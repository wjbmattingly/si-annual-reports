JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

SPECIAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

OCTOBER 21, 1891.

Pursuant to a call by the Secretary, a special meeting of the Board of
Regents was held at the Institution to-day at 10:50 A.M. Present:
the Honorable Levi P. Morton, Vice-President of the United States;
the Honorable S. M. Cullom, the Honorable R. L. Gibson, the Honor-
able B. Butterworth, Dr. A. D. White, Dr. J.C. Welling, Dr. Henry
Coppée, Gen. M. C. Meigs, and the Secretary.

The Vice-President took the chair and called the meeting to order,
and on Dr. Welling’s suggestion, there being no objection, the reading
of the minutes of the last annual meeting was dispensed with.

The Secretary then stated that he had, some months since, entered
on a correspondence with Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setauket, Long
Island, and that Mr. Hodgkins had intimated his desire to give a con-
siderable sum to the fund of the Smithsonian Institution ‘for the in-
crease and diffusion of knowledge among men.” Further correspond-
ence led to visits to Mr. Hodgkins by the Seeretary and by the Assistant
Secretary, and to prolonged conferences with him, the result of which
was that Mr. Hodgkins offered a donation of $200,000, concerning
which the Secretary had telegraphed the Regents June 22, and upon
receiving the individual approval of most of the Regents to the accept-
ance of the sum named, Mr. Hodgkins had later, on September 22, at his
home on Long Island, given this amount in cash to the Secretary, who,
in company with the Assistant Secretary, had brought it to Washington
and deposited it in the Treasury of the United States, with the under-
standing that an early meeting of the Regents would be called as a
body to consider as to its acceptance.

The exact terms in which Mr. Hodgkins made this gift would, the
Secretary said, be stated later; but he gives $200,000 to the Smithsonian
Institution to be added to the Smithson fund proper ‘for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men,” with the condition that the
income of $100,000 of the gift shall be used, under this general purpose,
for the especial one of the increase and diffusion of knowledge by in-
vestigating and spreading knowledge concerning all the phenomena of
atmospheric air.

XI
XT JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

This meeting was, therefore, called in pursuance of this understand-
ing, and also with regard to some matters concerning the Zodlogical
Park.

Dr. Welling said that he had been instructed by his colleagues on
the Executive Committee to bring the matter of this donation before
the Regents in such a way that they can accept or reject the munificent
gift made by Mr. Hodgkins. He then read the following preamble and
resolutions:

Whereas, Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setauket, Long Island, has placed in the hands
of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of two hundred thousand
dollars, for the purpose declared by him in a formal statement, as follows:

SEPTEMBER 22, 1891.

I, Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setauket, New York, desiring to increase the endow-
ment of the Smithsonian Institution, founded in the city of Washington, for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, have transferred to Samuel Pierpont
Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the sum of two hundred thousand
dollars, the same to be delivered to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, to whom I give it in trust, to be invested permanently in the Treasury of the
United States, as a part of the Smithson fund, and its interest to be applied to the
increase and diftuson of knowledge among men; this fund to be called the Hodgkins
Fund, and all premiums, prizes, grants, or publications made at its cost, to be
designated by this name; the interest of one hundred thousand dollars of this fund
to be permanently devoted to the increase and diffusion of more exact knowledge in
regard to the nature and properties of atmospheric air, in connection with the wel-
fare of man in his daily life and in his relations to his Creator, the same to be
effected by the offering of prizes, for which competition shall be open to the world,
for essays in which important truths regarding the phenomena on which life, health,
and human happiness depend shall be embodied, or by such other means as in years
to come may appear to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution calculated to
produce the most beneficent results. * * *

(Signed) THOMAS G. HODGKINS.

Witness:

(Signed) M. L. CHAMBERS.

Therefore, be it

Resolved, That the Regents hereby accept the sum in question, subject to the con-
ditions thus stated by the donor, and that the Secretary is instructed to carry into
effect these conditions, and to administer the income as in the case of the income
from other funds belonging to the Institution.

Resolved, That the Secretary is instructed to place the sum of $200,000 in the U. S.
Treasury, at six per centum interest, under the terms of section 5591, of Title Lx x11,
of the Revised Statutes of the United States.

* x x x x x x

Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents are tendered to Mr. Hodgkins
for his generous and public-spirited donation, and that an engrossed copy of the
above preamble and resolutions be transmitted to him by the Secretary.

In answer to a question as to whether this was an absolute gift to
the Institution, the Secretary said that Mr. Hodgkins thoroughly under-
stood that this gift was subordinate to the general title of the Smith-
sonian fund, though it was to bear his own name as a sub-title.

Senator Cullom addressed the meeting at length, quoting frequently
from the Revised Statutes, arguing in favor of accepting the gift with
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XII

its conditions, and coneluding his remarks with a motion that the
resolutions be adopted.

The Chairman having put the question, the resolutions were unani-
mously adopted.

The Secretary then brought before the Regents the difficulties under
which he was laboring from the insufficient appropriations for the Na-
tional Zodlogical Park, and after a full discussion of the special diffi-
culties of the situation belonging to a novel undertaking, where no one
could say beforehand what appropriation would certainly be required
under each item, but where limited appropriations are nevertheless
made in unchangeable specific items, unsupplemented by discretionary
power, the following preamble and resolution were adopted:

Whereas, the National Zodlogical Park has been placed under the direction of
this Board, under legislative conditions quite other than those contemplated at the
time that the responsibility of its administration was accepted by it:

Resolved, That the Secretary is authorized and instructed to represent to the
proper committees of Congress the difficulties which these conditions impose upon
the administration of the Institution, and to advise such legislation as may do away
with the present system by which half of the expense of said park is paid from the
revenues of the District of Columbia; and also to advise such changes in the form
of future appropriation bills as may be requisite to do away with the especially

imposed difficulties which are now encountered in carrying on the work.

Fuller, Vice-President Morton, the Hon. J. 8S. Morrill, the Hon. 8S. M.
Cullom, the Hon. R. L. Gibson, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, the Hon. W.
C. P. Breckinridge, Dr. Henry Coppée, Dr. J. B. Angell, Dr. William
Preston Johnston, the Hon, J. B. Henderson, and the Secretary.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. J. C. Welling, caused
by illness, and from Dr. A. D. White, by important engagements.

The Chancellor stated that the minutes of the annual meeting of
January 28, 1891, and of the special meeting of October 21, 1891, were
of considerable length, and the Secretary was requested to read them
in abstract, which was done.

The Secretary announced that the Vice-President on December
15, 1891, re-appointed as Regent the Hon. J. S. Morrill, a United
States Senator; that the Speaker of the House had re-appointed Repre-
sentatives Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama; Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massa-
chusetts, and appointed Representative W. C. P. Breckinridge, of Ken-
tucky, and that further vacancies in the Board had been filled by the
re-appointment, by joint resolution approved by the President, January
26, 1892, of Henry Coppée, of Pennsylvania, and by the appointment
of Willian Preston Johnston, of Louisiana, and John Bb. Henderson,
of the District of Columbia.

The Secretary announced the death of Gen. M. C. Meigs, a Regent
at large, on January 2, 1892.

Dr. Coppée moved that a committee, to consist of one member of the
Board and the Secretary, be appointed to present to this meeting an
obituary notice of the late Gen. Meigs. The motion was carried, and
the Chancellor nominated Dr. Coppée to act with the Secretary. Dr.
Coppée, after expressing his regret at the illness of the chairman of the
Executive Committee, and his personal sorrow at the death of his col-
league on the committee, Gen. Meigs, read the following memorial reso-
Jution :

MEMORIAL RECORD OF GEN. M. C. MEIGS.

The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution desires to place on record
the expression of its sincere sorrow and its sense of the great loss it has suffered in
the death of Gen. Montgomery Cunningham Meigs, a member of the Board and
one of its Executive Committee. His valuable services to the Institution began
indeed before he was officially connected with it as a regent and continued until
his death.

While Gen. Meigs was prominently associated with many useful undertakings, his
record as a soldier and as a citizen is marked by unswerving fidelity and extraor-
dinary capability. The principal events of his life can only be briefly mentioned,
as showing what varied experience he placed at the service of the Institution,
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XV

He was born on the 3d of May, 1816, at Augusta, Ga., where his father, Charles
D. Meigs, afterwards the eminent physician and author of Philadelphia, was then
practicing medicine. After preliminary studies at the University of Pennsylvania,
he entered the Military Academy at West Point on the Ist of July, 1832, and was
graduated with distinction in 1836. He was at once appointed to a position in the
artillery service, and in the following year was transferred to the Corps of Engi-
neers. In 1849 he was engaged in the Engineer Bureau at Washington, and from
that time until the outbreak of the civil war his activity was principally directed
to the construction of Government works. Toward the close of 1852 he made a sur-
vey at Washington to determine the best plan for supplying the city with water.
He was eventually placed in charge of the work, which included the designing and
construction of the Potomac acqueduct. ‘This remarkable work contains a single
arch of 220 feet span, which still remains the largest stone arch hitherto constructed.

He also had charge, as supervising engineer, of the north and south extensions
of the National Capitol and of the construction of the iron dome, as well as of ie

northward extension of the General Post-Office building.

When the war broke out he was appointed colonel of the Eleventh Infantry
(May 14, 1861) and afterwards quartermaster-general of the U. S. Army, with the
rank of brigadier-general. ‘This post required unusual administrative ability, with
a probity which commanded general recognition, and it was because of his high
integrity and the strength of his personal character, as well as his acknowledged
capacity for business, that he was entrusted with the handling and use of hundreds
of millions of dollars in the greatest war ever waged.

This is not the place to recount his military services. ‘They were numerous and
admirably discharged. His duties took him to all parts of the country, connected
him with many fields of labor, and engaged him on the most varied cominissions.
Suffice it to say that be fully justified the conlidence imposed in him by President
Lincoln, performing with signal ability the duties entrusted to him. In 1864 he
received the well-earned title of brevet major-general in the Army.

Even during the period of his service in the Army he was engaged in other oceu-
pations; rendering the Smithsonian Institution most important service in L&76 by
devising the new building for the National Museum, a marvel of economic design.

While still full of vigor Gen. Meigs was retired from active service on the 6th
of February, 1882, by the inexorable law which makes the grand climacteric the
period when military inaction begins. But he was by no means idle. Tle signalized
his talent as an architect by the construction of the Pension-Oftice building at
Washington between the years 1882 and 1887.

He was elected a feliow of the National Academy of Sciences in 1865, and a regent
of the Smithsonian Institution, as a “citizen of Washington,” and directly upon his
entrance into the board, December 26, 1885, became an active member of its Execu-
tive Committee. He was always present, extremely painstaking, and eminently
judicious in his counsel and judgment on important points of business and policy.
He had just been nominated as regent for another term of six years when he was
taken away from us by sudden illness (January 2, 1892).

He was eminent as # soldier, as a scientific investigator, as a public-spirited citi-
zen, and as a man. Industrious and exact in business, he knew no idle time. He

ras a busy man even when he spent a year in Europe for his health in 1867 and
1868, as well as on his visit there in 1875 on Government service.

Few regents have been of such importance to the Institution as Gen, Meigs, and
it is fitting that we should record our tribute of thankfulness for his eminent serv-
ices and our great sorrow at his loss. He was a man faithful in all things, who has
left behind him an enduring reputation.

Senator Gibson moved the adoption of the memorial and that a copy
thereof should be sent to the family of Gen. Meigs, which was carried,
XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

three items: For buildings, improvements, and maintenance. While
all were insufficient, that for maintenance (which was essentially for
the care and food of living animals) was peculiarly inadequate, since it
left him unable to care for creatures who could not care for themselves,
and ought not to be allowed to suffer. This item, then, was notably
different in kind from those providing for buildings or roads, which
might be left incomplete with less immediate damage or only pecuniary
loss.

Senator Morrill expressed his regret at the deplorable insufficiency
of the appropriations for the park, and at the necessity of contemplating
the sundering of the park from the Institution, but he was of the opin-
ion that such a separation would become desirable unless some change
was made. He thought it out of the question that the matter should
continue on the present footing, and the Smithsonian ought not again
to be put under the necessity of caring for any part of the park out of
its private funds, even temporarily and indirectly.

Further remarks were made by Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Wheeler.

With reference to the administration of the Institution, the Secretary
recalled that the Assistant Secretary has, as such, no power to act in
the Seeretary’s place, such as the Assistant Secretary in any Execu-
tive Department possesses, and that he can not even execute such
routine signatures of necessary vouchers and like papers as in Executive
Departments the law authorizes, not only him, but his subordinates
to do.

Apart from the important administrative duties assigned to the
Secretary, there present themselves daily a great many vouchers and
like routine papers for the Treasury from the different bureaus under
his charge—papers which, as has just been stated, would in every
bureau of any Executive Department of the Government be signed by
a subordinate officer; while here the Secretary or Acting Secretary
must personally sign such routine money papers, under a custom which
has grown step by step from small beginnings to be a hardly tolerable
burden in the illness or absence either of the Secretary or of the Act-
ing Secretary, while for their joint illness no provision is made what-
ever. To meetin part the difficulties arising from the necessity of dele-
gating authority for signing voucbers and like Treasury papers, it
was Stated that by proper action of the Board of Regents all require-
meuts of the Treasury Department might be met.

No sunilar difficulty exists in any Executive Department, because
in all such the law provides not only for the Secretary and Acting
Secretary, but for a line of succession of subordinate officers author-
ized to execute such acts as the daily conduct of their respective
bureaus renders necessary.

The Seeretary pointed out that, owing to the established principles of
conduct in the Smithsonian Iustitution (which there was no intention
here of departing from), the Secretary’s power had never been diffused

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIX

and delegated as was the case in the Executive Departinents of the Gov-
ernment, where there were several persons in every separate bureau
who had a right, in case of the absence not only of the Secretary and
Acting Secretary, but of the head of the bureau itself, to carry on its
affairs, and especially to sign such money papers as were required for
its current business with the Treasury. There was no time, however,
in the past twelve years, when, in the joint event of the illness of the
Secretary and the Acting Secretary, there was any such provision for
‘rarrying on the current business of the Institution. The Secretary
further pointed out that since the provision for an Acting Secretary
was first made in 1879, he had made a computation of the amount of
business coming before the Secretary then and now, which shows that
the work is at present from eight to ten times that when the first legis-
lation for an Acting Secretary was asked for.

Dr. Coppée said that owing to his long connection with the Institu-
tion—perhaps the longest of any member present, with the possible
exception of Senator Morrill—he felt particularly in a position to cor-
roborate the statements made by the Secretary as to the growth of the
business of the Institution since the passage of the act relating to the
appointment of an Acting Secretary, and he thought the best manner
of effecting this immediate relief to the Secretary was covered by the
following resolution :

Resolved, That the Secretary be empowered to appoint some suitable person who,
in case of need, may sign such requisitions, vouchers, abstracts of vouchers, accounts
current. and indorsements of checks and drafts as are needed in the current busi-
ness of the Institution or of any of its bureaus, and are customarily signed in the
bureaus of other departments of the Government.

He added that as this came before the Board at a late hour he would
move, in order to give time for its consideration, that the whole matter
be put in the hands of a committee appointed by the Chancellor with
power to act.

The Chancellor stated that undoubtedly the increased growth of the
Institution had introduced new demands, and that it was desirable
that the action in reference to them should be carefully studied.

After further remarks by Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Henderson and
other members of the Board, Dr. Coppée said that he thought the
action of the Executive Committee could cover the ground of the reso-
lution, and, on motion of the Vice-President, the whole subject was
referred to the Executive Committee with power to act on the resolu-
tion.

The Secretary said, in connection with what had just been done,
that the increased burdens of extraneous duties imposed by Congress
were accompanied by special expenses for administering appropria-
tions for which no legislative provision was made, and which necessa-
rily fell on the limited Smithsonian fund, partly in indirect: ways.
There was no provision, for instance, for a disbursing oflicer, or private
xX JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

secretary, or stenographers, or clerks, or messengers to attend to the
administrative duties common to all the bureaus under the Regents’
are.

Dr. Coppée offered the following resolution, at the same time calling
the attention of the Board that it referred to public funds only:

Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to ask for an appropriation by Congress
to meet the miscellaneous expenses incident to the administration of the public
funds with which the Regents are intrusted.

On motion the resolution was adopted.

There being no further business before the meeting the Board ad-
journed.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XXI

SPECIAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

MARCH 29, 1892.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was held to-day at a
quarter before 10 o’clock A.M. Present: The Chancellor—Mr. Chief-
Justice Fuller, in the Chair; the Hon. Levi P. Morton, Vice-
President; the Hon. 8S. M. Cullom; the Hon. R. L. Gibson; the Hon.
Joseph Wheeler; the Hon. H. C. Lodge; the Hon. W. C. P. Breckin-
ridge; Dr. J. C. Welling, and the Secretary.

The reading of the minutes of the last meeting was dispensed with,
and the Secretary read a telegram from Dr. Coppée, expressing his
regret at his inability to be present.

The Secretary stated that the meeting had been called at the request
of three of the Regents chietly on account of the action of the Appro-
priations Committee of the House of Representatives—a matter in
which the good name of the Institution was in some measure involved,
—whereby the appropriations for various Government interests under
the charge of the Regents had been reduced to such an extent that the
prosperity of all these departments would receive a blow from. which
they could not hope to recover for years to come.

Especial stress was laid upon the inadequacy of the appropriations
for the National Zodlogical Park and attention was also called to the
fact that the park is already visited on fair days by thousands not
only of adults but of children, while dangerous animals are there with-
out sufticient buildings or cages or inclosures, and without means to
provide them, and that the only protection of the public and especially
of children must be from incessant guardianship, which the present
small and overworked force is unable to properly render.

The Secretary stated that he was unable to carry on the park with
less expenditure for maintenance than $26,000, or with a less total
appropriation than $50,000, in case it were made in one item.

The following resolutions were introduced by Mr. Wheeler:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution would re-
spectfully represent to Congress the impossibility of maintaining the administration
of the United States National Zodlogical Park, required by the act of Congress of
April 30, 1890, with a less appropriation for maintenance than $26,000, or with a less
total appropriation than $50,000.

Resolved, That the Secretary of the Institution be requested to communicate this
resolution to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives, with a preliminary statement of the reasons and considerations on which it is

based.

After some further discussion, the resolutions were adopted, with
the understanding that such limited modification of the wording might
be made as to meet any technicality suggested by the Treasury De-
partment.

There was a general expression of opinion among the Regents that the
XXII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

condition of the affairs of the park should be brought to the attention
of Congress by explanation on the floor of the House and Senate from
Regents and friends of the Institution.

Further remarks on the matter were made by Mr. Lodge and Dr.
Welling.

The Secretary then read a communication from Mr. Thomas G.
Hodgkins, dated March 10, 1892, in which Mr. Hodgkins stated that
he desired to relinquish the option of contributing the further sum of
$100,000 to the Smithsonian fund.

There being no further business betore the Board, the meeting ad-
journed.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. XLII

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1892, each of
which bears the approval of the Secretary or, in his absence, of the
Acting Secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer was accepted and his bonds approved by the
Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have
been examined and found correct.

As stated in the last annual report of the committee, the balance of
the appropriation for last year for ethnological researches (Bureau of
Ethnology) was continued in the hands of the disbursing clerk of the
sureau (Mr. J. D. McChesney). This balance having since been fully
disbursed by him and the appropriation for ethnological researches tor
the present year as well as the appropriation for the Astro-Physical
Observatory having been added to those already in the hands of the
disbursing clerk of the Institution (Mr. William W. Karr), all the ap-
propriations committed by Congress to the care of the Institution are
now disbursed by the disbursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution,
excepting the appropriation for “printing, National Museum,” which
is executed under the direction of the Publie Printer (Revised Statutes,
section 3661).

REPORT OF 8. P. LANGLEY,
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1892.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith ny report for the
year ending June 50, 1892, of the operations of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, including the work placed by Congress under its charge in the
National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the International Ex-
changes, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-Physical Observ-
atory.

Matters of general interest have been treated of in the body of the
report, while in the Appendix will be found detailed reports on the
more important subdivisions of the work of the Institution, namely:
the Bureau of Ethnology, the Bureau of International Exchanges, the
Library, the National Zoological Park, the Astro-Physical Observatory,
and the Editor in charge of Publications.

The work of the National Museum is reported on at length in a sep-
arate volume by the Assistant Secretary in charge.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

-L have to record the following changes in the Establishment during
the year: The resignation of the Hon. James G. Blaine, Secretary of
State, on June 4, 1892, and the appointment of his successor to the
Secretaryship, the Hon. John W. Foster; the resignation of the Hon.
Redfield Proctor, Secretary of War, on December 6,.1891, and the ap-
pointment of his successor, the Hon. Stephen b. Elkins; and the resig-
nation of the Hon, Charles EK. Mitchell, Commissioner of Patents, on
July 31, 1891, and the appointment of the Hon, William I. Simonds as
his successor.
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

fn accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents fixing the
time of the stated annual meeting of the Board on the fourth Wednes-

H. Mis, 114-1 1
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

day of January in each year, the Board met on January 27, 1892, at 10
oclock A. M. The journal of its proceedings will be fond as aeual in
its annual report to Congress, but for convenience reference is also here
made later to a portion of its action.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents was held on October 21,
1891, at which a gift of $200,000 from Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Se-
tauket, Long Island, was formally accepted; and another was held on
March 29, 1892, to take action regarding certain Congressional appro-
ar One:

The following changes in the personnel of the Board of Regents are
to be noted: The appointment of the Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, of
the House of Representatives, by the Speaker of the House (pro tem-
pore), January 15, 1892, to succeed the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth,
whose term expired December 23, 1891; the appointment, by joint reso-
lution of Congress, approved January "26, 1892, of President Williaa
Preston Johnston, of Tulane (oneaecstn Louisiana, to succeed Dr.
Noah Porter, who resigned December 31, 1889; and the appointment,
by the same resolution, of the Hon. John Bb. Henderson, of the District
of Columbia, to succeed Gen. M. C. Meigs, who died January 2, 1892.

The following have been re-appointed to fill vacancies caused by the
expiration of their own terms: The Hon. Justin S. Morrill, of the United
States Senate, by the Vice-President of the United States, December
15, 1891, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, and the Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge,
of the House of Representatives, by the Speaker (pro tempore) of the
House, January 15, 1892, and Dr. Henry Coppée, by joint resolution
of Congress approved January 26, 1892.

The Board has suffered the loss by death of Gen. Montgomery C.
Meigs on January 2, 1892. Dr. Noah Porter, an ex-member of the
Board, died on March 4,1892. Reference is made to them elsewhere in
the necrologic notices.

ADMINISTRATION.

I beg to repeat the recommendation contained in my report of last
year, that Congress be requested to make some provision for meeting
the actual expenses of the administration of the affairs of the General
Government confided to the Institution. There is no such provision
now for the considerable and increasing clerical expenses, which belong
not to any single Government bureau under its care, but to the charge
of their common administration, and these expenses all fall ultimately
upon the Institution.

Another difficulty arising out of the great extension of the interests
under the care of the Regents, which makes the duties of the Secretary
and the Assistant Secretary altogether different from what they were
in its early history, has been calling for relief for some time, and has
finally been met by appropriate action of the Board; for, apart from the
need of a Congressional appropriation which shall provide for the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

increased expenses of the clerical force in the Secretary’s office engaged
in transacting purely Government business, [ have directed the atten-
tion of the Regents to the fact that the Chancellor of the Institution
(in whom alone the power of appointing an Acting Secretary is vested
by law) may be absent when the Acting Secretary is ill and when
there is no one to relieve him. Such a case has actually presented
itself, directing attention to the necessity of authorizing the Secretary
to delegate authority for performing certain subordinate but indis-
pensable functions, such as signing a certain class of papers.

Owing to the established principles of conduct in the Smithsonian
Institution (which there has been no intention of departing from) the
Secretary’s power has never been diffused or delegated even as far as
is usual in the case of Executive Departments of the Government,
where there are several persons in every separate bureau constituting a
line of succession of those who are authorized, in case of the absence
of its head, to carry on ordinary business and especially to sign all
such routine papers as are required for its current business with the
Treasury. There has been no time however in the past twelve years,
when, in the joint event of the illness or absence of the Secretary and
the Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, any such provision
has existed for carrying on even the routine business.

At the meeting of the Regents on January 27, 1892, the following
resolution was introduced, and was duly given effect through the
Executive Committee in the appointment of an officer of the Insti-
tution to act according to its provisions:

‘“ Resolved, That the Secretary be empowered to appoint some
suitable person, who, in case of need, may sign such requisitions,
vouchers, abstracts of vouchers, accounts current, and indorsements of
checks and drafts. as are needed in the current business of the Institu-
tion, or of any of its bureaus, and are customarily signed in the bureaus
of other Departments of the Government.”

FINANCES.

I have recalled the fact that the gift of 3200,000 to the Institution by
Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setauket, Long Island, to which I brietly
referred in my report of last year, was formally accepted by the Board
of Regents at a special meeting held October 21, 1891.

At this meeting I stated that = had entered on a correspondence
with Mr. Hodgkins in which he had intimated his desire to give a
considerable sum to the fund of the Smithsonian Institution for the
“increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” The correspond-
ence was followed by personal visits both by the Secretary and by the
Assistant Secretary, the result of which was that Mr. Hodgkins offered
a donation of $200,000, concerning which the Secretary telegraphed
the Regents on June 22. Upon being advised of the individual
approval of most of the Regents to the acceptance of the sum named,
Mr. Hodgkins later, on September 22, at his home on Long Island,
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

gave the amount in cash to the Secretary, who deposited it in the
United States Treasury at Washington, with the understanding that
an early meeting of the Board would be called as a body to consider
its acceptance.

The essential conditions are that the income of $100,000 of this gift
shall be permanently devoted to the increase and diffusion of more
exact knowledge in regard to the nature and properties of atmos-
pherie air in connection with the welfare of man; the income of the
remaining $100,000 being for the general purposes of the Institution.

In view of the importance of the subject [ have referred to it again
later in the report, under a distinct heading.

IT may call attention in this place to the fact that the Smithsonian
Institution is, by reason of its far-reaching connection with the scien-
tifie world, enabled to make specially effective use of sums given for
immediate employment in specific purposes or investigations. A few
such special trusts (distinet from those for adding to the permanent en-
dowment) have been committed to the Institution iu the past, through
the Secretary, and yet I feel assured that, were the intentions of the
Regents better understood in this regard, the Institution would much
more frequently be made the medium for giving effect to the plans of
those interested in promoting specific researches, as well as in making
permanent endowments.

The permanent funds of the Institution areas follows:

Total permanent Smithsonian fund in the Treasury of the United
States, bearing interest at 6 per cent. per annum.........-.---- $903, 000. 00

Atthe beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand was $40,062.11.
Interest on the invested fund, amounting to $44,481.36, has been
received from the Treasury of the United States during the year, and
from sales of publications and miscellaneous sources, including repay-
ments on account of international exchanges, $2,974.23, making a total
of $87,517.70.

The total expenditures, as shown in detail in the report of the Execu-
tive Committee, have been $39,642.37, leaving an unexpended balance
on June 30, 1892, of $47,875.33. This includes a sum of $10,000, the
amount of a bequest of $5,000 from the late Dr. J. H. Kidder and a
donation of a like amount from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell personally
to the Secretary for physicalinvestigations, which was, with the donor’s
consent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the funds of the
Institution, subject to order. Neither of these sums, then, forms a por-

tion of the invested funds, and both have been held in the hope that
Congress would later provide a site for a permanent building for the
Astro-Physical Observatory. The balance available for the general
purposes of the Institution on July 1, 1892, was $37,875.33, but this is
in large part held against various liabilities, for scientific purposes,

The Institution has been charged by Congress with the disburse-
ment during the year of the following appropriations:

To these should be added the small unexpended balance of the special
appropriation of $92,000 made April 30, 1890, for the National Zoolog-
ical Park.

The vouchers for the disbursement of these appropriations have been
examined by the Executive Committee, and the various items of expen-
diture are set forth in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House
of Representatives, in accordance with a provision of the Sundry Civil
Act of October 2, 1888; while the expenditures from the Smithsonian
fund have likewise been examined and approved by the Executive
Committee, and are shown in their report.

I may call attention to the fact that the Secretary has been desirous
to see a change in the phraseology of the Sundry Civil Act making ap-
propriation for ethnological researches, which would relieve him from
the personal responsibility imposed by the language of former bills.
Such a change-has now been made, whereby the appropriation is placed
“under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,” instead of in the
charge of the “ Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,” as heretofore.
The vouchers from the Bureau of Ethnology are therefore now secruti-
nized by the Executive Committee, as are all other expenditures of the
Institution.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, forwarded to
the Secretary of the Treasury, under date of October 7, 1591, were as
tollows:

BUILDINGS.

I have repeatedly urged upon your attention the necessity for more
ample accommodations for the rapidly increasing collections of the
National Museum, a necessity that has been emphasized by the diffi-
culties attending the preparation for the Museum exhibit at the
World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the Columbian Histori-
eal Exposition in Madrid.

In the light of past experience, it is not unreasonable to anticipate a
large increase in the collections of the Museum in the shape of donations
from exhibitors at these expositions, if any assurance can be given
that such material will eventually be properly installed. If no such
assurance can be given a great amount of material will be lost to the
Institution, the value of which would, in my opinion, nearly equal the
estimated cost of a new building for the Museum.

The present Museum building was finished and occupied in 1881.
The collections increased so rapidly that as early as 1883 the Regents,
at their meeting of January 17, recommended to Congress the erection
of anew building.

Since 1883 the collections have again increased to such an extent
that a new building as large as the present one could now be advan-
tageously filled with material held in storage, and I can only repeat
with increased emphasis the closing sentence of my letter of January
21, 1890, to the Hon. Leland Stanford, chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, ‘“‘ That unless more space is
provided, the development of the Government collection, which is al-
ready partly arrested, will be almost completely stopped.”

The Museum collections have overflowed into every part of the
Smithsonian building, and special provisions have been made for them,
beginning with the galleries long since erected in the main hall, not
contemplated in the original plans of the building, and which seriously
interfere with lighting the exhibition open to the public. The storage
space of the Institution building needed for other purposes, is now also
almost exclusively occupied by Museum specimens, and some relief
must be found.
REPORT. OF THE SECRETARY. 7

A bill providing for the erection of a fire-proof building for the
National Museum was introduced in the Senate by the Hon. J. S. Mor-
rill, and passed the Senate on April 15,1892, but failed to secure
favorable action in the House.

The work of fire-proofing the so-called “ chapel” of the west wing
of the Smithsonian building has been practically completed, and I
would especially urge that the balance of this appropriation, unex-
pended, by reason of a limiting clause introduced in the act, on account
of which the money is not available for certain repairs originally con-
templated, should be now made available by Congress for increasing
the storage room in the east wing of the building, and at the same
time that certain rooms be fitted for the special needs of the Govern-
ment Exchange Bureau, now occupying rooms in the Main Building,
urgently needed for other purposes.

The new buildings erected or in’ progress of erection for the collee-
tion of living animals, being all in the Zoological Park, are mentioned
in the report upon the park.

RESEARCH.

In pursuance of the long established policy of the Institution, finan-
cial aid has, during the past year, been extended to original investi-
gators in the domain of science, and considering the modest sum that
it has been found possible to devote to this purpose, the results are
gratifying.

The subscription for twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal,
which are distributed abroad as exchanges of the Institution, has been
continued.

To the Lick Observatory, through its director, Prof. Holden, an addi-
tional grant has been made for the continuance of experiments in lunar
photography.

Prof. EK. W. Morley is still engaged in his determinations of the
density of oxygen and hydrogen, for which some special apparatus has
been provided by the Institution.

Mention has been made in previous reports of the aid extended to
Prof. A. A. Michelson, of Clark University, in his experiments with the
refractometer, and in the determination of a universal standard of
length founded on the wave length of light. In furtherance of the
latter project, the Institution will, during the coming summer, send one
of its scientific staff to assist Prof. Michelson in his investigations
under the auspices of the International Bureau of Weights and Meas-
ures in the laboratory of the Bureau at Sevres, France.

Both these latter investigations refer to fundamental constants of
nature, and their results promise to be of wide and lasting importance.

Allusion was made in my last report to aid extended to Dr. Wolcott
Gibbs in his investigations of the physiological action of chemical com-

pounds. These investigations are now completed, and have resulted
in a substantial contribution to this branch of science.

Astro-physical Observatory.—The Smithsonian Astro-physical Ob-
servatory still occupies the temporary wooden shelter upon the grounds
just south of the Smithsonian building, and the money given to the In-
stitution for the erection of a more permanent building is still held
while awaiting the action of Congress in providing a site. The ob-
servatory has received much of my personal attention during the year.

In statements to Congress and elsewhere some brief official expla-
nation has been given of the object of this observatory, which, as it
has not been explicitly given in previous reports, [ repeat here in the
most succinct manner before entering on any description of the special
work.

The general object of astronomy, the oldest of the sciences, was, un-
til a very late period, to study the places and motions of the heavenly
bodies, with little special reference to the wants of man in his daily
life, other than in the application of the study to the purposes of navi-
gation.

Within the past generation, and almost coincidentally with the dis-
covery of the spectroscope, a new branch of astronomy has arisen,
which is sometimes called astro-physi¢s, and whose purpose is distinctly
different from that of finding the places of the stars, or the moon, or the
sun; which is the principal end in view at such an observatory as that,
for instance, at Greenwich.

The distinct object of astro-physies is, in the case of the sun, for ex-
ainple, not to mark its exact place in the sky, but to find out how it
affects the earth and the wants of man on it; how its heat is distributed,
and how it in fact affects not only the seasons and the farmer’s crops,
but the whole system of living things on the earth, for it has lately
been proven that in a physical sense, it, and almost it alone, literally first
creates and then modifies them in almost every possible way.

We have however arrived at a knowledge that it does so, without
yet knowing in most cases how it does so, and we are sure of the great
importance of this last acquisition, while still largely in ignorance how
to obtain it. We are, for example, sure that the latter knowledge
would form among other things a scientific basis for meteorology and
enable us to predict the years of good or bad harvests, so far as these
depend on natural causes, independent of man, and yet we are still
very far from being able to make such a prediction, and we cannot
do so till we have learned more by such studies as those in question.

Knowledge of the nature of the certain, but still imperfectly un-
derstood dependence of terrestrial events on solar causes, is, then, of
the greatest practical consequence, and it is with these large aims of
ultimate utility in view, as well as for the abstract interest of scien-
tific investigation, that the Government is asked to recognize such
researches as of national importance; for it is to such a knowledge of
REPORT; OF THE SECRETARY. g

causes with such practical consequences that this class of investiga-
tion aims and tends.

Astro-physies by no means confines its investigation to the sun,
though that is the most important subject of its study and one which
has been undertaken by nearly every leading government of the civil-
ized world but the United States. France has a great astro-physical
observatory at Meudon, and Germany one on an equal scale at Pots-
dam, while England, Italy, and other countries have also, at the ma-
tional expense, maintained for many years institutions for the prosecu-
tion of astro-physical science.

It has been observed that this recent science itself was almost coeval
with the discovery of the spectroscope, and that instrument has every-
where been largely employed in most of its work. Of the heat which
the sun sends, however, and which, in its terrestrial manifestations, is
the principal objeet of our study, it has long been well known that the
spectroscope could recognize only about one-quarter—three-quarters
of all this solar heat being in a form which the ordinary spectroscope
san not see nor analyze, lying as it does in the almost unknown ‘ infra-
red”? end of the spectrum, where neither the eye nor the photograph
sanexamineit. It has been known for many years that it was there, and
we have had a rough idea of its amount, with an almost total incapacity
to exhibit it in .detail. Our imperfect knowledge of this region is at
present represented by a few inadequate types of parts of it given in
drawings made by hand, where the attempts to depict it at all are even
to-day more crude than the very earliest charts of the visible spectrum,
made in the infancy of spectroscopic science.

One of the first pieces of work which this observatory has under-
taken is to explore and describe what may be properly called “this great
unknown region,” by a method which the writer has recently been able
to bring to such a degree of success as to give good grounds for
its continued prosecution and for the hope that a complete map of this
whole region will shortly be produced by an automatic and therefore
trustworthy process, showing the lines corresponding to the so-called
Fraunhofer lines in the upper spectrum.

The firstsyear’s work of any such observatory must ordinarily con-
sist largely in perfecting its apparatus and determining its constants,
but a portion of this necessary labor has been deferred in favor of this
principal task, of which it is hoped that another year will see the es-
sential completion, In this, the present principal scientific work here,
all resources of the observatory are, then, for the time being engaged.

I have acknowledged in a previous report the valuable assistance of
Prof. C. C. Hutchins, of Bowdoin College, who efficiently aided in in-
stalling the apparatus. Prof. Hutchins was obliged to leave in Aug-
ust. On the 16th of November Dr. William Hallock was appointed
senior assistant.

At different times during the year, there have been employed as
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

assistants Mr. C. A. Saunders, Mr. C. T. Child, and Mr. F. L. O. Wads-
worth. A photographer and a laborer complete the present force of
the Observatory.

In the latter part of the year, Dr. Hallock, to my regret, advised me of
his proximate call to another duty, and the work was later left tempo-
rarily in the charge of Mr. Wadsworth, who had joined the staff in June,
but who was sent to Europe in July, for the purpose, elsewhere referred
to, of contributing to the work of establishing a wave-length standard
under Professor Michelson. The labor has been carried on under the
disadvantages of these interruptions, and also under others of another
kind, due to the fact that the extremely delicate apparatus, which is
used in a perpetually darkened room, is, by reason of the location of the
temporary observatory shed, in proximity to traffic-laden streets, where
there is danger that the passing vehicles affeet the accuracy of the ob-
servations both by earth tremors and by magnetic disturbances. Not-
withstanding these latter drawbacks, much better results have been
obtained than it was supposed could be reached in such a situation,
and these, as I have said, I trust, another year will enable the Institu-
tion to make public.

EXPLORATIONS.

Several explorations have been carried on during the year by the
U.S. Fish Commission, resulting in the transfer to the Museum of many
large and varied collections of zodlogical, botanical, and geological
material. Dr. W. L. Abbott has continued his work in Asia and has
contributed collections made in Kashmir. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns,of the
International Boundary Commission, has sent several large collections
of natural-history specimens obtained near the border line between the
United States and Mexico. Mr. P. L. Jouy has made important col-
lections in Arizona and New Mexico. Collections of the fishes of Nica-
ragua have been received from Mr. C. W. Richmond.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill, the distinguished traveler, whose previous ex-
plorations have been mentioned in my reports and who has already
deposited in the Museum very valuable collections which he made illus-
trating the religious practices, occupations, and amusements of various
peoples in different parts of China, Thibet, and Turkestan, has started
upon a second journey to hitherto almost unknown parts of Thibet,
with such aid (much more limited than I could wish) as it was possible
for me to afford him. From his known qualities as an explorer it may
be confidently expected that his journey will result in important con-
tributions to our knowledge of this country.

PUBLICATIONS.

The number of publications during the year has been about the same
as in preceding years.

As has been frequently stated, the publications of the Institution
proper are of three classes: First, the series of ‘‘ Smithsonian Contribu-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. li

tions to Knowledge,” in quarto form, comprising original memoirs of
researches believed to present new truths, and which, as required,
are liberally illustrated with figures or plates; secondly, the series of
“Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,” in octavo size, containing
special reports, systematic lists of synopses of species, ete., whether
from the organic or the inorganic world, instructions to naturalists for
collecting and preserving specimens, special bibliographies, tabulated
results, and other aids to scientific investigation not generally requir-
ing illustrations; and lastly, the series of ‘Smithsonian Annual Re-
ports,” presenting to Congress, through the Secretary, the condition of
the Institution, accompanied, under the early plan of Professor Henry,
by scientific articles from competent writers, either original or selected,
but as arule in untechnical terms, representing the advances made in va-
rious departments of research and frequently admitting of illustration by
plates or figures. These articles are intended to be of interest not alone
to the correspondents and collaborators of the listitution, but to that
large number of the educated public who follow such statements with
profit when they are presented in popularly intelligible form.

Smithsonian Contributions to iknowledge.—The only publication of the
year in this series is a memoir detailing the results of original experi-
ments in aérodynamics by the Secretary,* and occupying 115 quarto
pages, Ulustrated with 11 figures and 10 plates.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—The number of titles in this
series during the year is 47, of which none seem to call for any partic-
ular comment.

Smithsonian Annual Report.—t have referred in my report for 1889
to a modification of the plan on which the Appendix was prepared.
From 1880 to 1888 the Appendix was chiefly devoted to an annual suimn-
mary of progress in various branches of science. The growing ineffi-
ciency of this summary, due to causes elsewhere mentioned, led me to
return in the report for 1889 to the earlier plan of Prof. Henry, which
was to present a selection of papers by eminent, or at least competent,
expositors, chosen from the scientific literature of the year. This modi-
fication, or rather this return to the method of the earlier reports,
has been continued, and seems to meet with general appreciation at the
hands of the correspondents of the Institution and others to whom the
reports are sent. The report for 1890 issued during the year embraces
a considerable range of scientific investigation and discussion. Many
of the papers are the work of distinguished investigators, and all are
presented in untechnical language so as to interest the largest number.

Lunar photographs.—l have devoted considerable thought to a plan
for publishing a work on the moon, which shall represent the present
knowledge of the physical features of our satellite. A study of the

* Resolved, That the Secretary of fhe Smithsonian Institution be requested to con-
tinue his researches in physical science, and to present such facts and principles as

12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

surface of the moon is of special and growing interest to geologists,
who have rarely access to the largest class of telescopes, and what we
know of it is derived very largely from maps made from eye-studies by
astronomers.

Within a few years photography has been used with such increasing
advantage in this interesting field, that it is believed by those compe-
tent to express an opinion, that photographs can shortly be produced
which will exhibit in a permanent form everything that a trained eye
can recognize at the most powerful telescope. If this surprising result
be not actually obtained, [ am of opinion that it is attainable; and I
have proposed to procure, through the association of the Smithsonian
Institution with some of the leading observatories of the world, a series
of photographic representations of hitherto unequaled size and defini-
tion, Which shall represent the moon’s surface as far as possible on a
definite scale, and entirely without the intervention of the draftsman.
Photographs of the moon made at the Harvard, Lick, and Paris obsery-
atories have been piaced at the disposition of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion for publication, and it is intended to issue a series of them accom-
panied by explanatory text. Whether this considerable work shall
appear as one of the regular series of ‘Contributions to Knowledge,”
or as a special publication in a more limited edition, has not yet been
decided.

Smithsonian Tables.—The meteorological and physical tables, originally
prepared by Dr. Guyot and first published in 1851, have been in such
demand that they have already passed through four editions. The last
edition was exhausted several years ago, and in considering the advisa-
bility of issuing a fifth edition, it was determined in 1887 to revise the
tables to conform to the present state of our knowledge. The work has
been divided into three parts, meteorological, geographical, and physi-
cal, each one being independent of the others, but the three capable of
forming a homogeneous volume.

In carrying out this plan [ was able to secure the assistance of Prof.
William Libbey, jr., of Princeton, under whose editorship the last edi-
tion was issued in 1884, and Prof. Libbey, devoting gratuitously such
time to the work as he could command from his engrossing college duties,
prepared the first volume of the series, the “ Meteorological Tables.”
The plan of the work was then somewhat modified and a further re-
vision was made by Mr. G. E. Curtis, who was at the time employed upon
other work at the Smithsonian Institution, and by the end of December,
1891, the manuscript was essentially ready for the printer. Since that
timeit has been passing through the press, and it is hoped that the volume
will be entirely finished by the close of the present calendar year.

SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

The international exchange service, through which the Smithsonian
Institution is known to most of the large libraries and to a vast num-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

ber of scientific men throughout the world, has received such attention
in my recent reports that it seems unnecessary to dwell upon it at
length here.

The work of the bureau continues to increase, and in spite of many
labor-saving devices in the clerical work suggested by experience, it will
be impossible to meet all the demands made for transportation of doe-
tents unless some considerable increase is also made in the amount
appropriated by the General Government in the near future.

The United States Government has undertaken, by a treaty formu-

lated at Brussels in 1886, and finally proclaimed by the President in
1889, to carry on a system of international exchanges. These various
countries adhering to the treaty have formally agreed each to estab-
‘lish a bureau charged with the duty of attending to the exchange of
official documents, parliamentary and administrative, which are pub.
lished in the country of their origin, and the bureaus of exchange will
furthermore serve as intermediaries between the learned bodies and
literary and scientific societies of the contracting States for the recep-
tion and transmission of their publications.

In transmitting abroad each State assumes the expenses of packing
and transportation to the place of destination, but when the transmis-
sions are nade by sea, special arrangements regulate the share of each
State in the expense of transportation.

The Smithsonian Institution, having since 1850 conducted an ex-
change service with means of communication over the entire world, has
been charged by the United States Government with the conduct of
its own exchange business, and appropriations for the purpose have
accordingly been made of late years to the Institution, covering at
present the greater part of the expense. The deficiency arising each
year has been met from the Smithsonian fund, and the Institution has
continued its paid agents in Mngland and in Germany, as these two
countries have not signified their adherence to the treaty in question,
but maintain exchange relations with the United States independently
of other countries concerned in the treaty. By referring to the cura-
tor’s statistical report contained in the Appendix, it will be seen that
over 100 tons of books passed through the exchange office during the
fiscal year, representing 97,027 packages—an increase of 6,36L packages
over the number handled during the preceding year—while upon the
exchange books, accounts of publications received and transmitted are
kept with 20,682 societies or institutions and individuals. The expen-
ditures upon this account have amounted to $20,510.49, of which $17,000
were appropriated by Congress, $2,108.44 were repaid by Government
bureaus, and $30.75 by State institutions and others, leaving a
deficiency of $1,171.30 to be met by the Smithsonian Institution.

The expenses, it will be noted, take no account of the rent value of
the rooms in the Institution occupied in this manner by the General
Government for exchange purposes, or that portion of the service of
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the regular officers of the Institution occupied with exchange business,
and the sum appropriated by Congress would be entirely inadequate
were it not that the chief ocean steamship companies have, since the
early days of the Institution, granted the privilege of free freight for
its exchange boxes. I have repeatedly called attention to the impro-
priety of further trespassing upon the generosity of these companies,
the privilege having been originally intended as a direct encouragement
of the philanthropic aims of the Institution, whereas now a very large
proportion of the freight thus carried is Government property and the
service is conducted under an international treaty.

Imay further call attention in this place to the fact that an additional
treaty made at Brussels in 1886 and proclaimed by the President of the
United States on January 15, 1889, wherein provision is made for the
immediate exchange of official journals, parliamentary annals and docu-
ments, has never been executed. A bill making an appropriation of
$2,000 for this purpose passed the Senate in 1891, but no final action
thereon has been taken.

The amount estimated for the conduct of the exchange service for
the year 189293 was $23,000, a sum which was expected to cover the
present expense of the Exchange Bureau in a single item, including the
$2,000 just mentioned. At the close of the fiscal year the Sundry Civil
Appropriation bill, of which this was an item, had not become a law.

I desire to mention again here the increasing difficulty of making
provision for the storage of Government publications not needed for
immediate transmission abroad. A portion of the building is now de-
voted to this purpose which is needed more and more each year for the
more legitimate purposes of the Institution.

The exchange offices are also needed for the growing reference library
of scientific books belonging to the Institution, and with a view to re-
lieving the overcrowded condition of the library by removing these
offices to the basement, I have urged upon Congress the desirability of
making available for the purpose, the balance of an appropriation orig-
inally intended for repairs and alterations to the western part of the
building, which, by reason of a restricting clause in the appropriation
act, can not be used for the work first proposed. By the expenditure
of about $10,000 the basement of the east wing, now damp and some-
times flooded with water, can be made thoroughly healthy and well
adapted to the needs of the exchange work.

In my report for 1890 I stated that there had been expended from the
Smithsonian fund for the support of the international exchange sys-
tem, in the interests and by the authority of the National Government,
$38,141.01 in excess of appropriations, advanced from January 1, 1868,
to June 30, 1586, for the exchange of official Government documents,
and $7,034.81 in excess of appropriations from July 1, 1886, to June 30,
1889, advanced for the purpose of carrying out a convention entered
into by the United States, or an aggregate of $45,175.82.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

A memorandum in regard to this matter was duly transmitted to the
Hon. Benjamin Butterworth, a member of the Board of Regents, in the
House of Representatives, for the purpose of taking the necessary steps
to procure a return by Congress to the Smithsonian fund of this last
mentioned stun, namely, $45,175.82, but I am not aware that action has
been taken on it.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the library have been recorded as in the previous
year, the entry numbers in the accession book extending from 225,586
to 246,109.

The following statement shows the munber of volumes, parts of vol-
umes, pamphlets, and charts received from July 1, 1891, to June 30,
1892.

Of these accessions, 297 volumes, 6,363 parts of volumes, and 774 pam-
phlets—7,434 in all—were retained for use in fhe Institution and Mu-
seum; and 857 medical dissertations were deposited in the library of
the Surgeon-General, U. S. Army; the remaining publications were
sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday following their receipt.

The reading room continues to be well used; it has only been possi-
ble to provide room upon the shelves for new periodicals by removing
to the special libraries under the charge of curators or to the Library
of Congress such technical periodicals as experience has shown are
seldom called for by general readers.

The plan detailed in my report for 188788 for increasing the acces-
sions to the library and for completing the series of scientific journals
already in possession of the Institution has been continued; the sup-
plementary work involved by the issue of new scientific journals within
the last few years has added somewhat to the work originally planned.

The small collection of books forming what is called “ the Secretary’s
library” has been added to this year, but is already encroaching upon
the limited space available for library purposes. These books, as I have
stated in my previous reports, are mostly, if not exclusively, books of
scientific reference, and are, under certain restrictions, available to all
connected with the Institution.

I regret to state that Mr. John Murdoch, who has been the efficient
librarian of the Institution since 1887, resigned his position on May
15, 1892. At the close of the year his successor had not been appointed.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
MISCELLANEOUS.

Tomb of Smithson.—During the summer of 1891, upon the occasion
of avisit to Hurope, I made a special journey to Genoa for the purpose
of seeing if the place of sepulture of the founder of the Institution was
properly cared for. The tomb of Smithson is on the hill of San Be-
nigno, high above the Gulf of Genoa, in a small obscure cemetery,
whose existence is unknown to most of the people of the city. It is the
property of the English Government and in the immediate charge of
the British consul. Smithson’s tomb is a substantial structure, but it
appears to have had no attention during the sixty years of its existence,
though other tombs in the small inclosure give evidence of continued
care. A small sum of money, the interest of which is sufficient to de-
fray the expense of the care of the inclosure and tomb, was placed to
the credit of the United States consul at Genoa, who kindly consented
te take charge of the matter.

Statue of Prof. Baird.—. bill to provide for the erection of a bronze
statue of Prof. Baird in the grounds of the Institution was introduced
in the Senate by Mr. Morrill, but failed to pass. This was a renewal
of previous efforts in this direction and the result is particularly disap-
pointing to the friends of the Institution.

Statue of Robert Dale Owen.—A bill to appropriate $20,000 for a statue
to the Hon. Robert Dale Owen, of Indiana, first chairman of the Board
of Regents of the Institution and one of its staunchest friends, was in-
troduced in the Senate by Mr. Voorhees and passed, but failed to secure
favorable action in the House.

Perkins collection of copper implements.—An amendment to the Sun-
dry Civil Bill providing for the purchase by the Institution of a further
collection of prehistoric copper implements belonging to Mr. Freder-
ick S. Perkins, was proposed, but failed to secure favorable action in the
House.

Stereotype plates.—The Institution is possessed of a large collection
of stereotype plates and engravers’ blocks. An effort has been made
to arrange these in a systematic manner to facilitate reference, but
owing to the pressure of routine work, much yet remains to be done in
this direction. It is the policy of the Institution to permit the use of
these plates by publishers under reasonable conditions.

Government collections at Washington.—There was passed during the
first session of the Fifty-second Congress a joint resolution (H. Res. 92)
defining the policy of the Government with reference to the scientific
and literary collections, designed to facilitate the use of such collections
by students, and to encourage the establishment of institutions of learn-
ing at the national capital.

Assignment of rooms.—Pendulum observations by officers of the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey have been continued in a basement room
specially fitted for such work.

The use of the “chapel” of the Smithsonian building was granted
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. if
to the American Oriental Society as a place of assembly in April, 1892,
and later to the Art Congress for a loan exhibition of works of Amer-
ican artists, held during the session of the Congress in May, 1892.

The Hodgkins gift—In May, 1891, a letter received from Mr. Thomas
George Hodgkins, of Setauket, N. Y., led to a correspondence in which
he was advised by the Secretary of the objects of the Institution. At
Mr. Hodgkins’s request, the Secretary, and subsequently, the Assistant
Secretary, made several visits to him at his home, and in conversation
with him learned more in detail his wishes with reference to a proposed
gift.

Mr. Hodgkins wished to present to the Smithsonian Institution the
stun of $200,000, the interest of $100,000 of which was to be used for
the general purposes of the Institution in the “increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men,” provided that the interest of the other $100,-
000 should be used in the investigation of the properties of atmospheric
air considered in its very widest relationship to all branches of science.

sefore taking any steps with regard to this offer, a telegram was sent
on June 22, 1891, to each Regent who could be reached in this country,
requesting his individual opinion of the propriety of accepting Mr.
Hodgkins’ proposition. Favorable opinions having been received in
answer to this from nearly ail the Regents, Mr. Hodgkins later, on
September 22, at his home on Long Island, placed his gift of $200,000
in cash in the hands of the Secretary, with the understanding that an
early meeting of the Regents would be called to consider its formal
acceptance under the terms which Mr. Hodgkins proposed.

A meeting of the Regents was therefore called at the earliest day
practicable (October 21, 1891), and the matter having been laid before
them in detail, the gift was accepted in the terms of the donor.

It seems appropriate at this time to make a statement in elucidation
of Mr. Hodgkins’s wishes as they have been expressed in various
conterences with the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary. It is not
his intention that his fund should be applied to special investigation in
Sanitary science, but he desires rather that the standard of work
should be primarily in relation to the demands of pure science, believing
that application in many directions would follow. He has spoken of
the experiments of Franklin upon atmospheric electricity as one of the
investigations which, if carried on at the present day, would be
germane to his foundation; and has, in further illustration of his
meaning, also referred to the prize awarded by the French Academy of
Sciences to Paul Bert for his discovery in regard to the influences of
oxygen on the phenomena of vitality, as appropriate to his own pro-
posed foundation. His great interest in the diffusion of knowledge
concerning air grows out of his belief that the air is of the highest
importance to man in every aspect of his physical and mental condition,
and he hopes that his gift will stimulate scientific investigation of the
highest order by the best minds, believing that by this means the

H. Mis, 114 2

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

attention of mankind may best be concentrated and kept concentrated
on the importance of the subject. He has expressed a hope that it
might be thought advisable to offer some very considerable prize,
which, being published to the entire world, would by its magnitude call
attention to the subject in which he was so much interested.

Much consideration nas been given to the question as to how the
donor’s wishes may best be carried into effect, for no small difficulty
arises from the universality of the application of his foundation, since
manifestly there is no branch of natural science which is not affected
by it. Meteorology, hygiene and related subjects are most obviously
concerned, while others, though less obviously, are no less immediately
connected, such as geology, for instance, which has for its field the
erust of the earth, now recognized as being largely formed of atmos-
pherie deposits and molded by atmospheric influences. This is only
an instance of what we find in the case of nearly every one of the
whole circle of sciences, biological and physical, all of which appear
onexamination to be affected by our knowledge of the atmosphere in
a very real and important sense.

In order to secure the advice and co-operation of scientific men
throughout the world, letters were addressed to a number of eminent
specialists, stating the circumstances of Mr. Hodgkins’s gift to the
Institution, and explaining his wishes. The following letter is an
example:

Sir: I have the honor to inform you that a bequest has been made
to the Smithsonian Institution by Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, the income
of a portion of which is to be devoted to the increase and diffusion of
more exact knowledge of the nature and properties of atmospheric air,

In carrying out the donor’s wishes, it is proposed to offer a number
of prizes for scientific investigations of a high order of merit bearing
upon the properties of the atmosphere, to be awarded without regard
to the nationality of the author.

While hygiene will occupy a prominent place, it is not intended to
limit these prizes to any single class of investigations, however in-
portant, but to extend them over the whole field of the natural sciences,
as far as these may be regarded as related to each other through the
atmosphere as a common bond.

In illustration of my meaning, I may instance as proper subjects for
investigation—

1. Anthropology, considering man himself as modified by climate,

and his arts as affected by the atmosphere;

2. Biology, in connection with the atmosphere as a fountain of life;

4. Electricity, considered in connection with atmospheric electricity ;

5. Geology, considered in connection with the action of the atmos-

phere in its formation and deformation of the surface of the
planet;
and so on through almost the whole circle of the sciences.

I now write to ask if you will kindly suggest the nature of the prin-
cipal relationships existing between physics and the atmosphere, and
indicate one or two subjects arising out of these relations which you
consider to be proper for prize essays.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

T shall also be glad to know if you will conseut to be a member of a
committee to award such a prize, if given, and to learn from you in
the same connection of any important research, germane to your own
studies, that would be materially advanced by a grant from the funds
now available nnder this liberal construction.

In further illustration of my meaning, [ take the liberty of inclosing
a copy of a reply made to me in answer to a similar inquiry concerning
the science of anthropology, which I do merely to show more cle arly
the character of the information I desire.

The following was the inclosure. It is an answer by a distinguished
anthropologist to a similar question, and was inclosed as an illustration
of the fact that the terms of the Hodgkins donation apply even to sci-
entific matters which may appear at first sight disconnected with the
subject (7. ¢. to anthropology), but which upon consideration are seen
to be intimately related to it:

DEAR Sie: In reply to your inquiry concerning the relations existing
between anthropology and the study of the atmosphere L beg leave to
say that the natural history of man takes into consideration :—

(1) Man, as modified by climate.

(2) His arts as occasioned and affected by the atmosphere.

As to the first, the atmosphere, through climate, elevation, ete., upon
man considered as an animal, is ‘believed to have affected his bodily
form and stature, the color of his eyes, hair, and skin; his longevity,
fecundity, and vigor, and therefore to have been the most potent factor
of all in producing those varieties of our species called races, and to be
at the foundation of these problems whose discussion constitutes the
science of ethnology.

As to the second, most of the arts and activities of man depend upon
the atmosphere for their suggestion and methods. For example, his
habitations, clothing, and the common occupations of his daily life are
most obviously controlled by his atmospheric surroundings, which make
him in the Arctic regions a hunter of furs, dwelling underground; in
the temperate zone a farmer, dwelling in houses; in the tropics a
hunter of ivory, dwelling in open shelters from the sun.

Permit me to observe “further, that the study of the air can not be
omitted in connection with the science of sociology. Even philology
draws its material and perhaps derives it forms largely from the atmos-
phere, and the primitive philosophies and my thologies of the world are
filléd with imagery and theories derived therefrom. Therefore in select-
ing, at your request, from the relationships of the atmosphere to the
science of anthropology in general, two or more subjects for prize
essays, IL have only too much seope.

After much consideration [| would propose to suggest that a prize of
not less than $1,000 should be offered for an essay upon one of the fol-
lowing topics:

1. The relation of atmospherie phenomena to the cosmogenies,

creeds, and cults of all peoples.

2. Atmospheric changes as determining the forms of primitive so-
ciety, family and tribal or ganizations, ete.

3. AS between the monogenistic and the polygenistie theory of the
origin of man, what light is thrown upon the question by a study
of atmospheric influences upou man’s physical constitution.

4. Atmospheric influences and phenomena as affecting constructive
and decorative architecture.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

These essays should be presented within a specified time and sub-
mitted to the judgment of a committee, of which I should be willing
to be amember. Notice of this prize could advantageously be made
public through the following special journals: L’Anthropologie, Paris;
Archiv fiir Anthropologie, Braunschweig.

In regard to your inquiry as to any important research germane to
the subject in which I am personally interested, which would be ad-
vanced by a grant of money, I beg leave to say that I am at present
hindered from pursuing my investigations into the influence of climate
and other atmospheric phenomena in bringing about the distribution
of tribes and stocks of North American aborigines at the time of the
discovery, by the need of a small sun of money which might be placed
at my disposal. If I had $500 unfettered by conditions, I could within
a year’s time undertake to bring together the elements for the solution
of this problem, which has puzzled for so many years students of
ethnology and philology.

Lam, very respectfully yours,

S. P. LANGLEY, Esq,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D.C.

As soon as the attention of the public had been directed to Mr,
Hodekins’s gift, numerous applications for assistance from the fund
were made, and I deemed it advantageous to appoint a special advisory
comnittee, to which might be referred matters pertaining to the
Hodgkins fund. This committee was composed of Surgeon John 8.
Billings, U.S. Army, Director of the Army Medic«!] Museum, in behalf
of hygiene and the related sciences; Prof. F. W. Clarke, chemist of
the U.S. Geological Survey; Mr. William H. Dall of the U.S. Geolog-
ical Survey, well known for his biological and anthropological studies;
Prof. William ©. Winlock, in behalf of astronomy and physics, and the
Assistant Secretary of the Institution, Dr. G. Brown Goode, who acted
as chairman. The committee has held several meetings, and I desire
at this time to express my high appreciation of the value of the work
which they have already done, both as a committee and individually.
At the close of the year, the committee had under consideration, at my
request, a form of circular to be issued to learned institutions and in-
vestigators throughout the world, calling attention to the establish-
ment of the Hodgkins fund, and announcing certain prizes which it is
intended to offer for essays upon specified subjects.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

1 took occasion in my last report to invite your attention to the fact
that the very rapid growth of the collections of the Museum was be-
coming, under existing circumstances, a source of great embarrass-
ment. The difficulties of the situation have increased during the past
year, since, while the influx of specimens has continued, no additional
space has been provided for their reception and only an insignificant
additional sum of money for their maintenance.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. yA

This unsolicited increase of the collections should properly be a
source of gratification rather than of embarrassment. Growth is essen-
tial to the welfare of a museum, and to check it is sure to produce un-
fortunate results. It seems undesirable to say to the friends of the
Museum that their valuable donations ean not be received. Such a
course would alienate their sympathy, and the Museum would lose the
advantage of their good offices. Under existing conditions, however,
the necessity of resorting to so undesirable a measure is perilously
near. The increase of the collections from certain other sources can
not even thus be checked.

Large collections are made every year by the Department of Agri-
culture, the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, and other De-
partments and Bureaus of the Government, either as an essential part
of their work or incidentally. By provision of law the Museum is made
the custodian of these collections, and it can not, therefore, do other:
wise than to receive and preserve them.

Many valuable objects are exposed to dust and vandalism from the
lack of sufficient money to procure the necessary cases for their protec-
tion. Series of objects, such as the great Lacoe collection of fossil
plants, recently acquired, are frequently offered with the condition that
suitable cases be provided. For the safe-keeping of the objects already
in the possession of the Museum and for the reception of those offered.
numerous storage and exhibition cases are a necessity.

The number of specimens of all kinds in the Museum at the close of
the year, as shown by the following table, nearly equalled three and a
quarter millions. The increase for the year was about 260,000 speci-
mens, or nearly double that of 1891,

'The actual increase in the collections during the year 1889-90 is much greater than appears from a
comparison of the totals for 1889 and for 1890. This is explained by the apparent absence of any increase

2TIneluded in the historical collection.

3The total number of specimens in the department of Birds in 1890-91 was 62,806 instead of 62,601.

4Only a small portion of the collection represented by this number was received during the year
1889-"90.

5The decrease in this department for the year 1891-92 was occasioned by the transfer of 1,000
skeletons to the department of vertebrate fossils.

®Up to 1890 the numbers have reference only to specimens received through the Museum, and do
not include specim ens received for the National Herbarium through the Department of Agriculture.
The figures given for 1890-91 include, for the first time, the number of specimens received both at the
National Museum and at the Department of Agriculture for the National Herbarium.

7Collections combined in October, 1889, under Department of Geology. The apparent decrease of
more than 50 per cent of the estimated total for 1889 is accounted for (1) by the rejection of several
thousands of specimens from the collection, and (2) by the fact that no estimate of the specimens in
the reserve and duplicate series is ineluded.

8Transferred to the National Zoédlogical Park.

Nore.—The fact that the figures for two successive years relating to the same collection are un-
changed, does not necessarily imply that there has been no increase in the collection, but that for some
special reason it has not been possible to obtain the figures showing the increase,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Condition of the exhibition halls—The results of over-crowding are
evident everywhere in the exhibition halls. The installation of the
collections and the comfort of visitors are interfered with. It has
become necessary to narrow the aisles in many halls to such a degree
that they are almost impassable, and on occasions when unusual num-
bers of visitors are in the city, nany objects of interest have to be
withdrawn from exhibition. The unavoidable crowding of the cases
interferes with the lighting, so that many objects are practically
hidden from view.

To relieve the present pressure, as regards space, I have, in address-
ing Congress, brought forward two propositions. For immediate and
temporary relief | have recommended the erection of light galleries
in two of the halls, with the intention of hereafter asking for others of
the same character. Such galleries, unlike those in the main Smith-
sonian hall, were provided for in the original plans of the building, and
can be erected without detracting from the appearance of the halls.

While these galleries would add materially to the available exhibition
space, we must look to the erection of anew museum building for more
permanent relief from the present overcrowded condition. <A bill
providing for the construction of a new building has twice received
favorable action by the Senate, but has failed to pass the House.

It is greatly to be hoped that both the galleries and also an addi-
tionai building may be provided without further delay.

Curatorships.—There are now in the Museum thirty-three organized
departments and sections, under the care of eight curators, paid by the
Museum, and twenty honorary curators, detailed for special duty from
different bureaus of the Government. While the latter render very
important and highly appreciated services, they are, of course, more
especially occupied with their own peculiar duties, and can not devote
more than asmall portion of their time to the interests of the Museum.
The technical character of the duties of the curators renders highly de-
sirable the employment of a larger paid staff of men who have had
Special training for museum work. In order to secure the services of
such persons, however, and to obtain the best results for the Museum,
greater inducements should be offered in the way of compensation.
There are few protessors in our colleges who do not receive larger sal-
aries than it is now possible to pay the curators of the Museum, who,
nevertheless, in addition to their onerous executive duties as custodians
of the collections, are expected to furnish scientific information for re-
plies to the thousand of inquiries received every year.

It may be added that the proper preservation of the collections often
entails much manual labor, and in many instances immediate and stren-
uous efforts are needed to save from entire loss large collections of a
perishable nature. Urgent work of this kind is not unfrequently per-
formed by the curators.

It is most desirable that the scientific staff of the Museum should be
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

permanently identified with it, and this condition can hardly be reached
unless a majority at least of the curators are paid from its appropria-
tions. The permanent assignment of the curators to their respective
departments, with adequate compensation and the absence of extraneous
duties, would materially advance the work of the Museiun on its scien-
tific side.

The lack of means to employ a sufficient number of assistants in the
lower grades causes a large amount of minor routine work to fall on the
curators, who are capable of rendering services of a higher character.
On account of this condition of affairs many plans of the greatest impor-
tance to the Museum are held in abeyance from year to year, or are
neyer consummated.

Clerical force.—AMusion has been made in my vormer reports to the
need of additional clerical assistance in the Museum. This need
becomes greater every year as the collections increase in magnitude.
The salaries paid for clerical work are less than in the executive depart-
ments of the Gevernment and elsewhere, and the Museum on many
oceasions has lost the services of competent clerks, trained in their
special work, who have been attracted to other fields of labor by higher
compensation. Some of the departments in the Museum are entirely
without clerical assistance, and the curators are obliged to devote time
which could be much better employed, to the simple but necessary
work of cataloguing and labelling specimens, preparing invoices, and
unpacking boxes.

For the safekeeping of the collections, which have greatly increased
in intrinsic value as well as extent, a larger number of watchmen is
necessary. The force is now so small that it is difficult to grant the
usual leaves of absence without exposing the collections to danger.
It is also with difficulty that the cleanliness of the floors and cases is
maintained, on account of the limited number of laborers and cleaners
which the present appropriation will permit the Museum to employ.

Distribution of specimens.—The distribution of duplicate material to
educational institutions has been continued as far as practicable. This
means of diffusing knowledge is one of the most popular features of the
Museum work, and has been carried on unceasingly for nearly halt a
century, during which time nearly half a million specimens, embracing
mammals, fishes, marine invertebrates, birds, shells, rocks, ores, min-
erals, and ethnological objects, have been given to Museums and other
educational institutions in the United States, while important ex-
changes with similar institutions abroad have resulted in much good to
the Museum. This work, too, is now being seriously hindered, owing
to lack of space for the proper handling and separation of the duplicate
material, and its classification and arrangement into series for distribu-
tion.

The material distributed during the year consisted chiefly of miner
als, marine invertebrates, and casts of prehistoric stone implements,
and amounted to 32,098 specimens.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Publications.—There has been unusual activityin the work of this de-
partment of the Museum during the year. The report for 1889 has been
published, and the report for 1890 has been put in type. The manuscript
of the report for 1891 was sent to the Public Printer and is now going
through the press. Vol. x1 of the ‘“‘ Proveedings” of the National Mu-
seum has been published. Of the “ Bulletin,” Nos. 39 (Parts A to G),
41 and 42 have been issued.

The Proceedings and Bulletins of the National Museum are not “pub-
lic documents,” hence no part of the edition is regularly apportioned
for distribution by the Senate and House, or to the legal depositories.
The edition of 3,000 copies, now printed, is only sufficient to supply in
limited measure the very urgent requests from publie libraries, educa-
tional institutions, and scientific investigators in the United States and
throughout the world. A larger appropriation for printing is needed,
so as to enable the Museum to place a full series of its publications in
representative libraries in different parts of each State. It is not the
intention that the annual number of issues of the Proceedings and Bul-
letins should be increased, but that a larger edition of each should be
printed. On account of the small edition, the Museum fails to receive
in exchange the valuable publications of many scientific institutions.

The amounts hitherto appropriated, though expended with strict
economy, have been found inadequate.

Visitors.—The total number of visitors to the Smithsonian building
during the past year was 114,817, and to the Museum 269,825; total,
384,642, This is an increase of 13,453 over the previous year.

Heating and lighting—The larger part of this appropriation is ex-
pended for fuel and gas. As has been explained in connection with
the estimates for previous years, it is necessary for the safety of the
collection that the buildings should be kept at a nearly even tempera-
ture day and night throughout the winter. The reduction of this ap-
priation below the minimum of $12,000 will make a deficiency estimate
necessary. From lack of fuel, required to maintain the proper temper-
ature, some of the offices had to be abandoned on several occasions
during the winter of 1892. The longer the heating apparatus is used
the less efficient it becomes, and of late it has been necessary each
successive year to expend a larger sum for replacing worn-out parts.
The wires of the burglar alarms, watchman’s call boxes, and other
electrical apparatus, have deteriorated from long use, and need imme-
diate attention.

There are at present in use in the Museum building twenty-five are
lights, and this number is not sufficient to iluminate the entire build-
ing, there being no lights in the courts and an insufficient number in
the halls. It is thought that with an additional plant, costing about
$5,000, the building may be so lighted that it can be thrown open
occasionally to the public at night, to the advantage of those persons
who are unable to avail themselves of the regular hours of exhibition.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. al

The purchase of an additional engine will also render it possible io
provide against the contingency of total darkness in case of damage
to dynamo, line, or motor.

By the appropriation of $5,000 for the removal of decayed wooden
floors, and the substituting of granolithic or artificial stone pavement
therefor, it has been possible to complete a much needed improvement
in several of the halls and courts of the Museum.

With a view of securing the best pavement possible, as well as for
the purpose of obtaining for future guidance a practical knowledge of
the merits of the artificial stone flooring made by different bidders,
three proposals which did not vary materially in amount, were accepted.
it will require a greater length of time than has yet elapsed to pro-
nounce upon the relative merits of these pavements, but they have
already proved themselves far more satisfactory than the wooden floors
for which they were substituted, and it is hoped that it will soon be
possible to put down the same, or some equally durable form of pave-
ment, in the parts of the museum which still lack this improvement.

The World’s Columbian Exposition.—The work of preparing an ex-
hibit for the World’s Fair in Chicago has been continued during the
year. <A full report of the participation of the Smithsonian Institution
and the National Museum in this exhibition will be deferred until such
time as a complete statement can be made.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnological researches among the North American Indians have
been continued by the Smithsonian Institution, in complianee with
acts of Congress, during the year 1891-92, under the direction of Maj.
J. W. Powell, who is also Director of the U. 8. Geological Survey.

The work of the Bureau of Ethnology during the year has been con-
ducted on the same systematic plan before explained as in successful
operation, The authors of the publications of the Bureau prepare
them from material personally gathered by themselves in the field,
which is supplemented by study of all the information attainable from
other sources.

In addition to the issue during the year of the Seventh Annual Re-
port and of six other volumes of publications, nentioned under that
heading in the report of the Director hereunto appended, at the close
of the fiscal year the Highth and Ninth Annual Reports were in type,
the tenth had been delivered to the Public Printer, and the eleventh
and twelfth were on file ready for delivery to that official as soon as
there should be any prospect that their printing could be commenced.
Other reports and papers not intended to form parts of the series of
annual reports were also filed as ready for printing.

Another feature of the year’s work consisted in the collection by
officers of the Bureau, under the authority of law, of ethnologic objects
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

for the exhibit at the World’s Colambian Exposition. This authority
was opportune, as objects of that character are becoming scarce and
costly and probably could not, after a few months, be secured for pres-
ervation in a permanent collection. A similar work of preservation,
also authorized by law, was executed in the restoration of the ruin of
Casa Grande, in Arizona.

Mention of these special operations does not imply that the re-
searches into the religions, customs, history and other ethnologic data
of the Indian tribes were omitted during the year. Details respecting
all the work of the Bureau will be found in the report of its director,
given in the Appendix.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The insufliciency of the appropriations for the maintenance of the
National Zoological Park was pointed out in the report for the year
ending June 30,1891, and experience amply supports the opinions there
expressed. It does not seem superfluous to repeat the following passage
from this last report:

“The primary object for which Congress was asked to establish a
National Zoological Park was to secure “the preservation of those Amer-
ican animals that are already nearly extinct, and this object it was
thought would be best secured by the establishment of a large inclosure
in which such animals could be kept in a seclusion as nearly as possible
like that of their native haunts. It was believed that, except for initial
expenses for buildings and roads for the publie, this could be done with
an outlay comparatively small, probably not exceeding $50,000 a year;
for, after the necessary land was once acquired and fenc ed in, smaller
inclosures and paddocks could be set off and inexpensive barns erected
at about this yearly charge.

It was, in the nature of things, inevitable that some provision should
be made ‘for the convenience of a curious and interested public, as well
as for the care and well being of animals unaccustomed to the pres-
ence of man. For the first of these it was intended to set aside a con-
siderable area, on which the principal buildings should be placed and
to which should be taken, as was expedient, such of the animals as
might interest the public, the larger portion of the park being still
considered as a natural preserve where animals need be disturbed by
no unusual surroundings, and where it was hoped they might, after
the time necessary for their acclimation, breed their young.

The maintenance of a park devoted to these purposes, that is, pri-
marily to useful and scientific ends, and ee to recreation, seemed
to those interested in its suecess a legitimate tax upon national re-.
sources, but when Congress decided that one-half of the necessary
oP on aes should be raised by local taxation it seemed only fit that the

tax-payers should be heard in their wish to have prominence given to
the feature that principally interested them, and their chief interest was
naturally in the park as a place of recreation. That this was recog-
nized by a considerable body in Congress became evident from the sub-
sequent debates.

The moral right of the people of the District to ask consideration of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

their wishes for entertainment in return for the outlay which falls
upon them can not be questioned, and so far as this could be recog-
nized it introduced a tendency to provide an establishment more like
an ordinary zoological garden, or permanent menagerie, than the com-
paratively inexpensive scheme at first contemplated.

In view of the circumstances an appropriation was asked of Con-
gress, which was believed to be smaller than was consistent with the
proper ultimate development of the park, but on an estimate which
proposed to begin on the most economical scale. Thus, for the general
maintenance of the collection, $35,000 was asked, which is about the
same as the annual sum spent in the Central Park menagerie, New
York, having an area of about LO acres, and at least $10,000 less than is
spent either at the zoological garden in Cincinnati or P hiladelphia, e ach
having an area of about 40 acres. When it is reflected that these
latter enterprises are conducted for business purposes by business men,
that they have their collections already nearly complete and purchase
but few new aninals, it will be seen that the sum asked for the main-
tenance of the 67 acres of the National Zoological Park with all the
expensive animals yet to be procured was certainly not extravagant.
Congress reduced this estimate to $17,500, a sum for which as a year’s
experience has now shown the Park can not be maintained,

For buildings, an appropriation of $36,850 was asked. In this con-
nection it may be recalled that in the Philadelphia gardens the build-
ings and inclosures cost $194,705, The sum estimated was intended to
cover all inclosures and structures of every character indispensable on
the modest scale proposed, Congress reduced this to $18,000,

The average expense of preparing such uncultivated grounds in city
parks elsewhere has proved to be at least $2,900 per acre. The sum of
$29,500 was asked for that purpose, aS no more than sufficient to fit
such portions of the park as were necessary for the immediate accom-
modation of the public. Congress reduced this to $15,000.

These reductions have not only obliged me to retard the development
on the lines that had been laid down, but have increased the ultimate
cost; for where living creatures are in question it is plain that they
have not only to be fed and guarded but to be housed; and all this at
once, under penalty of their loss. Congress has plainly intended that
they should be preserved, and that some sort of roads and access for
the public should be provided this year.

The result has necessarily been, that with every effort to obtain per-
manent results there has been a partial expenditure of the absolutely
insufficient grant on enforced expedients of a temporary character,
which are not in the interest of economy.

It is extremely desirable that a sum for emergencies be secured in the
next appropriation. In carrying forward, from the beginning, novel
and untried work of such varied character, unforeseen difficulties must
inevitably arise, but no provision has been made for these, nor even for
such readily anticipated emergencies as are caused, for instance, by
floods in grounds traversed by a stream which has been known to rise
6 feet in less than half an hour.

The difficulties which these conditions have imposed on the admin-
istration of the park may be fairly called extreme, and the amount and
character of what has been effected must be considered in this con-
nection. In spite of these the result, I think, nay be said to be, that
at least as a source of interest and amusement to the people the park
has exceeded the most sanguine expectations.”
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It will be observed that, of the $101,350 asked, two-thirds were for
buildings and grounds which, if not provided for, could wait with com-
paratively little inconvenience, while the remaining third, or $35,000,
was for the care and food of living animals, for policing of the park
and for the safety of the public, matters which, when the garden was
once opened, could not wait, and could not be materially diminished,
but constituted a comparatively fixed sum without which the park
could not go on, and which should therefore be given nearly as it
stood or withheld altogether. Congress, however, it will be seen, re-
duced all these items nearly in the same proportion, that is, to about
one-half.

Two-thirds of the desired appropriation was of a nature that could
perhaps be reduced one year and made good later; the other third (that
for food of living animals and maintenance), as painful experience has
shown, could not be materially reduced and could not be made good
later; and it is the deficiency on this item that has been the special
cause of the difficulties of the administration.

Inadequacy of appropriations —Embarrassment also arose from the
fact that the small amount appropriated was specified and allotted un-
der three separate subordinate heads and in three nearly equal amounts,
although the needs were not equal. As the bounds of these allotments
could not be overstepped, it occurred that, while there were relatively
sufficient funds under one item (the care of grounds), there was entire in-
adequacy under the much more essential head which provided for the
maintenance and care of living animals. No matter how great the emer-
gency or serious the need, it was, of course, impossible to change this
allotment, and while the total appropriated by Congress might, by close
economy, have been sufficient, yet there was danger that the animals
would be unfed and that the force of watchmen and keepers, although
overworked, would be inadequate for their proper protection; and as there
existed no authority to give away or sell the animals, disaster of some
kind would have ensued but for the aid indirectiy given by the Smith-
sonian Institution.

It may here be mentioned that it was expected that a large number
of animals would be obtained from the Yellowstone National Park,
that being the principal great preserve for wild game controlled by the
Government of the United States. With the consent of the honor-
able the Seeretary of the Interior, a hunter was employed to capture
large wild animals in considerable numbers, which were to be for-
warded to the park at Washington. When a number of bears, deer,
and elk were thus obtained, the reduced appropriations were insufficient
to continue his employment or to transport the animals already captured.
A stillmore regrettable consequence was the necessity of refusing abso-
lutely all gifts made by the public, as there were no means of paying for
the transportation of animals or for their subsistence when received, This
has been a serious disadvantage to the collection, not only at present,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

but as regards its future, for it need hardly be said that it has dis-
couraged and rebuffed many public-spirited citizens who would have
been glad to present animals to the park, and who will now cease to
have any further interest in the enterprise.

Dangers by freshet.—On the oth of September, 1591, a freshet of un-
usual violence invaded the valley of Rock Creek. Such was the rapid-
ity of the increase of water that in less than half an hour the little
stream had risen 6 feet and had become a torrent of considerable mag-
nitude and power. The piers for the bridge had just been completed,
but the banks above and below were not yet protected from the abra-
sion of a flood. In consequence of this the water formed an eddy
near one of the piers, causing it to break, and cracked one of the abut-
ments. It is believed that this unfortunate accident was not due to any
defect in the design of the pier (which was constructed under the com-
petent supervision of the late Gen, Meigs), but rather to the fact that
the freshet occurred before the neighboring banks were properly pre-
pared.

The damage to the pier was by no means the total extent of that
caused by the flood. The bear-yards, then nearly completed and ready
for occupation, were very seriously injured by the precipitation into
them of many tons of rock and earth. This made it evident that the
bank of earth and decomposed rock on the cliff above the yards could
not be depended on without some additional safeguard. The heavy
fall of water seriously injured and cut away the new roads, gutters,
and drains that were yet fresh and unsettled, removed whole banks of
sarth from fresh slopes and washed out trees and bushes. The creek
changed the level of its banks, cutting out a new channel for itself in
several places, and covered the slopes with hundreds of tons of gravel
and sand, and occasionally even deposited considerable stones, which
were lifted by the rushing water and left upon the grass as a striking
evidence of the violence of the flood. Immediate steps were commenced
to repair the damage, but this work was not completed within the fiscal
year on account of the insufficiency of the appropriation.

The bear-yards are in an abandoned quarry, adjoining a precipice
whose summit is upon the extreme boundary line of the park. For this
reason no permanent protection can be provided until the Government
secures the few contiguous roods needed at the top. With this the sum-
mit of the precipice, formed of the original rock, would constitute the
cheap and natural barrier. For protection under the actual, existing
conditions, the only measure (and it is both incomplete and expensive) is
to build a retaining wall reaching from the solid rock of the cliff high
enough to hold any detritus that might be displaced by the action of
rain or frost.* This has been commenced, but lett incompleted owing
to lack of funds.

“See illustration, Plate II, page 41.
By REPORT OF THE. SECRETARY.

A considerable force of men was employed in repairing the roads,
gutters, and drains, and in diverting the course of the stream so as to
prevent further erosion of the banks. The amount expended im par-
tially repairing the damage caused by the freshet was nearly $5,000.
This unexpected demand upon already insufficient appropriations was
another cause of embarrassment.

Influx of visitors —Public interest in the park has steadily increased
from the beginning, and even in its present unfinished state the number
of visitors ina single day sometimes reaches from five to ten thousand
or more. It was supposed that when the collection should be of notable
size, when the buildings were completed, the grounds improved, and
the means of access ample, that a large number of visitors would fre-
quent the park, but so very large and so immediate an attendance could
hardly have been anticipated. It was found that the force of watch-
men was quite insufficient properly to direct and control the throngs of
people that on holidays passed through the unfinished houses and along
the roads and paths. There are five entrances to guard, and eight sep-
arate houses and inclosures where animals and property are kept, so
far distant from one another that a watchman or keeper should be
stationed at each, while in the larger houses, like the general animal
house and the elephant house, it is desirable to have more than one
keeper on hand, during the presence of great crowds, both for the pur-
pose of protecting children as well as to prevent mischievous individ-
uals frominjuring the animals. The services of the keepers are required
chietly in the day, but there must be watchmen to relieve each other
during the whole twenty-four hours. Under these circumstances, the
appropriation allowed—for the guarding of the animals, the public, and
the policing of the 167 acres by day and by night—but six men inelud-
ing both watchmen and keepers.

Deficiency appropriation.—In view of these and other circumstances
it seemed proper to ask a measure of relief from Congress. The fol-
lowing estimates were accordingly framed and a deficiency appropria-
tion asked to meet them:

ing those damages and preventing similar occurrences for the future,

The following deficiency appropriation was made by Congress under
date of March 8, 1892:

Mor care and subsistence of animals for the National Zodlogical Park,
fiscal year eighteen hundred and ninety-two, one thousand dollars, one-
halfof which sum shall be paid from the revenues of the District of
Colunbia and the other half from the Treasury of the United States.

Damages occasioned by the undue reduction of force.—As the season
advanced and no additional appropriation was made by Congress, it
became necessary to reduce the expenses of the park still further. This
was done by stopping all work upon the buildings and grounds, and
reducing the force till one watchman only could be on duty at a time,

HM, Mis; 114=—--3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and much danger to the public and many accidents to the animals en-
sued in consequence. The deer and antelope were annoyed and injured
by dogs, the flock of valuable Angora goats was nearly destroyed by
being poisoned by visitors with laurel (Kalmia latifolia), and many
other injuries were inflicted on the animals, while the administration
was in anxiety lest some grave accidents, such as were almost to be
expected under these circumstances, should occur among the crowds of
visitors, embracing not only adults, but children, of the latter of whom
there were often many hundreds present and unprotected.

That this anxiety was not unwarranted was shown on the night of
May 24, when a grizzly bear, during the absence of the single watch-
man, scrambled up the almost perpendicular cliff in the rear of the
yards and escaped from the park. After fruitless attempts to capture
him, and the injury of one of the employés whom he wounded, orders
were reluctantly given to shoot him.

The following letter, setting forth the urgent needs of the park, was
addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury on January 23:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C., January 23, 1892.

Sir: I beg leave to invite your attention to the estimates under the
Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, duly
submitted to you October 7, 1891, and to the modified form in which
these estimates were transmitted to Congress, whereby it would seem
to be recommended that no increase be made over the amounts appro-
priated for the current year.

While feeling that all the amounts asked for by the Institution have
been only such as are adequate with the strictest economy, I have to
ask your especial attention to the three items for the National Zoodlogi-
cal Park, i. e., [mprovements, Buildings, and Maintenance. Disasters
from floods and like contingencies for which no provision was made by
Congress in the appropriations for the present year emphasize the
necessity of securing the full amount estimated under the headings
Improvements and Buildings, while there exists exceptional necessity
in the item for Maintenance, which is essentially for the food and care
of living animals.

The appropriations made by the act of March 3, 1891, for “ main-
tenance” during the present fiscal year (for which $35,000 was asked),
was $17,000, but the sum of $5,122.71 from the appropriation of April
30, 1890, was available and has been used for this purpose; and even
with this addition it has been necessary to ask for a deficiency appro-
priation of $4,434, chiefly to cover expenditures which were found to
be absolutely necessary to prevent loss to the Government.

The minimum expenditures for the present year under this item will
therefore be $22,622.71; the expenses for the first six months being
$14,269.73, or at the rate of $28,539.46 per annum. I trust, therefore,
that it is made sufficiently clear that with an appropriation of $17,500
it will be impossible to properly care for and feed the animals now on
hand.

The past expenditures would have been still larger but that the work
on the accounts for the Treasury has in part been done gratuitously by
the Institution, which has also supplied tree of cost office rooms, as well
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 30

as the aid and supervision of unpaid naturalists. This can not be reck-
oned upon tor the future, but has been sanctioned by the Regents as a
means to meet the exigency until the need of a larger appropriation can
be represented to Congress, and in the meantime the working force has
been reduced to an extreme degree, the policing, for instance, being now
done by one watchman, aided by two employés who are largely engaged
with other duties; and these three men are required to maintain order
over an area of 167 acres, visited during each day by thousands of people.
These details are mentioned in connection with the fact that (unless some
small purchases of animals made at the outset be excepted) it is under
like stringencies of economy in every branch of the administration that
the expenses have already amounted, as shown above, to more than
$14,000 in six months.

i can not too emphatically represent the peculiar difficulties that must
arise in administering an insufficient appropriation for the care of liv-
ing wild animals, unable to care for themselves where they are, if no
provision has been made by Congress for disposing of them elsewhere,

In view of increased expenses since the estimates were prepared, due
directly to the unexpectedly great popular interest manifested in the
park, and to the extraordinary increase of visitors, | now feel com-
pelled to either increase the estimate for maintenance to $30,000, to
cover further contingencies, or to ask that the total appropriation
requested for the park be made in such form as to allow a certain dis-
cretionary power to meet them, If under the circumstances stated, the
latter would, in your judgment, be the more advisable cowrse, [ would
respectfully ask that you recommend to Congress that the three items of
improvements ($20,000), buildings ($27,000), and maintenance ($26,000)
be appropriated in one sum of $75,000, as follows:

National Zoological Park, Smithsonian Institution :

Continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage, and
drainage, and for grading, planting, and otherwise Luaproving the grounds. erecting,
and repairing buildings and inclosures for animals and for administrative purposes,
care, subsistence, and transportation of animals and for the purchase or exchange of
specimens not otherwise obtainable, including salaries or compensation of all neces-
sary employés, and general incidental expenses not otherwise provided for, $73,000.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours,
- S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
The SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,
Washington, D.C.

Notwithstanding this urgent appeal, it was .ound, when the sundry
civil appropriation bill was reported to the House, that but $29,000
was recommended to be appropriated for the National Zodlogical Park.
This was divided into the following heads:

The matter seemed to me so urgent and serious as to demand the
immediate attention of the Regents. I therefore called a special meet-
ing of the Board and laid the matter before them. The result of that
meeting will be seen in the following letter addressed to the President
of the United States Senate,
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, April 2, 1892.

Str : In accordance with the instruction of the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, I have the honor to transmit a resolution passed by
them on the 29th of March, 1892, together with the following prelimn-
inary statement of the considerations on which it is based :

The National Zodlogical Park was placed under the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution by the act of April 30, 1890, to be administered
by them, first “for the advancement of science ” and, second, ‘ for the
instruction and recreation of people. ”

The necessity of protecting the unexpectedly large crowd of people
that have been attracted to the Park and of providing for their access
to the animals, as well as for the protection of the latter, has made it
necessary to assign to this secondary object a disproportionate share of
the appropriations, and it seems unavoidable that this subordinate
feature should thus claim the larger portion of the expenses, as long as
the collections are open to the public, as in ordinary zodlogical gardens.

The appropriations for the fiscal year 1891-92 were made under three
heads: Improvements and care of grounds, $15,000; buildings, $18,000,
and maintenance, $17,500, these amounts being about one-half those
that were submitted to Congress as necessary to make preliminary pro-
vision for the security and accessibility of the collections and to ad-
minister their trust with safety to the public.

The Regents recognized the impossibility of doing this with such
means; but, considering that the animals were already i in the Park, in
view of this public safety, and regarding the act as mandatory upon
them, they, with the aid of a balance, economized, in anticipation from
the original appropriation made for the organization of the Park, and
a deficiency item of $1,000, to meet urgent needs, have endeavored to
get through the year until relief could be had from Congress. In doing
so they have been obliged to reduce the number of watchmen and em-
ployés of the Park in every grade till the public safety threatens to be
endangered, while yet a consider able part of these watchmen have been
called on to labor continuously through Sundays and holidays ten to
twelve hours a day without extra compensation, and have in other re-
spects felt obliged to carry economy to a degree which would have been
unjustifiable, except upon compulsion under such circumstances.

They would, in their opinion, have been unable to administer the
Park to the close of the fiscal year, even under these conditions, had
they not, in view of the emergency, also given without char oe the
services of officials and employés paid from the private Smithsonian
fund. The total expenditure for maintenance during the current year
may, under these conditions, be expected to be $23,600. These facts
were represented by them through the Secretary of the Institution in a
letter dated January 23, 1892 to! the Secretary of the Trea asury (a copy
of which is appended) and by him transmitted to Congress.

For the year 1892-793 the followiug estimates were sent to the Treas-
ury Department: Improvements, $20,000; buildings, $27,000, and
maintenance, $26,000.

In the sundry civil bill (H. R. 7520) as now reported to the House
of Representatives, there is appropriated for improvements $9,000,
for buildings $10,000, and for maintenance, $10,000; in all $29,000. If
the Regents considered, as they must, $9,000 as inadequate for a year’s
expenditure i in laying out the roads and grounds in a new park of 167
acres, they yet would not have felt compelled to make this present rep-
resentation, since such improvements may await the action of a future
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Ht

Congress; but, under the appropriation for buildings,” the security
of the animals must be provided tor without delay, while under * main-
tenance” come not only their food and warmth, but the protection of
the public; and that in the case of animals, which are helpless to provide
for themselves and dangerous if not guarded, can not wait future action,
has been a pressing consideration to them.

The Regents think it proper to remark that the roads of the park in
the vicinity of the cages have been crowded with visitors, to the num-
ber of as many as 10,000 in a day, before there was time to make any
means for the permanent care of the animals, or provide proper roi ids
to get to them, even had the means for these been appropriated, and
that there is, in their judgment, every reason to expect during the eom-
ing summer the visit of still larger throngs, composed not only of adults,
but of children.

The Regents feel desirous to represent that they can not be held re-
sponsible for the imminent danger which must result, under the contem-
plated withdrawal even of these means for protection which experience
has already shown to be absolutely insufficient. They would also ask
attention to the fact that small as the appropriation is, it is in several
items, and that under no emergency is any discretion allowed them as
to their relative amounts, although the whole matter of expenditure is
here for a novel purpose, on which only experience could decide the
relative exigency of each part.

If Congress intended that the park must be maintained on the ap-
propriation under which the Regents have been unable to administer it
the last year (improvement, $15,000; buildings, 818,000; maintenance,
$17,500), they deem it reasonable to bring the attention of Congress to
the fact that a discretion might properly be exercised by them as to what
proportion they should apply to the imminent needs of the public safety
and what to matters of less urgency, and that they should either be
allowed to expend on the part upon which the safety of the publie and
the existence of the animals especially depends, that which their ex-
perience has shown to be indispensable, or that they should be relieved
of responsibility for the consequences.

They desire to add in further explanation that they do not suppose
that with the total appropriation of $50,000, of which $26,000 is for
“maintenance” (mentioned in the resolution), the park can be properly
conducted, and that they believe this sum to be in fact inadequate for
such conduct, their intent being to state to Congress the sum below,
which, according to their experience, it is impossible to undertake that
the park shall be carried on another year, though not creditably, yet
without most probable danger.

The resolutions are as follows:

MARCH 29, 1892.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution would respect-
fully re present to Congress the impossibility of maintaining the United States Na-
tional Zodlogical Park, required by the act of Congress of April 30, 1890, with a
less total appropriation than $50,000, of which at least $26,000 will be required for
maintenance.

Resolved, That the Secretary of the Institution be requested to communieate this
resolution to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, with a prelimi-
nary statement of the reasons and considerations on which it is b: ase dd.

[ have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Secretary.

President of the Senate.
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

[House Ex. Doe. No. 102, Fitty-second Congress, first session. ]

TREASURY DEPARTMENT, January 25, 1892.
Str: LT have the honor to transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a
communication from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution of the 23d instant,
in relation to the estimates on page 231 of the Book of Estimates, for the fiscal year
1893, submitted for the improvement, maintenance, etc., of the Nationel Zoédlogical
Park, District of Columbia, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893.
Respectfully, yours, ;
O. L. SPAULDING,
Acting Secretary.
The SPEAKER OF THE House OF REPRESENTATIVES.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C., Janwary 25, 1892.
Sir: I beg leave to invite your attention to the estimates under the Smithsonian
BS ea for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, duly submitted to you October
1891, and to the modified form in which these estimates were transmitted to Con-
eee wher eby it would seem to be recommended that no increase be made over the
amounts appropriated for the current year.

While feeling that all the amounts asked for by the Institution have been only
such as are adequate with the strictest economy, I have to ask your special atten-
tion to the three items for the National Zodlogical Park, 7. ¢., improvements, build-
ings, and maintenance. Disasters from floods and like contingencies, for which no
provision was made by Congress in the appropriations for the present year, empha-
size the necessity of securing the full amount estimated under the headings Impr ove-
ments and Buildings, while there exists exce ptional necessity in the item for
maintenance, which is essentially for the food and care of living animals.

The appropriations made by the act of March 5, 1891, for ‘‘maintenance” during
the present fiscal year (for which $35,000 was asked), was $17,500, but the sum of
$5,122.71 from the appropriation of April 30, 1890, was available and has been used
for this purpose; and eyen with this addition it has been necessary to ask for a defi-
ciency appropriation of $4,434, chiefly to cover expenditures which were found to be
absolutely necessary to prev ent loss to the Government.

The minimum expenditures for the present year under this item will therefore be
$22, 622.71; the expenses for the first six months being $14,269.73, or at the rate of
$28,539.46 per annum. I trust, therefore, that it is made suffici iently clear that with
an appropriation of $17,500 it will beimpossible to properly care for and feed the an-
imals now on hand.

The past expenditures would have been still larger but that the work on the ac-
counts for the Treasury has in part been done gratuitously by the Institution, which
has also supplied free of cost office rooms, as well as the aid and supervision of un-
paid naturalists. This can not be reckoned upon for the future, but has been sane-
tioned by the Regents as a means to meet the exigency until the need of a larger ap-
propriation can De re presented to Congress, and in the meantime the wor king force
has been reduced to an extreme degree, the policing, for instance, being now done by
one watchman, aided by two employés who are iaeaely engaged with other duties ;
and these three men are required to maintain order over ay area of 167 acres, visited
during each day by thousands of people. These details are mentioned in connection
with the fact that (unless some small purchases of animals made at the outset be
excepted) it is under like stringencies of economy in every branch of the adminis-
tration, that the expenses have already amounted, as shown above, to more than
$14,000. in six months. ;

I can not too emphatically represent the peculiar difficulties that must arise in
administering an insufficient appropriation tor the care of living wild animals, un-
able to care for themselves where they are, if no provision has been made by Con-
gress for disposing of them elsewhere

In view of increased expenses since the estimates were prepared, due directly to
the unexpectedly great popular interest manifested in the park, and to the extraor-
dinary increase of visitors, I now feel compelled either to increase the estimate for
maintenance to $3 30,000, to cover further contingencies, or to ask that the total ap-
propriation requested for the park be made in such form as to allow a certain disere-
tionary power to meet them. If, under the circumstances stated, the latter would,
in your judgment, be the more advisable course, I would respectfully ask that you
recommend to Congress that the three items of improvements ($20,000), building
($27,000), and maintenance ($26,000) be appropriated in one sum of $73,000, as fol-
lows:

‘National Zoélogical Park, Smithsonian Institution: Continuing the construction
of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage, and drainage, and for grading,
planting, and otherwise improving the grounds, ereeting and repairing buildings
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

and inclosures for animals, and for administrative purposes, care, subsisteiec, and
transportation of animals, and tor the purchase or exchange of specimens not other-
wise obtainable, including salaries or compensation of all necessary employés, and
general incidental expenses not otherwise provided for, $73,000.”
T have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
The SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,
Washington, D.C,

The Committee on Appropriations of the United States Senate finally
recommended that the sum allowed by the House for the Park be raised
to $73,000, and that the amount be appropriated in one item, that is to
say, without assigning special sums to special subordinate heads.

In the conference committee upon the sundry civil bill the amount
recommended by the Senate was reduced to $50,000, but the embarrass-
ment of special subheads of appropriation was removed. The bill was
finally passed* in the following terms,

National Zoblogical Park: For continuing the construction of roads-
walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage, and drainage; and for grading,
planting, and otherwise improving the grounds; erecting and repair,
ing bmidings and inclosures for animals; and for administrative pur-
poses, care, subsistence, and transportation of animals, including sala-
ries or compensation of all necessary employes, and general incidental
expenses not otherwise provided for, fifty thousand dollars, one-half of
which sum shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Columbia
and the other half from the Treasury of the United States; and a re-
port in detail of the expenses on account of the National Zodlogical
Park shall be made to Congress at the beginning of each regular ses-
sion.

Work already done.—Notwithstanding a compulsory waste of means
‘raused by the fact that insufficient appropriations made it necessary
to do certain urgent work provisionally and imperfectly, it is believed
that results have been attained at a smaller expense than is usual in
establishinents of the same nature elsewhere. The following table
shows the cost of the principal works projected up to June 30, 1892.

In elucidation of these statements, the plans and drawings of a
portion of the work given (on a necessarily small scale in the text) may
be referred to (see Plates 11, 11, 1V and vy.)

*Owing to the long session of Congress the bill did not become a law until August
5, 1892. Although the scope of this report is confined to the fiscal year ending June
30, 1892, it seems desirable to conclude here the history of this session’s operation.

the grounds were to be used essentially in large preserves for the pres-
ervation of the national large game.

* Fifty-first Congress, 2d session; H. R. Ex. Doc. No. 5.
A4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The area occupied by the buildings and inclosures for animals in the
Park is not far from 40 acres.

Work for the next fiscal year.—The limited amount appropriated by
Congress will not permit a rapid development of the Park. Nearly
$30,000 of the sum allowed will be required for the feeding and care
of the animals and the maintenance of the necessary staff of employés.
The remainder will be applied to carrying out the plans already de-
vised; that is to say, to completing the structures yet unfinished,
making secure the inclosures and building additional quarters where
necessary, in strengthening the banks of the creek against erosion, in
completing the ponds for aquatic animals, in extending somewhat the
water supply, sewerage, and drainage, and in grading and dressing
the roads and slopes.

PLATE V.—House for Bison and Elk.

There is an urgent need for a better structure for the elephants than
the temporary barn which was hastily erected for their accommodation
and which they have ever since occupied. It is calculated that a com-
plete building suitable for the accommodation of elephants and other
animals of the same general habits and needs would cost about $15,000.
Only a portion of this sum need be appropriated for the present, as the
house could be built upon a plan that admits of enlargement.

Access to the park.—The Rock Creek Railway Company intend, as I
understand, to carry a branch of their road directly to the Ontario
avenue entrance to the park and to transfer passengers from all the
city street-car lines without extra charge. In that case there is no
doubt that the number of visitors will be greatly increased. The widen-
ing and improvement of Quarry road and the extension of Kenesaw

avenue to the park lines on the eastward will also tend to increase the
ase of access to the park.

Additions to the collections. —The collection is now added to only
through gifts made by public-spirited citizens and the somewhaé limited
aecessions derived from the Yellowstone Park. As before mentioned,
lack of funds has prevented any notable increase from these sources.
It is decreased by the inevitable deaths which the experience of older
zoological gardens shows will not be less than from 20 to 30 per cent
annually.

Aecessions from the Yellowstone Park are usually limited to a very
narrow range of specimens and can not be depended on for producing
a really valuable and characteristic collection of the North American
fauna. Under the terms of the first appropriation act it was allow-
able to procure by purchase “ rare specimens not otherwise attainable.”
This provision was nearly ineffective owing to the inadequate fund
given, and it was omitted from the act passed at the recent session of
Congress.

The total number of animals in the park is 448 of which 540 are in-
digenous to North America. Fifty-five of the animals were obtained
by purchase.

NECROLOGY.
MONTGOMERY CUNNINGHAM MEIGS.

Montgomery Cunningham Meigs was a son of the eminent physician
and medical author, Charles D. Meigs. He was born May 3, 1816, in
Augusta, Ga., and graduated from the United States Military Academy
at West Point in 1836. He was assigned first to the artillery service,
and subsequently to the Corps of Engineers. In 1852 he was directed
to make a survey at Washington, D. ©., with the view of determining
the best plan for supplying the city with water. The plan proposed
by him received the approval of the War Department and was adopted
by Congress, General Meigs, then a captain of engineers, being
charged with its execution—a task that occupied his attention for a
period of ten years, and which he completed with signal success. During
the prosecution of this important work Capt. Meigs was also placed in

charge, as supervising engineer, of the north and south extensions of
the Capitol, and of the construction of its crowning iron dome, as well
as of the northern extension of the General Post-Office Building.

He served with eminent distinetion throughout the war of the re-
bellion, reaching the rank of brigadier-general in charge of the Quarter-
master’s Department. The place sought him not only for his high in-
tegrity and acknowledged capacity for business, but on account of the
strength of his personal character. In 1864 he received the well-earned
title of brevet major general in the Army,
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

With the close of the war ends the most active period of his life,
and begins the gentle course of an honored old age, devoted among
other occupations to the advancement of the best interests of this In-
stitution. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and
one of the founders of the Philosophical Society of Washington. He
was appointed by a joint resolution of Congress in 1885 a Regent of the
Smithsonian Institution, and from his entrance into the Board became
an active member of its executive committee, which positions he filled
until his death, which occurred at his residence in this city on the 2d
of January, 1892.

Of Gen. Meigs as a man alike in external or in moral aspects, one
can only speak in terms of respect. Personally, he will be remem-
bered by all, even until his very last days, as erect in carriage, with a
soldierly bearing which did not recognize the lapse of years, and a
manner both dignified and engaging. In character he was not only
conscientious and sagacious, but firm at a time when firmness tried
every quality of aman. What more can be added when we have said
that he was a man faithful in all things. who has left behind him a repu-
tation both high and enduring?

NOAH PORTER.

Noah Porter was born in Farmington, Conn., December 14, 1811, and
graduated at Yale College in 1831. During a tutorship in Yale in 1835-
1835, he devoted himself to the study of theology. He was appointed pro-
fessor of moral philosophy and metaphysics at Yale in 1846, In 1871
he was called to the presidency of Yale, which post he resigned in 1886,
During President Porter’s administration the progress of the college
was marked. As a teacher, and in his personal relations with the
students, he was one of its most popular presidents. He received the
degree of D. D. from the University of the city of New York in 1858,
and that of LL. D. from Edinburgh in 1886. His writings cover a wide
range of subjects, but are mainly philosophical. He was one of the
most scholarly metaphysicians this country has produced. His con-
nection with the Smithsonian Institution began January 26, 1875,
when he was elected to the Board of Regents by a joint resolution of
Congress, as a citizen of Connecticut, and this connection terminated
with his resignation December 31, 1889, on account of failing health.

His death occurred on March 4, 1892, in the eightieth year of his age.
President Dwight said of him in an address delivered at his funeral:

He was strong in the native force of his mind, quick in his mental
action, keen in his insight, firm in his grasp of truth, rich in his think-
ing, but most of all, wide in his reach. His eye kindled with enthusi-
asm as he saw the first opening of new ideas. His face beamed with
joy as he gained new measures of knowledge. The field of truth was
full of attractiveness for him, and he was glad to enter it by any path-
way. He has been in the brotherhood of scholars a man of mark and of

influence. He has commanded respect for his learning. He has com-
mended learning by his own possession of it. He has stimulated those
nearest to him by his many thoughts, by his wide interest in many
departments of knowledge, and by his free and liberal spirit. He has
kept an open mind for truth and an open heart for his friends. He has
stood among us as one of the ablest men in intellectual power whom we
have known in these past years.

Respectfully submitted,

APPENDIX I.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY FOR THE
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1892.

Str: Ethnologic researches among the North American Indians were continued
under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in compliance with acts of Con-
gress, during the year 1891-92.

A report upon the work of the year is most conveniently presented under two
general heads, viz, field work and office work.

f®IELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) archeology and (2) general field
studies, the latter being directed chiefly to religion, technology, and linguistics.

Archeological field work.—The explorations of the Bureau for the last fiscal year
were continued under the personal supervision of Mr, W. H. Holmes, with Messrs.
Cosmos Mindeleft, Gerard Fowke, and William Dinwiddie as assistants.

The work begun in the tide-water regions of Maryland and Virginia in the spring
of 1891 was continued throughout the present year. Careful attention was given
to the examination and mapping of the shell deposits of the Lower Potomae and the
Chesapeake, and many of the historic village sites visited by John Smith and his
associates were identified and examined. The remains upon these sites are identical
with those of the many other village sites of the region. Mr. Holmes studied the
archeology of South, West, and Rhode rivers and of the shores of the bay above and
below Annapolis. The middle Patuxent was visited and the site of the ancient vil-
lage of Mattpament identified and examined. The valley of the Rappahannock in
the vicinity of Fredericksburg and a number of the other western tributaries of the
Potomac received attention. Ancient soapstone quarries, one in Fairfax County,
Va., three in Montgomery County, Md., and one in Howard County, Md., were
studied, and collections of the quarry rejects and implements used in quarrying and
cutting the stone were obtained.

In July Mr. Holmes made a trip to Ohio to assist in the resurvey of several geo-
metric earthworks at Newark and near Chillicothe. <A visit was made to the great
flint quarries in Licking County, between Newark and Zanesville. This well-known
quarry is one of the most extraordinary pieces of aboriginal work in the country,
and the evidence of pitting and trenching and of the removal and working up of
creat bodies of the flint are visible on all sides, the work having extended over many
square niles. Numerous hammer stones and large bodies of the refuse of manutac-
ture are seen. The chief product of the work upon the site here as elsewhere was a
thin blade, the blank from which various implements were to be specialized. The
countless handsomely shaped and tinted arrow and spear points and Knives scat-

5Q) REPORT OF THE: SECRETARY.

When the work of re-surveying the earthworks at Newark and Chillicothe was
finished, Mr. Holmes made a journey into Indian Territory to examine an ancient
quarry formerly supposed to be a Spanish silver mine. It was reported by Mr. Wal-
ter P. Jenney, of the Geological Survey, that this was really an Indian flint quarry,
and the visit of Mr. Holmes confirmed this conclusion. Seven miles northwest of
Seneca, Mo., and 2 or 3 miles west of the Indian Territory line there are numer-
ous outcrops of massive whitish chert, and in places this rock has been exten-
sively worked for the purpose of securing flakable material for the manufacture of
implements. The pits and trenches cover an area of about 10 acres. They are
neither as deep nor as numerous as the Flint Ridge quarries. The product of this
quarry was also the leaf-shaped blades of the usual type, the size being greater than
in the other similar quarries of the country as a result of the massive unflawed
character of the stone.

In May Mr. Holmes visited and examined a number of extensive quarries of novac-
ulite in Arkansas, one of which had been visited during the previous year. A great
quarry situated upon the summit of a long mountainous ridge at the head of Cove
Creek is the most extensive yet discovered in this country. The ancient excavations
extend along the crest of the ridge for several miles. The largest pits are still 25
feet deep and upwards of 100 feet in diameter. The product of this quarry was also
leaf-shaped blades of the type obtained from the other quarries, and closely analo-
gous in size, shape, and appearance to those of Flint Ridge, Ohio. Mr. Holmes next
passed north into Stone County, Mo., to visit a very large cave situated about
20 miles southeast of Helena, the county seat. Neither human remains nor works
of native art were found within the cave. The manufacture of chert implements
had been carried on extensively in the surrounding region. From Stone County he
went to southwest Minnesota, and spent ten days in the study of the red pipestone
quarry so famous in the history of the Coteau des Prairies. Evidence of the pre-
historic operation of this quarry was found in the series of ancient pits extending
across the prairie for nearly a mile in a narrow belt and following the cuterop of
the thin layer of pipestone.

The ancient copper mines of Isle Royale, Lake Superior, were next visited and
mapped, and extensive collections of stone hammers were obtained from the very
numerous pits and trenches.

Mr. Holmes then went west to Little Falls, Minn., to examine the losality from
which certain flaked quartz objects, supposed to be of paleolithic age had been
obtained. It was found that these bits of quartz were the refuse of the manufacture
of blades of quartz by the aborigines and at a period not necessarily more remote
than the period of quarry working already described.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, early in July, 1891, closed the field work on the Rio Verde,
in Arizona, an account of which was given in the last annual report, and returned to
Washington, after which time he was engaged for the remainder of the fiscal year in
office work.

Mr. Gerard Fowke completed the exploration of the James River and its northern
tributaries, making interesting discoveries in Botetourt, Bath, Alleghany, and High-
land counties. He then began an examination of the prehistorie remains of the
Shenandoah Valley, remaining in the field until December. Later he examined the
islands and coast between the Savannah and St. Johns rivers, locating mounds and
shell heaps. In the spring he resumed work in the Shenandoah Valley, making a
careful and thorough investigation of every county. The results show that this re-
gion was not the seat of any permanent occupation by the aborigines, though it
seems to have been a place of resort for hunters in large numbers.

Mr. William Dinwiddie was engaged during the year in mapping and examining
the shell banks and other aboriginal remains of the Potomac-Chesapeake region.

As Prof. Cyrus Thomas was engaged most of his time during the year in necessary
office work, his field work was limited. Vinding it desirable that more accurate
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

information in reference to certain ancient works in Vanderburg County, Ind.,
should be obtained, he engaged Mr. F. W. Wright to make a careful survey and
measurement of them. As the result showed that they were of unusual importance
on account of their peculiar character as compared with other ancient works of the
same section, Prof. Thomas thought it necessary to make a personal examination of
them, and did so. During the same trip he examined certain important mounds in
Illinois, among which was the noted ** Cahokia” or ‘‘Monk’s Mound,” of Madison
County. His object in this case was to ascertain the present condition of this re-
markable monument, and to investigate certain other points in relation to which
sdtisfactory conclusions could be reached only by personal inspection.

He also made during the summer another examination of the Newark works and
Fort Ancient, in Ohio, in order to settle some points which previous reports had
overlooked. At his suggestion the director had a resurvey made, under Mr. Gannett’s
direction, of the four most noted circles of the Ohio works, the plane table being
used to show their exact forin as they at present appear.

Mr. IF. H. Cushing, during the summer and autumn months of 1891, made some ex-
aminations on the shores of Lake Erie, near Buffalo, and of Lake Ontario in Orleans
County. N. Y., where he discovered pottery of the well-known net-impressed lacust-
rine or littoral type, and also, at the former point, some pits or slightly indurated
cavities in the sand, which he considered to be connected with the manufacture of
that pottery. By experiments made without the aid of modern appliances of any
kind he duplicated the ancient specimens found in the vicinity and showel that
these pits, lined with ordinary fishing nets, had actually been used simply and
effectively for shaping pottery. He has prepared an illustrated report giving the
details on the subject.

General field studies.—In August, 1891, Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson resumed her in-
vestigations into the mythology, religion, and sociology of the Zuni Indians, mak-
ing careful study of the shrine worship, which constitutes such an important feature
in the religion of those people. She added to the already valuable collection of
photographs and sketches of their sanctuaries, made in previous years by Mr. James
Stevenson, and by the aid of the war priest of Zuni, secured from the tribe some
interesting objects.

Through the influence of the war priest, the priest of the Ka-ka and theurgists of
the ‘‘medicine societies,” Mrs. Stevenson was able to be present at Zuni cere-
monials almost continuously from the time of her arrivalto her departure in March.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded early in August to the Menomonee Reservation, Wis-
consin, in response to an invitation from the Mitawok or chiefs of the Mitawit (or
“Grand Medicine Society”) of the Menomonee Indians, to observe the ritualistic cere-
monies and order of initiation of a new candidate for membership, for comparison
with similar ceremonials of other Algonquian tribes. In addition to the mythologic
material collected at this attendance, he also secured much valuable information re-
lating to the primitive customs and usages of the Menomonee for use in the prepara-
tion of a monogravh upon that people. Specimens of their workmanship were also
collected.

As he had been appointed a special agent for making ethnologic collections for the
exhibit to be made by the Bureau of Ethnology at the World’s Columbian Exposi-
tion, he secured a collection of Menomonee material, as well as a number of desired
objects at White Marth Reservation, Minnesota. In May, 1892, he visited the Crow
Agency, Mont., to procure a collection of articles to illustrate the industries and
workmanship of the Crow Indians. It was specially desirable to obtain some of the
elaborate clothing for which the tribe isremarkable. A unique series of articles was
obtained, after which a visit was made to the isolated band of Ojibwa at Leech Lake,
Minn, to collect various specimens desired to complete the collection illustrating
early Ojibwa history.

On his return, Dr. Hoffman again stopped at the Menomonee Reservation to make
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

final collections of ethnologic material and to complete his studies of the ritual and
initiatory ceremonies of the Grand Medicine Society, a meeting of which body had
been called for this special purpose. He returned to Washington in June, 1892.

Mr. James Mooney, during the field months of the fiscal year, continued the col-
lection for an exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposition, of objects to illustrate
the daily life, arts, dress, and ceremonies of the Kiowa in the southeastern part of the
Indian Territory. That tribe was selected as continuing in its primitive condition
more perfectly than any other which could be examined with profit. He succeeded
inmaking a tribal collection which is practically complete, including almost every
article in use among the Kiowas for domestic uses, and for war, ceremony, amuse-
ment, or dress. A number of illustrating photographs were also obtained. On his
return in August this collection was labeled and arranged in cases ready for trans-
portation to Chicago on the opening of the Exposition, and by means of the photo-
graphs and costumes obtained several groups of life-size figures were prepared to
show characteristic scenes in Indian life.

In November he again set forth to obtain additional information upon the ghost
dance, especially among the principal tribes not before visited. After a short stay
in Nebraska with the Omahas and Winnebagoes, neither of whom, as it was found,
had taken any prominent part in the dance, he went to the Sioux at Pine Ridge
Avency, 8. Dak., the chief seat of the late outbreak, where he collected a large
number of songs of the dance and much miscellaneous information on the sub-
ject. From there he went to the Pintes in Nevada, among whom the Messiah and
originator of the ghost dance resides. Here he obtained the statement of the doc-
trine from the lips of the Messiah himself, took his portrait, the only one ever taken,
and obtained a number of dance songs in the Piute language. He then returned to
the Cheyennes and Arapahoes in the Indian Territory, among whom he had begun
the study of the dance, and obtained from them the original letter which the Mes-
siah had given them, containing the authentic statement of his doctrine and the
manner in which they were to observe the ceremonial. He returned to Washington
in February.

In May he again started out to gather additional ethnologic material, especially
with regard to the Kiowas, and to obtain further collections for the World’s Co-
umbian Exposition. Going first to the Sioux, he proceeded next to the Shoshones
and Northern Arapahoes, in Wyoming, and then turned south to the Kiowas, in the
Indian Territory, where he was still at work at the close of the fiscal year.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw, on May 14, 1892, proceeded to New Mexico and California
for the purpose of pursuing certain linguistic investigations and to make collections
for the World’s Columbian Exposition. This duty was continued until the close of
the fiscal year.

Rey. J. Owen Dorsey, from January 14 to February 21, 1892, made a trip to Le-
compte, Rapides Parish, La., for the purpose of gaining information from the sur-
vivors of the Biloxi tribe. He found only one person, an aged woman, who spoke
the language in its purity, and two others, a man and his wife (the latter the
daughter of the old woman), whose dialect contains numerous modifications of the
ancient language. From these three persons he obtained several myths and other
texts in the Biloxi language, material for a Biloxi-English dictionary, local names,
personal names, names of clans, kinship terms, lists of flora and fauna, with their
Biloxi names, and grammatical notes. He filled many of the schedules of a copy of
the second edition of ‘ Powell’s Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages”
(English-Biloxi in this instance). He brought to Washington a few botanical speci-
mens, for which he had gained the Biloxi names, in order to obtain their scientific
names from the botanists of the Smithsonian Institution. He photographed three
Biloxi men and two women, all that could be found. There were about seven other

siloxi residing in the pine forest 6 or 7 miles from Lecompte, but they would not
be interviewed. The Biloxi language contains many words which resemble their
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

equivalents in other Sionan languages, some being identical in sound with the cor-
responding words in Dakota, Winnebago, ete. The Biloxi las more classifiers than
are found in the other languages of this family, and while it uses adverbs and con-
junctions, it often expresses a succession of actions by mere juxtaposition of two,
three, or more verbs. In the paueity of model prefixes it may be compared with
the Hidatsa and Tutelo, and in the use of d@" and t!® it may be classed with the
Kwapa and Hidatsa. The information now gained permits a tabular comparison of
the Biloxi with the Hidatsa, Winnebago, Catawba, and Tutelo, those five being re-
garded as the archaic languages of the Siouan family.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet, having met with little suecess in his previous attempt, in
1884, to study the Wichita language in the field, continued to watch for better oppor-
tunities. In 1892 he met twelve young men of that tribe in the Educational Home
(branch of the Lincoln Institute) at Philadelphia, and selected four of the brightest
of their number, who seemed to be the most promising through their advanced knowl-
edge of English. With their help he gathered about three thousand terms of Wich-
ita, which is a Caddoan dialect, also a large number of paradigms, sentences, and a
few mythological texts. A thorough interchangeability of the consonants makes the
study peculiarly difficult.

Maria Antonia, a young Costa Rica woman residing in Philadelphia, was questioned
concerning what she remembered of her native tongue, the Guatuso. About one
hundred and twenty vocables were recorded as the result of the inquiry. Mr.
Gatschet’s field work extended from the beginning of March to the beginning of
June, 1892.

OFFICE WORK,

The Director took special pains in the revision and correction of his work on the
“Indian Linguistic Families of America north of Mexico,” as it passed through the
press. The scope and importance of this linguistic Classification has before been
explained, and the paper forms part of the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau,
now issued,

Col. Garrick Mallery, U.S. Army, was chiefly occupied in writing in final form,
for publication in the Tenth Annual Report of the Bureau, a comprehensive paper
on the ‘ Picture Writing of the American Indians,” which presents the result of
several years of personal exploration and study of all accessible material on that
subject. At the close of the year, the manuscript and the drawings for the large
number of necessary illustrations had been transmitted through the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution to the Public Printer. Col, Mallery was also, during
the greater part of the year, charged with administrative duties and with the exe-
cution of a variety of special works under the instructions of the Director,

Mr. H. W. Henshaw, in addition to his usual administrative duties, when not in the
field as before mentioned, was employed in preparing the exhibit of the Bureau for
the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago and also in the preparation of the
forthcoming volume on ** Tribal Synonymy,” the purport and utility of which have
been explained in former reports. In this work Mr. Henshaw has had the assistance
of Mr. F. Webb Hodge, who has devoted special attention to the Piman, Yuman, and
the several Pueblo linguistic stocks.

The office work of Mr. W. H. Holmes consisted in the completion of papers upon
the pottery and shellwork of the aborigines of the United States. A third paper
was written upon the textile fabrics obtained from the mound region, and a fourth
upon the stone implements of the tide-water country. <A fifth paper upon the gen-
eral archieology of the region was commenced.

At the commencement of the official year Prof. Cyrus Thomas was engaged in ex-
amining and correcting the proof of his ‘Catalogue of Prehistoric Works East of
the Rocky Mountains,” which was published in the latter part of I891, as a Bulletin
of the Bureau. This examination involved in many cases the necessity of a reter-
ence to the authorities quoted.
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Much of his time during the year was employed in writing the final pages of the
report on the field work and explotations which for several years had been in his
charge, and in adapting it to a change in the form and manner of its publication
which had been made necessary. This involved the re-writing of many pages and
a material condensation of the introductory portion relating to the distribution of
types of mounds. It was completed by the close of the fiscal year and filed for pub-
lication, nearly all the illustrations having been drawn and prepared for engray-
ing.

He devoted all his spare time to the study of the Maya Codices and in the prepa-
ration of a report of the discoveries he made therein. One of these, which is deemed
of much interest and importance, is that, when the Dresden Codex, which is consid-
ered the most ancient of those known, was written, the year consisted of 565 days,
and that the calendar was arranged precisely as it was found to be by the Spanish
conquerors. But his most important discovery was made during the closing days
of the year. This consisted in what may be termed the discovery of the key to the
signification of the hieroglyphic characters of the Codices by which it is probable
that the inscriptions may ultimately be read. This discovery, which the tests so
far applied appear to confirm, consists, first, in the evidence that the characters as a
rule are phonetic and, second, in ascertaining the signification of a sufficient number
to form a basis for the interpretation of the rest. if this discovery proves to be
what, from the evidence presented, it appears to be, it will be of incaleulable im-
portance to American archeology.

Early in the year the work of Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff commenced in repairing and
securing the preservation of the Casa Grande ruin. This work was ordered by act
of Congress and plans had been prepared by Mr. Mindeleff while in Arizona during
the previous year. These plans provided for the excavation of the interior of the ruin,
the underpinning of the walls with brick and cement, the use of tie-beams to hold
the walls in place and render them more solid, the restoration of the lintels over door
and window openings, and the filling of the cavities above the lintels with brick
and cement. The work was completed in November and was inspected and ac-
cepted. Although all that was deemed necessary to preserve the ruin could not be
done with the appropriation provided, still it is believed that enough was done to
preserve it in its present condition for many years. All the work done was directed
to the preservation of the ruin, no attempt at restoration being made. In June,
1892, the President, in accordance with the authority vested in him by Congress,
reserved from settlement twelve quarter sections about the ruin, comprising an area
of about 480 acres. A number of specimens obtained during the excavation were
shipped to Washington and deposited in the National Museum.

During a part of the year Mr. Mindeleff was engaged in the preparation of a
report upon his field werk of the previous year. This report, entitled “Aboriginal
Remains in the Valley of the Rio Verde, Arizona,” was completed and will appear in
the Twelfth Annual Report of the Bureau. Aside from a comprehensive treatment of
the ruins in the valley of the Verde the report will contain the first illustrations
published of ancient irrigating ditches, and the first comprehensive data, including
illustrations of cevate lodges. It is fully illustrated from photographs, plans, and
surveys made by the author, Subsequently he commenced a scientific report on
the Casa Grande ruin of Arizona.

No new work was undertaken in the modelling room during the year, as the entire
force was occupied upon the preparation of duplicates of models previously made,
for use at the World’s Coiumbian Exposition and elsewhere. Six models, in addi-
tion to other material, were sent to Spain, to be exhibited at the historical exposi-
tion at Madrid. The series comprised models of the Pueblo of Zuni, New Mexico,
the Pueblo of Walpi, Arizona, Mummy Cave cliff ruin, Arizona, all of Jarge size, and
three smaller models of ruins.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

An indetinite leave of absence without pay was granted to Mr. Frank H. Cushing
in December, 1886, in order that he might organize and conduct the important ex-
plorations in southern Arizona and the Zuni country of the Southwestern Archwo-
logical Expedition established by Mrs. Mary Hemenway, of Boston. His successful
fulfillment of this work was suddenly interrupted in the winter of 1889 by a severe
and prostrating illness, which disabled him until the summer of 1891. He
was therefore unable to resume promised work on his older Zuni material for the
Bureau until August, 1891, when he began the preparation of a contribution in-
tended to appear in the Twelfth Annual Report of the Bureau, on the Zuni myths of
creation and migration as related to the mythie drama-dance organization, or Kaka
of the Zunis, and the so-called Cachina ceremonials of all Pueblo and other south-
western tribes. Mr. Cushing’s discoveries as set forth in this essay confirm and
substantiate the opinion held by the Director that all primitive so-called dance cer-
emonials are essentially dramatic, and they go so far as to indicate also that all
primitive ceremonials, of whatever nature, are essentially dramaturgic, thus making
his contribution of general as well as of special significance.

In January, 1892, Mr. Cushing again reported at Washington and was regularly
engaged as an ethnologist of the Bureau on the Ist of February, and has since been
occupied in elaborating his paper on the myths of the drama dances and on a
study of manual concepts or the influence of primitive hand-usages on mental de-
velopment in the culture growth of mankind.

Mrs. Stevenson returned from the field work before mentioned in March, 1892, and
was employed for the remainder, of the fiscal year in preparing her field notes for
publication. .

Mr. Gerard Fowke was engaged during December and January in preparing a re-
port of the season’s work by hin in archeology, arranging and classifying the speci-
mens procured, and embodying in reports, previously prepared, the results of recent
discoveries.

The office work of Dr. Hoffman consisted in arranging the material gathered dur-
ing the preceding field season and in preparing for publication an account of the
Midéwiwin, or so-called “Grand Medicine Society,” of the Ojibwa Indians of White
Earth, Minnesota. This work, which forms one of the papers accompanying the
Seventh Annual Report, embraces new material and consists of the traditions of the
Indian cosmogony and genesis of mankind, the ‘materia medica” of the shamans,
and the ritual of initiation, together with the musieal notation of the chants and
songs used.

During the winter and spring months a delegation of Menomonee Indians from Wis-
consin visited Washington and Dr. Hoffman frequently conversed with them to ob-
tain information explanatory of the less known practices of the Menomonee ceremony
of the Mitawit, or their “Grand Medicine Society,” for the purpose of comparison
with the ritual as observed by the Ojibwa. In addition a large mass of mythologic
material was obtained, as well as texts in the Menomonee language.

On returning from the field in August 1891, Mr. James Mooney spent about ten
weeks in arranging his Kiowa collection for the World’s Columbian Exposition,
writing out a series of descriptive labels, and in copying all the more important
documents relating to the “ ghost dance” from the files of the Indian Office and the
War Department. He then again went out into the field, as above stated, returning
to Washington in February 1892. About three months were then occupied in ar
ranging the material thus obtained and in writing the preliminary chapters of his
report on the ghost dance. He also superintended the preparation, at the National
Museum, of a number of groups of life-size figures to accompany the Kiowa collec-
tion at the World’s Fair.

Rey. J. Owen Dorsey continued the arrangement of Kwapa texts with interlinear
and free translations and critical notes. He revised the proof of ‘* Omaha and Panka
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Letters,” a bulletin prepared trom (egiha texts collected by himself. He finished
the collation of all the Tutelo words recorded by Dr. Hale, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, and
himself, with the result that he had 775 words in the Tutelo-English dictionary.
Ife furnished a list of several hundred linguistic and sociologic questions to be used
among Indian tribes, These questions were in addition to those contained in the
second edition of Powell’s Introduction to the Study of Indian Languages and were
based on original investigations made by Mr. Dorsey among the Siouan tribes. He
prepared for publication the following articles: Siouan Onomatopes (sound-roots),
illustrated by charts; The Social Organization of Siouan Tribes, illustrated by fig-
ures consisting chiefly of material gained by himself from the Dakota tribes, the
Omaha, Ponka, Kwapa, Osage, Kansa, lowa, Oto, Missouri, Winnebago, and Tutelo;
Nanibozhu in Siouan Mythology; Games of Teton Dakota Children (translated and
arranged from the original Teton manuscript in the Bushotter collection of the
Bureau of Ethnology).

After his return from Louisiana he devoted most of his time to the arrangement of
the material collected in his Biloxi note-books. He prepared a Biloxi-English dic-
tionary of 3,183 words on about 7,000 slips in alphabetic order. He arranged the
Biloxi texts for publication, adding to the myths (with their interlinear and free
English translations and critical notes) a list of several hundred Biloxi phrases.
In his article on the Biloxi kinship system, he gave 53 kinship groups, of which
number only 27 have their counterparts in the Dakota, (egiha, and other Siouan
languages of the Missouri valley. The elaboration of all the Biloxi material could
not be completed by June 30, 1892.

Mr. Albert S. Gatschet assisted in augmenting and improving the data for the
Tribal Synonymy now in preparation, by extracting material from a number of
books and original reports especially referring to southern and southwestern In-
dians. Hismain work during the year was directed towards extracting and arrang-
ing some of the more extensive vocabularies made by him previously in the field.
After completing the Tonkawe of Texas, he carded each word of the Shawano and
Creek languages obtained by him, copied the historical and legendary texts of both,
and extracted the lexical and grammatic elements from them toe serve as the ground-
work for future grammars. The remains of the Virginia or Powhatan languages
that are known were also made accessible by carding the terms.

During the fiscal year Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt wasa part of the time engaged in careful
study of the grammatic forms of the Iroquoian languages, especially in the ascer-
tainment of the number and order in which the affixes may be used with one and
the same stem or base. He was also engaged in translating, extracting, and trans-
ferring to library cards, from the ‘ Découvertes et Etablissements des Frangais dans
VAmérique septentrionale,” by Pierre Margry, matter relating to the manners, cus-
toms, beliefs, rights, ceremonies, and history of the Iroquois, which matter is now
placed on about 20,000 cards.

He continued his work on the Tuscarora Dictionary and directed attention to de-
veloping the full number of ordinary sentences in which every generic noun may
be employed, which affords a measure of the capacity of the vocabulary for the ex-
pression of thought.

Mr. James C. Pilling continued his bibliographic work throughout the year, with
special attention to the Athapascan family. Work upon this family was begun
early in the fiscal year, on October 13 the manuscript was sent to the printer, and
at the close of the year but a few pages of the final proofs remained unread. The
Bibliography of the Athapascan Languages forms a pamphlet of xiii+125 pages.
While this volume was being put in type Mr. Pilling began the collection of mate-
rial for a number of bibliographies relating to the languages of the northwest coast _
of America—the Chinookan, Salishan, and Wakashan, and satisfactory progress has |
been made, Probably one or more of them will beready to send to the printer dur-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. HT

ing the coming autumn. During the month of May, 1892, Mr. Pilling made a brief
visit to libraries in Boston and Cambridge in connection with the compilation of ma-
terial relating to these northwest languages.

Mr. De Lancey W. Gill continued in charge of the work of preparing and editing
the illustrations for the publications of the Bureau,

The total number of illustrations prepared during the year was 980. These draw-
ings may be classified as follows:

The number of illustration proofs handled during the year was as follows: Eighth
Annual Report, 308; Ninth Annual Report, 459; 678 illustrations for the Tenth An-
nual Report were transmitted to the Public Printer.

The photographic laboratory remains under the able management of Mr. J. K.
Hillers. A small but valuable collection of portraits of North American Indians
was secured by him during the year from sittings; twenty-six negatives were ob-
tained. The following table shows the size and number of photographic prints
made:

APPENDIX IT.

REPORT OF THI CURATOR OF EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING

EXPENSES.

The expenses of the exchange bureau are met in part by direct appropriation by
Congress and in part by appropriations made to Government Departments or
Bureaus, either in their contingent funds or in specified terms for repayment to the
Smithsonian Institution of a portion of the cost of transportation. In 1878 the
Board of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for the publica-
tions sent out or received by the various Government bureaus, this charge being
necessary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution, as the ap-
propriations made by Congress have never been sufficient to meet the entire cost of
the service. For similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of
the same amount to State institutions, and from these a further small sum has been
received.

The appropriation made by Congress for the fiscal year 1891-’92 was in the follow-
ing terms :

For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States

and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, seventeen thousand dollars.

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian
Institution on account of international exchanges, under date of July 1, 1892, and
covering the fiscal year immediately preceding, were as follows :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

The foregoin9 table shows that the entire amount received from Government bu-
reau and others was $2,139.19, making the sum practically available for the specitic
purpose of exchanges $19,159.19, while the expenses have amounted to $20,310.49, the
deficiency of $1,171.30 being made up from the Smithsonian fund.

The advantages have been pointed out in previous reports of combining in a single
item the various appropriations for the exchange service, now divided into compar-
atively small sums among the several larger appropriation bills of the Government,
but the matter seems to be of sufficient importance to call attention to if again in
this place.

For the year 1891-’92 an estimate for the entire expense of the service of $23,000
was submitted, this sum being intended to include these smaller amounts alluded to,
and also an item of $2,000 to cover the expense of an immediate exchange of parlia-
mentary documents with the countries entering into the treaty of Brussels in 1886,
The amount appropriated was $17,000, the same as that for the preceding year.

CORRESPONDENCE,

The name of each person or institution sending or receiving publications through
the exchange bureau was heretofore entered upon a large ledger card, showing all
such packages received or sent. This system has proved itself of great convenience,
but with the large increase in the number of cards the space occupied has become
of serious moment, and it was therefore found desirable to begin a new series of
cards, of smaller size, entering in an abbreviated form the recetpts from correspond-
ents upon a blue card, while the packages forwarded to these correspondents are
entered upon a white card. Thissystem was put in operation January 1, 1892, and
during the six months succeeding, 9,808 cards of the new form have been prepared,
representing the number of correspondents with whom communication has been had
during that period. There have been added to the list of correspondents during the
year 1,834 names.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

Under the treaty alluded to in the Secretary’s report for 1887-’88, the exchange of
the official publications of the United States Government with other governments
has been continued by the Smithsonian Institution, and it now forms a very large
proportion of the bureau’s work.

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the provision
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, ana of the treaty above referred to, wis
27,873, and there have been received in return 1,941 packages or volumes. The
United States Government Departments have forwarded to their correspondents
abroad 20,575 packages, and have received in return 13,000 packages. The total
number of exchanges on Government account has been 14,941 received and 52,783
packages sent abroad. ‘There have, therefore, been « total of 67,724 packages, or
about 70 per cent of the total number handled.

Adding this to the number of miscellaneous packages the total of 97,027 packages,
weighing 113 tons, has passed through the bureau. i

EFFICIENCY

or

THE SERVICE.

Tt is, perhaps, desirable to rehearse brietly here the method of receiving and hand-
ling exchange packages received by the Institution.
Scientific societies and individuals in the United States desiring to forward their

publications abroad send them to the Smithsonian Institution, where a record is
kept of the number of packages received, under the sender’s name, and also a record
showing each person or institution to which a copy of the work in question is trans-
mitted. The books are then packed, with invoices from other senders, and for-
warded by freight to the Government bureau abroad which has undertaken the
task of distributing all exchange packages in that country. The books are for-

warded direct to the paid agents of the Institution, if in Great Britain or Germany,
.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

by whom they are distributed by mail or express, the Institution assuming the cost
of transportation to the distributing agents, and in the case of its special agent the
cost is further defrayed to the recipient when practicable. Because of the lack of
Sufficient funds transportation is efiected by slow freight, and the governmental
bureau of the United States or other correspondents of the Institution can not expect
their publications to be delivered with the same promptness with which they may be
sent by mailor by express. The transmissions are especially slow to foreign countries
with which we have comparatively infrequent communication. To England and
Germany, where, as before stated, the agencies are under control andl pay of the
Smithsonian Institution, and to France, cases are dispatched on the average about
three times a month.

Special care is taken to insure the safe delivery of the package to the person ad-
dressed, and the cases of failure constitute but a small percentage of the entire num-
ber ef packages handled. Some errors are inevitable unless the greatest care is ex-
ercised by the sender in securing the proper address of his correspondents.

With each package sent out a receipt card is forwarded requesting acknowledg-
ment thereon of the package in question, and when this receipt is placed in the files
of the exchange office the record of that particular package is complete.

Transmissions from abroad received by freight in large cases are distributed in the
United States by registered mail, a record tirst having been made of the name of the
sender aniLof the recipient of each package. <A receipt card, returnable by mail
without postage, is sent with each of these packages, and should be returned at
ouce by the recipient in acknowledgment of the package, otherwise further trans-
missions to that address can not be made. It should be borne in mind that as no
record is made of the title of the book contained in each package, it is not always
possible to trace a given work unless the date of ifs dispatch to the exchange office
is known.

I give this account of the working of the Exchange Service, as Tam led to beheve
froma number of inquiries with reference to this Bureau that it is not thoroughly
understood by all who have had occasion to make use of it.

Iam gratified to state that, the recommendation for additional assistance con-
tained in previous reports having been approved, it has been possible to bring the
records and files into a much more satisfactory state than heretofore, as, owing to
the insufficient clerical force, the work has been for several years past somewhat in
arrears. By the adoption of new and abbreviated forms for records the clerical work
has been materially decreased without the sacrifice of accuracy, though in spite of
this reduction in the work and the increase of the force it is only now possible to keep
the work of the Bureau well up to date. This, I think, will readily be understood
if it is remembered that since 1886 the number of packages accounted for has been
nearly doubled.

Six thousand four hundred and sixty-one more packages were handled in 1891-92
than in the previous year, and on June 30, 1892, there were but 102 packages on
hand to be disposed of.

The increased number of shipments to the principal foreign countries has been
maintained, as shown in the tables appended as Exhibit A. A further improvement
in this direction can be looked for only when the appropriations made by Congress
become sufficient to enable the Institution to pay for fast freight. As it is now,
free freight is granted by a majority of the ocean steamship companies to the Smith-
sonian Institution in its endeayor to increase and diffuse knowledge among men,
while full rates would be charged to the United States Government for a similar
service; an:l where the privilege of free freight has not been secured the exchange
boxes are sent by slow steamers or by sailing vessels offering low rates.

I take pleasure in bearing witness to the conscientious efliciency of the employes
of the Exchange Office, and I beg leave to express my appreciation of the careful
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

attention to the interests of the Bureau on the part of its special agents abroad,
Doctor Felix Fliigel, in Leipzig, and Messrs. Willian Wesley & Son, in London.

Grateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation companies
and firms for their continued liberality in granting free freight, or in otherwise
assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while to other firms
thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of the disinter-
ested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 6

APPENDIX III.

REPORT OF THE ACTING MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Str: Thave the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zodlogical Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892:

At the close of the last year the park had but just been oceupied by the animals
of the collection.. The experience of the present season has been valuable as indi-
cating the lines along which development should proceed.

The main road having been laid out, the permanent locations for the animals
were established at convenient distances near it. The bridge across the creek was
contracted to be built, and a temporary bridge established until such time as the
permanent structure should be completed. The work of completing the bear yards
was also continued.

On September 5, a disastrous rain storm occurred, during which Rock Creek, the
small stream that flows through the park rose toa height nearly equalling that which
it reached at the time of the famous Johnstown flood in 1890. The rise was extra-
ordinarily rapid, being, according to the watchmen of the park, at the rate of 6 feet
within two hours. Within a short time a cavity 10 feet deep was excavated by the
stream alongside of one of the bridge piers, undermining one of its corners, the
temporary bridge was swept away, a large quantity of earth and rock was precipi-
tated from the cliff above into the bear pits, the banks of the creek were eroded and
a considerable amount of filling washed away, and the roads and gutters of the
park recently laid were cut out and injured to a very great extent. The cost of
repairing the damages thus occasioned was nearly $5,000, a sui that could not well
be spared from the scanty appropriation, and the loss embarrassed the park very
seriously during the entire season.

The bridge pier damaged by the storm was rebuilt and this delayed the final com-
pletion of the bridge, which was not finally opened for travel until about October 1.

For the same reason the occupation of the bear yards was postponed until a retain-
ing wall much larger and stronger than had been anticipated could be built, it be-
ing considered dangerous to place the animals in yards where some tons of rock and
earth might fall after any serious storm.

The main animal house, although far from complete, was hastily prepared for the
reception of animals by closing it up with temporary work and substituting for the
metal roof designed by the architect a felt roof of cheap construction. The comple-
tion of the tower at the eastern end was deferred until more funds should be ayail-
able.

As soon as the cooler autumn weather set in the number of visitors to the park
greatly increased. There was during each Sunday of October and until nearly the
last of November an average attendance of about 7,000 people each Sunday, the
number reaching over 10,000 on some particularly fine days. The daily attendance
during the week was considerably less.

This large influx of visitors tested the arrangements which had been made, and
they were found wanting in several respects. The bridge was found to be too nar-
row and dangerous for foot passengers. The road was in some localities so narrow
that it became inconveniently and dangerously crowded. The number of watchmen
was found to be entirely inadequate, and the crowd was so great in the principal
animal house as to be extremely uncomfortable.
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

To remedy this state of affairs it seemed necessary to place footways upon the
bridge, to relieve the main roadway by making side roads and walks, to enlarge the
ground plan of the animal house, and to provide more ample means of exit. It
seemed best also to remove from the house as many animals as could be properly ac-
commodated in quarters outside, both for the convenience of the public and the health
of the animals.

The limited means at the disposal of the park did not permit the full completion
of this plan. New roadways were eut out and new sidewalks built, an addition to
the animal house was commenced in the shape of a large wooden shed situated on
the north side. None of these were entirely completed at the close of the fiscal year.

A grading plan for a portion of the park was furnished by Mr. F. L. Olmsted.
This contemplated the excavation of a large pend for aquatic animals upon the
meadow west of the bridge, the shaping up of the banks of the creek and their pro-
tection from erosion by means of riprap and the formation of a smaller pond to the
north of the road near the main entrance. But little of this could be done during
the year, the expenses of preparing the winter quarters of the animals being such
that all surplus funds were exhausted. It was indeed found necessary to limit the
expenditures to the barest necessities, and although an additional appropriation of
$1,000 was made by Congress it was with difficulty that the park was maintained
until the end of the year. The force of employés was reduced to the lowest possi-
ble number, and every device was used to insure the strictest and most parsimonious
economy.

The scantiness of the resources of the park made it necessary to postpone any pur-
chases of animals, and the collection has therefore increased but slowly. There were
on June 30, 448 living animals in the collection, ef which 320 were mammals, 63 birds,
and 65 reptiles. A catalogue of the additions made is appended hereto. Ninety-six
animals have been presented to the park during the year, of which 45 were mam-
mals, 26 birds, and 27 reptiles.

The insufficient nature of the temporary quarters in which it has been necessary to
keep the animals has led to a considerable mortality. Besides this, it is found that
many specimens do not survive the fatigue and excitement of the journey necessary to
reach the park, and they succumb shortly after their arrival here. The most alarm-
ing mortality has been that of the bears, two of which died from injuries received, two
others from pulmonary trouble. While the bear yards are certainly picturesque and
effective from the landscape architect’s point of view, it is believed that they are not
now proper sanitary dwellings for the animals, as they are constantly damp, are too
cold in winter and too hot in summer. It is intended to take measures to remedy
their defects.

Owing to the small number of watchmen necessarily employed, one of the bears
escaped by climbing up a nearly perpendicular wall over 50 feet high. He was pur-
sued and an attempt was made to capture him, This was, however, unsuccessful and
it was found necessary, finally, to shoot him.

The elephants have continued constantly to gain in weight since arriving at the
park. “Dunk” now weighs 7,260 pounds, having gained 1,110 pounds. ‘Golddust”’
weighs 4,920 pounds, having gained 860 pounds.

74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

APPENDIX IY.
REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1892.

Str: I have the honor to submit herewith the report on the library of the Smith-
sonian Institution during the year ending June 30, 1892.

The operations of the library have been conducted as in the two preceding years.
The entry numbers in the accession book extend from 225,586 to 246,109.

Following is a statement of the volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts
received during the year:

Publications received between July 1, 1891, and June 50, 1892.

Of these publications, 297 volumes, 6,363 parts of volumes, and 774 pamphlets—
7,434 in all—were retained for use in the National Museum.

Light hundred and fifty-seven medical dissertations were deposited in the library
of the Surgeon-General, U.S. Army; the remaining publications were sent to the
Library of Congress on the Monday after their receipt.

In carrying out the plans formulated by the Secretary for increasing the library by
exchanges, 803 letters asking for publications not on our list, or asking for numbers
to complete the series already in the library, have been written. As a result of this
correspondence it gives me pleasure to report that 444 new exchanges were acquired
by the Institution, while 220 defective series were completed either wholly or as far
as the publishers were able to supply missing parts.

Below is a comparative statement of the operations of the library since June 30,

1889:

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1892,

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific diseov-
ery in particular directions; occasional reperts of the investigations
made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general charae-
ter or on Special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the
purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and brietly
to present (as fully as space will permit) sueh papers uot published in
the Smithsonian Contributions or in the Miscellaneous Collections as
may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

it has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remark-
able and important deyelopments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an Interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoblogy, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (Some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and diseus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1892,

THE METEOROLOGICAL WORK OF THE SMITHSONIAN IN-
STITUTION.*

The Smithsonian Institution has always made it a rule of action to
undertake such lines of work as point the way to great public utilities,
and these have subsequently been made the function of useful govern-
ment bureaus of applied science.

This is notably true in the case of meteorology, which was developed
by the Institution in both its scientific and its popular aspects, until its
importance became so well understood, and its utility so widely ap-
preciated, that in 1870, Congress made it the duty of the Chief Signal
Officer of the U. S. Army to observe and report storms for the benefit
of commerce and agriculture.

The interest of the Sminithsonian Institution in meteorology began
with the organization of its work by its first secretary, Prof. Joseph
Henry, in 1847, and from that time to the present—nearly half a cen-
tury—meteorological science has been granted an important share ofits
labors and expenditure.

In his “ programme of organization, ” submitted on the 8th of Decem-
ber, 1847, in giving examples of objects for which appropriations might
properly be made, the Secretary mentioned first, and urged upon the
immediate attention of the Institution, a ‘system of extended meteor-
ological observations for solving the problem of American storms. ”
This clear appreciation of the existing state of knowledge, and of the
utilities to be gained, are set forth in the following words, with which
he commends this undertaking :

Of late years, in our country, more additions have been made to meteorology than
to any other branch of physical science. Several important generalizations have
been arrived at, and definite theories proposed, which now enable us to direct our
attention, with scientific precision, to such points of observation as can not fail to
reward us withnew andinteresting results. It is proposed to organize a system of ob-
servations which shall extend as far as possible over the North American continent.
The present time appears to be peculiarly auspicious for commencing an enterprise
of the proposed kind. The citizens of the United States are now scattered over
every part of the southern and western portions of North America, and the extended
lines of the telegraph will furnish a ready means of warning the more northern and
eastern observers to be on the watch for the first appearance of an advancing storm.

In the inauguration of this system of observations, Prof. Henry so-
licited the suggestions of the most experienced American meteorolo-
gists—Espy, Loomis, and Guyot—who extended their cordial co-opera-
tion.

90 METEOROLOGICAL WORK OF SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Accompanying the above-quoted presentation of his programme the
Secretary published a valuable, and now historic, report by Prof.
Loomis upon the meteorology of the United States, in which he showed
what advantage society might expect from the study of storms, what
had been already done in this country toward making the necessary
observations, and, finally, what encouragement there was to a further
prosecution of the same researches. He then presented in detail a plan
for unifying all the work done by existing observers, and for supple-
menting it by that of new observers at needed points, for a systematie
supervision, and, finally, for a thorough discussion of the observations
collected.

On the 13th of December, 1847, the Board of Regents adopted the
“programme of organization,” and on the 15th inaugurated the sys-
tem of meteorological observations by an appropriation of $1,000 for
the purchase of instruments and other related expenses.

In the following year (1848) Prof. Espy, who was then the official
meteorologist of the Navy Department, was assigned to duty under the
direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. In connee-
tion with Espy, the Secretary (Henry) addressed a circular letter to all
persons who would probably be disposed to take part in the contem-
plated systems of observations, and co-operation was solicited from the
existing systems under the direction of the Surgeon-General, and of
the States of New York and Pennsylvania. As aresult of these efforts
the Institution at the close of 1849, already had one hundred and fifty
daily observers, and the number continued to increase.

In order to unify the methods adopted by observers, Prof. Guyot
was requested to prepare a pamphlet of Directions for Meteorological
Observations,* which was published in 1850, and to compile a collee-
tion of Meteorological Tables, which was published as a volume of the
Miscellaneous Collections in 1852. In 1857, after careful revision by
the author, a second and much enlarged edition of the Tables was pub-
lished, and in 1859, a third, with further amendments. <Aithough de-
signed primarily for the meteorological observers reporting to the
Smithsonian Institution, the Tables obtained a much wider circulation,
and were extensively used by meteorologists and physicists in Europe
and the United States. An important step taken at the inception of
the Smithsonian system was the introduction of accurate instruments.
Standard barometers and thermometers were imported from Paris and
London, with which those made for the use of the Institution were
compared, and sets of such apparatus were furnished to observers.

In 1849, Prof. Henry personally requested the telegraph companies to

direct their operators to replace in their regular morning dispatches
the signal, “O. K.,” by which they were accustomed to announce that
their lines were in order, by such words as “fair,” “cloudy,” ete., thus
giving, without additional trouble, and as concisely as possible, a sum-
mary of the condition of the weather at the different stations, which
should be communicated to lim. This request was complied with, and
such elementary telegraphic weather reports were thus furnished the
Institution daily, without charge. This action of Prof. Henry, which
has sometimes been erroneously ascribed to Prof. Espy, was the be-
ginning of telegraphic weather service, nothing of the kind having
been attempted in Europe until a later date, and by means of these re-
ports predictions of coming storms, with all the now recognized advan-
tage to the country at large, were made possible. With the material
thus obtained the Institution was enabled in 1850, to coustruct the first
current weather map, giving daily, from “live data,” the meteorological
conditions over the whole country. This map was hung where the pub-
lic could have general access to it to observe the changes, and its ind1-
‘ations were first published at large by signals displayed from the high
tower of the Institution. This method was followed, and further ex-
tended, by publications in the Washington Hvening Star in 1857, and
such general interest was manifested in the subject that telegraphic
weather reports were thereafter furnished to the Star for daily publi-
cation. The systematic notification of the general public by the press
and otherwise of weather observations, appears, then, to have been
undoubtedly due to Henry, and unquestionably to have preceded by a
year a similar publication in 1858, of Leverrier, to whom this pioneer
step has been erroneously attributed.

In 1858, the meteorological map already in use was improved by the
adoption of circular disks of different colors, which were attached to it
by pins at each station of observation, and indicated by their color
the state of the atmosphere—white signifying clear weather; gray,
cloudy; black, rain, ete. The disks had an arrow stamped upon them,
and as they were so arranged that they could be attached to the map in
any direction, the motion of the wind at each station was shown by them,
and the * probabilities” thus more accurately forecast.

The study of the meteorological data, begun in 1849, continued under
the direction of the Institution for twenty-five years, during which time
numerous publications were issued relative to temperature, rainfall,
hygrometry, and casual phenomena, while popular information was con-
tinuously disseminated by publishing telegraphic weather reports, maps,
etc. Among the associates of the Institution in this branch of investi-
gation may be mentioned Prof. Espy, and later, Prof. J. H. Coffin, Mr.
©. A. Schott, and others. Their work may be concisely described as
follows: Prof. Espy utilized the already collected data in the prepa-

‘ation of his Third and Fourth Meteorological Reports. After the
92 METEOROLOGICAL WORK OF SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Smithsonian observations were practically completed, Mr. Schott* took
the data and prepared elaborate tables of temperature and precipita-
tion, Which were published in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl-
edge.

Prof. Coffint compiled his great work on the laws of the winds, and
contributed various lesser works to the bibliography of the Institution
on meteorological subjects.

The first collection of meteorological tables compiled by Dr. Guyot,
at the request of the Institution, was published in 1852, as a volume of
the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, and new editions were pub-
lished in 1857, and 1859, Twenty-five years later the work was again
revised, and a fourth edition was published (1884). The demand for
these tables exhausted this edition in a few years; it was then de-
cided to re-cast the work entirely, and publish it in three parts, one of
meteorological, one of geographical, and one of physical tables, each
representative of the latest knowledge in its field, and independent of
the others, but the three forming a homogeneous series.

The desirability of establishing a meteorological department under
one comprehensive system, with an adequate appropriation of funds,
was frequently urged by the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1869 an
appropriation of $25,000 was made by Congress for the adoption and
maintenance of a code of weather signals on the northern lakes, under
the direction of the Chief of the Signal Corps of the United States
Army. The Government having thus evinced a willingness to take
charge of the meteorological system of the country, and it being the
policy of the Institution to do nothing which could be accomplished as
well by other means, the work of the Smithsonian in this direction was
freely relinquished by the Institution, although its formal transfer to
the War Department did not take place until 1874.

During the period when the Smithsonian was directly in charge of
meteorological researches in the United States, its expenditures in
this connection, which had been voluntarily assumed, were over $60,000.
In addition to this the Institution made a contribution of inealculable
value in the stimulus given to investigations of this class by the active
personal interest of its first Secretary, who always devoted much time

and tnought to this subject, while even after the transfer of the Smith-
sonian system to the War Department, the discussion and publication
of the material already accumulated was continued by the Institution.

The Smithsonian Institution may, then, be termed the parent of the
present Weather Bureau.

In 1891, the present Secretary (Mr. 8S. P. Langley) deposited in the
United States Signal Office all the voluminous monthly records of the
Institution, and all the manuscript and printed observations and con-
tributions relating to meteorology, subject to recall, but with the un-
derstanding that the entire official record of research and progress in
this connection should be preserved intact by the Bureau which now
has these investigations in charge.
THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE.*

By Prof. C. 8S. Hastines, Yale University.

There is no instrument which has done so much to widen the scope
of human knowledge, to extend our notions of the universe, and to stim-
ulate intellectual activity as has the telescope, unless the microscope
be regarded as a successful rival. But even admitting a parity in
scientific Importance, the former instrument is incomparably more
interesting in its history, in the same degree that its history is more
simple and more comprehensible. To trace its development from a
curious toy in the hands of its discoverer, for we shall see that this term
is more appropriate than inventor, to the middle of this century, is to

time of the Renaissance, who have achieved greatness in physical
science, Galileo, Torricelli, Huygheus, Cassini, Newton, Halley, Kepler,

from only a portion of the list of great names. Its growth toward per-
fection has constantly carried with 1t increased precision in the applied
sciences of navigation and of all branches of engineering. It would be
easy to show that even pure mathematics would be in a far less forward
state had there been no problems of astronomy and physics which were
first suggested by the employment of the telescope. It is to this his-
tory that I venture to invite your attention this evening. I purpose to
review succinctly the origin and development of this potent aid in the
study of nature, to name some of the more important achievements de-
pending upon it, and to trace its gradual improvement to the magnifi-
cent and complicated instrument which constitutes the modern equa-
torial, After this sketch I shall try to give an idea of the imperfections
which the conscientious artisan has to contend with in attaining per-
fection, and to make clear the methods which have been employed in
reducing these imperfections in the noble instrument now erected at
this institution,t and explain why its possegsors are so hopeful of grat-
ifying success.

Q6 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE.

Galileo learned in 1609, while visiting Venice, that a marvellous in-
strument had been invented the preceding year in Holland, which
would enable an observer to see a distant object with the same distinct-
ness as if it were only at asmall fraction of its real distance. It required
but little time for the greatest physicist of his age to master the prob-
lem thus suggested to his mind, and after his return to Padua, where he
held the position of professor of mathematics in the famous university
of that city, he set himself earnestly to work making telescopes. Such
was his success that in August of the same year he sent to the Vene-
tian senate a more perfect instrument than they had been able to pro-
cure from Holland; and in January of the next year, by means of a
telescope magnifying thirty times, he discovered the four satellites of
Jupiter. This brilliant discovery was followed by that of the mountains
in the moon; of the variable phases of Venus, which established the
Copernican theory of the solar system as incontestible, and of the true
nature of the Milky Way, together with many others of less philosoph-
ical importance. Though Galileo did not change the character of the
telescope as it was known to its discoverer in Holland, he made it
much more perfect; and above all, made the first and most fertile ap-
plication of the instrument to increase the bounds of human knowledge,
so that it is inevitable that his name should be indissolubly connected
with the instrument. Thus the form which he used is to this day
known as the Galilean telescope.

Considering the enormous interest excited throughout intellectual
Europe by the invention of the telescope, it seems surprising that its
early history is so confused. Less than two years after it was first
heard of, a discovery, perhaps the greatest of a thousand years in the
domain of natural philosophy, had been made by its means. Notwith-
standing these facts, the three contemporary, or nearly contemporary,
investigators assign the honor to three different persons, and if we
should write out the names of all those to whom more modern writers
have attributed the invention, the list would be a long one. The sur-
prise will not be boundless, however, if we consider the task before a
historian in the next century who undertakes to justly apportion the
honor of the invention of the telephone among its numerous claimants.
The analogy, though suggested in the obvious fact that the telephone
is to hearing just what the telescope is to sight, may be made much
closer if we could imagine the future historian deprived of all but verbal
description, that contemporary diagrams and models were wholly want-
ing. Under such conditions it is difficult to believe that the historian
would easily escape ante-dating the discovery of the telephone proper
on account of descriptions, generally imperfect, of the acoustic tele-
phone. But this would fairly represent the condition of the material
at the command of an investigator of the present day into a question
of science of the early part of the seventeenth century. No wonder,
then, that the invention has been attributed to Archimedes, to Roger

THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 97

Bacon, to Porta, and to many others who have written on optics; but
te find the name of Satan in the list is certainly surprising. Still we
read that a very learned man of the seventeenth century, named Arias
Montanus, finds in the fourth chapter of Matthew, eighth verse, evi-
dence that Satan possessed, and probably invented, a telescope; other-
wise, how could he have “shown him all the kingdoms of the world
and the glory of them”?* It seems to be well established now, how-
ever, that Franz Lippershey, or Lippersheim, a spectacle maker at
Middleburg, was the real inventor of the telescope, and that Galileo’s
first telescope, avowedly suggested by news of the Hollander’s achieve-
ment, was an independent invention.

That this discovery was really an accident we may be quite sure,
for not only was there no developed theory of optics at that time, but
even the law of refraction, which lies at the basis of such theory, was
quite unknown. So, too, it seems to me quite certain that Galileo’s
invention must have been empirical and guided by somewhat precise
information, such as that the instrument consisted essentially of two
lenses, of which one was a magnifying and the other a diminishing
lens. At least, that Galileo’s telescope was like that of the Hollander;
that, theoretically considered, it is not so simple as that made of two
magnifying lenses, as is evinced by the fact that Kepler, the first
philosopher to establish an approximate theory of optical instruments,
only two years later invented the latter and prevailing form; and
finally, that Galileo published no contributions to the theory of opties,
seem quite sufficient reasons for such a belief. But, in any case, Ga-
lileo’s merit isin no wise lessened by having failed to do what could
not be done at that time, and the value of his discoveries in emanci-
pating mei’s minds from authority in matters of pure reason is incal-
culable.

No other discoveries of great moment were inade until over a gen-
eration after Galileo proved the existence of spots on the sun in 1611.
This cessation of activity was doubtless owing to the difficulty of se-
curing telescopes of greater efficiency than that possessed by Galileo,
and which he would hardly have left until its powers of discovery had
been fully exhausted in his own hands. By the middle ofthe seventeenth
century, however, several makers of lenses lad so far improved the
methods of grinding and polishing, that telescopes notably superior in
power to that of Galileo were procurable. Of these Torricelli, Divini,
and Campani, all Italians,—Auzout, who constructed a telescope 600
feet in length, though no means was ever found for directing such an
enormous instrument towards the heavens,—but above all, Huyghens,
have won distinction as telescope-makers. The last mamed_ philos-
opher discovered, by means of a telescope of his construction, the lar-
gest satellite of Saturn in 1655, thus adding a fifth member to the list

*The history of the telescope is admirably treated in Poggendorft’s Geschichte
der Physik, from which the statements above are taken.

of planetary bodies unknown to the ancients. But his most important
astronomical discovery, made also in 1655, was the nature of the
rings of Saturn. This object had greatly puzzled Galileo, to whose
small telescope the planet appeared to consist of a larger sphere
flanked on either side by a smaller one; but when in the course of the
orbital motion of Saturn the rings entirely disappeared he was wholly
unable to suggest an explanation. This planet had thus presented
a remarkable problem to all astronomical observers for more than
forty years, and the records of the efforts to solve it during that inter-
val afford us a most excellent means of judging the progress in practi-
caloptics. Huyghens announced these discoveries early in 1656, but
that relating to the ring was given in the form of an anagram, the
solution of which was first published in 1659, This discovery was
contested in Italy by Divini, but was finally confirmed by members of
the Florentine Academy with one of Divini’s own telescopes.

A few years later the famous astronomer Cassini, having come to
Paris from Italy as royal astronomer, commenced a series of brilliant
discoveries with telescopes made by Campani, of Rome. With these,
varying in length from 35 feet to 156 feet, he discovered four satellites
to Saturn in addition to the one discovered by Huyghens. The whole
number was increased by Herschel’s discovery of two smaller ones in
1789, a hundred and five years after Cassini’s last discovery, and again
by Bond’s discovery of an eighth in 1848, The Saturnian system, to
which the telescope has doubtless been directed more frequently than
to anything else, thus serves as a record of the successive improve-
ments of the telescope. Highly significant is the fact that the discov-
eries of the eighteenth century were made with a reflecting telescope,
the others all being with refracting instruments.

Cassini’s discovery in 1684 of the two satellites now known as Tethys
and Dione, was not accepted as conclusive until long afterwards, when
Pound, in 1718, with a telescope 123 feet in length, which Huyghens
had made and presented to the Royal Society, saw all five. This par-
ticular instrument is of especial interest, because it is the only one of
those of the last half of the seventeenth century which has been care-
fully compared with modern instruments. Moreover, it is without
doubt quite equal in merit to any of that period. But we find that,
although it had a diameter of 6 inches, its performance was hardly
better than that of a perfect modern telescope of 4 inches in diameter,
and, perhaps, 44 feet in length, while in regard to convenience in use
the modern compact instrument is incomparably superior.

Another notable discovery of this period was that of the duplicity
of the rings of Saturn by the Ball brothers in 1665, though its inde-
pendent discovery by Cassini ten years later first attracted the atten-
tion of astronomers. The earlier discovery was made by means of a
telescope 38 feet long which seems to have been of English manutac-
ture. We must regard Cassini’s discovery of the third and fourth sat-
THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. oo

ellites of Saturn, however, as marking the very farthest reach of the
old form of telescope; a century was to elapse and an entirely new
form of telescope was to be developed before another considerable ad-
dition to our knowledge of the aspect of the heavenly bodies was to be
made, It is true larger telescopes were made, and Huyghens invented
a means by which they could be used without tubes, but notwithstand-
ing this improvement they proved so cumbersome as to be impracticable.

The older opticians had found thatif they attempted to increase the
diameter of a telescope they were obliged to increase its length in a
much more rapid ratio to secure distinct vision. The reason of this
was not clearly understood, butit was supposed to be owing to the faet
that a wave front, changed in curvature by passing through a spherical
surface, 1s no longer strictly spherical. This deviation in shape of the
refracted wave from a true sphere is called spherical aberration. When
the retracting surfaces are large and of considerable curvature this
soon becomes very serious, but by using small curvature, which, in a
telescope, obviously corresponds to great length, the effects of the error
can be made insensible. Newton’s discovery of the composite nature
of light and of the phenomenon of dispersion enabled him to explain
the true cause of indistinctness in short telescopes; namely, that the
refraction by the objective varies for different colors; consequently, it
the ocular is placed for one particular color, it will not be in the right
position for any of the others, whence the image of a star or planet
will seem to be surrounded by a fringe of colored light. Newton found
this source of indistinctness in the image, which is now known as
chromatic aberration, many hundred times as serious as the spher
ical aberrations. As he was persuaded by his experiments that this
obstacle to further improvement in the refracting telescope was in-
superable, he turned his attention to a form of telescope which had
been suggested a number of years earlier in which the image was to
be formed by reflection from a concave mirror, aud constructed a small
one with his own hands which is still in the possession of the Royal
Society. This little instrument seems to have been of about the same
power as Galileo’s instrument with which he discovered the satellites
of Jupiter, butis was hardly more than 6 inches in length.

Since that time the reflecting telescope has had a remarkable history
of development in the hands of a number of most skillful mechani-
cians, Who have also for the most part been distinguished by their dis-
coveries 1 physical astronomy; we may therefore advantageously
depart from the chronological treatment and follow the history of this
type of instrument. This course is the more natural because we may
probably regard the supremacy of the reflector (undisputed a century
ago) as passed away forever.

Even after Newton’s invention was made public, little was done
towards the improvement of telescopes for half a century, until Hadley
presented a retlector of his own construction to the Royal Society in
100 ' THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE.

1723, which was found to be equal to the Huyghens refractor of 123
feet in length. From this time we may date the beginning of the
superiority of reflectors. A few years later Short commenced his
career as a practical optician, and for thirty years he was unapproached
in the excellence of his instruments. During this time many telescopes,
more powerful than the best of the previous century and infinitely more
convenient in use, had been made and scattered throughout Europe,
but during this period also there was a singular dearth of telescopic
discovery. Perhaps men thought that the harvest had already been
gathered; or, perhaps, we may find the explanation in that the great
cost of telescopes so restricted their use that the impulse to discovery
by their means was confined to a very small class. In view of the
remarkable manner in which the standstill in this branch of science
was finally followed by a brilliant period of discovery, rivalled alone
by that of Galileo, we might well regard the latter cause as the chief
one.

William Herschel was born in 1738 in Hanover. In 1755 he left his
native country, and going to England, secured a position as organist
in Octagon Chapel, Bath, where we find him in 1766. Here he became
so profoundly interested in the views of the heavens which a borrowed
telescope of moderate power yielded, that he tried to purchase one in
London. The cost of a satisfactory instrument proving beyond his
command, he determined to construct one with his own hands. Thus
he entered upon a course which was to refiect honor upon himself, his
country, and his age, and which was to add more to physical astronomy
than any other one man has added before or since. With almost
inconceivable industry and perseverance he cast, ground, and polished
more than four hundred mirrors for telescopes, varying in diameter
from 6 to 48 inches. This in itself would imply a busy life in any arti-
san, but when we remember that all this was merely subsidiary to his
main work of astronomical discovery, we can not withhold our admira-
tion.

Fortunately for science as well as for himself, he made early in his
‘areer a discovery of the very first importance which attached the at-
tention of all Christendom. On the night of March 13, 1781, Herschel
was examining small stars in the constellation of Gemini with one of
his telescopes of a little more than 6 inches in diameter, when he per-
ceived one that appeared “ visibly larger than the rest.” This proved
to be a new world, now known as Uranus. ‘The discovery led in the
following year to his appointment as astronomer to the king, George
III, with a salary sufficient to enable him to devote his whole time to
astronomy.

One of the fruits of this increased leisure was the construction of a
telescope far more powerful than had been dreamed of by his prede-
cessors, namely, a telescope 4 feet in diameter and 40 feet in length.
Commenced in 1785, Herschel dated its completion as August 28, 1789,
THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 101

when he discovered by iis means a sixth satellite of Saturn and, less
than a month later, a seventh, even closer to the planet and smaller
than the sixth. We may regard this achievement as marking the limit
of progress in the reflecting telescope, for, although at least one as
large is now in use, and one even half as large again has been con-
structed, it is more than doubtful whether they were ever as perfect as
Herschel’s at its best.

There has been one improvement however in the reflecting telescope
since the time of Herschel which ought not to be left unnoticed here,
namely, that of replacing the heavy metal mirror by one of glass, made
even more highly reflective than the old mirrors by a thin coating of
silver deposited by chemical methods upon the polished glass. The
great advantage of this modern form of reflector lies, not so much in
the greater lightness and rigidity of the material as in that the surface
when tarnished can be renewed by the simple process of replacing the
old silver film by a new one; whereas in the metal reflectors a tarnished
surface required a repetition of the most difficult and critical portion of
the whole process of construction. The construction is also so eompar-
atively simple that an efficient reflector is far less expensive than are
refracting telescopes of like power, so that this may be regarded as
particularly the amateur’s telescope. On the other hand, such tele-
scopes are, like their predecessors, extremely inconstant, and they re-
quire much more careful attention to keep them in working order. It
is for these reasons, doubtless, that silver-on-glass retlectors have done
so little for the advancement of astronomical discovery. In astronom-
ical photography, however, they promise to do much; and indeed, at
the present date by far the best photographs we have of any nebule
have been made by Mr. Common’s magnificent reflector of 3 feet in
diameter, and by the 20-inch reflector of Mr. Roberts.

We must go back now to a quarter of a century before Herschel dis-
covered the new planet,—to the very year indeed when that great
astronomer first set foot on English soil,—in order to trace the history
of another form of telescope which has remained unrivalled for the last
half century in the more difficult fields of astronomical research, and
which to-day finds its most perfect development in the instruments at
Mount Hamilton, at Pulkowa, at Vienna, and at Washington.

Newton had declared that, as a result from his experiments, separa-
tion of white light into its constituent colors was an inevitable accom-
paniment of deviation by refraction, and consequently the shortening of
the unwieldy refractors was impracticable. The correctness of the ex-
periments remained unquestioned for nearly a century; but a famous
German mathematician, Euler, did question his conclusion. His argu-
ment was that since the eye does produce colorless images of white ob-
jects it might be possible by the proper selection of curves to so combine
lenses of glass and of water as to produce a telescope free from the color
defect. Although Euler's premise was an error, since the eye is not free
102 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE.

from dispersion, his efforts had the effect of leading to much more crit-
ical study of the phenomena involved. In this John Dolland, an Eng-
lish optician, met with brilliant success. Repeating an experiment of
Newton’s with a prism of water opposed by a prism cf glass he found
that deviation of light could be produced without accompanying dis-
persion into prismatic colors. More than this, he found that the two
varieties of glass, then as now common in England—crown or common
window glass, and flint glass, which is characterized by the presence
of a greater or less quantity of lead oxide—possessed very different
powers in respect to dispersion; thus, of two prisms of these two vari-
eties of glass which would deflect the light by the same angle, that
made of flint glass would form a spectrum nearly twice as long as the
other; hence, if a prism of crown glass deflecting a transmitted beam
of light, say 10 degrees, were combined with one of flint glass which
would deflect the beam of light 5 degrees in the opposite direction there
would remain a deflection of 5 degrees without division into color. It
also follows that a positive lens of crown combined with a negative
lens of flint of half the power would yield a colorless image. Such
combinations of two different substances are called achromatic systems.

It is a singular fact, worth noting in passing, that more than twenty
years betore Dolland’s suecess, Mr. Chester More Hall had invented
and made achromatic telescopes, but this remained unknown to the
world of science until after Dolland’s telescopes became famous.

For along time this ingenious invention remained fruitless for astro-
nomical discovery, (though they were early applied to meridian instru-
ments,) on account of the impossibility of securing sufficiently large and
perfect pieces of glass, more particularly of flint glass. Not until after
the beginning of this century was any real advance in this braneh of
the arts exhibited. Even then success appeared, not in England or
Franee, where most strenuous efforts had been made to improve the
quality of optical glass, butin Switzerland. There a humble mechanie,
a watchmaker named Guinaud, spent many years in efforts, long un-
fruitful, to make large pieces of optical glass. What degree of success
he attained there during twenty years of experiment we do not know,
though from the fact that during that period good achromatic tele-
scopes of more than 5 inches in diameter were unknown we must con-
clude that his suecess was limited. In 1805 he joined the optical
establishment of Fraunhofer and Utzschneiden in Munich. Here he
remained nine years, and with the increased means at his disposal, and
the aid of Fraunhofer, he perfected his methods so far that the pro-
duction of large disks of homogeneous glass became only a matter of
time and cost; that is to say, all of the large pieces of optical glass
which have since been produced, whether in Germany, France, or Eng-
land, have been made by direct heirs of the practical secrets of this
Swiss watchmaker.

Fraunhofer was a genius of » high order. Although he died at the
THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPR. 103

early age of 59, he had not only brought the achromatic telescope to a
degree of optical perfection which made it a rival of the most powerful
of the reflector type, and so far improved its method of mounting, that
his system has replaced all others; but he also made some capital dis-
coveries in the domain of physical optics. His great achievement was
the construction of an achromatic telescope 9.6 inches in diameter,
with which the elder Struve made at Dorpat his remarkable series of
discoveries and measurement of double stars. The character of
Struve’s work demonstrates the excellence of the telescope, and shows
us that it is to be ranked as the equal of all but the very best of its
predecessors. Indeed, it may fairly be concluded that not more than
one or two telescopes, and those made and used by Herschel, had ever
been of greater power, while in convenience for use the new refractor
was vastly superior.

For a long time Fraunhofer and his successors, Merz and Mahler,
from whom the great telescopes of Pulkowa and of the Harvard Obsery-
atory were procured, remained unrivalled in this field of opties. But
they have been followed by a number of skillful constructors whose
products have, since the middle of the century, been scattered all over
the world. In Germany, Steinheil and Schréder; in Franee, Canchois,
Martin, and the Henry brothers; in England, Cook and Grubb; and in
this country the Clarks and Brashear, hove each produced one or more
great telescopes which has rendered his name familiar to all readers of
astronomical history. Of these the Clarks, father and son, have beyond
a doubt won the first place, whether determined by the character of
the discoveries made by means of their instruments or by the facet that
the two most powerful telescopes in existence were made by them,
namely, the new refractor of 30 inches in diameter, at Pulkowa, and the
great retractor of 5 feet diameter, of the Lick Observatory in California.
The most notable discoveries made with their telescopes are the satel-
lites of Mars and the companion to Sirius; but besides these there is a
long list of double stars of the most difficult character discovered by
the makers themselves, by Dawes, in England, by Burnham, in our
own country, and by a number of other observers.

We ought not to terminate our review of the development of the tel-
escope without a reference to the parallel development of the mounting
of great telescopes. Indeed, did this not lead us too far from the im-
mediate aim in view, we might find a great deal of interest and be
brought into agreeable contact with some of the cleverest mechanicians
and engineers of two centuries by tracing its course. We should
meet with Huyghens, as the inventor of the aerial telescope, and per-
haps consider the claims of his contemporary, Robert Hook, as a rival
inventor, for we may be sure that nothing which brings us to a study
of that curious and able philosopher would fail to possess interest. We
should find Herschel confronted with the problem as to how he should
use his great 40-foot telescope, and the study of his solution would
104 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE.

enide us in valuing the results of the subsequent efforts of Lassel and
Rosse. The same line of study would bring us to Grubb’s clever and
interesting equatorial mounting of that anachronism, the 4-foot Mel-
bourne reflector. But we should find nothing of very notable interest
in the mounting of refractors, after the time of Huyghens and Hook,
until Fraunhofer invented a type of mounting for the famous Dorpat
equatorial, which still remains in its essential features as the type in
universal use. With the increase in size of the telescopes to be directed
towards the heavens, however, the number and complexity of the me-
chanical problems te be solved has been vastly increased, so that they
have taxed the best powers of some of the ablest mechanicians. The
Repsolds, of Germany, and Sir Howard Grubb, of Dublin, have specially
distinguished themselves in this field of activity. But it seems to me
that none have shown greater fertility of resources, greater skill in the
solution of every problem affecting the comfort and efficacy of the ob-
server, and greater taste, combined with accurate workmanship, than
have the celebrated firm which has mounted the telescope at Mount
Hamilton and that at Carleton College.

We come now to a consideration of the present state of the art of
lens-making. We ask why such a very large proportion of the tele-
scopes in existence are bad; why there was a time, brief it is true, dur-
ing which the glass-maker was certainly in advance of the demands ot
telescope-makers; and why, finally, the first of the great modern objec-
tives was in the hands of the most skillful optician in Great Britain for
seven years, and even then this maker asserted that it was incomplete.

These questions can not be answered in a word, but we can, at least,
gain much in perspicuity by recognizing that the reasons are of two
distinct kinds, namely, purely technical, and theoretical; and by re-
garding them briefly in suecession.

The art of lens-making can be certainly traced back to the 13th cen-
tury. though the methods at a much later day than that were so rude
that, as we have seen, Galileo had the utmost difficulty in making a
lens good enough to bear a magnifying power of 30 times. At the
present day there is little difficulty in selecting a spectacle glass which
would rival that most famous of all telescopes. Not until after another
generation of effort was there such notable improvement in the tech-
nique of lens-making that further astronomical discovery was possible.
The reasons for this slow progress are to be found in the extremely
critical requirements for a good lens. A departure by a fraction of a
hundred-thousandth part of an inch from a correct geometrical surface
will greatly impair the performance of an objective. But even at this
day the limit of accurate measurement may be set at about a one-hun-
dred-thousandth of an inch, while it is quite probable that ten times
that value was vanishingly small to the artisans of a century or more
ago. It was necessary therefore to devise a method of polishing—
for it is a comparatively simple matter to grind a surface aecurately—
THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 105

which should keep the surface true within a limit far transcending the
range of measurements. Huyghens is the first who seems to have done
this, by polishing upon a paste which was formed to the glass and then
dried, and by using only the central portion of a large lens. In Italy
Campani developed a system which he most jealously guarded as a
secret until his death, consisting of polishing with a dry powder on
paper cemented to the grinding tools. This method still survives in
Paris to the exclusion of almost all others, and it is probably the best
for work which does not demand the highest scientific precision.

Newton however was the first to introduce a method which has
since been developed to a state of surprising delicacy. Casting about
for a means which should be sufficiently “tender,” to use his own ex-
pression, for polishing the soft speculum metal, he fixed upon pitch,
shaped to the mirror while warm, as a bed to hold the polishing powder.
But the enormous value of this substance lies not so much in the com-
parative immunity which it gives from scratching, but in the fact that
under slowly changing forees it is a liquid, but under those of short
duration it behaves like a hard and brittle solid. Thus it is possible
to slowly alter the shape of a lens while polishing, in any desired direc-
tion. It was only after the practical recognition of this fact that really
excellent lenses were much more than a question of good fortune. ‘Phe
perfecting of this method belongs without doubt to the English of the
last century and the early part of this. In the Philosophical Transac-
tions, we find many long papers relating to this art, contributed by
skillful and successful amateurs. We may therefore regard the tech-
nique of the art of lens-making as practically complete at the middle of
this century and as common property, so that success no longer de-
pends upon the holding of some special or secret method.

Weare now (after this, I fear, somewhat dry discussion of a necessary
point) in a condition to explain the differences between the processes
pursued by most telescope-makers and that of the maker of the Carleton
College telescope.

This is the ordinary method: After securing perfect pieces of glass,
crown and flint, as like as possible to those generally used, and having
fixed upon the general shape of the lenses, a guess is made as to the
proper radii of the four surfaces to determine the desired focal length
and corrections both for color and spherical aberration. The success
of this guess has much to do with the necessary outlay of labor, and
therefore past experience is of great value as a guide. After working
the four surfaces to the dimensions provisionally adopted so far as to
admit of fairly good seeing through the objective, an examination of the
errors is made. Should the errors of color be so small that their final
correction will not make the telescope more than from 3 to 10 per cent
greater or less than the desired focal length, the crown lens will prob.
ably be completed in accordance with the provisional figures. Then
the flint lens will be modified in such a direction as will tend to correct
106 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE.

the observed errors of color and figure, until, by a purely tentative proc-
ess, the color error is practically negligible and the error of figure is
small. Then follows a process when the qualities of skill, conscientious-
ness, and perseverance have full scope. ‘This process first introduced, or
at least made public by Foucault, is known as local correcting. It
consists in slowly polishing away portions of the lens surfaces so that
errors in the focal image become so small, not that they can not be de-
tected, but that one can not determine whether they are on the one
side of truth or the other. Local correcting has always seemed to me
to be eminently unscientific and unnecessary. It is a process of mak-
ing errors small which ought not to exist.

Mr. Brashear’s method is essentially different from this. Before the
glasses are touched every dimension and constant of the finished
objective is known with great accuracy. His whole aim is to make the
surfaces geometrically perfect; and by ingenious polishing machinery,
which embodies twelve years of his thought and experience, he is
enabled to do this with truly astonishing exactness. All the surfaces
which admit of investigation—usuaily three in his ordinary construe-
tion—are made rigidly true without regard to the character of the focal
image. This leaves only one surtace which is known to be very nearly
a sphere, but probably deviating slightly within in the direction of a
prolate or oblate spheroid. A glance at the character of the focal image
will determine this point. Then the polishing machine is adapted to
bring about a change in the proper direction, and after action during a
measured interval of time, the image is again examined, and from the
observed change in character the necessary time for complete correec-
tion by the same or contrary action may be dedueed. It will be
observed that by this means it is quite possible to correct errors which
are much too small to betray their nature, since a step in the wrong
direction carries with it no consequences of the shghtest moment, since
any step may be retraced.

When we learn that Mr. Brashear’s telescope objectives have always
had a foeal length differing only from one-tenth to one one-hundred-
and-eightieth of 1 per cent of the value prescribed, we have a sugges-
tion of the success of his efforts. But adding to that the fact that he
is absolutely untrammelled by purely mechanical considerations, either
as to the shape of his lenses or the character of his materials, leaving
these questions to be decided alone by the requirements of the astrono-
mer, it seems to me that we may fairly accord to him the merit of the
most important improvements introduced into his art for a very long
period.

I shall. not venture to demand much of your time in considering the
purely theoretical difficulties in telescope construction, not merely be-
cause the subject has already taxed our patience, but because it would
be of almost too technical a character did we allow ourselves to regard
anything but the most general features.
THF HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 107

The obvious requirements ave that in a good objective the light com-
ing from a point in the object should be concentrated at a point in the
image; but this, combined with a prescribed focal length, may be re-
duced to three conditions: First, a fixed focal length; second, freedom
from color error; third, freedom from spherical aberration for a partic-
ular color or wave length of light. Now let us catalogue what provi-
sions we have for satisfying these conditions. They are, four surfaces,
which must be spherical but may have any radii we please, the two
thicknesses of the two lenses, and the distance which separates the
lenses—that is, seven elements which may be varied to suit our require-
ments. As a matter of fact, however, on account of the cost of the
material and the fact that glass is perfectly transparent, for powerful
telescopes we must make the lenses as thin as possible; and we shall
find also that separating the lenses introduces errors away from the
axis which are, to say the least, undesirable. We have left, therefore,
only the four radii as arbitrary constants. These, however, are more
than enough to meet the three requivements. To make the problem
determinate we must add another condition. The suggestion of this
fourth condition and carrying the problem to its solution is the work
of the great mathematicians who have directed their thought to it.
Olairault proposed to make the fourth condition that the two adjacent
surfaces should fit together and the lenses be cemented. This condition
would be, doubtless, of great value were it possible to cement large lenses
without changing their shapes to a degree which would quite spoil their
performance, Sir John Herschel published a very important paper in
1821, in which he made the fourth condition that the spherical aberration
should vanish, not only for objects at avery great distance, but also for
those ata moderate distance. In this paper he computed a table, after-
wards greatly extended by Prof. Baden Powell, for the avowed purpose
of aiding the practical optician. It was this feature undoubtedly which
brought his construction, not at all a good one as we shall see, into
more general use than any other for some time. But, as all Herschel’s
tables were derived from calculations which wholly disregarded the
thickness of the lenses, Lam quite unable to see how they could have
been of any material aid, and am inclined to suspect that the discredit
with which opticians have received the dieta of mathematicians con-
cerning their instruments may have been due in part to this very faet.
It is a singular fact, for which I have in vain sought the explanation,
that Fraunhofer’s objectives are of just such a form as to comply with
the Herschelian solution, although they must have been made quite
independently.

Gauss made the fourth condition that another color or wave-length
of light should be also free from spherical aberration. This seems to
have been a tour de force as a mathematician, not as a sober suggestion
of an improvement in construction, for in a point of fact the construe-
tion is very bad. It was generally believed that this condition could
108 THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE.

uot be fulfilled; therefore Gauss, who was particularly fond of doing
what all the rest of the world believed impossible, straightway did it.
There has been only one efiort to carry out this suggestion of Gauss,
and that forty years later by Steinheil, but it proved a disappointment.
A much larger objective made by Clark a few years ago, of the general
form of Gausy’s objective, probably does not meet the Gaussian condi-
tion,—at least this condition is extremely critical, and I believe it is not
asserted that the objective was ever thoroughly investigated. It has
been the father of no others.

It is hardly surprising, since none of these forms have any real merit,
that the practical optician has, following the line of least resistance,
adopted a form which costs him less labor than those heretofore men-
tioned and is quite as good. By making the eurve equi-convex the
trouble and expense of making one pair of tools is saved, although this
would hardly appear a satisfactory reason for choice of a particular
form te the astronomer, who simply demands the best possible instru-
ment of research.

The reason for so much futile work on the theory of the telescope
objective is not far to seek. It had always been tacitly assumed that
the condition of color correction, one of those which serves to determine
the values of the arbitrary constants, was readily determinable—in
fact, one of the donne of the problem, whereas it is just this datum
which has offered peculiar difficulties. Fraunhofer brought all the re-
sources at the command of his genius to bear upon this point, and frankly
failed, although in the effort he made a splendid discovery, which has
assured a permanence to his fame no less than that of the history of
science itself—the discovery of the dark, or Fraunhofer, lines in solar
and stellar spectra. Gauss proposed the condition that the best objec-
tive is that which produces the most perfect concentration of light about
the place of the geometrical image of a point, just as the best rifle
practice is that which produces the maximum concentration of hits
about the center of the target. That this is a false guide appears at once
from the consideration that if we take even as much as 10 per cent of
the light from an object and diverted from the image so far that it can
not be found, the telescope may still be practically perfect; all of Her-
sechel’s did much worse than this. But if you take that same 10 per
cent and concentrate it very close about the image, the telescope will
be absolutely worthless.

The true difficulty with most of the theorists is this: There is no
recognition of the relative weight or importance of unavoidable errors.
The optician is confronted at the very outset by the fact that absolute
elimination of color error is impossible, for certain physical reasons
which we have not time for considering farther. He can reduce the
color error of the old single-lens type of telescopes hundreds of times,
and hence the length of the telescope tens of times. It is this fact
which prevents the still farther shortening of telescopes, which keeps

“THE HISTORY OF THE TELESCOPE. 109

the ratio of length to diameter not less than fifteen to one in large tele
scopes. This restriction being recognized, let us revise our limiting con
ditions. They now become, first, fixed focal length; second, best color
correction; third, freedom from spherical aberration for a particular
wave-length of light. We therefore have still one arbitrary constant
undetermined. How shall we fix its value, and thus solve the problem
completely? Surely there is only ene rational guide. Consider the
residual errors and make the fourth condition such as to reduce these
errors as far as possible. Now the only remaining errors are secondary
color error and spherical aberration for colors other than that for which
it is eliminated, or more scientifically, chromatic difference of spherical
aberration. Which of these is the gravest defect? Our answer must
depend upon the use to which the objective is to be put. If itis a
high-power microscope objective, it is certainly the second. If itis an
objective to be used for photographing at considerable angular dis-
tances from the axis, our question loses its physical significance, since
we have excluded the consideration of eccentric refraction. But if the
objective is to be for a visual telescope, there is no question that the
defect of secondary color error is incomparably the most serious. Our
fourth and determining condition must, therefore, be better color cor-
rection.

These are therefore the considerations which have served as guides
in the construction of the Carleton College objective. First, the selee-
tion of the materials which, in the present condition of the art of opti-
cal glass making, possess in the highest degree the desired physical
properties; second, a general discussion of every possible combination
of these two pieces of glass and a selection of the forms which yield
the best attainable results. This conscientious strife after scientific
perfection, the unexcelled skili with which the results of analysis have
been interpreted into the reality of substance, the gratifying identity
of predicted and realized values of physical characteristics—all of these
have led some of those who have watched the growth of this new in-
strument of research with the most solicitous attention to the belief
that although not the most powerful in existence it may well be the
most perfect great telescope yet made. Let us therefore congratulate
the possessors of this noble instrument, wish them God speed in their
search after knowledge, while we remind them that although no as-
tronomer Can ever make another discovery which will rival that made
by the insignificant tube first directed toward the heavens by the
Paduan philosopher, yet no mind can weigh the importance of any
truth, however trivial in appearance, which may be added to that store
which we call “science.” ;
GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. *

By Sir ARCHIBALD GEIKIE,
Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.

In its beneficent progress through these islands the British Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science now for the fourth time receives
a welcome in this ancient capital. Once again, under the shadow of
these antique towers, crowded memories of a romantic past fill our
thoughts. The stormy annals of Scotland seem to move in possession
before our eyes as we walk these streets, whose names and traditions
have been made familiar to the civilized world by the genius of litera-
ture. At every turn, too, we are reminded, by the monuments which
a grateful city has erected, that for many generations the pursuits
which we are now assembled to foster have had here their congenial
home. Literature, philosophy, science, have each in turn been guided
by the intiuence of the great nasters who have lived here, and whose
renown is the brightest gem in the chaplet around the brow of this
Queen of the North,

Lingering for a moment over these local associations, we shall find a
peculiar appropriateness in the time of this renewed visit of the Asso-
ciation to Edinburgh. A hundred years ago a remarkable group of
men was discussing here the great problem of the history of the earth.
James Hutton, after many years of travel and reflection, had com-
municated to the Royal Society of this city, in the year 1785, the first
outlines of his famous Theory of the Earth. Among those with whom
he took counsel in the elaboration of his doctrines were Black, the
illustrious discoverer of fixed air and latent heat; Clerk, the sagac-
ious inventor of the system of breaking the enemy’s line in naval tac-
ties; Hall, whose fertile ingenuity deyised the first system of expert-
ments in illustration of the structure and origin of rocks; and Playfair,
through whose sympathetic enthusiasm and literary skill Hutton’s
views came ultimately to be understood and appreciated by the world
at large. With these friends, so well able to comprehend and criticise
his efforts to pierce the veil that shrouded the history of this globe, he

paced the streets amid which we are now gathered together; with them
he sought the crags and ravines around us, wherein Nature has laid
open SO Many impressive records of her past; with them he sallied
forth on those memorable expeditions to distant parts of Scotland,
whence he returned laden with treasures from a field of observation
which, though now so familiar, was then almost untrodden. The cen-
tenary of Huttows Theory of the Earth is an event in the annals of
science which seems most fittingly celebrated by a meeting of the
British Association in Edinburgh.

In choosing from among the many subjects which might properly
engage your attention on the present occasion, [ have thought that it
would not be inappropriate nor uninteresting to consider the more
salient features of that Theory, and to mark how much in certain
departments of inquiry has sprung from the fruitful teaching of its
author and his associates.

It was a fundamental doctrine of Hutton and his school that this
globe has not always worn the aspect which it bears at present; that
on the contrary, proofs may everywhere be culled that the land which
we now see has been formed out of the wreck of an olderland. Among
these proofs, the most obvious are supplied by some of the more
familiar kinds of rocks, which teach us that, though they are now por-
tions of the dry land, they were originally sheets of gravel, sand, and
mud, which had been worn from the face of long-vanished continents,
and after being spread out over the floor of the sea were consolidated
into compact stone, and were finally broken up and raised once more
to form part of the dry land. This eycle of change involved two great
systems of natural processes. On the one hand, men were taught that
by the action of running water the materials of the solid Jand are in a
state of continual decay and transport to the ocean. On the other
hand, the ocean floor is liable from time to time to be upheaved by
some stupendous internal force akin to that which gives rise to the
volcano and the earthquake. Hutton further perceived that not only
had the consolidated materials been disrupted and elevated, but that
masses of molten rock had been thrust upward among them, and had
cooled and crystallized in large bodies of granite and other eruptive
rocks which form so prominent a feature on the earth’s surface.

It was a special characteristic of this philosophical system that it
sought in the changes now in progress on the earth’s surface an ex-
planation of those which occurred in older times. Its founder refused
to invent Causes or modes of operation, for those with which he was
familiar seemed to him adequate to solve the problems with which he
attempted to deal. Nowhere was the profoundness of his insight more
astonishing than in the clear, definite way in which he proclaimed and
reiterated his doctrine, that every part of the surface of the continents,
from mountain top to seasbore, is continually undergoing decay, and is
thus slowly travelling to the sea. He saw that no sooner will the sea
GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. TES

floor be elevated into new land than it must necessarily become a prey
to this universal and unceasing degradation. He perceived that as the
transport of disintegrated material is carried on chiefly by running
water, rivers must slowly dig out for themselves the channels in which
they flow, and thus that a system of valleys, radiating from the water
parting of a country, must necessarily result from the descent of the
streams from the mountain crests to the sea. He discerned that this
ceaseless and wide-spread decay would eventually lead to the entire
demolition of the dry land, but he contended that from time to time
this catastrophe is prevented by the operation of the under-ground
forces, whereby new continents are upheaved from the bed of the ocean.
And thus in his. system a due proportion is maintained between land
and water, and the condition of the earth as a habitable globe is pre-
served.

A theory of the earth so simple in outline, so bold in conception, so
full of suggestion, and resting on so broad a base of observation and
reflection, ought (we might think) to have commanded at once the atten-
tion of men of science, even if it did not immediately awaken the inter-
est of the outside world; but, as Playfair sorrowfully admitted, it
attracted notice only very slowly, and several years elapsed before any
one showed himself publicly concerned about it, either as an enemy or
a friend. Some of its earliest critics assailed it for what they asserted
to be its ivreligious tendency,—ai accusation which Hutton repudiated
with much warmth. The sneer levelled by Cowper a few years earlier
at all inquiries into the history of the universe was perfectly natural
and intelligible from that poet’s point of view. There was then a wide-
spread belief that this world came into existence some six thousand
years ago, and that any attempt greatly to increase that antiquity was
meant as a blow to the authority of Holy Writ. So far however from
aiming at the overthrow of orthodox beliefs, Hutton evidently regarded
his ‘*Theory” as an important contribution in aid of natural religion.
He dwelt with unfeigned pleasure on the multitude of proofs which he
was able to accumulate of an orderly design in the operations of nature,
decay and renovation being so nicely balanced as to maintain the hab-
itable condition of the planet. But as he refused to admit the pre-
dominance of violent action in terrestrial changes, and on the contrary
contended for the efficacy of the quiet, continuous processes which we
‘an even now see at work around us, he was constrained to require an
unlimited duration of past time for the production of those revolutions
of which he perceived such clear and abundant proofs in the crust of
the earth. The general public, however, failed to comprehend that the
doctrine of the high antiquity of the globe was not inconsistent with
the comparatively recent appearance of man,—a distinction which seems
so obvious now.

Hutton died in 1797, beloved and regretted by the circle of friends
who had learned to appreciate his estimable character and to admire his

H. Mis. 114 3

114 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

genius, but with little recognition from the world at large. Men knew
not then that a great master had passed away from their midst, who
had laid broad and deep the foundations of a new science; that his
name would become a household word in after generations, and that
pilgrims would come from distant lands to visit the scenes from which
he drew his inspiration.

Many years might have elapsed before Hutton’s teaching met with
wide acceptance, had its recognition depended solely on the writings of
the philosopher himself. For, despite his firm grasp of general prin-
ciples and his mastery of the minutest details, he had acquired a liter-
ary style which, it must be admitted, was singularly unattractive.
Fortunately for his fame, as well as for the cause of science, his devoted
friend and disciple, Playfair, at once set himself to draw up an exposi-
tion of Hutton’s views. After five years of labor on this task there
appeared the classic ‘“ Hlustrations of the Huttonian Theory,” a work
which for luminous treatment and graceful diction stands still without
a rival in English geological literature. Though professing merely to
set forth his friend’s doctrines, Playfair’s treatise was in many respects
an original contribution to science of the highest value. It placed for
the first time in the clearest light the whole philosophy of Hutton regard-
ing the history of the earth, and enforced it with a wealth of reasoning
and copiousness of illustration which obtained for it a wide apprecia-
ation. Irom long converse with Hutton, and from profound reflection
himself, Playfair gained such a comprehension of the whole subject,
that discarding the non-essential parts of his master’s teaching, he was
able to give so lucid and accurate an exposition of the general scheme
of Nature’s operations on the surface of the globe, that with only slight
corrections and expansions his treatise may serve as a text-book to-day.
In some respects, indeed, his volume was long in advance of its time.
Only, for example, within the present generation has the truth of his
teaching in regard to the origin of valleys been generally admitted.

Various causes contributed to retard the progress of the Huttonian
doctrines. Especially potent was the influence of the teaching of Wer-
ner, who, though he perceived that a definite order of sequence could
be recognized among the materials of the earth’s crust, had formed
singularly narrow conceptions of the great processes whereby that
crust has been built up. His enthusiam, however, fired his disciples
with the zeal of proselytes, and they spread themselves over Europe to
preach everywhere the artificial system which they had learned in Sax.
ony. Byacuriousfate Edinburgh became one of the great headquarters
of Wernerism. The friends and followers of Hutton found themselves
attacked in their own city by zealots, who proud of superior minera-
logical acquirements, turned their most cherished ideas upside down
and assailed them in the uncouth jargon of Freiberg. Inasmuch as
subterranean heat had been invoked by Hutton as a force largely in-
strumental in consolidating and upheaving the ancient sediments that

GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 115

now form so great a part of the dry land, his followers were nicknamed
Plutonists. On the other hand, as the ageney of water was almost
alone adimitted by Werner, who believed the rocks of the eartl’s crust
to have been chietly chemical precipitates from a primeval universal
ocean, those who adopted his views received the equally descriptive
name of Neptunists. The battle of these two contending schools raged
fiercely here for some years, and though mainly from the youth, zeal,
and energy of Jameson, and the influence which his position as pro-
fessor in the university gave him, the Wernerian doctrines continued
to hold their place they were eventually abandoned even by Jameson
himself, and the debt due to the memory of Hutton and Playfair was
tardily acknowledged.

The pursuits and the quarrels of phildsphiers have from early times
been a favorite subject of merriment to the outside world. Such a feud
as that between the Plutonists and Neptunists wouid be sure to furnish
abundant matter for the gratification of this propensity. Turning over
the pages of Kay’s * Portraits,” where so much that was distinctive of
Edinburgh society a hundred years ago is embalmed, we find Hutton’s
personal peculiarities and pursuits touched off in good-humored carica
ture. In one plate he stands with arms folded and hammer in hand,
meditating on the face of a cliff, from which rocky prominenees in
shape of human faces, perhaps grotesque likenesses of his scientifie
opponents, grin at him. In another engraving he sits in conclave with
his friend Black, possibly arranging for that famous banquet of garden
snails which the two worthies had persuaded themselves to look upon
as a Strangely neglected form of huraan food. More than a generation
later, when the Huttonists and Wernerists were at the height of their
antagonism, the humorous side of the controversy did not escape the
notice of the author of ** Waverley,” who, you will remember, when he
makes Meg Dods recount the various kinds of wise folk brought by
Lady Penelope Pennfeather from Edinburgh to St. Ronan’s Well, does
not forget to include those who “rin uphill and down dale, knapping
the chucky-stanes to pieces w’ hammers (like sae mony road-mnakers
run daft), to see how the warld was made.”

Among the names of the friends and followers of Hutton there is one
which on this occasion deserves to be held in especial honor, that of
Sir James Hall, of Dunglass. Having accompanied Hutton in some
of his excursions, and having discussed with him the problems pre-
sented by the rocks of Scotland, Hall was familiar with the views of
his master, and was able to supply him with fresh illustrations of them
from different parts of the country. Gifted with remarkable originality
and ingenuity, he soon perceived that some of the questions involved
in the theory of the earth could probably be solved by direct physical
experiment. Hutton however mistrusted any attempt “to judge of
the great operations of nature by merely kindling a fire and looking
into the bottom of a little crucible.” Out of deference to this preju-
116 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

dice Hall delayed to carry out lis intention during Hutton’s lifetime.
But afterwards he instituted a remarkable series of researches which
are memorable in the history of science as the first methodical endeavor
to test the value of geological speculation by an appeal to actual ex-
periment. The Neptunists, in ridiculing the Huttonian doctrine that
basalt and similar rocks had once been molten, asserted that, had such
been their origin, these masses would now be found in the condition of
glass or slag. Hall however triumphantly vindicated his friend’s view
by proving that basalt could be fused, and thereafter by slow cooling
could be made to resume a stony texture. Again, Hutton had asserted
that under the vast pressures which must be effective deep within the
sarth’s crust, chemical reactions must be powerfully influenced, and
that under such conditions even limestone may conceivably be melted
without losing its carbonic acid. Various specious arguments had
been adduced against this proposition, but by an ingeniously devised
series of experiments Hall succeeded in converting limestone under
great pressure into a kind of marble, and even fused it, and found that
it then acted vigorously on other rocks. These admirable researches,
which laid the foundations of experimental geology, constitute not the
least memorable of the services rendered by the Huttonian school to
the progress of science.

Clear as was the insight and sagacious the inferences of these great
masters in regard to the history of the globe, their vision was neces-
sarily limited by the comparatively narrow range of ascertained fact
which up to their time had been established. They taught men to
recognize that the present world is built of the ruins of an earlier one,
and they explained with admirable perspicacity the operation of the
processes whereby the degradation and renovation of land are brought
about. But they never dreamed that a long and orderly series of such
suecessive destructions and renewals had taken place and had lett
their records in the crust of the earth. They never imagined that from
these records it would be possible to establish a determinate cihro-
nology that could be read everywhere and applied to the elucidation
of the remotest quarter of the globe. It was by the memorable obser-
vations and generalizations of William Smith that this vast extension
of our knowledge of the past history of the earth became possible.
While the Scottish philosophers were building up their theory here,
Smith was quietly ascertaining by extended journeys that the stratified
rocks of the west of England oceur in a definite sequence, and that
each well-marked group of them can be discriminated from the others
and identified across the country by means of its inclosed organie
remains. It is nearly a hundred years since he made known his views,
so that by a curious coincidence we may fitly celebrate on this occasion
the centenary of William Smith as well as that of James Hutton. No
single discovery has ever had a more momentous and far-reaching in-
fluence on the progress of a science than that law of organic succession
GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. ya oy

which Smith established. At first it served merely to determine the
order of the stratified rocks of England. But it soon proved to possess
a world-wide value, for it was found to furnish the key to the strue-
ture of the whole stratified crust of the earth. It showed that within
that crust lie the chronicles of a long history of plant and animal life
upon this planet, it supplied the means of arranging the materials for
this history in true chronological sequence, and it thus opened out a
magnificent vista through a yast series of ages, each marked by its
own distinctive types of organic life, which, in proportion to their an-
tiquity, departed more and more from the aspect of the living world.

Thus a hundred years ago, by the brilliant theory of Hutton and the
fruitful generalization of Smith, the study of the earth received in our
country the impetus which has given birth to the modern science of
geology.

To review the marvellous progress which this science has made dur-
ing the first century of its existence would require not one, but many,
hours for adequate treatment. The march of discovery has advanced
along a multitude of different paths, and the domains of nature which
have been included within the growing territories of human knowledge
have been many and ample. Nevertheless, there are certain depart-
ments of investigation to which we may profitably restrict our atten-
tion on the present occasion, and wherein we may see how the leading
principles that were proclaimed in this city a hundred years ago have
germinated and borne fruit all over the world.

From the earliest times the natural features of the eartl’s surface
have arrested the attention of mankind. The rugged mountain, the
cleft ravine, the searped cliff, the solitary bowlder, have stimulated
curiosity and prompted many a speculation as to their origin. The
shells embedded by millions in the solid rocks of hills far removed from
the seas have still further pressed home these “obstinate questionings.”
But tor many long centuries the advance of inquiry into such matters
was arrested by the paramount influence of orthodox theology. It was
not merely that the church opposed itself to the simple and obvious in-
terpretation of these natural phenomena. So inplicit had faith become
in the accepted views of the earth’s age and of the history of creation,
that even laymen of intelligence and learning set themselves unbidden
and in perfect good faith to explain away the difficulties which nature
so persistently raised up, and to reconcile her teachings with those of
the theologians. In the various theories thus originating, the amount
of knowledge of natural law usually stood in inverse ratio to the share
played in them by an uncontrolled imagination. The speculations, for
example, of Burnet, Whiston, Whitehurst, and others in this country,
can not be read now without a smile. In no sense were they scientific
researches; they can only be looked upon as exercitations of learned
ignorance. Springing mainly out of a laudable desire to promote what
was believed to be the cause of true religion, they helped to retard
118 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

inquiry, and exercised in that respect a baneful influence on intellectual
progress.

It is the special glory of the Edinburgh school of geology to have
cast aside all this fanciful trifling. Hutton boldly proclaimed that it
was no part of his philosophy to account for the beginning of things.
His concern lay only with the evidence furnished by the earth itself as
to its origin. With the intuition of true genius he early perceived that
the only solid basis from which to explore what has taken place in
bygone time is a knowledge of what is taking place to-day. He thus
founded his system upon a careful study of the processes whereby geo-
logical changes are now brought about. He felt assured that Nature
must be consistent and uniform in her working, and that only in pro-
portion as her operations at the present time are watched and under-
stood will the ancient history of the earth become intelligible. Thus,
in his hands, the investigation of the Present became the key to the
interpretation of the Past. The establishment of this great truth was
the first step towards the inauguration of a true science of the earth.
The doctrine of the uniformity of causation in Nature became the
fruitful principle on which the structure of modern geology could be
built up.

Fresh life was now breathed into the study of the earth. A new
spirit seemed to animate the advance along every pathway of inquiry.
Facts that had long been familiar came to possess a wider and deeper
meaning when their connection with each other was recognized as parts
of one great harmonious system of continuous change. In no depart-
ment of Nature, for example, was this broader vision more remarkably
displayed than in that wherein the circulation of water between land
and sea plays the most conspicuous part. From the earliest times men
had watched the coming of clouds, the fall of rain, the flow of rivers,
and had recognized that on this nicely adjusted machinery the beauty
and fertility of the land depend. But they now learned that this
beauty and fertility involve a continual decay of the terrestrial surface ;
that the soil is a measure of this decay, and would cease to afford us
maintenance were it not continually removed and renewed; that
through the ceaseless transport of soil by rivers to the sea the face of
the land is slowly lowered in level and carved into mountain and valley,
and that the materials thus borne outwards to the floor of the ocean
are not lost, but accumulate there to form rocks, which in the end will
be upraised into new lands. Decay and renovation, in well-balanced
proportions, were thus shown to be the system on which the existence
of the earth as a habitable giobe had been established. It was impos-
sible to conceive that the economy of the planet could be maintained
on any other basis. Without the circulation of water the life of plants
and animals would be impossible, and with that circulation the decay
of the surface of the land and the renovation of its disintegrated mate-
rials are necessarily involved.

As it is now, so must it have been in past time. Hutton and Play-
fair pointed to the stratified rocks of the earth’s erust as demonstra-
tions that the same processes which are at work to-day have been in
operation from a remote antiquity. By thus placing their theory on a
basis of actual observation, and providing in the study of existing
operations a guide to the interpretation of those in past times, they
rescued the investigation of the history of the earth from the specula-
tions of theologians and cosmologists, and established a place for it
among the recognized inductive sciences. To the guiding influence of
their philosophical system the prodigious strides imade by modern
geology are in large measure to be attributed. And here in their own
city, after the lapse of a hundred years, let us offer to their memory
the grateful homage of all who have profited by their labors.

But while we recognize with admiration the far-reaching influence of
the doctrine of uniformity of causation in the investigation of the his-
tory of the earth, we must upon reflection admit that the doctrine has
been pushed to an extreme perhaps not contemplated by its original
founders. To take the existing conditions of Nature as a platform of
actual knowledge from which to start in, an inquiry into former condi-
tions was logical and prudent. Obviously, however, human experience,
in the few centuries during which attention has been turned to such
subjects, has been too brief to warrant any dogmatic assumption that
the various natural processes must have been carried on in the past
with the same energy and at the same rate as they are carried on now.
Variations in energy might have been legitimately conceded as possi-
ble, though not to be allowed without reasonable proof in their favor.
It was right to refuse to admit the operation of speculative causes of
change when the phenomena were capable of natural and adequate
explanation by reference to causes that can be watched and investi-
gated. But it was an error to take for granted that no other kind of
process or influence, nor any variation in the rate of activity save those
of which man has had actual cognizance, has played a part in the ter-
restrial economy. The uniformitarian writers laid themselves open to
the charge of maintaining a kind of perpetual motion in the machinery
of Nature. They could find in the records of the earth’s history no
evidence of a beginning, no prospect of an end. They saw that many
successive renovations and destructions had been effected on the
earth’s surface, and that this long line of vicissitudes formed a series
of which the earliest were lost in antiquity, while the latest were still
in progress towards an apparently ilimitable future.

The discoveries of William Smith, had they been adequately under-
stood, would have been seen to offer a corrective to this rigidly uni-
formitarian conception, for they revealed that the crust of the earth
contains the long record of an unmistakable order of progression in
organic types. They proved that plants and animals have varied
widely in successive periods of the earth’s history: the present con-
120 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

dition of organic life being only the latest phase of a long preceding
series, each stage of which recedes further from the existing aspect of
things as we trace it backward into the past. And though no relic
had yet been found, or indeed was ever likely to be found, of the first
living things that appeared upon the earth’s surface, the manifest sim-
plification of types in the older formations pointed irresistibly to some
beginning from which the long procession has taken its start. If then
it could thus be demonstrated that there had been upon the globe an
orderly march of living forms from the lowliest grades in early times
to man himself to-day, and thus that in one department of her domain,
extending through the greater portion of the records of the earth’s his-
tory, Nature had not been uniform, but had followed a vast and noble
plan of evolution, surely it might have been expected that those who
discovered and made known this plan would seek to ascertain whether
some analogous physical progression from a definite beginning might
not be discernible in the framework of the globe itself.

But the early masters of the science labored under two great disad-
vantages. In the first place, they found the oldest records of the earth’s
history so broken up and effaced as to be no longer iegible. And in
the second place, they lived under the spell of that strong reaction
against speculation which followed the bitter controversy between the
Neptunists and Plutonists in the earlier decades of the century. They
considered themselves bound te search for facts, not to build up theories ;
and as in the crust of the earth they could find no facts which threw
any light upon the primeval constitution and subsequent development
of our planet, they shut their ears to any theoretical interpretations
that might be offered from other departments of science. It was
enough for them to maintain, as Hutton had done, that in the visible
structure of the earth itself no trace can be found of the beginning of
things, and that the oldest terrestrial records reveal no physical con-
ditions essentially different from those in which we still live. They
doubtless Hstened with interest to the speculations of Kant, Laplace,
and Herschel on the probable evolution of nebulee, suns, and planets,
but it was with the languid interest attaching to ideas that lay outside
of their own domain of research. They recognized no practical con-
nection between such speculatious and the data furnished by the earth
itself as to its own history and progress.

This curious lethargy with respect to theory on the part of men who
were popularly regarded as among the most speculative followers of
science would probably not have been speedily dispelled by any dis-
covery made within their own field of observation. Even now, after
many years of the most diligent research, the first chapters of our
planet’s history remain undiscovered or undecipherable. On the great
terrestrial palimpsest the earliest inscriptions seem to have been hope-
lessly effaced by those of later ages. But the question of the prim-

GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 121

eval condition and subsequent history of the planet might be consid-
ered from the side of astronomy and physics. And it was by investi-
gations of this nature that the geological torpor was eventually dissi-
pated. ‘To our illustrious former president, Lord Kelvin, who occupied
this chair when the association last met in Edinburgh, is mainly due
the rousing of attention to this subject. By the most convincing argu-
ments he showed how impossible it was to believe in the extreme doc-
trine of uniformitarianism. And though, owing to uncertainty in re-
gard to some of the data, wide limits of time were postulated by hin,
he insisted that within these limits the whole evolution of the earth
and its inhabitants must have been comprised. While therefore the
geological doctrine that the present order of Nature must be our guide
to the interpretation of the past remained as true and fruitful as ever,
it had now to be widened by the reception of evidence furnished by ¢
study of the earth as a planetary body. The secular loss of heat,
which demonstrably takes place both from the earth and the sun, made
it quite certain that the present could not have been the original con-
dition of the system. This diminution of temperature with all its con-
sequences is not a mere matter of speculation, but a physical fact of
the present time as much as any of the familiar physical agencies
that affect the surface of the globe. It points with unmistakable di-
rectness to that beginning of things of which Hutton and his followers
could find no sign.

Another modification or enlargement of the uniformitarian doctrine
was brought about by continued investigation of the terrestrial crust and
consequent increase of knowledge respecting the history of the earth.
Though Hutton and Playfair believed in periodical catastrophes, and
indeed required these to recur in order to renew and preserve the habit-
able condition of our planet, their successors gradually came to view
with repugnance any appeal to abnormal, and especially to violent
manifestations of terrestrial vigor, and even persuaded themselves that
such slow and comparatively feeble action as had been witnessed by
nan could alone be recognized in the evidence from which geolegical
history must be compiled. Well do L remember in my own boyhood
what a cardinal article of faith this prepossession had become. We
were taught by our great and honored master, Lyell, to believe im-
plicitly in gentle and uniform operations, extended over indefinite
periods of time, though possibly some, with the zeal of partisans, car.
ried this belief to an extreme which Lyell himself did not approve.
The most stupendous marks of terrestrial disturbance, such as the
structure of great mountain chains, were deemed to be more satisfac-
torily accounted for by slow movements prolonged through indefinite
ages than by any sudden convulsion.

What the more extreme members of the uniformitarian school failed
to perceive was the absence of all evidence that terrestrial catastrophes
even on a colossal scale might not be a part of the present economy of
122 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

this globe. Such occurrences might never seriously affect the whole
earth at one time, and might return at such wide intervals that no ex-
ample of them has yet been chronicled by man. But that they have
occurred again and again, and even within comparatively recent geologi-
cal times, hardly admits of serious doubt. How far at different epochs
and in various degrees they may have included the operation of cosmi-
‘al influences lying wholly outside the planet, and how far they have re-
sulted from movements within the body of the planet itself, must remain
for further inquiry. Yet the admission that they have played a part in
geological history may be freely made without impairing the real value
of the Huttonian doctrine, that in the interpretation of this history our
main guide must be a knowledge of the existing processes of terrestrial
change.

As the most recent and best known of these great transformations, the
Ice Age stands out conspicuously beforeus. If any one sixty years ago
had ventured to affirm that at no very distant date the snows and
glaciers of the Arctic regions stretched southwards into France, he
would have been treated as a mere visionary theorist. Many of the
facts to which he would have appealed in support of his statement were
already well known, but they had received various other interpretations.
By some observers, notably by Hutton’s friend, Sir James Hall, they
were believed to be due to violent debacles of water that swept over the
face of the land. By others they were attributed to the strong tides
and currents of the sea when the land stood at alower level. The uni-
formitarian school of Lyell had no difficulty in elevating or depressing
land to any required extent. Indeed, when we consider how averse
these philosophers were to admit any kind or degree of natural opera-
tion other than those of which there was some human experience, we
may well wonder at the boldness with which, on sometimes the slender-
est evidence, they made land and sea change places, on the one hand
submerging mountain ranges and on the other placing great barriers of
land where a deep ocean rolls. They took such liberties with geogra-
phy because only well-established processes of change were invoked in
the operations. Knowing that during the passage of an earthquake a
territory bordering the sea may be upraised or sunk a few feet, they
drew the sweeping inference that any amount of upheaval or depression
of any part of the earth’s surface might be claimed in explanation of
geological problems. The progress of inquiry, while it has somewhat
curtailed this geographical license, has now made known in great detail
the strange story of the Ice Age.

There can not be any doubt that after man had become a denizen of
the earth, a great physical change came over the Northern hemisphere.
The climate, which had previously been so mild that evergreen trees
flourished within ten or twelve degrees of the north pole, now became so
severe that vast sheets of snow and ice covered the north of Europe and
crept southward beyond the south coast of Lreland, almost as far as the

ee a) ae ee eee SF

it he
GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 123

southern shores of Kngland, and across the Baltic into France and Ger-
many. This Arctic transformation was not an episode that lasted merely
a few seasons, and left the land to resume thereafter its ancient aspect.
With various successive fluctuations it must have endured for many
thousands of years. When it began to disappear it probably faded
away as slowly and imperceptibly as it had advanced, and when it
finally vanished it left Europe and North America profoundly changed
in the character alike of their scenery and of their inhabitants. The
rugged rocky contours of earlier times were ground smooth and pol-
ished by the march of the ice across them, while the lower grounds were
buried under wide and thick sheets of clay, gravel, and sand, left be-
hind by the melting ice. The varied and abundant flora which had
spread so far within the Arctic circle was driven away into more
southern and less ungenial climes. But most memorable of all was
the extirpation of the prominent large animals which, before the ad-
vent of the ice, had roamed over Europe. The lions, hyenas, wild
horses, hippopotamuses, and other creatures either became entirely ex-
tinct or were driven into the Mediterranean basin and into Afriea. In
their place came northern forms—the reindeer, glutton, musk ox, woolly
rhinoceros, and mammoth.

Such a marvellous transformation in climate, in scenery, in vegetation
and in inhabitants, within what was after all but a brief portion of geo-
logical time, though it may have involved no sudden or violent convul-
sion, is surely entitled to rank as a catastrophe in the history of the
globe. It was probably brought about mainly if not entirely by the
operation of forces external to the earth. No similar calamity having
befallen the continents within the time during which man has been
recording his experience, the Ice Age might be cited as a contradiction
to the doctrine of uniformity. And yet it manifestly arrived as part of
the established order of Nature. Whether or not we grant that other
ice ages preceded the last great one, we must admit that the conditions
under which it arose, so far as we know them, might conceivably have
occurred before and may occur again. The various agencies called
into play by the extensive refrigeration of the northern hemisphere
were not different from those with which we are familiar. Snow fell
and glaciers crept as they do to-day. Ice scored and polished rocks
exactly as it still does among the Alps and in Norway. There was
nothing abnormal in the phenomena, save the scale on which they
were manifested. And thus, taking a broad view of the whole subject,
we recognize the catastrophe, while at the same time we see in its prog:
ress the operation of those same natural processes which we know to
be integral parts of the machinery whereby the surface of the earth is
continually transformed,

Among the debts which science owes to the Huttonian school, not
the least memorable is the promulgation of the first well-founded con-
124 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

ceptions of the high antiquity of the globe. Some six thousand years
had previously been believed to comprise the whole life of the planet,
and indeed of the entire universe. When the curtain was then first
raised that had veiled the history of the earth, and men, looking beyond
the brief span within which they had supposed that history to have
been transacted, beheld the records of a long vista of ages stretching
far away into a dim illimitable past, the prospect vividly impressed
their imagination. Astronomy had made known the immeasurable
fields of space; the new science of geology seemed now to reveai bound-
less distances of time. The more the terrestrial chronicles were studied
the farther could the eye range into an antiquity so vast as to defy all
attempts to measure or define it. The progress of research continually
furnished additional evidence of the enormous duration of the ages
that preceded the coming of man, while, as knowledge increased, periods
that were thought to have followed each other consecutively were found
to have been separated by prolonged intervals of time. Thus the idea
arose and gained universal acceptance that, just as no boundary could be
set to the astronomer in his free range through space, so the whole of by-
gone eternity lay open to the requirements of the geologist. Playfair,
re-echoing and expanding Hutton’s language, had declared that neither
among the records of the earth, nor in the planetary motions, can any
trace be discovered of the beginning or of the end of the present order
of things; that no symptom of infancy or of old age has been allowed
to appear on the face of nature, hor any sign by which either the past
or the future duration of the universe can be estimated; and that
although the Creator may put an end, as he no doubt gave a begin-
ning, to the present system, such a catastrophe will not be brought
about by any ofthe laws now existing, and is not indicated by anything
which we perceive. This doctrine was naturally espoused with warmth
by the extreme uniformitarian school, which required an unlimited
duration of time for the accomplishment of such slow and quiet cycles
of change as they conceived to be alone recognizable in the records of
the earth’s past history.

It was Lord Kelvin, who, in the writings to which I have already
referred, first called attention to the fundamentally erroneous nature
of these conceptions. He pointed out that from the high internal tem-
perature of our globe, increasing inwards as it does, and from the rate
of loss of its heat, a limit may be fixed to the planet’s antiquity. He
showed that so far from there being no sign of a beginning, and no
prospect of an end, to the present economy, every lineament of the
solar system bears witness toa gradual dissipation of energy from some
definite starting point. No very precise data were then, or indeed are
now, available for computing the interval which has elapsed since that
remote commencement, but he estimated that the surface of the globe
could not have consolidated less than twenty millions of years ago, for
the rate of inerease of temperature inwards would in that case have
GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 125

been higher than it actually is; nor more than four hundred millions of
years ago, for then there would have been no sensible increase at all. He
was inclined, when first dealing with the subject, to believe that from
a review of all the evidence then available, some such period as one
hundred millions of years would embrace the whole geological history
of the globe.

It is not a pleasant experience to discover that a fortune which one
has unconcernedly believed to be ample has somehow taken to itself
wings and disappeared. When the geologist was suddenly awakened
by the energetic warning of the physicist, who assured him that he had
enormously overdrawn his account with past time, if was but natural
under the circumstances that he should think the accountant to be mis-
taken, who thus returned to him dishonored the large dratts he had
made on eternity. He saw how wide were the limits of time deducible
from physical considerations, how vague the data from which they had
been calculated. And though he could not help admitting that a limit
must be fixed beyond which his chronology could not be extended, he
consoled himself with the reflection that after all a hundred millions of
years was a tolerably ample period of time, and might possibly have
been quite sufficient for the transaction of all the prolonged sequence
of events recorded in the crust of the earth. He was therefore dis-
posed to acquiesce in the limitation thus imposed upon geological his-
tory.

But physieal inquiry continued to be pushed forward with regard to
the early history and antiquity of the earth, Further consideration of
the influence of tidal friction in retarding the earth’s rotation, and of
the sun’s rate of cooling, led to sweeping reductions of the time allow-
able for the evolution of the planet. The geologist found himself in
the plight of Lear when his bodyguard of 100 knights was cut down.
“What need you five-and-twenty, ten or five?” demands the inex-
orable physicist, as he remorselessly strikes slice after slice from his
allowance of geological time. Lord Kelvin is willing, I believe, to grant
us some twenty millions of years, but Professor Tait would have us
content with less than ten millions. ;

In scientific as in other mundane questions there may often be two
sides, and the truth may ultimately be found not to lie wholly with
either. I frankly confess that the demands of the early geologists for
an unlimited series of ages were extravagant, and even, for their own
purposes, unnecessary, and that the physicist did good service in re-
ducing them. It may also be freely admitted that the latest conclu-
sions from physical considerations of the extent of geological time re-
quire that the interpretation given to the record of the rocks should
be rigorously revised, with the view of ascertaining how far that inter-
pretation may be capable of modification or amendment. But we must

also remember that the geological record constitutes a voluminous body

must be explained in accordance with ascertained natural laws. If the
conclusions derived from the most careful study of this record can not
be reconciled with those drawn from physical considerations, it is surely
not too much to ask that the latter should be also revised. It has been
well said that the mathematical millis an admirable piece of machinery,
but that.the value of what it yields depends upon the quality of what
is put into it. That there must be some flaw in the physical argument
LT can, for my own part, hardly doubt, though I do net pretend to be
able to say where it is to be found. Some assumption, it seems to me,.
has been made, or some consideration has been left out of sight, which
will eventually be seen to vitiate the conclusions, and which when duly
taken into account will allow time enough for any reasonable interpre-
tation of the geological record.

In problems of this nature, where geological data capable of nu-
merical statement are so needful, it is hardly possible to obtain trust-
worthy computations of time. Wecan only measure the rate of changes
in progress now, and infer from these changes the length of time re-
quired for the completion of results achieved by the same processes in
the past. There is fortunately one great cycle of movement which ad-
mits of careful investigation, and which has been made to furnish val-
uable materials for estimates of this kind. The universal degradation
of the land, so notable a characteristic of the earth’s surface, has been
regarded as an extremely slow process. Though it goes on without
ceasing, yet from century to century it seems to leave hardly any per-
ceptible trace on the landscapes of a country. Mountains and plains,
hills and valleys appear to wear the same familiar aspect which is
indicated in the oldest pages of history. This obvious slowness in one
of the most important departments of geological activity doubtless
contributed in large measure to form and foster a vague belief in the

vastness of the antiquity required for the evolution of the earth.

But, as geologists eventually came to perceive, the rate of degrada-
tion of the land is capable of actual measurement. The amount of
material worn away from the surface of any drainage basin and carried
in the form of mud, sand, or gravel, by the main river into the sea
represents the extent to which that surface has been lowered by waste
in any given period of time. But denudation and deposition must be
equivalent to each other. As much material must be laid down in sed-
imentary accumulations as has been mechanically removed, so that in
measuring the annual bulk of sediment borne into the sea by a river,
we obtain a clue not only to the rate of denudation of the land, but also
to the rate at which the deposition of new sedimentary formations takes
place.

As might be expected, the activities involved in the lowering of the
surface of the land are not everywhere equally energetic. They are
naturally more vigorous where the rainfall is heavy, where the daily

range of temperature 1s large, and where frosts are severe. Hence they

:
sims 'shc aie aeidli

i in i ad
GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 127

are obviously much more effective in mountainous regions than on plains ;
and their results must constantly vary, not only in different basins
of drainage, but even, and sometimes widely, within the same basin.
Actual measurement of the proportion of sediment in river water
shows that while in some cases the lowering of the surface of the land
may be as much as ;,, of a foot in a year, in others it falls as low
as gay. Inother words, the rate of deposition of new sedimentary
formations, over an area of sea floor equivalent to that which has
yielded the sediment, may vary from one foot in seven hundred anc
thirty years to one foot in six thousand eight hundred years.

Ifnow we take these results and apply them as measures of the lengti.
of time required for the deposition of the various sedimentary masses
that form the outer part of the earth’s crust, we obtain some indication
of the duration of geological history. On a reasonable computation
these stratified masses, where most fully developed, attain a united
thickness of not less than 100,000 feet. If they were all laid down at
the most rapid recorded rate of denudation, they would require a
period of seventy-three millions of years for their completion. If they
were laid down at the slowest rate they would demand a period of not
less than six hundred and eighty millions.

But it may be argued that all kinds of terrestrial energy are grow-
ing feeble, that the most active denudation now in progress is much
less vigorous than that of bygone ages, and hence that the stratified
part of tle earth’s crust may have been put together in a much brieter
space of time than modern events might lead us to suppose. Sueh
arguments are easily adduced and look sufficiently specious, but no
confirmation of them can be gathered from theroeks. On the contrary,
no one can thoughtfully study the various systems of stratified forma-
tions without being impressed by the fullness of their evidence that, on
the whole, the accumulation of sediment has been extremely slow.
Again and again we encounter groups of strata composed of thin paper-
like lamince of the finest silt, which evidently settled down quietly and
at intervals on the sea bottom. We find successive layers covered
with ripple-marks and sun-eracks, and we recognize in them memorials
of ancient shores where sand and mud tranquilly gathered as they do
in sheltered estuaries at the present day. We can see no proof what-
ever—nor even any evidence which suggests—that on the whole the rate
of waste and sedimentation was more rapid during Mesozoie and Palie-
ozoic time than it is today. Had there been any marked difference in
this rate from ancient to modern times, it would be incredible that no
clear proof of it should have been recorded in the crust of the earth.

But in actual fact the testimony in favor of the slow accumulation
and high antiquity of the geological record is much stronger than might
be inferred from the mere thickness of the stratified formations. These
sedimentary deposits have not been laid down in one unbroken sequence,
but have had their continuity interrupted again and again by upheaval
128 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

and depression. So fragmentary are they in some regions that we can
-asily demonstrate the length of time represented there by still exist-
ing sedimentary strata to be vastly less than the time indicated by the
gaps in the series, ;

There is yet a further and impressive body of evidence furnished by
the successive races of plants and animals which have lived upon the
arth and have left their remains sealed up within its rocky crust. No
one now believes in the exploded doctrine that successive creations and
universal destructions of organic life are chronicled in the stratified
rocks. It is everywhere admitted that, from the remotest times up to
the present day, there has been an onward march of development, type
succeeding type in one long continuous progression. As to the rate of
this evolution precise data are wanting. There is however the im-
portant negative argument furnished by the absence of evidence of
recognizable specific variations of organic forms since man began to
observe and record. We know that within human experience a few
species have become extinct, but there is no conclusive proof that a
single new species have come into existence, nor are appreciable
variations readily apparent in forms that live in a wild state. The
seeds and plants found with Egyptian mummies, and the flowers and
fruits depicted on Egyptian tombs, are easily identified with the vege-
tation of modern Egypt. The embalmed bodies of animals found in
that country show no sensible divergence from the structure or propor-
tions of the same animals at the present day. The human races of
Northern Africa and Western Asia were already as distinet when por-
trayed by the ancient Egyptian artists as they are now, and they do
not seem to have undergone any perceptible change since then. Thus
a lapse of four or five thousand years has not been accompanied by any
recognizable variation in such forms of plant and animal life as can be
tendered in evidence. Absence of sensible change in these instances
is, of course, no proof that considerable alteration may not have been
accomplished in other forms more exposed to vicissitudes of climate
and other external infiuences. But it furnishes at least a presumption
in favor of the extremely tardy progress of organic variation.

If however we extend our vision beyond the narrow range of human
history, and look at the remains of the plants and animals preserved in
those younger formations which, though recent when regarded as parts
of the whole geological record, must be any thousands of years older
than the very oldest of human monuments, we encounter the most im-
pressive proofs of the persistence of specific forms. Shells which lived
in our seas before the coming of the Ice age present the very same
peculiarities of form, structure, and ornament which their descendants
still possess. The lapse of so enormous an interval of time has not
sufficed seriously to modify them. So too with the plants and the
higher animals which still survive. Some forms have become extinct,
but few or none which remain display any transitional gradations into

*

GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 129

new species. We must admit that such transitions have occurred, that
indeed they have been in progress ever since organized existence began
upon our planet, and are doubtless taking place now. But we can not
detect them on the way, and we feel constrained to believe that their
march must be excessively slow.

There is no reason to think that the rate of organic evolution has
ever seriously varied; at least no proof has been adduced of such va-
riation. Taken in connection with the testimony of the sedimentary
rocks, the inferences deducible from fossils entirely bear out the opinion
that the building up of the stratified crust of the earth has been ex-
tremely gradual. If the many thousands of years which have elapsed
since the Ice age have produced no appreciable modification of sur-
viving plants and animals, how vast a period must have been required
for that marvellous scheme of organic development which is chronicled
in the rocks!

After careful reflection on the subject, I affirm that the geological
record furnishes a mass of evidence which no arguments drawn from
other departments of nature can explain away, and which, it seems to
me, can not be satisfactorily interpreted save with an allowance of time
much beyond the narrow limits which recent physical speculation would
concede.

I have reserved for final consideration a branch of the history of the
earth which, while it has become, within the lifetime of the present
generation, one of the most interesting and fascinating departments of
geological inquiry, owed its first iinpulse to the far-seeing intellects of
Hutton and Playfair. With the penetration of genius these illustrious
teachers perceived that if the broad masses of land and the great
chains of mountains owe their origin to stupendous movements which
from time to time have convulsed the earth, their details of contour
must be mainly due to the eroding power of running water. They
recognized that as the surface of the land is continually worn down, it
is essentially by a process of sculpture that the physiognomy of every
country has been developed, valleys being hollowed out and hills left
standing, and that these inequalities in topographical detail are only
varying and local accidents in the progress of the one great process of
the degredation of the land.

From the broad and guiding outlines of theory thus sketched we
have now advanced amid ever-widening multiplicity of detail into a
fuller and nobler conception of the origin of scenery. The law of evo-
lution is written as legibly on the landscapes of the earth as on any
other page of the book of nature. Not only do we recognize that the
existing topography of the continents, instead of being primeval in
origin, has gradually been developed after many precedent mutations,
but we are enabled to trace these earlier revolutions in the strueture
of every hill and glen. Each mountain chain is thus found to be a

H. Mis. 114 )

130 GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME.

memorial of many successive stages in geographical evolution. Within
certain limits land and sea have changed places again and again.
Voleanoes have broken out and have become extinct in many countries
long before the advent of man. Whole tribes of plants and animals
have meanwhile come and gone, and in leaving their remains behind them
as monuments at once of the slow development of organic types, and
of the prolonged vicissitudes of the terrestrial surface, have furnished
materials for a chronological arrangement of the earth’s topographical
features. Nor is it only from the organisms of former epochs that
broad generalizations may be drawn regarding revolutions in geog-
raphy. The living plants and animals of to-day have been discovered
to be eloquent of ancient geographical features that have long since
vanished. In their distribution they tell us that climates have changed ;
that islands have been disjoined from continents; that oceans once
united have been divided from each other, or once separate have now
been joined; that some tracts of land have disappeared, while others
for prolonged periods of time have remained in isolation, The pres-
ent and the past are thus linked together, not merely by dead matter,
but by the world of living things, mto one vast system of continuous
progression.

In this marvellous increase of knowledge regarding the transforma-
tions of the earth’s surface, one of the most impressive features, to my
mind, is the power now given to us of perceiving the many striking
contrasts between the present and former aspects of topography and
scenery. We seem to be endowed with a new sense. What is seen by
the bodily eye—mountain, valley, or plain—serves but as a veil, beyond
which, as we raise it, visions of long-lost lands and seas rise before us
in a far-retreating vista. Pictures of the most diverse and opposite
character are beheld, as it were, through each other, their lineaments
subtly interwoven, and even their most vivid contrasts subdued into
one blended harmony. Like the poet, ‘we see, but not by sight alone ;”
and the “ray of fancy” which, as a sunbeam, lightened up his land-
scape, is for us broadened and brightened by that play of the imagina-
tion which science can so vividly excite and prolong.

Admirable illustrations of this modern interpretation of scenery are
supplied by the district wherein we are now assembled. On every side
of us rise the most convincing proofs of the reality and potency of that
ceaseless sculpture by which the elements of landscape have been carved
into their present shapes. Turn where we may, our eyes rest on hills
that project above the lowland, not because they have been upheaved
into these positions, but because their stubborn materials have enabled
them better to withstand the degradation which has worn down the
softer strata into the plains around them. Inch by inch the surface of
the land has been lowered, and each hard rock successively laid bare has
communicated its own characteristics of form and color to the scenery.
GEOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND TIME. 131

[f, standing on the Castle Rock, the central and oldest. site in Edin-
burgh, we allow the bodily eye to wander over the fair landseape, and
the mental vision to range through the long vista of earlier landscapes
which science here reveals to us, what a strange series of pictures passes
before our gaze! The busy streets of to-day seem to fade away into the
mingled copsewood and forest of pre-historic time. Lakes that have long
since vanished gleam through the woodlands, and a rude canoe pushing
from the shore startles the red deer that had come to drink. While we
look, the picture changes to a polar scene, with bushes of stunted Arctic
willow and birch, among which herds of reindeer browse and the huge
mammoth makes his home. Thick sheets of snow are draped all over the
hills around, and far to the northwest the distant gleam of glaciers and
snowfields marks the line of the Highland mountains. As we muse on
this strange contrast to the living world of to-day the scene appears to
grow more Arctic in aspect, until every hill is buried under one vast
sheet of ice, 2,000 feet or more in thickness, which fills up the whole
midland valley of Scotland and creeps slowly eastward into the basin of
the North Sea. Here the curtain drops upon our moving pageant, for
in the geological record of this part of the country an enormous gap
oceurs before the coming of the Ice Age.

When once more the spectacle resumes its movement the scene is
found to have utterly changed. The familiar hills and valleys of the
Lothians have disappeared. Dense jungles of a strange vegetation—
tall reeds, club-mosses, and tree-ferns—spread over the streaming Swamps
that stretch for leagues in all directions. Broad lagoons and open seas
are dotted with little voleanie cones which throw out their streams of
lava and showers of ashes. Beyond these, in diminer outline and older in
date, we descry a wide lake or inland sea, covering the whole midland

valley and marked with long lines of active volcanoes, some of them sev-

eral thousand feetin height. And still furtherand fainter over the same
region, we nay catch a glimpse of that still earlier expanse of sea which
in Silurian times overspread most of Britian. But beyond this scene our
vision fails. We have reached the limit across which no geological
evidence exists to lead the imagination into the primeval darkness
beyond.

Such in briefest outline is the succession of mental pictures which
modern science enables us to frame out of the landscapes around Edin-
burgh. They may be taken as illustrations of what may be drawn, and
sometimes with even greater fulness and vividness, from any district in
these islands. But I cite them especially because of their local interest
in connection with the present meeting of the Association, and because
the rocks that yield them gave inspiration to those great masters whose
claims on our recollection, not least for their explanation of the origin
of scenery, I have tried to recount this evening.
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE
NATIONAL PARK.*

By ARNOLD HAGUE,

U.S. Geological Survey.

In the short time allotted to me I can only hope to present a brief
sketch of the main geological features of the country which you are
about to visit. My remarks must, of necessity, be more or less incom-
plete, as my desire is not so much to elucidate any special problem
connected with the many interesting geological questions to be found
here, but rather to offer such a general view of the region as will
enable you, during your five days’ trip through the Park, to understand
clearly something of its physical geography and geology.

The Yellowstone Park is situated in the extreme northwestern por-
tion of the Territory of Wyoming. Its boundaries, as determined by
the original act of Congress setting apart the Park, are very ill-
defined. At the time of the enactment of the law establishing this
national reservation, the region had been but little explored, and its
relation to the physical features of the adjacent country was but little
understood. Since that time, surveys have shown that only a narrow
strip, about 2 miles in width, was situated in the Territory of Mon-
tana, but it was also found that a still narrower strip extended west-
ward into the Territory of Idaho. The question of properly establish-
ing the boundaries, based upon our present knowledge of the country,
is now before Congress, and an act has already passed the Senate, pro-
posing to make the northern boundary coincide with the boundary
between Wyoming and Montana, and the western boundary coincide
with the Wyoming and Idaho line. The act under consideration
extends the southern boundary of the Park to the 44th parallel of lati-
tude, carrying the area of the reservation southward 94 miles. The

astern boundary is made to coincide with the meridian of 109° 30/,
adding a strip of country about 244 miles in width along the entire
eastern side of the Park.

The area of the Park, as at present defined, is somewhat more than
3,300 square miles, and the proposed addition increases the reservation

by nearly 2,000 square miles. The Park plateau, with the adjacent
mountains, presents a sharply defined region, in strong contrast with
the rest of the northern Rocky Mountains. It stands out boldly by
itself, unique in topographical structure, and complete as a geological
problem.

The central portion of the Yellowstone Park is, essentially, a broad,
elevated, volcanic plateau, between 7,000 and 8,500 feet above sea-level,
and with an average elevation of about 8,000 feet. Surrounding it on
the south, east, north, and northwest, are mountain ranges with culmi-
nating peaks and ridges rising from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the
general level of the inelosed table-land.

For present purposes it is needless to confine ourselves strictly to
legal boundaries, but rather to consider the entire region in its broader
physical features. It is worthy of note, however, that by the proposed
enlargement the protected area will agree closely with the geographical
province.

South of the Park, the Tetons stand out prominently above the sur-
rounding country, the highest, grandest peaks in the northern Rocky
Mountains. The eastern face of this mountain mass rises with un-
rivalled boldness for nearly 7,000 feet above Jackson Lake. North-
ward, the ridges fall away abraptly beneath the lavas of the Park, only
the outlying spurs coming within the limits of the reservation. For the
most part the mountains are made up of coarse crystalline gneisses and
schists, probably of Archean age, flanked on the northern spurs by up-
turned Paleozoic strata.

To the east, across the broad valley of the Upper Snake, generally
known as Jackson Basin, lies the well-knowa Wind River Range,
famous from the earliest days of the Rocky Mountain trappers. The
Northern end of this range is largely composed of Mesozoic strata,
single ridges of Cretaceous sandstone penetrating still farther north-
ward into the regions of the Park, and protruding above the great
flows of lava.

Along the entire eastern side of the Park stretches the Absaroka
Range—so-ealled from the Indian name of the Crow Nation. The
Absaroka Range is intimately connected with the Wind River, the two
being so closely related that any line of separation must be drawn
more or less arbitrarily, based more upon geological structures and
forms of erosion than upon physical limitations.

The Absarokas offer, for more than 80 miles, a bold, unbroken bar-
rier to all western progress; a rough, rugged country, dominated by
high peaks and crags from 10,000 to 11,000 feet in height. Only a
few adventurous hunters and mountaineers cross the range by one or
two dangerous, precipitous trails known to but few. The early trap-
pers found it a forbidding land; prospectors who followed them, a
barren one.

At the northeast corner of the Park a confused mass of mountains
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 135

connects the Absarokas with the Snowy Range. This Snowy Range
shuts in the Park on the north, and is an equally rough region of coun-
try, with elevated mountain masses covered with snow the greater part
ot the year, as the name would indicate. Ouly the southern slopes,
which rim in the Park region, come within the limit of our investiga-
tion. Here the rocks are mainly granites, gneisses, and schists, the
sedimentary beds, for the most part, referable to the pre-Cambrian
series.

The Gallatin Range ineloses the Park on the north and northwest.
It lies directly west of the Snowy, only separated by the broad valley
of the Yellowstone River. It is a range of great beauty, of diversified
forms, and varied geological problems. Electric Peak, in the extreme
northwestern corner of the Park, is the culminating point in the range,
and affords one of the most extended views to be found in this part of
the country. Archean gneisses form a prominent mass in the range,
over which oceur a series of sandstones, limestones, and shales, of Pale-
ozoic and Mesozoic age, representing Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian,
Carboniferous, Trias, Jura, and Cretaceous. [mmediately associated
with these sedimentary beds, are large masses of intrusive rocks,
which have played an important part in bringing about the present
structural features of the range. They are all of the andesitic type,
but showing considerable range in mineral composition, including
pyroxene, hornblende, and hornblende inica varieties. These intrusive
masses are found in narrow dikes, in immense interbedded sheets
forced between the different strata, and as laccolites, a mode of oceur-
rence first described from the Henry Mountains in Utah, by Mr. G. K.
Gilbert, but now well recognized elsewhere in the northern Cordillera.

We see then that the Absarokas rise as a formidable barrier on the
eastern side of the Park, the Gallatins as a steep mural face on the
west side, while the other ranges terminate abruptly, rimming in the
Park on the north and south, and leiving a depressed region not unlike
the parks of Colorado, only covering a more extended area with a rela-
tively deeper basin. The region has been one of profound dynamic
action, and the center of mountain building on a grand scale. On the
accompanying map of the Yellowstone Park, which shows the position
of the principal objects of interest, the relations of the ranges to the
plateau are clearly indicated.

It is not my purpose at the present time to enter upon the details of
geological structure of these ranges, each offering its own special study
and field of investigation. My desire is simply to call your attention
to their general features and mutual relations. So far as their age is
concerned, evidence goes to show that the action of upheaval was con-
temporaneous in all of them, and coincident with the powerful dy-
hamie movements which uplitted the north and south ranges, streteh-
ing across Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. This dynamic move-
ment blocked out, for the most part, the Rocky Mountains, near the

close of the Cretaceous, although there is good reason to believe that
in this region profound faulting and displacement continued the work
of mountain building well into the Middle Tertiary period.

burst; indeed the region may be considered long since extinct. These
volcanic rocks present a wide range in chemical and mineral composi-
tion and physical structure. They may all however be classed under
three great groups—andesites, rhyolites, and basalts—following each
other in the order named. In some instances, eruptions of basalt oe-
curred before the complete extinction of rhyolite, but in general, the
relative age of each group is clearly and sharply defined, the distribu-
tion and mode of occurrence of each presenting characteristics and
salient features frequently marked by periods of erosion.

Andesites are the only volcanic rocks which have played an impor-
tant part in producing the present structural features of the moun-
tains surrounding the Park. As already mentioned, they occur in
large masses in the Gallatin range, while most of the culminating
peaks in the Absarokas are composed of compact andesites and ande-
sitic breccias. On the other hand, the andesites are not confined to the
mountains, but played an active role in filling up the interior basin.
That the duration of the andesitic eruptions was long continued, is
made evident by the plant-remains found in ash and lava beds through
2,000 feet of volcanic material. The plants have as yet been too little
studied to define positively their geological horizons. It is quite pos-
sible that they may indicate marked differences of climate between the
lower and upper beds.

In early Tertiary times, a voleano burst forth in the northeast cor-
ner of the depressed area encircled by the Park Mountains, not far
from the junction of the Absaroka and Snowy ranges. While not to
to be compared in size and grandeur with the voleanoes of California
and the Cascade Range, it is, for the Rocky Mountains, one of no mean
proportions. It rises from a base about 6,500 feet above sea-level, the
culminating peak attaining an elevation of 10,000 feet. This gives a
height to the volcano of 3,500 feet from base to summit, measuring from
the Archean rocks of the Yellowstone Valley to the top of Mount Wash-
burne. The average height of the crater rim is about 9,000 feet above
sea level, the volcano measuring 15 miles across the base. The erup-
tive origin of Mount Washburne has long been recognized, and it is
frequently referred to as a volcano, It is however simply the highest
peak among several others, and represents a later outburst which de-
stroyed in a measure the original rim and form of the older crater. The
eruptions for the most part were basic andesites. Erosion has so worn
away the earlier rocks, and enormous masses of more recent lavas
have so obscured the original form of lava-flows, that it is not easy for
an inexperienced eye to recognize a volcano and the surrounding peaks
as the more elevated points in a grand crater wall. By following
around on the ancient andesitic rim, and studying the outline of the
old crater, together with the composition of its lavas, its true origin
and history may readily be made out. This older crater has as yet
received no special designation, but when our maps and reports are
finally published, this ancient geological ruin will receive an appropriate
.

138 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.

designation. This old voleano of early Tertiary time occupies a prom-
inent place in the geological development of the Park, and dates back
to the earliest outbursts of lava which have in this region changed a
depressed basin into an elevated plateau. We have here a volcano
situated far inland, in an elevated region, in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains. It les on the eastern side of the continent, only a few
miles from the great continental divide which sends its waters to both
the Atlantic and Pacifie.

After the dying out of the andesitie lavas, followed by a period of
erosion, immense volumes of rhyolite were erupted, which not only
threatened to fill up the crater but to bury the outer walls of the vol-
cano. On all sides the andesitic slopes were submerged beneath the
rhyolite to a height of from 8,000 to 8,500 feet. This enormeus mass
of rhyolite, poured out atter the close of the andesitic period, did more
than anything else to bring about the present physical features of the
ark table-land. A tourist making the customary trip through the
Park, visiting all the prominent geyser basins, hot springs, and the
Grand Cation and Falls of the Yellowstone, is not likely to come upon
any other rock than rhyolite, excepting, of course, deposits from the
hot springs. If he extended his journey to the lake region, taking in
Shoshone, Lewis, and Yellowstone lakes, and spending a week or ten
days going over the beaten routes of travel, he will not, unless he as-
cends Mount Washburne, leave the rhyolite lavas. A description of
the rhyolite region is essentially one of the Park plateau. Taking the
bottom of the basin at 6,500 feet above sea level, these acidic lavas
were piled up until the accumulated mass measured 2,000 feet in thick-
ness. It completely encircled the Gallatin Range, burying its lower
slopes on both the east and west sides; it banked up all along the west
flanks of the Absarokas, and buried the outlying spurs of the Teton
and Wind River ranges.

The Park Plateau covers an area approximately 50 by 40 miles, with
a mean altitude of 8,000 feet. It is accidented by undulating basins of
varied outline and scored by deep canyons and gorges. Strictly speak-
ing it isnot a plateau; at least it is by no means a level area, but arug-
eed country, characterized by bold escarpments and abrupt edges of
mesa-like ridges. But few large vents or centers of volcanic activity
for the rhyolite have been recognized, the two principal sources being
the voleano to which reference has already been made, and: Mount
Sheridan in the southern end of the Park. Mount Sheridan is the
most commanding peak on the plateau, with an elevation 10,200 feet
above sea level and 2,600 feet above Heart Lake. From the summit of the
peak on aclear day one may overlook the entire plateau country and the
mountains which shut it in, while almost at the base of the peak lie the
magnificent lakes which add so much to the quiet beauty ofthe region, in
contrast with the rugged scenery of the mountains. From no point is the
magnitude and grandeur of the volcanic region soimpressive. The lava-
flows—bounded on the east by the Absarokas—extend westward not
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 139

only across the park, but across the Madison Plateau, and out on to the
great plains Snake of River, stretching far westward almost without a
break in the continuity of the eruptive flows. Over the central portion of
the park,whe. e the ryholites are thickest, erosion has tailed to penetrate to
theunderlying rock. Even such deep gorgesas the Yellowstone, Gibbon,
and Madison Cations have nowhere worn through these rhyolite tlows.
In the Grand Canon of the Yellowstone the andesitic breccias are found
beneath the rhyolites, but the deepest cuts fail to reveal the underly-
ing sedimentary beds. Although the rocks of the plateau for the most
part belong to one group of acidic lavas, they by no means present the
great uniformity and monotony in field appearance that might be ex-
pected. These 2,000 square miles offer as grand a field for the study of
structural forms, development of crystallization, and mode of occurrence
of acidic lavas as could well be found anywhere in the world. They
vary from a nearly holocrystalline rock to one of pure volcanic glass.
Obsidian, pumice, pitchstone, ash, breccia, and an endless development
of transition forms alternate with the more compact lithoidal lavas
which make up the great mass of the rhyolite, and which in colors,
texture, and structural developments present an equally varied aspect.
In mineral composition these rock are simple enough. The essential
minerals are orthoclase and quartz, with more or less plagioclase.
Sanidine is the prevailing feldspar, although in many cases plagioclase
forms occur nearly as abundantly as orthoclase. Chemical analyses,
whether we consider the rocks from the crater of Mount Sheridan, the
summit of the plateau, or the volcanic glass of the world-renowned
Obsidian Cliff, present comparatively slight differences in ultimate com-
position.

The following analyses of two rocks, representing extreme forms in
physieal habit, show how closely they approach each other in composi-
tion of the original magma:

140 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.

The rock from Madison Plateau was collected on the north side of
Madison Canyon and was selected asa typical rock covering large areas
of the Park. It is purplish-gray in color, rough in texture, porphy-
ritic in structure, and characterized by well-developed sanidin and
quartz. The obsidian, from Obsidian Cliff, is an excellent example of
pure volcanic glass, wholly devoid of porphyritie crystals. In general
the investigations of the laboratory confirm the observations of the
field geologist, that the differences exhibited by the voleanic product are
not of chemical or mineral composition, but rather of physical con-
ditions under which the magma has cooled.

I have dwelt somewhat in detail upon the nature of these rocks for
two reasons: First, because of the difficulty met with by the scientific
traveller in recognizing the uniformity and simplicity of chemical com-
position of the rhyolite magma over the entire plateau, owing to its
great diversity in superficial habit; second, on account of their geolog-
ical importance in connection with the unrivailed display of the gey-
sers and hot springs. That the energy of the steam and thermal
waters dates well back into the period of voleanic action, there is in
my opinion very little reason to doubt. As the energy of this under-
ground heat is to-day one of tie most impressive features of the
country, I will defer commenting upon the geysers and hot springs
until speaking of the present condition of the Park.

Although the rhyolite eruptions were probably of long duration and
died out slowly, there is, I think, evidence to show that they occupied
a clearly and sharply defined period between the andesites and basalt
eruptions. Since the outpouring of this enormous body of rhyolite
and building up of the plateau the region has undergone profound
faulting and displacement, lifting up bodily immense blocks of lava
and modifying the surface features of the country. Following the rhy-
olite came the period of basalt eruptions, which, in comparison with
the andesite and rhyolite eras, was, so far as the Park was con-
cerned, insignificant, both as regards the area covered by the basalt
and its influence in modifying the physical aspect of the region. ‘The
basalt occurs as thin sheets overlying the rhyolite and in some
instances as dikes cutting the more acidic rocks. It has broken out
near the outer edge of the rhyolite body and occurs most frequently
along the Yellowstone Valley, along the western foothills of the Gal-
latin Range and Madison Plateau, and again to the southward of the
Falls River basin.

After the greater part of the basalt had been poured out came the
glacial ice, which widened and deepened the pre-existing drainage
channels, cut profound gorges through the rhyolite lavas and ‘modelled
the two voleanos into their present form. Over the greater part of the
Cordillera of the central and northern Rocky Mountains wherever the
peaks attain a sufficiently high altitude to attract the moisture-laden
clouds evidences of the former existence of local glaciers are to be
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 141

found. In the Teton Range several well-defined characteristic glaciers
still exist upon the abrupt slopes of Mount Hayden and Mount Moran.
They are the remnants of a much larger system of glaciers. The Park
region presents so broad a mass of elevated country that the entire
plateau was, in glacial times, covered with a heavy capping of ice.
Evidences of glacial action are everywhere to be seen.

Over the Absaroka Range glaciers were forced down into the Lamar
and Yellowstone valleys, thence westward over the top of Mount Evarts
tothe Mammoth Hot Springs Basin. On the opposite side of the Park
the ice from the summit of the Gallatin Range moved eastward across
Swan Valley and passing over the top of Terrace Mountain joined the
ice field coming from the east. The united ice sheet plowed its way
northward down the valley of the Gardiner to the Lower Yellowstone,
where the broad valley may be seen strewn with the material trans-
ported from both the east and west rims of the Park.

Since the dying out of the rhyolite eruptions erosion has greatly
modified the entire surface features of the Park. Some idea of the ex-
tent of this action may be realized when it is recalled that the deep
‘anhons of the Yellowstone, Gibbon and Madison rivers—canons in the
strictest use of the word—have all been carved out since that time.
To-day these gorges measure several miles in length and from 1,000 to
1,500 feet in depth.

To the geologist one of the most impressive objects on the Park
plateau is a transported bowlder of granite which rests directly upon
the rhyolite near the brink of the Grand Canon, about 3 miles below the
Falls of the Yellowstone. It stands alonein the forest, miles from the
nearest glacial bowlder. Glacial detritus carrying granitic material
may be traced upon both sides of the canon wall, but not a fragment
of rock more than a few inches in diameter, older than the recent lavas,
has been recognized within a radius of many miles. ‘This massive
block, although irregular in shape and somewhat pointed toward the
top, measures 24 feet in length by 20 feet in breadth and stands 18 feet
above the base. The nearest point from which it could have been trans-
ported is distant 50 or 40 miles. Coming upon it in the solitude of the
forest with all its strange surroundings it tells amost impressive story.
In no place are the evidences of frost and fire brought so forcibly to-
gether as in the Yellowstone National Park,

Since the close of the ice period no geological events of any moment
have brought about any changes in the physical history of the region
other than those produced by the direct action of steam and thermal
waters. <A few insignificant eruptions have probably occurred, but
they failed to modify the broad outlines of topographical structure and
present but little of general interest beyond the evidence of the con-
tinuance of volcanic action into quaternary times. Volcanic activity
in the Park may be considered as long since extinct. At all events in-
dications of fresh lava-flows within historical times are wholly want-
142. GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.

ing. This is not without interest, as evidence of under-ground heat
may be observed everywhere throughout the Park in the waters of the
geysers and hot springs. <All our observations point in one direction
and lead to the theory that the cause of the high temperatures of these
waters must be found in the heated recks below, and that the origin of
the heat is insome way associated with the source of volcanic energy. It
by no means follows that the waters themselves are derived from any
deep-seated source; on the contrary, investigation tends to show that
the waters brought up by the geysers and hot springs are mainly sur-
face waters which have percolated downward a sufficient distance to
become heated by large volumes of steam ascending through fissures
and vents from much greater depths. If this theory is the correct one
it is but fair to demand that evidence of long-continued action of hot
waters and super-heated steam should be apparent upon the rocks
through which they passed on their way to the surface. This is pre-
cisely what one sees in innumerable places on the Park plateau. In-
deed, the decomposition of the lavas of the rhyolite plateau have pro-
ceeded on a most gigantic scale, and could only have taken place after
the lapse of an enormous period of time and the giving off of vast
quantities of heat, if we are to judge at all by what we see going on
around us to-day. The ascending currents of steam and hot water
have been powerful geological agents, and have left an indelible im-
pression upon the surface of the county. The most striking example
of this action is found in the Grand Canon of the Yellowstone. From
the lower falls for 5 miles down the river abrupt walls upon both
sides of the canon, a thousand feet in depth, present a brilliancy and
mingling of color beyond the power of description. From the brink of
the canon to the water’s edge the walls are sheer bodies of decomposed
rhyolite. Varied hues of orange, red, purple, and sulphur-yellow are
irregularly blended in one confused mass. There is scarcely a piece of
unaltered rock in place. Much of it is changed into kaolin; but from
rhyolite, still easily recognized, occur transition products of every pos:
sible kind to good procelain clay. This is the result of the Jong-con-
tinued action of steam and vapors upon the rhyolite lavas. Through
this mass of decomposed rhyolite the course of ancient steam vents in
their upward passage inay still be traced, while at the bottom of the
canon hot springs, fumaroles, and steam vents are still more or less
active, but probably with diminished power.

It is needless to weary you with the details of this decomposition,
but I may add that investigations in the laboratory upon these tran-
sition products fully substantiate field observations.

Still other areas are quite as convincing, if not on so grand a scale,
as the Yellowstone Canon. Joseph’s Coat Basin, on the east side of
the canon, and Brimstone Hills, on the east side of the Yellowstone
Lake, an extensive area on the slopes of the Absaroka Range, both
present evidences of the same chemical processes brought about in the
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 143

same manner. It is not stating it too strongly to say that the plateau on
the east side of the Grand Canon, from Broad Creek to Pelican Creek,
is completely undermined by the action of super-heated steam and
alkaline waters on the rhyolite lava. Similar processes may be seen
going on to-day in all the geyser basins. To accomplish these changes
a long period of time must bave been required. The study of com-
paratively fresh vents shows almost no change from year to year, al-
though careful scrutiny during a period of five years detects a certain
amount of disintegration, but infinitely small in comparison with the
great bodies of altered rock. This is well shown in a locality like the
Monarch Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin, where the water is thrown
out at regular intervals through a narrow fissure in the rock.

The Grand Canon of the Yellowstone offers one of the most impres-
sive examples of erosion on a grand scale within recent geological
times. It is self-evident that the deep canon must be of much later
origin than the rock through which it has been worn, and it seems
quite clear that the course and outlines of the canon were in great part
determined by the easily eroded decomposed material forming the
canon walls, and this in turn was brought about by the slow processes
just described.

The evidence of the antiquity of the hot spring deposits is, perhaps,
shown in an equally striking manner and by a wholly different proc-
ess of geological reasoning. Terrace Mountain is an outlying ridge of
the rhyolite plateau just west of the Mammoth Hot Springs. It is
covered on the summit with thick beds of travertine, among the cldest
portions of the Mammoth Hot Springs deposits. It is the mode of
occurrence of these calcareous deposits from the hot waters which
has given the name to the mountain. Lying upon the surface of
this travertine on the top of the mountain are found glacial bowlders
brought from the summit of the Gallatin Range, fifteen miles away,
and transported on the ice sheet across Swan Valley and deposited
on thé top of the mountain, 700 feet above the intervening valley. It
offers the strongest possible evidence that the travertine is older than
the glacier which has strewn the country with transported material.
How much travertine was eroded by the ice is, of course, impossible to
say, but so friable a material would yield readily to glacial movement.

Still another method of arriving at the great antiquity of the thermal
energy and theage of the hot spring formation is by determining the
rate of deposition and measuring the thickness of the accumulated
sinter. This method, although the one which would perhaps first sug-
gest itself, is in my opinion by no means as satisfactory as the geo-
logical reasoning already given. It is unsatisfactory because no wni-
form rate of deposition can be ascertained for even a single area, like
the Upper Geyser Basin, and it is still more difficult to arrive at any
conclusion as to the growth of the sinter in the past. Moreover, it is
quite possible that heavy deposits may have suffered erosion before the
144 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OE THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.

present sinter was laid down. It however corroborates other meth-
ods and possesses the advantage of being a direct way.

It may be well to add here that there exists the greatest contrast
between the deposits of the Mammoth Hot Springs and those found
upon the plateau. At the Mammoth Springs they are nearly pure
travertine, with only a trace of silica, analyses showing from 95 to 99
per cent of caleium carbonate. On the plateau, the deposits consist
for the most part of siliceous sinter, locally termed “geyserite.” The
reason for the difference is this: At the Mammoth Hot Springs the
steam, although ascending from fissures in the igneous rock, comes in
contact with the waters found in the Mesozoic strata, which here form
the surface rocks. The Jura or Cretaceous limestones have furnished
the lime held in solution and precipitated on the surface as travertine.
On the other hand, the mineral constituents of the plateau waters are
derived almost exclusively from the highly acidic lavas, which, as it
will be seen by reference to the analyses, carry but a small amount of
lime.

Deposition of sinter from the hot waters of the geyser basins de-
pends in a great measure on the amount of silica held in soiution,
which varies considerably at the different localities and may have
varied still more in past time. The silica, as determined by analyses,
ranges from .22 to .60 grammes per kilogramme of water, the former
being the amount found in the water of the caldron of the Excelsior
Geyser and the latter at the Coral Spring in the Norris Basin. Analysis
shows that from one-fifth to one-third of the mineral matter held in so-
lution consists of silica, the remaining constituents being readily solu
ble salts carried off by surface drainage. <A few springs highly charged
with silica, like the Coral, deposit it on the cooling of the waters; but
such springs however are exceptional, and I do not recall a single in-
stance of a spring in the Upper Geyser Basin precipitating silica in this
way. At most springs and geysers it results only after evaporation,
and not from mere cooling of the water. It seems probable that the
nature and amount of alkaline chlorides and carbonates present influ-
ence the separation of silica. Temperature also may in some degree
influence the deposition. My friend, Mr. Elwood Hofer, one of the best
guides to this region and a keen observer of nature, has called my
attention to an observation of his made in mid-winter, while on one of
his snow-shoe trips through the Park. He noticed that certain over-
flow pools of spring water, upon being frozen, deposited a considerable
amount of mineral matter. He has sent me specimens of this material,
which, upon examination, proved to be identical with the silica depos-
ited from the Coral Spring upon theecoolingof the water. Demijohns of
geyser water which have been standing for one or two years have failed
to precipitate any silica. Quite recently, in experimenting upon these
waters in the laboratory, it was noticed that on reducing them nearly
to the freezing point no change took place, but upon freezing the waters
GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. 145

there was an abundant separation of free silica. The waters frozen in
this way were collected from the Coral Spring, Norris Basin, and the
Taurus Geyser, Shoshone Basin.

Again, there is no doubt that the algous growths found flourishing
in the hot waters of the Park favor the secretion of silica and exert an
influence in building up the geyserite far greater than one would at
first be led to suppose. These low forms of vegetable life occur in
nearly all pools, springs, and running waters, up to a temperature of
185° FI. (only 13° below the boiling point), at the Upper Geyser Basin.
If time permitted, much might be said on this subject. T will only add
that Mr. Walter H. Weed, in connection with his other duties on the
Geological Survey, has devoted much time to a study of these algous
growths, and the results of his investigations will form an important
chapter in the final publications.

Several methods have been devised for ascertaining the growth of
deposition of the geyserite. One way is by allowing the water to
trickle over twigs, dried grasses, or almost anything exposing consid-
erable surface, and noting the amount of inhcrustation. This way
gives the most rapid results, but is far from satisfactory and by no
means reproduces the conditions existing in nature. Other methods
employed are placing objects on the surface of the water or, still
better, partially submerging them in the hot pools, or again by allow-
ing the water to run down an inclined plane with frequent intervals
for evaporation and concentration.

The vandals who delight to inseribe their names in public places
have invaded the geyser basins in large numbers and left thei
addresses upon the geyserite in various places. It is interesting to
note how quickly these inscriptions become indelible by the deposition
of the merest film of silica upon the lead-pencil marks, and, at the
same time, how slowly they build up. Names and dates known to be
six and eight years old remain perfectly legible, and still retain the
color and luster of the graphite. ‘That there is some increase in the
thickness of the inerustation is evident, although it grows with
incredible slowness. Mr. Weed tells me that he has been able, in at
least one instance, to chip off this siliceous film and reproduce the
writing with all its original distinctness, showing conclusively that a
slow deposition has taken place. Pencil inscriptions upon the. sill-
ceous sinter at Rotomahana Lake, in New Zealand, are said to be
legible after the lapse of twenty or thirty years. It is easy to see
that various ingenious devices might be planned to estimate the rate
of deposition, but in my opinion none of them equal a close study
of the conditions found in nature, especially where investigations of
this kind can be watched from year to year. All observations show
an exceedingly slow building up of the geyserite formation. ‘This is
well seen in the repair going on where the rims surrounding the hot
pools have been broken down, and where it might be supposed that

the building-up process was under the most favorable conditions; yet,
in a number of instances, I can see no appreciable change in three or
four years. Re-visiting hot springs in out-of-the-way places after
several years’ absence, I am surprised to see that objects that I had
noted carefully at the time remain unchanged. Taking the entire
area of the Upper Geyser Basin covered by sinter, I believe that the
development of the deposit does not exceed one-thirtieth of an inch a
year, and this estimate I believe to be much nearer the maximum than
the minimum rate of growth. The thickness of the geyserite has
never been ascertained; the greatest thickness measured is 70 feet,
the depth reached in the conduit of Old Faithful geyser, without
meeting any obstruction. Supposing the deposit around the Castle
geyser to have been built up with the same slowness as observed
to-day, and assuming it to grow at the rate given—one-thirtieth of
an inch a year—it would require over twenty-five thousand years to
reach its present development. This gives us a great antiquity for the
geyserite, but I believe that the deposition of the siliceous sinter in
the Park has been goihg on for a still longer period of time. It is
certain that the decomposition of the rhyolite of the plateau dates
still further back.

From a geological point of view, there is abundant evidence that ther-
mal energy is gradually becoming extinct. Tourists re-visiting the Park
after an absence of two or three years occasionally allude to the springs
and geysers as being less active than formerly and as showing indica-
tions of rapidly dying out. It is true that slight changes are con-
stantly taking place, that certain springs become extinet or discharge
less water, but this action is fully counterbalanced by increased activity
in other localities. Close examination of the source of the thermal
waters fails to detect any diminution in the supply. Moreover, it stands
to reason that if the flow of these waters dated—geologically speaking—
far back into the past, the few years embraced within the historical
records of the Park would be unable to indicate any perceptible change
based upon a gradual diminution of the heat.” Accurate descriptions
of the region go back only to 1871, the year of the first exploration by
Dr. F. V. Hayden.

The number of geysers, hot springs, mud-pots, and paint-pots seat-
tered over the Park exceeds 3,500, and if to these be added the fumaroles
and solfataras from which issue in the aggregate enormous volumes of
steam and acid and sulphur vapors, the number of active vents would
in all probability be doubled. Each one of these vents is a center of
decomposition of the acid lavas. In the four principal geyser basins the
geysers in action—or known to have been active within the past sixteen
years—numbered 84. The following list comprises all the geysers that
are known in the Norris, Lower, Midway, and Upper Geyser Basins.

A comparative study of the analyses of the fresh rhyolite, the vari-
ous transition-products, and the thermal waters points clearly to the
fact that the solid contents of these waters are derived for the most
part from the volcanic rocks of the plateau. During the progress of
the work of the Geological Survey in the Yellowstone Park there have
been collected from nearly all the more important localities samples of
the waters, which have been subjected to searching Chemical analyses
in the laboratory of the Survey, by Messrs. I’. A. Gooch and J. KE. Whit-
field; the results of whose work will be published at an early date.

The following analyses of hot waters trom the three principal geyser
basins serve to show their chemical composition:

They are all siliceous alkaline waters holding the same mineral con
stituents, but in varying quantities. Silica forms the principal deposit
not only immediately around the springs, but over the entire floor of
the basins. The carbonates, sulphates, chlorides, and traces of other
easily soluble salts are carried off in the waters. Oxides of iron and
manganese and occasionally some calcite occur under certain condi-
tions in the cauldrons of the hot springs or immediately around their
vents. Concentrations from large quantities of these waters fail to
show the presence of even a trace of copper, silver, tin or other metal.
Nearly all the waters carry arsenic, the amount present, according to
Messrs. Gooch and Whitfield, varying from .02 to .25 per cent of the
mineral matter in solution.

Among the incrustations found at several of the hot springs and
geysers is a leek-green amorphous mineral, which proves on investiga-
tion to be scorodite, a hydrous arseniate of tron. The best occurrence
observed is at Joseph’s Coat Springs, on the east side of the Grand
Cation of the Yellowstone, where it occurs as a coating upon the sili-
ceous sinter lining the cauldron of a boiling spring. Analysis shows

Alteration of the scorodite into limonite takes place readily, which
in turn undergoes disintegration by the wearing of the water, and is
mechanically carried away. So far as I know this is the only oecur-
rence where scorodite has been recognized as deposited from the
waters of thermal springs. Although pure scorodite is only sparingly
preserved ata few localities in the Yellowstone Park, it is easily recog-
nized by its characteristic green color, in strong contrast with the
white geyserite and yellow and red oxides of iron, After a little
practice the mineral green of scorodite is not easily mistaken for the
vegetable green of the algeous growths. The latter is associated every-
where with the hot waters, while the former, an exceedingly rare min-
eral, is obtained only in small quantities after diligent search. In
America traces of arsenic have been reported from several springs in
Virginia, and quite recently sodium arseniate has been detected in the
hot springs of Ashe County, N. C.  Arsenical waters of, sufficient
strength to be beneficial for remedial purposes and not otherwise
deleterious are of rare occurrence. In France the curative properties
of arsenical waters have long been recognized, and the famous sani-
tarium of La Bourboule in the voleanic district of the Auvergne has
achieved a wide reputation for the efficacy of its waters in certain
forms of nervous diseases. Hygeia Springs, supplying the bath houses
at the hotel in the Lower Geyser Basin, carries .5 of a grain of sodium
arseniate to the gallon, The Yellowstone Park waters, while they
carry Somewhat less arsenic than those of La Bourboule, greatly excel
the latter in their enormous overflow. It is stated that the entire
discharge from the springs of La Bourboule, amounts to 1,500 gallons
per minute. The amount of hot water brought to the surface by the
hot springs throughout the park is by no means easily determined,
although during the progress of our investigations we hope to make
an approximate estimate. Some idea of the amount of hot water
brought to the surface and carried off by the great drainage channels
may be formed at the Midway Basin. According to the most accurate
measurements which could be made, the discharge from the ealdron
of the Excelsior Geyser into the Firehole River during the past sea-
son amounted to 4,400 gallons of boiling water per minute, and there
is no evidence that this amount has varied within the last two or three
years. The sample of the Excelsior Geyser water collected August
25, 1834, yielded .19 grains of sodium arseniate to the gallon. It is
impossible to say as yet what curative properties these park waters
150 GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.

may possess in alleviating the ills of mankind. Nothing but an
extended experience under proper medical supervision can determine.
I may say that no hot springs with which I am acquainted prove so
delightful for bathing purposes and so agreeable in their action upon
the skin.

Changes modifying the surface features of the park in recent times
are mainly those brought about by the filling up with detrital material
from the mountains, the valleys and depressions worn out by glacial ice,
and those produced by the prevailing climatic conditions. Between the
park country and what is known as the arid regions of the West there
is the greatest possible contrast. Across the park plateau and the
Absaroka range the country presents a continuous mountain mass
75 miles in width, with an average elevation unsurpassed by any area
of equal extent in the northern Rocky Mountains. It is exceptionally
situated to collect the moisture-laden clouds, which coming from the
southwest precipitate immense quantities of snow and rain upon the
cooled table-land and neighboring mountains. The climate in many
respects is quite unlike that found in the adjacent country, as is
shown by the meteorological records, the amount of snow and rainfall
being higher, and the mean annual temperature lower. Rain storms
occur Feduently throughout the summer, while snow is quite likely to
fall any time between September and May. Protected by the forests
the deep snows of winter lie upon the plateau well into mid-summer,
while at still higher altitudes, in sheltered places, it remains throughout
the year. By its topographical structure the park is designed by
nature as a reservoir for receiving, storing, and distributing an excep-
tional water supply, unexcelled by any area near the head-waters of the
ereat continental rivers. The Continental Divide, separating the
waters of the Atlantic from those of the Pacific, crosses the park
plateau from southeast to northwest. On both sides of this divide lie
several large bodies of water which form so marked a future in the
scenery of the plateau that the region has been designated the lake
