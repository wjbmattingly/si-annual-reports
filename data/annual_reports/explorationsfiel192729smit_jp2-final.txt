PREERAGE

The purpose of the Smithsonian Institution as stated by its founder,
James Smithson, is “ the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” The first part of this dual mission is accomplished through
research and exploration; the second part through 12 series of pub-
lications. Because the research of the Institution is wholly in the
field of pure science, the large majority of these publications are
technical in character, being therefore of interest primarily to the
student and the specialist. Besides occasional works in its regular
series which prove to have a popular appeal, two Smithsonian publi-
cations are issued, however, for the definite purpose of attracting
the general reader to matters of scientific interest. These are the
Smithsonian Reports with their general appendixes of authoritative
articles reviewing in non-technical language the yearly advance along
the scientific front, and the annual Smithsonian Exploration and
Field-Work pamphlets started in 1912 to inform the public of Smith-
sonian activities in scientific exploration. It is the hope of the Insti-
tution that this present pamphlet, covering the year 1927, will lend
the reader something of the fascination of scientific field-work, and
also illustrate the wide scope of Smithsonian efforts to increase
knowledge.

In fairness to the Institution, it should be added that it has almost
no unrestricted funds for field-work. Practically all of the expedi-
tions sent out each year are made possible either through the help of
generous friends and patrons of the Institution, or through coopera-
tive arrangements with other scientific agencies whereby costs and
collections are shared.

CALIFORNIA
Bye CG. AB BO,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and Director of the
Astrophysical Observatory

On Mount Montezuma, in the Atacama Desert of Chile, at 9,000
feet elevation, and on Table Mountain, California, at 7,500 feet, over-
looking the Mojave Desert, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-
tory has two stations for measuring the intensity of sun rays on
which all life depends. A third station on Mount Brukkaros, within
a Hottentot reservation of South West Africa, is supported by
funds of the National Geographic Society but administered by the
Smithsonian. These three stations are cooperating to measure solar
radiation on every possible day of the year. The observations are
made and reduced in a manner to indicate the daily intensity of sun
rays as they are outside our atmosphere, and to reveal any changes
therein.

If one should ask: Are the sun’s rays growing weaker or stronger,
or are they fluctuating in a manner to produce predictable changes in
weather, it would be impossible to answer because it is only recently
that records of solar heat measurements have been available. Not
until the Chilean observatory was founded by the Smithsonian in
1918 did daily measurements throughout the year begin. It is hoped
to carry on the observations for a long term of years, so that mete-
orologists of the next generation can consult these basic measures,
and, comparing them with climate and weather all over the world,
perhaps be 1n position to forecast conditions with great advantage.

Within the past year, several results of promise have appeared.
Iirst, the march of the monthly mean values of solar radiation from
1918 to 1926, inclusive, shows evidence: (a) That increased solar
radiation attends increased sun-spot activity; (b) that a regular
periodic change of solar radiation of considerable amplitude occurs
in a period of 253 months; (c) that less important periodicities of
15 and 11 months also appear.

Second, the observations of Dr. Pettit of Mount Wilson Observa-
tory on the changes in the extreme ultra-violet spectrum of the sun,

which he finds amounting to from fifty to one hundred per cent, go
closely parallel to the changes in total solar radiation of from one to
three per cent observed by the Smithsonian stations.

Third, Dr. Austin of the U. S. Bureau of Standards, observing
the monthly average of intensity in the receipt of radio signals from

in solar radiation.

If the periodicities of 11, 15, and 253 months continue to be found
in future years, and to represent as now they do the major part of
long range solar variation, then whatever of change in terrestrial
affairs may be proved to depend on these changes in the sun will
probably become predictable in general terms for many months
in advance.

Mr. F. A. Greeley, has established the station on Mount Brukkaros

We have just discovered that we have some of the large lizards on Mt.
Brukkaros. Our native boy killed one a few days ago which was four feet long.
He said he had seen others which were very much larger. We shall try to
catch one of the large ones and send the skin to you for the Smithsonian, as I
understand the large lizards are rather rare now.

We have been having plenty of experience in motor travel in this country.
A short time ago I was returning home with a load of provisions and just as I
arrived in the middle of the Fish river (dry sand except after heavy rains )
one of the axles broke. Well, the Fish river is 40 miles from Keetmanshoop

and 20 from the mountain. Our native boy was with me, so I sent a note to
Fred and he telephoned to Keetmanshoop for an axle. One arrived after a
day and a half. In the mean time I camped in the middle of the river. Not a
place I would choose for a picnic with the temperature about 100° and a sand
storm most of the day.

On the twentieth of this month, one-third of an inch of rain fell. It filled our
waterhole full again, so we now have no doubts but that there will always be
an adequate supply there. The rain was quite general and heavier towards the

crosses between Tses and Berseba. It is a pretty spot there. After a lunch of
tea and sandwiches we donned bathing suits and proceeded to treat ourselves
to a swim in muddy water. We all enjoyed it thoroughly and were loath to
come out after an hour of swimming about.

We hear leopards almost every night now. The Hottentot captain has prom-

FOSS lt. b@@ TERRINITS) INTHE eGR AND CAN YON
OF THE COLORADO, ARIZONA
By CHARLES W. GILMORE,

Curator, Division of Vertebrate Paleontology, U. S. National Museum

The fossil tracks of extinct four-footed animals were first dis-
covered in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado in 1915, but the abun-
dance of their occurrence and their great diversity of kind remained
unknown until 1924. In that year and again in 1926 collections of
them were made for the U. S. National Museum, and my studies
of these materials have disclosed the presence of no less than 26
genera and 32 species of fossil footprints. In number of species,
and in excellence of preservation of the tracks, this area easily out-
ranks all other known American localities for Permian and Penn-
sylvanian footprints.

The great antiquity of these fossilized tracks of extinct creatures
of a by-gone age is clearly shown by the fact that they occur from
goo to 3,800 feet below the top of the canyon wall. This means that
since the first of these animals left their footprints in what was then
moist sand, nearly 4,000 feet of rock-making materials were deposited
in successive layers above them, not to mention the hundreds of
feet more that no doubt were eroded from the present rim of the
canyon. Add to this period of up-building, the length of time required
for the cutting of the canyon through 4,000 feet of solid rock, and
we have an idea of the tremendous age of these fossil footprints.

A third visit to the Grand Canyon under the auspices of the Grand
Canyon Exhibit Committee of the National Academy of Sciences,
was made in the late spring of 1927 for the dual purpose of locating
and preparing exhibits of tracks i situ, and making further col-
lections of fossil footprints for the U. S. National Museum. Both
of these projects were successfully carried out.

Two small field exhibits, one in the Coconino, the other in the
Supai formation were prepared, the purpose being to show the tracks
precisely as they occur in nature in order that they may be viewed
by visitors, through fixed telescopes which the committee plans to
place in front of the new observation station now being erected on
Yavapai Point. In order to find suitable locations for these exhibits

which obviously must be visible from the observing station, a con-
siderable amount of exploratory work was necessary. As a result
of this, the known geographical range of fossil tracks in the Grand
Canyon was greatly extended and a considerable amount of new
material was secured for the National collections. Subsequent study
has shown some of the tracks to be undescribed, but the most note-
worthy specimen collected, from an exhibition viewpoint, is the large
slab from the Hermit formation shown in the accompanying illustra-
tion. This gives a vivid picture of the diversity of animal life that
once roamed over this ancient mud flat.

An interesting development of these investigations was the dis-
covery by Mr. G. E. Sturdevant, Park Naturalist, of a track-bearing
horizon in the Bright Angel section of the Middle Cambrian. Thus
four distinct ichnite horizons are established in this one geological
section, distributed as follows: Coconino sandstone, 900 to 1,030 feet ;
Hermit, 1,350 to 1,400 feet ; Supai, 1,760; to 1,800 feet ; and Tapeats,
3,600 to 3,800 feet below the top of the Canyon wall.

On the south rim of the Grand Canyon, tracks have been found
on Grand View Trail on the east and Dripping Springs on the west,
these two localities being separated by a distance of 27 miles, and this
last exploration leads to the belief that tracks can be found in the
above mentioned horizons wherever the physical conditions will per-
mit search being made for them. In view of this last statement, it is
of interest to add that Mr. Sturdevant has recently discovered fossil
tracks in the Coconino and Supai formations on the north rim of the
canyon, some 14 miles distant in an air line from those found on the
south rim.
CONTINUING DEE KREPHANT TUN?
By We GHDEEN:

Assistant Curator, Division of Vertebrate Paleontology, U. S. National Museum

Extinct elephants, the mammoths (represented by at least three
species) and their near relatives, the mastodons, were native in North
America throughout the entire Pleistocene Age, that geologic period
which just preceded the present time, and which was marked by sev-
eral epochs of widespread glaciation. During the interglacial periods
and continuing even after the last great ice sheet had disappeared or
at least retreated far to the north, these great beasts roamed widely
over most of the United States, traveled far southward into Mexico
and Central America, and extended their range northwestward into
Alaska. Their fossil remains are numerous and have been found in
hundreds of localities over the regions just mentioned, yet complete
skeletons and even skulls are seldom found and recovered. One factor
seems largely responsible for this, namely the great size of these ani-
mals. It must have been only under the most favorable conditions
of accumulating deposits that entire carcasses of such very large crea-
tures would be covered and preserved. In consequence most of the
finds reported represent only a few scattered bones and more often
a jaw or tooth, for teeth are less easily destroyed by the elements
than other parts of the skeleton. Another contributing cause for
scarcity of good material of these animals is due to the fact that many
of the best preserved skeletons have been discovered in swamp-dredg-
ing, or other excavation work by men who have not had the technical
training and special knowledge required to collect such material and
in consequence most of these have been greatly damaged or entirely
destroyed for scientific purposes. From this it may be rightly inferred
that to obtain good mountable material of these ancient elephants, it
is necessary to send into the collecting fields especially trained men,
experienced in collecting fossil bones and properly equipped for sys-
tematic search and recovery of material discovered.

The National Museum has never been able to do this in any ade-
quate way owing to lack of funds, but has been obliged to depend
upon following up and investigating such occasional promising reports
of finds as come to the Museum from time to time, and as small allot-

ments are found available.

14 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

In this way the Museum has procured in years gone by three good
skeletons of mastodons, one a rare and unique species ; but as yet no
skeleton of the mammoth suitable for mounting has been secured,
although several reports of mammoth bones which have turned out
to be of some value have been investigated. A short account of one
of these was published in last year’s Explorations and Field-W ork of
the Smithsonian Institution.’

More recently two additional favorable reports of such discoveries
came to the Museum, one from Curtis, a small town in northwestern
Oklahoma, the other from Sarasota, Florida. I was detailed to investi-
gate these finds and near the end of March left Washington for this
purpose going first to Oklahoma and afterward to Florida. The
Oklahoma find was reported by Mr. B. C. Baxter, a resident and
proprietor of a newspaper in the little town of Curtis. This gentleman
met me on my arrival on March 31st and took me at once to the
locality at the head of a little canyon about two and one-half miles
north-northeast of the town where investigation was at once begun.
This was followed by several days search here and exploration of the
surrounding country. It seems not out of place to express here my
appreciation of Mr. Baxter’s public spirited attitude in the matter,
first in reporting his discoveries to the National Museum, and after-
ward in rendering what assistance he could in furthering the work of
investigation and exploration during my stay at Curtis.

The prospect at the canyon head just mentioned looked promising
but on investigation proved disappointing. Many fossil bone frag-
ments were scattered along the exposures, but a little digging soon
revealed the fact that there was small hope of securing anything like
a complete skeleton here, as it was quite evident the fossil-bearing
beds, which are of Pleistocene Age, represent rather slowly accumu-
lated river channel deposits and the contained bones had been much
broken and scattered before their original burial in the sand and clay
layers of which the beds are composed. However, a good palate
portion of a mammoth skull containing the cheek teeth, some impor-
tant foot bones, ribs, vertebrae, and also a few teeth of an extinct
species of horse, probably Equus scotti, were collected. At another
locality, two or three miles southeast, were later found a jaw and
other bones of a rare species of ground sloth belonging to the group
known as Nothrotherium, apparently representing a newly discovered
species of this genus.

In my exploration by automobile, of many miles of the surrounding
country. I found abundant evidence that there are many isolated areas,
usually of limited extent, of fossil-bearing Pleistocene deposits in that
general region. These seem to be remnants of ancient stream channels
which once occupied the high plains country before the present valleys
were formed and the present drainage systems established. While
none of the exposures examined yielded much of value they gave
promise of good returns had time and funds permitted a much more
extended exploration.

Leaving western Oklahoma April 11, [ arrived in Sarasota, Florida,
on the morning of April 13. Here I was met by Mr. J. E. Moore, the

discoverer of the fossil bones in the vicinity of Sarasota, and received
from him the same cordial and helpful assistance I had had from
Mr. Baxter in Oklahoma. Things looked promising here also, but,
as in Oklahoma, I was destined to be again disappointed in my search
for the “ big prize,” namely, a mountable skeleton of the mammoth.
Also, as in Oklahoma, the visit to this locality was not unproductive,
as, in the few days of my stay in Florida, from the several localities
we visited in this vicinity and in the neighborhood of Zolfo Springs,
about 60 miles east of Sarasota, I recovered a respectable little col-
lection of fossil bones and teeth, including remains of the mammoth,
mastodon, extinct horse, bison, camel, tapir and other smaller kinds
of prehistoric mammals, all from Pleistocene deposits.
CAMBRIAN GEOLOGY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
By CHARLES FE, RESSER:

Associate Curator, Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology,
U.S. National Museum

For a number of years I have been carrying on field-work, both in
the western United States and in Europe, under the direction of
Dr. Charles D. Walcott, to obtain data to be used in systematizing
the Cambrian System and more particularly to find a Middle Cam-
brian section complete enough to serve as a standard of reference for
these strata in other parts of the world. Owing to the lamented death
of Dr. Walcott in February, 1927, it became necessary for me to
interrupt this program and visit a wider area this past summer than
would otherwise have been done.

Dr. Walcott was occupied during the last few years of his life
in summarizing the knowledge gained in the extensive researches con-
ducted throughout his long and fruitful career, with the result that
at his death he left a large uncompleted manuscript presenting a com-
prehensive treatment of the stratigraphy in the Canadian Rocky
Mountains where he made many remarkable discoveries. As I] was
detailed to edit and attempt to complete this manuscript, it became
necessary to reexamine certain Canadian sections for stratigraphic
details which were found lacking when Dr. Walcott assembled his
data and which he had hoped to seek in the field himself,

Since the motor truck used in previous years had been sold as no
longer useful for strenuous field-work, a new one was purchased in
Washington, through the generous assistance of Mrs. C. D. Walcott,
and driven across the continent. Our party traveled by this means
from the time of leaving Washington until the outfit was stored at
Salt Lake City, a total of more than 6,000 miles, traversing a con-
siderable portion of the continent. It was a pleasure to find that
Dr. R. S. Bassler, curator of stratigraphic paleontology, U. S. Na-
tional Museum, was willing to accompany me, and so I have had the
benefit of his advice and experience in stratigraphic geology, thus
assuring more certain results in the field determinations. My son,
Harold Resser, served as camp assistant.

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 19027 19

We left Washington on July 21 and met Dr. Bassler in Provo,
Utah, July 29, having covered the 2,250 miles in eight days, one of
which was spent in a repair shop, a delay made necessary by a plains-
man, fearful of the outer edge of a winding mountain road, coming
up on the wrong side of the road. No other means of transportation
than by motor can give one such an intimate view of our country nor
so impress on the mind its immensity and the extent of its resources.

After securing the portion of the camp outfit that had been left
in storage at Provo, we moved on to Salt Lake City where a confer-
ence with the local geologists was held concerning their more recent
discoveries and advice as to desirable places to visit was obtained.
Here Dr. Bassler was able to arrange for an important collection of
Permian fossils, which has since been received at the Museum.

After briefly studying the Wasatch Mountains and traversing
Yellowstone Park, the sections in the mountains immediately to the
north were examined, the one along Newland Creek, Meagher County,
Montana, being studied in some detail. Then since our route led by
the Little Belt Mountains, stops were made here to study their Cam-
brian strata.

The main objective of the summer’s work was the general region
of the Bow Valley, Canadian Rocky Mountains, to the north and
west of Banff, Alberta. The first camp was made on Vermilion Pass
on the Banff-Windermere road, in which vicinity a number of sec-
tions were studied. It was hoped that as a side issue of the season’s
work the vexing question as to the extract stratigraphic boundary
between the Lower and Middle Cambrian could be determined, and
here in Vermilion Pass there seemed to be a chance for finding the
necessary data. However, the time and equipment at our disposal did
not permit us to reach a sufficient number of points to enable us to
decide the question. A survey of the interesting and important sec-
tion in the Sawback Range was next made with the idea of verifying
the presence of certain Cambrian and Ozarkian formations.

Several days were spent in the vicinity of Lake Louise where
many of the best Cambrian sections are located. Camp was then
moved into the Kicking Horse Canyon near Field, where are located
two remarkable fossil localities: one on Mt. Stephen, which has
been known for more than 50 years; and the other above Burgess
Pass, where Dr. Walcott discovered the most important Cambrian
fauna ever found. We continued down the Kicking Horse River
to Golden, reviewing the great sections exposed along the gorge of
that river.

In the Columbia River valley we had the good fortune to be
accompanied by Dr. Charles S. Evans of the Canadian Geological
Survey, who by his assistance saved us much time, particularly in
the Sinclair Canyon section. Continuing up the Columbia valley to
its head, then again into the Kootenay drainage, we had the pleasure
of discovering a new locality for some very important Lower Cam-
brian beds near Fort Steele, British Columbia.

Returning now to the United States, and with the main stratt-
graphic work completed, Dr. Bassler left the party at Coeur d’Alene,

Idaho. He continued to the West Coast where, before returning to
Washington, he spent a few days studying the geology of the Coast
Range from which he has previously described several faunas. My
son and I then traveled eastward across the picturesque Bitteroot
Mountains, through the extensive mining district of Idaho, a region
always interesting to the geologist. A brief stop was made at Logan,
Montana, where the accumulated fossils were packed and shipped.
Following this, visits were made to outcrops of interest in the moun-
tains of the south, on the way back to Salt Lake City, where the truck
and camp outfit were stored at the University of Utah, through the
kindness of members of the Department of Geology.
PES MIND RAS OF MEXIC®@

By W. F. FOSHAG,
Assistant Curator, Division of Mineralogy and Petrology,
U.S. National Museum

Although Mexico is one of the richest countries in the world in
mineral resources, but few collections of its minerals have been made
and comparatively little is known of the mineralogy and geology of
Mexico. In 1926 a start was made towards assembling a representa-
tive collection for the U. S. National Museum, and this year, in con-
tinuation of the work, I visited a number of localities in the States
of Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas and Guanajuato.

Las Chispas mine, near Arispe, Sonora, is well known for the
richness of its silver ore and the beauty and great size of the various
silver minerals found there. It was with the hope of acquiring a
complete series of these specimens that I first proceeded to Arispe.
The rich ore bodies are comparatively small pockets lined with large
crystals of stephanite, polybasite, argentite and pyrargyrite and it
is from these pockets that the remarkable specimens come. A small
series, not so extensive as had been hoped for, yet a very valuable
addition to our collections, was obtained. As incidental to this part
of the field-work, I studied some rocks in the vicinity of Arispe and
made some collections at Cananea, Sonora and Bisbee, Arizona.

From Sonora, I went to El Paso where I was joined by Mr. Harry
Berman, of the Mineralogical Museum of Harvard University, who
acted as assistant throughout the rest of the field season. After a
few days in Mexico City, where the Hon. Sr. Genaro Estrada, Act-
ing Secretary of Foreign Relations, graciously received us and ex-
tended the necessary permission for investigation and collection, we
proceeded to Guanajuato in the state of the same name. The famous
Veta Madre of Guanajuato upon which mining first began in 1558,
has probably been the richest silver-gold vein of the entire world.
The production of the district, mainly from this one vein, has reached
the enormous total of $1,000,000,000, and it is still producing about
1,000 tons of ore per day. The rich bonanza ores of the early days
now appear to be entirely exhausted, but mining is made profitable
by the efficient treatment of large bodies of low grade ore. The Veta

Madre occupies a well defined fault with schists as the foot, and
conglomerates as the hanging wall.

From Guanajuato we went to Zacatecas, another of Mexico's
famous camps. Several large veins are found in the district, the most
conspicuous being the Cantera vein prominently visible from the cen-
ter of the city. This vein can be easily followed to the south for a
distance of 15 kilometers or more. The geology of this district 1s
very similar to that of Guanajuato. Mining has almost ceased in
Zacatecas, presumably due to the exhaustion of the bodies of com-
mercial ore but a number of smaller camps in the vicinity have
promise. We visited one such district, Ojo Caliente, where the Bil-
boa Mine attracted our attention because of the abundance here of
the chloro-arsenate of lead, mimetite, and the report that other rare
minerals were obtainable in quantity. Unfortunately the low price
of lead necessitated the closing of the mine a few weeks before we
arrived, and the exceptional material known to be still in the mine
was unobtainable.

Reported new finds of fine specimens at the Ojuela Mine, visited
during the field-work of last year, brought us there. I was able to
study somewhat more in detail some of the more interesting fea-
tures of this important deposit of lead and silver and was able to
collect, together with pyromorphite and other rare and beautiful
minerals, a number of good specimens of the very rare species, car-
minite, an arsenate of lead and iron.

While in Mexico City we had the good fortune to arrange with
the officials of the Penoles Company for permission to visit Naica,
in the State of Chihuahua, and take out of the famous gypsum cave
of the Maravilla Mine two groups of the enormous crystals that are
found there. The group selected for the Museum’s exhibit consists
of 15 crystals, the smallest three feet, and the longest five feet in
length. The entire group measures ten feet in length, and will be
used to reconstruct a section of this unique cave. The two taken out
are the finest examples of large crystal groups in any Museum in the
world. Some smaller but very fine groups of clear gypsum were
also procured.

Our next stop was at the old and famous camp of Santa Eulalia
where we were able by rare good luck to collect at the Potosi Mine
some unique specimens of pyrrhotite, a sulphide of iron. Single com-
plete individuals, two inches across and an inch thick, as well as
unusual matrix specimens, are believed to be unparalleled. The ore

bodies of Santa Eulalia, aside from their great economic importance
are of unusual geological interest. They are in the form of huge
chimneys that cut across beds of limestone. From these chimneys
lateral extensions called mantos extend for variable distances hori-
zontally. One such manto which we examined in the Mina Vieja
Mine had been followed for two miles from its source and had been
in continuous ore.

Our last work was done at Los Lamentos revisiting the Ahumada
Mine. The ore body of this mine consists of a continuous maito
that follows the contact between a fine-grained blue limestone and a
highly fossiliferous pink to light gray one, and is characterized by an
aureole of dolomitized limestone about it. Beautiful specimens of
various lead minerals, wulfenite, vanadinite and descloizite are often
abundant at the Ahumada Mine and make very desirable display
specimens. Some choice material was collected and the study of the
deposit considerably extended.

The field-work in Sonora was undertaken with money from the
Roebling Fund. Later work was in collaboration with the Miner-
alogical Museum of Harvard University. For the successful field-
work I am indebted to a number of the mining men of Mexico, with-
out whose active cooperation little could have been accomplished.
GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN MICHIGAN

By ERWIN R. POHL,
Aid, Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology, U. S. National Museum

Under an arrangement existing between the U. S. National Mu-
seum and the Milwaukee Public Museum an expedition, represented
by myself for the Museum and by Mr. Gilbert Raasch, Assistant
Curator of Geology of the Milwaukee Museum, was formed with the
purpose of continuing the detailed study of the little-known but
highly important stratigraphy of the Middle Paleozoic of the mid-
eastern and central United States. In the two previous years the
work had been carried as far west as the Ontario peninsula. In pur-
suance of the general outline this year’s itinerary took us through
the northern central basin province.

The collections of the National Museum already contained much
excellent material from many of the Michigan localities; but the
disconnected data, brought together over a period of a half century
by a score of collectors interested primarily in the quality of their
specimens, was insufficient to a clear understanding of the geologic
history of the region. It was hoped that the results of this explora-
tive work would not only throw light on the gaps in the sequence
but also establish tie-points with beds of similar age in neighboring
areas.

The area covered by eastern Wisconsin, southern peninsular Michi-
gan, and southwestern Ontario is in the region of the ground moraine
of the Great Glacier. Most of the topographic features of this coun-
try are thus due to glacial phenomena and only in certain portions of
it is the bed-rock exposed. Such patches, due to subsequent denuda-
tion, are to be seen in the vicinity of Milwaukee, in a narrow band
near the northern edge of southern Michigan, and near the shores
of Lake Huron in Ontario. From the fossils contained in the out-
crops of these beds it has long been known that the period of deposi-
tion was during Middle Devonian times ; but the actual interrelations
among themselves and their positions in the type section of this age,
as it is evidenced in New York State, has formerly remained unde-
termined.

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1927 29

Our party remained at Milwaukee for a week collecting material
and data in the Lake Church and Milwaukee quarries before pro-
ceeding into Michigan. Here a camp was established at Charlevoix,
from which were explored all localities known to the Michigan Sur-
vey and many new ones. Owing to the fact that the geology was
complicated by local structure and limited exposures, camp was not
moved for two weeks. On completion of the work in the vicinity of
Little Traverse Bay, the outcrops were traced across the belt to the
eastern shore of Michigan. Much of the country is swampy and
undeveloped, and traveling is difficult away from the beaten paths of
the tourists. Irom an industrial standpoint the northern belt of
Michigan is highly interesting, for it contains several of the largest
limestone quarries in the world (fig. 29). Much of the rock is dolo-
mitized and it is impossible to produce the fine grades of cement
which we find in the New York Portland works; but a good deal
of the material is converted for alkali uses. This entire area is a
collector’s paradise, for nearly every bed in the section is crowded
with excellently preserved fossils in great variety (fig. 30). Fossils
are perhaps better known to the layman in this region than in most
districts of the United States, for the gravel of the bathing beaches
and the shores of Little Traverse Bay (figs. 27 and 28) are com-
posed of water-worn pebbles of fossil corals and shells, locally
called “ Petoskey Stones.”

A visit to Silica, Ohio, to obtain a collection of what are probably
the finest preserved Devonian fossils ever found, led to a meeting
with Dr. J. E. Carman, of Ohio State University. As this fossil
fauna has been Dr. Carman’s special province of research, a day of
collecting and study was very profitably spent with him here.

On the trip through Ontario to Limestone Mountain, Mich., addi-
tional data and collections relating to the Ordovician, Silurian, and
Lower Devonian were assembled. Limestone Mountain (fig. 31),
near Baraga at the southern end of the Keweenaw Peninsula, is an
erosional remnant or monadnock, forming an isolated reminder that
this area was below sea level during much of Lower and Middle
Palezoic times.

Up to within the present decade it was believed by the majority
of geological students that the interior of our continent was a region
of vast seas which existed with but little change over long lapses of
time. Such an inland sea, stretching from eastern New York to
Towa and Missouri, and from Kentucky to northern Michigan, was

hypothecated for the period of Hamilton deposition. The shore line,
it was admitted, was irregular and a narrow strait through which
there was supposed to be a mingling of the faunas of the eastern and
western arms of the immense sea was thought to have existed where
the state boundaries now define Wisconsin and Michigan. Dr. E. O.
Ulrich of the U. S. Geological Survey was the first to point out that
it was only in exceptional cases that such conditions prevailed, and
now, through the present detailed study, it is definitely known that the
actual conditions of deposition were quite different. It is still ques-
tionable as to just where the Wisconsin Devonian strata belong in
the general geological column; but stratigraphic observations have
established the fact that the entire Michigan section lies below that
of Ontario while the Ontario strata belong in a position below the
middle of the typical Hamilton series of New York State.

Nearly two tons of selected specimens of beautifully preserved
and finely sculptured fossil shells and corals were shipped to the
Museum. These, together with the collections already in the Mu-
seum’s possession, form as nearly a perfect series of fossils from
these beds as can be brought together.

ZOOLOGICAL EXELORAMON WIN HISPANIOVUA
By ALEXANDER WETMORE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

The island that Columbus named Hispaniola, divided politically
between the Dominican Republic and the Republic of Haiti, offers, in
its zoological features, one of the most interesting areas for study in
the West Indies. To supplement the collections previously made for
the National Museum in Hispaniola by Dr. W. L. Abbott, and to
obtain information on faunal areas and distribution for use in re-
ports now in preparation on the Abbott collections, | conducted zoo-
logical explorations on the island, under the Swales Fund, from
March 27 to June 3, 1927.

Following my arrival in Port au Prince, and a few days spent in
that vicinity, work was begun at Fonds-des-Négres in the southern
peninsula where, in company with Dr. C. H. Arndt, a considerable
area was covered, from Aquin on the south coast to the great fresh
water lake known as the Etang de Miragoane on the north. Much of
Haiti is dry and arid, but the vegetation in the better watered region
at Fonds-des-Négres appears more as is anticipated in visits to
subtropical regions. Guinea hens running wild in abundance, native
coots with smooth, glistening white plates on the forehead, gray or
green lizards 12 inches in length clinging motionless on the tree
trunks, and for some unknown reason held in the deepest fear by the
Haitian laborers, were a very few of the many attractive features of
this locality. It was here that I had opportunity to investigate the
communal nests of the palm chat, a bird peculiar to the island. The
palm chats are as large as bluebirds, and are of gregarious habit,
being found in little bands that construct at the top of some royal
palm a permanent home of sticks, a structure at times six or seven
feet in diameter.

On returning from the southern peninsula, we set out one morning
from Pétionville, a village in the hills back of the capital city, for the
great mountain ridge of La Selle. Our road, at first broad and open,
wound steadily up the slopes of the hills bordering the Cul-de-Sac
plain toward Kenscoff and Furcy to altitudes where the air was cool
and pleasant, although we looked far down into the shimmering heat

of the broad plain. Along our trail appeared the familiar weeds of
temperate climates, left as evidence of the agriculture of the period
of French colonization. On the second day of this journey, when
we approached the precipitous escarpment of La Selle itself, our
pack animals were unable to progress with their loads of camp and
collecting equipment over the steep, rocky trails, and we engaged
cheerful Haitian women as porters, finally reaching the summit of
the ridge at 7,500 feet above the sea. At camp a thousand feet below
the summit near the head of the Riviere Chotard, forests of pine
extended on either hand, while the ground below was covered with
bracken or a turf in which white clover and strawberries blossomed.
The higher peaks and many ravines were covered with a rain-forest
jungle in which trees and shrubs grew densely, interlaced with the
entangling, wirelike strands of a creeping bamboo. Parrots, vocif-
erous crows, and pigeons were abundant in the pinelands, while in
the jungles were found solitaires, a beautiful chestnut-sided robin
not previously known to science, and many other birds. In early
morning, it was pleasant to rest in the warm sun on the edge of the
1,500-foot precipice that marked the face of Morne La Visite, one
of the higher points above camp, while through the still air from the
jungle depths came the clear, flutelike notes of the musicien, the
appropriate Haitian name of the solitaire, mingled with the barbaric
beat of distant work drums to whose irregular cadence laborers toiled
and sang in a remote world of cultivated fields far below. As no
zoological collector had visited this mountain ridge so far as known,
many specimens taken were new to science. Smoothly scaled lizards,
found under flat stones and preserved on the spot in a bottle of
native rum purchased from the load borne on the head of a traveling
merchant woman, proved to be a new genus, and landshells gathered
at random were also new. By means of a tall pine tree felled for a
ladder, we climbed down into a great sink hole and discovered in a
sheltered crevice bones of extinct mammals that ranged the island
before the coming of Columbus.

Returning to the lowlands, I journeyed to Hinche in the level,
central plain where I was welcomed at the experiment station by Mr.
J. E. Boog-Scott, and pleasantly entertained while I explored for
strange birds. One journey was made as far as the caves at l’Atalaye,
where we viewed the excavations from which had come the remains
of a giant owl and numbers of other creatures that have become
extinct for no apparent reason and are known only from their skele-
tons in these deposits.

The last journey in Haiti was by airplane from Port au Prince
to the north over the central plain, past the ruins of the Citadelle of
Christophe perched on its high hill top, to Cap Haitien, and then over-
land by auto to Poste Charbert where were many things of interest.
On the return we crossed to Gonaives and for miles flew low over
the coastal swamps viewing the myriads of water birds disturbed by
our near passage, finally locating the flamingos of which we were in
search. As they rose in flight, while the plane banked above them,

I examined them quickly one by one to enjoy their beautiful colors
to the fullest extent, to find at the end of the flock, a little separated,

Throughout the period of work in Haiti the friendly cooperation
of General J. H. Russell, American High Commissioner, and
Dr. George F. Freeman, Directeur Général of the Service Technique
du Departement de l’Agriculture, was of the greatest assistance.

In Santo Domingo City, reached after a long journey by auto, the
Dominican officials received me with the greatest courtesy, and I was
40 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

soon again in the field on Samana Bay, where with headquarters at
Sanchez I had easy access to great swamps in the delta of Rio Yuna,
which drains the broad stretch of the Vega Real, to the waters and
islands of the bay itself, and to the steep, forested hills inland. The
caves in the limestone hills near San Lorenzo where native fisher-
men now live in as primitive fashion as the Indians preceding them
who had left great shell middens as indication of their tenancy, and
the colonies of pelicans, frigate birds, herons, and terns on the Cayos
de los Pajaros were of especial interest.

Continuing after two weeks to La Vega I bargained for pack
mules and was soon bound for the mountains of the interior. Leav-
ing the palms and banana plantations of the lowlands, we traveled
for miles through open forests of beautiful pines, climbed by nar-
row trails up the steep slopes of El Barrero, impassable during rains,
and came finally to the interior valley of Constanza, where the air
was cool and where, in winter, frosts come to kill tender vegetation.

At Constanza, the collections obtained included archeological as
well as zoological material, for this had been one of the favored
sites of the Indians, so that the country people found many pottery
fragments and stone implements in cultivating their fields. Birds
abounded, among them especially a song sparrow of the genus
Brachyspiza with its relatives in South and Central America, and
found elsewhere only in the interior mountains of this island. Dense
deciduous forests covered many slopes, alternating with pines in pleas-
ing contrast. A rare quail-dove inhabited the jungles, and trogons
nested in hollow trees. In climate and topography, the region, except
for its vegetation, was reminiscent of the mountains of Arizona and
New Mexico. The return to the heat of the lowlands was made with
regret, and work in the field was finally terminated on June 3 with
departure for New York from Puerto Plata.

NORA ents LORY COLLECTING BY
DR. HUGH M. SMITH IN SIAM

By DORIS M. COCHRAN,

Assistant Curator, Division of Reptiles and Batrachians, .
U.S. National Museum

Dr. Hugh M. Smith, formerly United States Commissioner of
Fisheries and now director of the fisheries of Siam and honorary
curator of zoology in the U. S. National Museum, has for the past
few years collected natural history specimens in Siam for the Mu-
seum. During 1927, continued shipments of valuable material reached
the Museum from Dr. Smith, especially during the early part of the
year before his return to Washington for a visit.

One of his most interesting experiences was a visit to Koh Tao or
Turtle Island, an island which is 40 miles from the mainland, further
removed from the coast than any others in the Gulf of Siam. This
island is uninhabited, seldom being visited even by the natives, and
never before explored by a scientific collector. Needless to say, it
yielded some new species, among them two distinct species of smooth-
scaled lizards called ‘ skinks,” and one beautiful little snake which is
about as large as a pencil. It is reddish-brown above with a black ring
around the neck and another near the end of the tail, which is light
blue underneath.

Dr. Smith’s own house and garden in Bangkok are excellent places
to collect amphibians and reptiles. There is a tree near his verandah
which is the home of a green bamboo-snake ; he often sees this indi-
vidual lying along a branch sunning itself and waiting for an unwary
lizard. The house itself is not free from reptile invaders, as the little
soft-bodied lizards called “ house-geckos”’ are fond of taking up
their abode wherever the moths are attracted by lights. The pond
in his garden is a favorite resort of the water-snakes, which feed on
the fish and on the amphibians which come there to breed. The
common toad of Siam, often found in his garden, is decorated on
the upper surfaces with sharp tubercles, black in the center and a
deep raspberry pink at the edges.

Many odd forms of fish occur in Siam, although the dry season
is very hard on them and they have had to adapt themselves in many

ways to withstand the yearly desiccation. Some aestivate in damp
soil for as long a time as four months. A regular form of fishing in
Siam is to dig in a dried-up marsh to the depth of two or three feet,
where many fish called “ serpent-heads ” are to be found. These are
very good to eat. The climbing perch Anabas is the most remarkable
of all the aestivators ; it is always popular in the markets, being sold

The cord is fastened to a wooden sliver, the point of which rests in a de-
pression at the center of the bow. When the noose is drawn out and the
trap is ready, the bow is under considerable tension, so that it is sprung at

steep canal banks by means of its tail and the large pectoral fins. It
goes overland from one body of water to another and travels as fast
as a man walking slowly.

During the year Dr. Smith collected about 200 species of birds,
18 of them being woodpeckers. One of the most daintily colored
of all Asiatic birds is the Jambu fruit pigeon. The anterior half

middle of the throat, the upper parts including wings and tail are
brilliant green, the lower parts are white with the under tail-coverts
chestnut, and with a wash of peach-blossom pink on the chest. Mem-
bers of the crow and jay family were not numerous; one of the
crested jays of Cochin China and Siam (Cissa hypoleuca), however,
is especially handsome. It is a pale green above and greenish yellow
below ; the bill, wings and feet are red; there is a broad black stripe
from the bill extending through the eyes and out to the tip of the
long crest. In the course of a few years museum specimens are said
to fade out, the lower parts becoming whitish and the green of the
upper parts turning to blue.

The crustaceans sent by Dr. Smith have proved extremely inter-
esting, as the specimens are always excellently preserved, especially
some very fine “ squillas,” the largest ever received here.

The land shells number over 1,200 specimens and the collection con-
tains several species not heretofore represented in our Siamese ma-
terial, and likewise numerous specimens from new localities.

Dr. Smith’s collections of mammals, insects, and plants are equally
extensive, and his material in all branches is especially valuable since
it augments the early work of Dr. W. L. Abbott who secured many
specimens from the Malay Peninsula for the Museum.
Tit Cw sTACE MNS OF SOUTH AMERICA
By WALDO L. SCHMITT,

Curator, Division of Marine Invertebrates, U. S. National Museum

The conclusion of last year’s account of my study of the crustacean
fauna of South America under the Walter Rathbone Bacon Travelling
Scholarship * left me on my way by steamer to that ‘‘ Vale of Para-
dise,” Valparaiso, Chile, which I reached November 18, 1926. During
stops en route to discharge and take on cargo—stops often of some
hours duration—intertidal collections were made at Tocopilla, Antofa-
gasta, Chanaral, and Cruz Grande, Chile. Valparaiso I should call
the San Francisco of South America in almost every respect, the busi-
ness-like atmosphere, the hills, the narrow streets of the older town,
and the stimulating
can city.

Through the kindness of Senor Doniez, part owner of the spiny-
lobster fishing concession on the Island of Juan Fernandez, I had the
good fortune to be furnished passage to that historic place, the one-
time home of Alexander Selkirk, the hero of Robinson Crusoe. The
spiny-lobster or crawfish fishery of Juan Fernandez is one of the
largest of its kind and the total catch of over 87,000 individuals as
given in the Chilean fishery statistics for 1925 for the two companies
operating in those waters exceeds in number of pounds the combined
catches made in California and Florida, where related species are
taken for the market.

The extremely generous hospitality of Senor Rene Durand and
his family rendered most pleasant and profitable a sojourn of 20
delightful December days in this veritable earthly paradise. Few
places are blessed with such an ideal, healthful and fruitful climate.
Preliminary studies on some of the zoological collections | brought
back with me have disclosed a distinct species of New Zealand crab
new to this fauna, and a spider of a genus known from South Africa,
Australia, and New Zealand, and now found here, the first record
for the Western hemisphere. The zoological evidence of the Poly-
nesian and subantarctic affinities of the life of Juan Fernandez has
never been as strong as that based on botanical data, and these two
finds are therefore rendered all the more significant.

It is a pleasure to acknowledge the cordial reception accorded me
at the National Museum of Chile in Santiago by Dr. Eduardo Moore,
the Director of that Institution; Dr. Juan Briiggen of the University
of Chile; and Dr. Carlos E. Porter, the indefatigable Chilean zoolo-
gist. Dr. Porter is to be highly commended for his personal financial
support of the Revista Chilena Historia Natural, the only periodical
of its kind published in Chile.

In Santiago I visited Dr. Ernesto Maldonado, Director of the
Chilean T*orest, Fish and Game Commission, as well as the very
excellent small museum maintained by this department. In consulta-
tion with Dr. Maldonado and Dr. Augusto Opazo of the Fisheries
Service, plans were outlined by which the Smithsonian Institution
would undertake to prepare a report on the crustacea of the coasts
of Chile, based upon material to be collected and shipped to Wash-
ington for the purpose. To the American Ambassador to Chile,
Mr. Collier, are due thanks for his kindness in lending a member of
his staff to this preliminary discussion.

The Museum of the University of Concepcion, although small, is
growing and covers a wide range of activities. It is the best museum
of its kind that it was my pleasure to visit on the west coast of South
America. That it is an institution of great promise is due almost
entirely to the energy and enthusiasm of its Director, Dr. Carlos
Oliver Schneider.

From Taleahuano, Castro on the Island of Chiloe was reached
five days later, after short stops en route, permitting some shore col-
lecting at Lota, and. at Corral. Southward through Chonos. Archi-
pelago- and the-canals of southern Chile to the Straits of Magellan,
the ‘scenery in many respects compares favorably with that of the
Inland Passage to Alaska. This vast stretch of coast from Castro
south, over 1,000 miles in a straight line, is still a “ terra incognita,”
with little more known of its resources and scientific potentialities than
when Darwin first visited the region 84 years ago. Collections of
animals were made at Punta Arenas, Chile, before visiting the Falk-
land Islands. In Punta Arenas is a wonderful little museum main-
tained by the Salesian Brotherhood. It is a treasure house of things
and rarities Fuegian, and is well worth a visit by ethnologists interested
in this fast disappearing race of Indians.

Port Stanley, Falklands, was reached after what I considered a
rather tempestuous passage, during which the galley of the. small
schooner in which the journey was. made was flooded, the potatoes
and other vegetables washed over-board, and the motor-room hatch

weather! The Falklands are well-known in scientific annals chiefly
through the visitations of Darwin and of the “ Challenger,” and
through the collections of Mr. Rupert Vallentin. Most helpful assist-
ance was extended me during more than a month’s stay (February to
April, 1927) on East Falkland by the Governor, the Colonial officials,
and all the private citizens with whom | came in contact. The interest
of the school boys of Stanley caused them to bring in a number of
specimens which might otherwise not have been obtained ; and a briet
talk to a class of pupils at Teal Inlet resulted in establishing a new
record of the occurrence of one of the rarer shrimps (Campylonotus
vagans Bate), heretofore known from the Straits of Magellan, Cape
Horn and South Georgia, taken by Miss Eileen Felton from the
roots of kelp hauled from water about two fathoms in depth for the
purpose of fertilizing the fields.

Taking advantage of an opportunity offered while in the Falklands,
a trip was made via the once-yearly mail boat to Deception Island of
the South Shetlands, the headquarters of the whaling industry of
that region. On the way, several tow-net hauls yielded a number of
organisms new to the National Museum collections.

In the course of my return journey to the States, beginning April 28
in the Falkland Islands, collections were made at several ports in
Argentine Patagonia: Rio Gallegos, Santa Cruz, San Julian, Deseada,
Comodoro Rivadavia, and Puerto Madryn. At Buenos Aires,
through the continuing kindness of Dr. Doello-Jurado, Director of
the Argentine National Museum, a loan of further study collections
of crustacea was obtained. At Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Museo Paulista,
from which we have had most helpful cooperation for a great many
years, was revisited during the two days that the northward bound
steamer was taking its cargo of coffee on board at Santos. I arrived
in New York on June 7, reaching Washington two days later.

The most grateful acknowledgment is due to the memory of
Mrs. Virginia Purdy Bacon and her son, Walter Rathbone Bacon, in
whose honor she founded the travelling scholarship which made pos-
sible this general reconnaissance of the marine fauna of the greater
part of the coasts of South America, resulting in more than 15,000
specimens, and many valuable notes and observations. A great deal
of this material is new to the National Museum’s collections, including
many additional records of occurrence and distribution, and, as far
as the limited preliminary studies have indicated, a number of species
new to science.

THE CERION BREEDING EXPERIMENTS

Fifteen years ago at the invitation of Dr. Alfred G. Mayor, the
then Director of the Marine Biological Laboratory of the Carnegie
Institution, I joined his expedition to Andros Island, Bahamas. I was
to devote my attention to the general invertebrate fauna of the region.

In looking over the general field, particularly that of mollusks in
preparation for this work, I decided to let alone one group of these
creatures, namely, members of the genus Cerion, for it was a some-
what tacit understanding that people who had devoted themselves
to this group had become more or less hopelessly entangled in it, and
some were even considered as having become slightly locoed.

The old saying about a certain group of individuals stepping in
where angels fear to tread, proved again to be an established fact,
for shortly after landing at the White House on South Bight, Andros
Island, I found myself picking up what I later named Cerion
casablancae, and that was the beginning of many years of work, for
I am still at the problem and will probably continue to be for some
time to come.

A little before going to the Bahamas, I had worked over the col-
lection made by Owen Bryant on these islands, which was described
by Dr. Dall.” That bit of work enabled me to understand why it
took a man of Dr. Dall’s standing to have the courage to describe
new species of Cerions then. At that time it was the generally as-
sumed belief that Cerions were a most plastic group, readily changing
under the influence of changes in environment. In a general way we
believed that a dry year might affect the food supply and activity
and growth of individuals, and young born under such conditions
would probably show the effect by having smaller shells or slightly
different sculpture, or other characteristics that might differentiate
them from individuals born under more propitious circumstances.
It is a fact that at the beginning of our studies, very little was known
about Cerions except descriptions of shells and that ey usually
occurred in large numbers wherever found. a

My gathering of some 8,000 specimens in a space the size of an
ordinary room finally caused me to cast caution aside and to take a
large series of two races of these creatures with me to the Florida
Keys, and there to subject them to all possible conditions of environ-
ment and to watch for results. We marked the Bahama specimens
by putting two fine, closely spaced file scratches on the shell of each
individual, and planted them in colonies of 500 each on Florida Keys,
beginning with the Ragged Keys a little south of Miami and con-
tinuing from there south into the Gulf to the Dry Tortugas. It was
somewhat of a surprise when we visited these colonies the next year
to find that no adult offsprings were present. The same surprise
was met the following year, and it was not until the third year that
we found Florida grown individuals that had attained a mature stage.
So one chapter was added to the life history of Cerions, that it took
three years for Bahama Cerions to mature, not a single season as
had previously been assumed. To this I may add that we have also
found that Cerions from Curacao and the Greater Antilles require
an additional year to attain their full growth.

Succeeding generations have been kept in isolated colonies, and
in that way we have been able to determine the part played by
changes of environment. Of course we expected that we would get
a broad expression of changes, for we had placed our colonies under
all possible conditions of habitat which we believed would affect their
food supply as well. At that time we believed that Cerions fed upon
the plants upon which they climb, another error that our observa-
tions have rectified, for we now know that they dine largely, if not
wholly, upon the fungal mycelia, minute plants and probably animals
living immediately below the surface of the ground.

In our first experiments two species of Cerions were colonized on
the Florida Keys, namely, Cerion casablancae and Cerion viaregis,
the first coming from the south side of South Bight, and the second
from the north side of South Bight at its eastern end. The first series
of Florida grown offsprings secured showed no measurable charac-
ters differing from those found among specimens from the parent
stock from the Bahamas. The second generation proved equally
unresponsive, and it is this generation which is usually considered
the critical one by naturalists, and here we had looked for possible
expressions of changes due to the changed environment, for in this
generation both the germplasm and somaplasm had a chance to adjust
to the new environmental conditions. bd

These experiments therefore proved that Cerions were not as un-
stable in characters as some had held, but rather the contrary. Since
then, other species have been added, namely, Cerion uva from

ee
SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1927 55

Curacao, Cerion crassilabre from Porto Rico, of which we have
also had two generations of Florida grown offsprings. While these
took four years for development, they told the same story presented
by the Bahama Cerions, namely, that they did not respond to changes
in environment in these two generations. A number of other forms
have since been added and are being subjected to the same critical
LESES:

On the Newfound Harbor Key in the Florida Key chain, we mixed a
colony of Cerion viaregis with native Florida Cerion incanum, and
great was our surprise to find three years later a hybrid between
these two species. This was the more startling because the Florida
group is not represented in the Bahama Islands, and its ancestors
are traceable on the Florida Keys back to Oligocene times. The
cross therefore was one of very distantly related things, and the
specimens secured of the first generation of this cross were true
hybrids showing intermediate characters between the two in about
equal proportion to the two ancestors, and very uniform in appear-
ance. The second generation of this hybrid group, however, was a
surprise, for now an endless number of mutations appeared, cover-
ing almost everything in the field of Cerions except spiral sculpture.
There is a tremendous difference in size, general shape, sculpture,
and coloration in the various individuals.

This finding reminds one very much of De Vries’ Oenothera prob-
lem, the basis of his mutation theory, due to a similar hybridization
cause, and also that presented by certain of the more recent experi-
ments on insects, and caused us to attempt the crossing of individual
pairs of Cerions instead of the mass reaction as featured by the New-
found Key colony. For this purpose, cages were employed at first.
The fine meshed screen of these cages, however, intercepted the
formation of dew within the cages, which in turn apparently reacted
on the food supply as well as the moisture supply of the Cerions, and
resulted in killing them. The making of islands was then resorted
to, and we have at the present time a series of small islands en-
closed by trenches which are kept filled with water and serve as a
barrier across which our mollusks will not pass. On these islands as
well as in cut down cages—mere board enclosures with a strip of
monel metal wire bent inward, tacked to the upper free edge of the
boards, which leaves the central portion of the cage exposed to the
normal atmospheric conditions—pairs of Cerions have been planted
in the hope of obtaining the desired individual cross. These studies
are going on at the present time. Meantime we have dissected too
of the hybrids from the Newfound Harbor colony, and found most

interesting variations in the anatomy of these creatures produced by
hybridization.

A series of specimens of Cerion viaregis Bartsch and Cerion
incanum Binney were sent to Professor Charles Jeffreys, Harvard
University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, for Chromosome studies. To
these will shortly be added a series of the hybrids of these two species
produced in the Newfound Harbor Key colony, for the same purpose.

Dr. Carlos de la Torre, of Havana, called my attention to a wild
native hybrid of Cerion tridentatum and Cerion paracuta which oc-
curs on the north coast of Cuba at Playa de Muerto a little west of
Bahia de Jaruco. Under the guidance of Sr. Guillermo Aguayo, |
visited the place and made a large gathering of specimens of both
parents and hybrids. A series of these are now being dissected by
students of mine at George Washington University, and specimens
have also been sent to Professor Jeffreys for Chromosome study.
The general picture presented by this native hybrid colony is similar
to that which we produced by crossing Cerion viaregis and Cerion
incanum on Newfound Harbor Key, Florida.

UNDERSEA ECOLOGY

The Tortugas region of the Florida Keys was long known as pre-
senting one of the richest faunal assemblages on the Atlantic coast.
For reasons not as yet entirely solved, but probably involving a num-
ber of factors, this fauna became materially reduced, and even at
the present time, from a molluscan standpoint, is exceedingly poor.

During our Philippine cruise in 1907 to 1910, I became very much
interested in the possibility of taking undersea pictures to show the
ecologic conditions under which organisms exist, and during the 1912
cruise to the Bahamas I took a series of photographs through a
truncate cone water glass from the surface. Later the development
of the diving hood presented new factors, because by means of this
apparatus one is able to spend as much time as one chooses undersea
without great discomfort, and enjoy undersea rambles which give
one an entirely new concept of the adjustments of creatures to the
undersea environment. A view through a glass bottomed boat or
a water glass does not reveal the subsea atmosphere as it actually
exists, and you do not become conscious of this until you are actu-
ally undersea and looking in a horizontal direction, for then you at
once become aware of the significance of the silvery sides of the
pelagic fishes which correspond beautifully with the general tone
of the background.

Hurricanes destroyed the major portion of the Staghorn coral
reefs since our early visits to the Tortugas group, and these are now

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1927 59

rapidly coming back. A series of undersea photographs taken in dif-
ferent years in the same place show the changes which occur in the
region from year to year, and over a number of years, produces a
very interesting record as to what really takes place. Not only that,
but with the aid of the undersea camera, it has been possible to
show the associations of different types of animals in the different
regions. These faunal associations are exceedingly definite and in-
teresting not only to the student of living organisms but also to the
student of fossil creatures, for you may have the reef building corals
in one place with all the fish, mollusks, echinoderms, gorgonians,
worms, etc., associated therewith, and not more than 50 feet away
you may have a grass flat with an entirely different assemblage of
creatures always found there and peculiar to such a place. If you
were to have these creatures fossilized, and you had two exposures,
one yielding the grass flat fauna and the other the reef fauna, you
might be hard put to understand that these things were really syn-
chronous elements. In order to have a definite record of the changes
and also faunal associations, | have taken undersea pictures of these
things, as time permitted, and likewise a series of undersea moving
pictures, which show the animals in action. During 1927 I added
2,900 feet of moving picture film and 144 O Graphic films.

WEST INDIAN LAND SHELL STUDIES

The late Mr. John B. Henderson, formerly a member of the Smith-
sonian Board of Regents, had intended to devote the major portion
of his scientific efforts to a study of the West Indian land shell prob-
lem. With that end in view, a number of expeditions were made by
him and the writer, and various other friends, particularly Dr. Carlos
de la Torre, of Havana, to many places in the Greater Antilles. These
expeditions, as well as old collections purchased by Mr. Henderson
and the material secured from collectors more recently has given
to the U. S. National Museum probably a larger series of West
Indian material than is contained in all the other museums of the
world together. Thanks to financial aid rendered by Dr. Charles T.
Simpson, of Little River, Florida, it has been possible to obtain
necessary assistance to push this work on the West Indian land
shell problem more rapidly than would otherwise have been possible,
and this has resulted in the practical completion of a monograph on
the large family of land shells known as the Annulariidae.

In order to make this monograph as complete as possible, the
writer in September visited Dr. Carlos de la Torre at Havana, Cuba,
to examine his rich private collection, which embraces by far the
most magnificent assemblage of Cuban land mollusks in existence.

It is the product of a lifetime of collecting by a veteran naturalist
assisted by a corps of associates, students, and loving friends. The
month spent in reviewing the land shells of this family in his collec-
tion resulted not only in the material expansion of our systematic
knowledge of the group, but also in the discovery of almost 200
unnamed forms. It likewise revealed that there still remained a
number of regions in that large island which have been untouched
and which will yield a rich harvest to the collector. The granting of
the Walter Rathbone Bacon Travelling Scholarship by the Smith-
sonian Institution to the writer will make it possible to explore these
regions before the manuscript on this family is sent to press. During
our study at Havana the collections of the Academy of Sciences,
Colegio de la Salle, and Colegio de los Escolapios were also ex-
amined, and interesting information gleaned therefrom.

The study of the West Indian land mollusks soon revealed that
while Jamaica already possesses some 600 named forms of land
shells, largely described by Professor C. B. Adams of Amherst Col-
lege, most of these specimens were without definite locality data, and
for that reason it was deemed desirable to have some one finetooth
comb this island in order that we might be able, by comparing Adams’
material with these new collections, to fix type localities for these
older species. This would likewise enable us to determine the range
of distribution of Jamaican forms. With this end in view, Mr. C. R.
Orcutt was prevailed upon to visit the Island, and he has now spent
a little more than a year in the pursuit of mollusks and has sent
thousands of specimens to the National Museum which will help to
clear up the problems mentioned above.

For the same reason Mr. Walter J. Eyerdam spent several months
in collecting land shells in unexplored portions of Haiti, which will
also assist in elucidating problems in zoogeographic distribution in
that Island.

Here, too, should be mentioned the contribution made in this direc-
tion by Dr. Alexander Wetmore’s expedition to the same island,
which added a number of novelties.

These studies of West Indian land shells are exceedingly fascinat-
ing and interesting, for they throw considerable light upon the deriva-
tion and distribution of the West Indian faunas.

BIRD STUDIES ON THE FLORIDA KEYS

In 1927, as during the past 15 years, I kept records of the birds
seen during my visit to the Florida Keys. This has resulted in the
accumulation of a large amount of information upon the migration of
62 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

birds and the breeding habits of resident species, and has likewise
furnished some interesting data on the adjustment of birds to changes
of conditions. Bird Key, a small island of the Tortugas group, which
was some 400 by 200 feet when I first visited these islands, has
shrunk to a little more than a third of that size through the action
of hurricanes and other storms. Here some 30,000 Sooty and Noddy
Terns come annually to breed. Fifteen years ago the Noddies bred
exclusively in the Bay Cedars and other trees, even in the axils of
the leaves of the tall cocoanut palms. All of the trees having been
destroyed by storms, the Noddies are now breeding upon the ground
as the Sooty Terns have always done. Photographs were taken year

by year showing the gradual adjustment from the tree nesting habit to
brush nesting, and finally to sand nesting. It is interesting to ob-
serve such a tenacity to a nesting site, particularly so since Logger-
head Key, which is only a short distance away and across which the
Terns are constantly flying, is still heavily covered with Bay Cedars
but has not been chosen as a new nesting site by the colony.

This vear yielded one addition to the birds previously recorded *
for the Tortugas group—the Nonpareil, Passerina ciris, seen and
photographed on Garden Key. We also secured a series of photo-
eraphs from a blind of the following birds: Least Sandpiper, Semi-
palmated Sandpiper, Sanderling, Willet, Spotted Sandpiper, Semi-
palmated Plover, and Turnstone. A report upon the 15 years of
bird observations upon the Florida Keys is in preparation.

TAP ONATURAL HISTORY OF THE NORTH SHORE OF
LEIGUER ORS LAWRENCE
By PAUL BARTSCH,
Curator, Division of Mollusks, U. S. National Muscium

At the invitation of Mr. Copley Amory, of Washington, D. C., a
collecting expedition to Mr. Amory’s estate on Matamek River on
the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence was sent out in the sum-
mer of 1927 by the U. S. National Museum. The party consisted of
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Bowman, of George Washington University, and
the writer. It was Mrs. Bowman’s purpose, under the writer’s direc-
tion, to gather as much as possible of the local marine invertebrate
faunas, particularly mollusks. With these specimens was to be kept
an accurate record of the environmental conditions under which these
organisms exist, including depth, character of bottom, bottom tempera-
ture, and salinity. Samples of bottom and water were to be taken
also at every station.

Mr. Amory placed at the party’s disposal a power boat and a
spacious laboratory well equipped with all the needed outfit for
oceanographic research, and saw to it that we were well housed and
more than well fed. Not only that, but he was ever ready to give us
the benefit of his knowledge of local conditions acquired through
many years of summer residence at this place, as well as actual per-
sonal help, and this meant much, for our party consisted largely of
land lubbers, while Mr. Amory might enter a race with any seaman
in bending on a dredge or splicing a line.

A series of hauls were accordingly made along the coast. In addi-
tion to the marine dredging, careful collecting was done along the
beaches and the shallow water lagoons. The tide pools were made to
yield their creatures by the judicious use of copper sulphate at low
tide, which soon brings all animals not fixed to rocks from their
hiding, and enables the collector to scoop them up with his dipnet.
Mrs. Bowman also carefully explored the pools, lakes, and streams of
the region for fresh-water organisms, and likewise made a careful
search for land mollusks. The gathering of the latter was rather an
ingenious proceeding. The land about Matamek is formed chiefly of
rock, deficient in lime, with an acid soil condition which makes this

region a very poor habitat for land mollusks. These, therefore, are
very poorly represented both in number of species and individuals. It
was found, however, that they were as easily attracted to lime baits as
mammals are to salt baits. By making a series of stations through
the area, and placing a handful of lime in each, it was possible to
sufficiently concentrate these creatures to secure a representative
series from the region. In addition to these efforts, Mrs. Bowman
made careful observation on the Ecto- and FEndoparasites of all
fish caught. She likewise made a careful analysis of the stomach
contents of these animals.

Mr. Bowman devoted his time to a consideration of the plants of
the region, covering everything from marine and fresh-water algae to
the flowering plants. The latter presented an exceedingly interesting
study. The short growing season in this northern latitude produced
a condensation which is simply marvellous, each day presenting new
assemblages, while the old passed out with equal rapidity.

We were there early enough to watch the trees break into leaf and
bloom, and by the time the party left, September 2, many of the trees
had reached their autumn tint and were shedding their leaves. Mr.
Bowman made the interesting observation that, upon their arrival,
the sea on the north shore was covered with floating grains of conifer
pollen. This was before the conifers on the north shore had sprung
into bloom, and he believes that this pollen was carried all the way
from the south shore of the Gulf. The comparative seasonal develop-
ment of those two regions would make an interesting study.

Mr. Bowman also made a careful investigation of the peat bogs
and found an extended hochmoor which he says is still in an early
stage of development, consisting of about seven feet of soupy sphag-
num resting on a sand bottom. The oldest and most interesting de-
posit found was covered with a spruce forest and consists of about
11 feet of dark peat placed upon a bottom of gray sand and clay.
Serial cores of these peat bogs were taken and the samples shipped
to Washington for microscopic study. In these land explorations for
plants, Mr. Amory generously provided an Indian guide whose experi-
ence and knowledge of the place were of inestimable value.

The writer returned after a short stay, and Mr. and Mrs. Bowman
remained until September 2. A large amount of material was collected,
including both animals and plants, a report on which was in prepara-
tion at the close of 1927.
(iE Pies OF Tk WESTERN MOUNTAINS

By J. M. ALDRICH,
Associate Curator, Division of Insects, U. S. National Museuin

Many mountainous regions of the western United States have never
been visited by an entomologist interested chiefly in flies, and other
such regions are poorly represented in the extensive collections of
flies in the U. S. National Museum. For these reasons I undertook
in the summer of 1927 to visit a number of localities of special interest
in the West.

The vicinity of Wells, Nevada, was the most important of these.
Here there are large mountains, the East Humboldt Range, carrying
much snow in early summer and giving rise to several important
streams. There is also some seepage from the range which produces
marshes a few miles from the base in the high plateau adjacent, which
has an altitude of a little more than 5,000 feet. In one of these marshes
I had collected for an hour as I stopped between trains in 1911, with
such surprising results (20 or more new species) that I had always
intended to visit the place again. This I was enabled to do last summer,
spending six days at Wells.

Next in importance was the Yellowstone National Park, where the
forested and well-watered plateau of about 7,500 feet altitude seemed
an ideal collecting region, but had been visited hardly at all by col-
lectors of flies for the National Museum. My visit in August was a
trifle late for the best weather, but the flies were more numerous
than in any other place in which I had ever collected. Six days here
gave excellent results.

Lake Tahoe, California, is a large and beautiful lake at 6,200 feet
altitude, among the high Sierras. Moist meadows around the south end
of the lake provided good collecting, and three days were spent here ;
I then moved down the east side of the Sierras past Mono Lake,
where the dryness of the season gave no promise of success in col-
lecting, and proceeded up Leevining Canyon to a camping place near
its head, just above Ellery Lake. The altitude of the camp was about
9,500 feet, with large banks of snow only a few yards from the tent.
Insects were naturally much less numerous in such a cold place, but
those captured were of especial interest because of the great altitude.

The higher portion of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado are still
yielding many new species of flies, though numerous collectors have
been there. I had hoped to make a stop at Tennessee Pass, at 10,430
feet altitude, where I had collected twice before, but my plans necessi-
tated a rather early start from Washington and the season was still too
early at the Pass, with freezing temperatures every night and cold
rains by day. However, I stopped on the South Fork of the Platte
River west of Pike’s Peak at about 8,500 feet altitude and found good
collecting ; my camp here was a very satisfactory one.

Fic. 73—On Ten Sleep Creek, Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming.

The Black Hills of South Dakota are important in the distribution
of the mountain forms of life, since they represent the easternmost
extension of the Rocky Mountain region. In 1892 I had collected
there for two weeks, the results being now incorporated in the National
Museum. Since the Hills are at some distance from all the transconti-
nental railroads, few entomologists have stopped there, and we possess
almost no flies from the region except those obtained on my former
visit. I had planned to make a stop there on this trip, but the season
was too late by the time I had come that far back. It was therefore
deemed expedient to visit the Hills on another trip, in the earlier part
of the summer.

These were the chief localities included in the plan of the trip, but
I had opportunities to collect in the forested foothills of North Idaho,
72 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

including the vicinity of Lake Waha and Craig’s Mountain, south of
Lewiston ; Mount Moscow, near the town of Moscow, the type locality
of many species described within the past 20 years; Gold Hill, and
Yale, northeast and east of Potlatch.

In order to visit so many scattered places, the trip was made by
automobile. My wife accompanied me, and we camped most of the
way. Our route was to Colorado Springs, across the Rockies by
Tennessee Pass, through Salt Lake City to Wells; thence to Reno,
crossing the Sierras at Tioga Pass, just above our camp at Ellery
Lake; thence across the San Joaquin Valley to Monterey and north
to San Francisco; up the Sacramento Valley and through Western
Oregon to Portland, and through the Inland Empire to Spokane ;
thence by Missoula, Butte and Three Forks to the Yellowstone Park ;
crossing the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming, and home across
South Dakota, Southern Minnesota, etc. The distance traveled was
over 9,000 miles, and the trip was made without mishap. The accom-
panying illustrations show a few of the collecting places and some-
thing of the traveling and camping conditions.

Several thousand flies were brought back ; it will require more time
to study the material sufficiently to tell how many species new to
science were obtained, but there is no reason to doubt that the results
were of substantial value.
BOQANICAL EXPLORATION IN EASTERN COLOMBIA
BY PLES WORTH BE LTP.

Assistant Curator, Division of Plants, U. S. National Mfuseum

Little is known of the plant life of the Eastern Cordillera of Colom-
bia north of the Bogota region. No expeditions from the United
States had previously visited the area, and the collections of the few
European botanists to penetrate this not easily accessible region—Lin-
den, Kalbreyer, Karsten, Funck and Schlim—consist mainly of the
more showy plants. Moreover, very few of these specimens have found
their way into American herbaria, so in continuation of the botanical
exploration of northern South America, begun in 1917 jointly by the
New York Botanical Garden, the Gray Herbarium of Harvard Uni-
versity, and the National Museum, Mr. Albert C. Smith, collaborator
in the Division of Plants, and I spent the winter of 1926-1927 in
Colombia, mainly in the eastern mountainous region. In the present
enterprise cooperation was extended also by the Arnold Arboretum.

In arranging for the trip and in carrying out our plans valuable
assistance was received from the Colombian Minister to the United
States, the Pan American Union, the United Fruit Company, the
governors of the various departments visited, and the representatives
of several American commercial houses in Colombia.

We arrived at Cartagena October 29, 1926, and spent several days
collecting at La Popa and Boca Grande and on Manga and Tierra-
bomba Islands, all of which are botanically historic localities in the
vicinity of the port. Turbaco, a village at the crest of the low hills
east of Cartagena, was our next base. Here Humboldt and Bonpland
spent several days before ascending the Magdalena River on their
way to Quito, and it is the type locality for several species. Though a
considerable part of the land is at present under cultivation, dense
woods still remain to the westward and nearly impenetrable thickets
cover considerable areas. Particularly interesting were the mud
volcanoes, about nine miles from Turbaco, where we made fairly large
collections.

A three days’ trip up the Magdalena River next brought us to
Puerto Wilches, the terminus of a railroad which eventually will
reach into the heart of the Eastern Cordillera. Collections were made

in the dense tropical jungle surrounding the town and extending east-
ward to the base of the mountains.

On December 3 we left the railroad at Provincia, the eastern end
of the portion which is open for traffic, and from then on, until we
emerged from the mountains on the far eastern side near Cucuta,
our only means of transportation was by mule.

Once in the mountains, headquarters were established at the delight-
ful city of Bucaramanga, and this served as our main base for two
and a half months. Bucaramanga is one of several thriving Colom-
bian cities linked to the outside world only by mule trails and air-
plane. Its streets, however, are filled with autos and autobuses and
its shops are well stocked with goods from this country and Europe.
The capital of a department in which coffee is abundantly grown and
which leads in the production of oil, it is at present experiencing a
high degree of prosperity. The Governor and other officials of the
Department of Santander, as well as private citizens, extended every
courtesy to us, and much of our success in collecting about 17,000
specimens in this area was due to this highly appreciated cooperation.

Situated on a plateau which drops abruptly to deep valleys on three
sides, the immediate vicinity of Bucaramanga was not especially inter-
esting botanically ; but areas to the south, east, and north, distant two
to four days by mule travel, were exceedingly rich. The Mesa de los
Santos, a broad plateau about 1,500 meters above sea level, was first
visited. Although there was no range of altitude here, the presence
of dense woods, sandy fields, marshes, and rocky cliffs, all within a
few miles of our inn, resulted in a wide diversity of plant life.

Our second trip from Bucaramanga took us eastward to the isolated
region about Las Vegas. From our base established here at 2,600
meters, in the midst of a rich vegetation, a two days’ trip was made
to the Paramo de las Vegas, the highest point of which lies at 3,800
meters elevation. Among the more interesting plants collected along
this trail were the Colombian May-flower, with showy magenta
flowers, a scarlet-flowered loranthus, related to our mistletoe, a species
of adder’s-tongue fern, several rare passion flowers, the large-fruited
blackberry, and a species of Espeletia. This last group of curious
woolly plants, locally known as frailejones, is characteristic of the
higher mountain plateaus.

The month of January and the first part of February were spent
about Surata, Charta, and California, to the north of Bucaramanga,
an area thought to be well worth visiting because of the rich collections
made there by Linden and by Funck and Schlim. From California,

Mr. Smith made a week’s trip to the paramos of Vetas, Santurban,
Mogotocoro, Rico, and Frailejonale, and I spent the following week
in the vicinity of La Baja, visiting the paramos of Las Puentes,
Las Coloradas, and Romeral.

On February 18 we started on our long journey to Pamplona over
the vast paramo of Santurban, the bleak region that so effectively
cuts off the northeastern part of Colombia from the rest of the country.
In the immediate neighborhood of this city nearly all the land had
been cleared, so we moved on at once to Toledo, due east and close to
the Venezuelan border. Here, at the headwaters of the Orinoco
system, a flora vastly different from that to the westward was found.

Having completed our work in the Eastern Cordillera we proceeded
back to the coast as directly as possible, by way of Cucuta, Maracaibo,
Curacao, and Puerto Colombia, making small collections at each of
these places.

In the course of the present exploration approximately 7,200 col-
lecting numbers were obtained, represented by nearly 30,000 speci-
mens. In this collection are about 800 numbers of ferns, 300 of
orchids, over 200 of the mimosa and cassia families, approximately
75 morning-glories and 100 passion flowers, and nearly 700 Com-
positae ; about a third of the collection consists of woody plants. Sets
have been distributed to the cooperating institutions and the work of
identification has been begun.

The routes of the three expeditions which have gone into Colombia
in connection with the present exploration work are shown on the
accompanying map (p. 74). Although 60,000 specimens in all have
been collected, there are, it will be noted, several wholly untouched
areas, such as the Amazon and Orinoco basins in the southeastern
part, the northwest section adjacent to Panama, and the Pasto region,
near the Ecuador border. Additional work should be done also in the
Santa Marta Mountains and among the isolated peaks at the northern
end of the Western Cordillera.
A OPARCH HOR RUBBER IN: TEXAS
Bye. Ne ROSE,

Associate Curator, Division of Plants, U. S. National Museum

To learn whether any of the native plants of central and southern
Texas might be of value as a source of rubber, I visited that region
in October, 1927, under the auspices of Mr. Thomas A. Edison.
Inasmuch as the United States Department of Agriculture is also
greatly interested in possible new sources of rubber, Mr. Paul G.
Russell was detailed by that Department to accompany me.

We left Washington October 5 and returned November 11. A small
automobile was used in the work, enabling us to cover a much wider
territory than would otherwise have been possible. We began work
at Austin, Texas, making the University of Texas our headquarters,
from which, under the direction of Prof. B. C. Tharp and his col-
leagues, we thoroughly explored that region. One day was spent in
studying the interesting flora of the Edwards Plateau, and on another
day we visited the new site of the University’s botanical garden,
which includes 500 acres lying on both sides of the Colorado River.
This area is very suitable for a botanical garden, for the land is exceed-
ingly diverse, consisting of high river bluffs, tree-covered knolls, deep
canyons, and wooded flats. It supports a rich native flora and, when
improved with good roads, will be one of the most interesting localities
in all central Texas.

After a week at Austin we motored south through New Braunfels,
the site of an old German colony and the home of two remarkable
botanical collectors, Dr. F. Roemer and Dr. F. Lindheimer. The latter
made very large collections in this region and sent the specimens to
his countryman, George Engelmann, then a physician in St. Louis
and an enthusiastic student of plants. Later, Engelmann published in
the Boston Journal of Natural History an important paper entitled,
“ Plantae Lindheimerianae,” based on Lindheimer’s collections and
containing descriptions of many new and rare plants. A common
cactus, Opuntia lindheimeri, perhaps the commonest species of this
family in the United States, is abundant about New Braunfels and
was traced by us as far south as Brownsville.

We then motored to San Antonio, where we visited the beautiful
rock garden of Dr. and Mrs. D. T. Atkinson, to which the Smith-
sonian Institution has contributed several shipments of living plants.
From San Antonio we went down the Rio Grande Valley, passing
through extensive orange groves. Brownsville is a very old town,
and is of considerable botanical interest, many of the street shade
trees being native to the region. One of these is the Sabal palm,
Inodes texensis, resembling very much the Washington palm, which
has been introduced into that part of Texas. I was especially interested
also in other trees belonging to the Mimosa family, a group which
I am now studying. One of these is a species of Leucaena, usually
passing as L. pulverulenta, which has finely cut leaves and heads of
small flowers. The other is a species of Ebenopsis, a new genus which
at the time of our visit had not yet been published. This tree has very
hard wood, which takes a beautiful polish and is known as Mexican
ebony.

The Sabal palm was doubtless once common in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, and is still represented by many scattered trees and
several fine groves. It occupies very fertile parts of the valley and is
therefore gradually being eliminated. An effort should be made to
have at least one of the groves reserved as a state park or monument.
Not only are the palms themselves unique, but the undergrowth about
them contains many interesting and rare plants. The appearance of
the groves is shown in the accompanying photographs.

With Brownsville as headquarters the surrounding territory for a
distance of about 100 miles in all directions was surveyed in an attempt
to discover rubber-yielding plants. This included three trips into
adjacent Mexico southeast, south, and southwest of Matamoros. The
southern trip extended as far as San Fernando, on the Rio de Conchas.

Although many plants were examined to determine their rubber
content, our results were chiefly negative. Near Brownsville we found
a variety of the common poinsettia (Poinsettia pulcherrima) which
grows very abundantly. It produces an abundance of latex, which
gives about nine per cent crude rubber, and although previously not
regarded as very promising, yet deserves further study.

As a result of this trip a valuable series of herbarium specimens
was brought back, including many rare species and others that are
of special interest as coming from the locality whence they were
originally described.

hy IBUNIRILIONY IBVARIRIES, BYRNE Ia Ana,
Collaborator, Division of Plants, U. S. National Museum

The flora of Formosa, rich in endemic species, has been made
known for the most part through the publications of Japanese botan-
ists. In the early years of the Japanese occupation, before the
aborigines of the mountains had been brought under complete con-
trol, botanizing was carried on only with difficulty and danger. In
consequence, few duplicates were collected, and the herbaria at
Taihoku, the Formosan capital, and Tokyo are the only ones that
adequately represent the flora. American herbaria lack Formosan
plants almost entirely, except for the collections of Wilson of the
Arnold Arboretum and some grasses collected by Hitchcock. I there-
fore felt that it would be decidedly valuable to secure even the small
amount of material that could be got in a brief trip, and so made use
of the five weeks preceding the Third Pan-Pacific Science Congress
at Tokyo in a botanical trip to Formosa.

The western half of Formosa is flat, fertile, densely populated and
tame. The formerly turbulent, semi-barbarous Chinese population
has been efficiently organized by the Japanese; railroads have been
built; rice, sugar cane, banana and other cultures have been sys-
tematically developed. Consequently the chief interest of this part
of the island is in its advanced and scientific agriculture. The eastern
half is rough and wild. Head-hunting by the Malayan aborigines has
been suppressed, and the Japanese have made wonderful progress in
gaining the confidence of the natives. They have established schools,
improved living conditions, and seem to be dealing very wisely with
the tribes.

I arrived in Kilung on September 22, 1926, and went at once to
Taihoku. On board the SS. Fuso Maru I had made friends with
Professor Masakazu Sato, plant biochemist of the Taiwan Agricul-
tural College. He introduced me to Dr. Kintaro Oshima, the Head
of the College, and Director of the central agricultural experiment
station, and through the latter I met Vice-Governor Goto. Plans for
a trip in the savage districts were soon made and approved. Dr.
Oshima very kindly arranged that Mr. Kindi Yamada, Expert in

Forestry at the Government Research Institute, Taihoku Botanical
Garden, should be released from his duties to accompany me. Thus
I was provided with an indispensable guide and friend. Mr. Yamada
spoke both Japanese and Chinese, as well as English and one of the
aboriginal languages, Paiwan. In our journeys together my lack of
understanding of Japanese etiquette must at times have been embar-
rassing to him, but his kindness and helpfulness never failed, even
under the stress of days in the cold and rain, after which plants had
to be straightened out and put in press at night.

We went by rail to Rato, on the east coast, around the northern
end of the island, and then struck inland to Taiheisan, a mountain
whose age-old forest of gigantic conifers is being forested. We fol-
lowed up the narrow-gauge gravity railroad by which the logs are
sent down. A primitive but efficient brake and a Chinese driver con-
trolled the cars, piled high with enormous logs, most of them from
the two species of Chamaecyparis, counterparts of our white cedar,
which form the bulk of the coniferous stand. The track might fol-
low a niche in a canyon-like wall, or traverse a temporary trestle, but
whenever the sound of the down-coming trains was heard there was
nothing to do but find some place to sidetrack as the cars went careen-
ing by. The empty cars were pulled back by patient plodding water-
buffaloes quaintly shod with little straw sandals like those of the
Japanese woodsmen.

On Taiheisan I saw the ancient relict conifer, Taiwania; the rare
Cunninghamia Kawakami, a counterpart of our East American Sas-
safras, S. randaiense ; the anomalous Trochodendron aralioides, a fine
tree, botanically noteworthy because it is one of the few angiosperms
whose wood contains no vessels. A characteristic shrub which we
always associate with Formosa was seen abundantly—the famous
paper plant, Tetrapanax papyriferum, a relative of our devil's club,
from the thick pith of which the pure white material is prepared upon
which the Cantonese artists paint the bright little pictures that every
globe-trotter for a hundred years has brought home.

After returning by gravity car from Taiheisan to the coast, we took
a steamer from Suwo to Kwarenko. Here we visited the Ami tribe, a
strictly coastal people who still preserve and revere the ancient canoes
by which, according to their traditions, they came to Formosa. Hat-
sune, near Kwarenko, was our point of departure for a trip on foot,
with Taiyal carriers, across the central mountain range, following up
the gorge of the slate-colored Mokka river. At the end of the first
day’s march we were served at a mountain inn with an American

dinner that would have been considered good in Washington. It
was a special treat, prepared by Mr. Nagase, who had been 18 years
in the United States, had served with Dewey at Manila, and then on
the Mayflower, where he had talked with Presidents McKinley and
Roosevelt. After dinner he called, and expressed his good will to
the country he had served so long.

We crossed the divide at Nokosan, elevation about 10,000 ft. On
the way I became more and more filled with admiration for the
plucky Japanese officers who have brought standards of living into
this wild land that do them infinite credit. They do the beautiful car-
pentry of their stations, using the trees in the forest as their raw
material; they construct the carefully graded mountain paths, often
blasted out of the face of the gorges; they build the wire suspension
bridges that carry a footway of from one to three narrow boards;
and they teach the native schools—all this in addition to their primary
duty of keeping order. One whom I met had made a good herbarium ;
another, Mr. Mitsui of Raishya, whom I met later in South Formosa,
had compiled an admirable dictionary of the Paiwan language which
would be a genuine contribution to knowledge if it could be published,
especially if it were romanized and included English as well as Japa-
nese equivalents.

The mountain flora of Nokosan included many familiar boreal
genera, which gave way, as we descended, to subtropical types, the
whole transition being seen in a day’s march. We got our botanical
collections in order at Hori, where we were entertained by the genial
Mr. Saito, Head of the Forest Experiment Station of the University
of Hokkaido. (Each Japanese university has its own Formosan
forest reserve and experiment station.) Mr. Saito is a butterfly en-
thusiast, and when he learned that we were returning to the moun-
tains to climb Niitakayama (Mt. Morrison) he decided to join us.
On the way to the top of the Japanese Empire we made very inter-
esting collections, and saw the shy and attractive Tsuo tribe, who
build little sacred houses of the skulls of the animals they kill in the
chase. Our baggage carriers on this trip were the more primitive
Bunun, the least engaging, perhaps, of the Formosan natives. We
reached the summit, at about 13,400 ft., and made good collections.

My last trip into the mountains was to the Paiwan village of
Raishya, reached from Heito, the southern terminus of the railroad.
On the way we had the interesting experience of fording a Formosan
river several times. Although shallow, the water was so swift that
its impact made it almost impossible to get one’s foot to the bottom.

The friendly Paiwan exclaimed at my poor technique and came to
the rescue. Raishya is built of great slabs of slate. The houses, with
abundant carving in wood and stone, are very interesting. The people
wear head bands of flowers and are most attractive.

On the return to Taihoku we stopped at a classic botanical locality
on the west coast, Ape Hill at Takao. On this mountain of the short
and low western range many botanical specimens were collected in
the early days by Europeans, especially Henry. It has now been
greatly modified by Chinese fuel and hay cutters, by being overrun
with Lantana, and by reforestation with Acacia, but it is still an
interesting locality for the rare and local palm, Phoenix Hanceana.

After returning to Taihoku I spent a few days in the Herbarium
at the Botanical Garden identifying my collections—an especially
important matter since type material for comparison exists only in

Japan. The specimens that could not be studied here, I compared
in Tokyo at the Botanical Institute of the Imperial University. For
many courtesies at the herbaria I am indebted to Professor Bunzo
Hayata, the Nestor of Formosan botany, and to Mr. Yamamoto of
Tokyo, and to Mr. Sasaki of Taihoku. In Taihoku I enjoyed the
hospitality of the Japanese friends already named; of our energetic
and helpful Consul, Mr. De Vault, and Mrs. De Vault; of the Dutch
Vice-Consul, Mr. Nichols and his wife; and of Mr. Hosui of the
Higher School, formerly chief of the Division of Foreign Relations
of the Formosan Government.

Although only about 370 numbers of plants were collected, there
are duplicates for several American institutions. The value of the
collection is greater than the number would indicate, because many
of the species have not heretofore been represented in American or
European collections.

iab ASI -DiIsArPEARING PEORA OF SUMATRA

BY HART EY, HARRIS BARE Ei,
Collaborator, Division of Plants, U. S. National Muitsewimn

The establishment of plantations and the influx of population are
rapidly sweeping away the jungles of Sumatra. To collect as much as
possible of the fast-disappearing native flora, I spent the first half
of 1927 there under the joint auspices of the University of Michigan
and the Smithsonian Institution. Upon arriving in Asahan, Sumatra,
December 25, 1926, I was occupied for a few days in making prepara-
tions for my work and in paying my respects to the Assistant Resi-
dent and the Toenkoe Regent, who gave me letters of introduction
to other officials and to the native headmen. I was most fortunate
in being invited by an old friend, Mr. James Grantham, Director of
Plantation Research for the United States Rubber Company, to make
his home at Boenoet my headquarters for the whole of my stay. It
is a pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness to the U. S. Rubber Co.
and its staff for their assistance; to Mr. Carel Hamel of the Ameri-
can Methodist Mission, who proved an agreeable and helpful com-
panion on several short jungle trips; to my former student, Mr.
W. E. Cake, who joined me in a rapid trip around the southern end
of Lake Toba to Taroetoeng; to Messrs. Stofkoper and Prokopo-
vitsch of Loendoet Concession, Koealoe, for their hospitality there ;
and to Dr. H. S. Yates with whom I made an interesting, though
botanically unproductive, visit to Poeloe Salah Nama, one of three
rocky islets in the Straits of Molacca northeast of Batoe Bara.

The plantation belt of the East Coast is a region of rapid develop-
ment, which had its beginning at Medan, center of the famous Deli
tobacco plantations. Other cultures, especially rubber and oil-palm,
have extended the belt southward, and now it is growing laterally
toward the highlands through plantings of tea and, locally, of irri-
gated rice. The great plantations of the U. S. Rubber Co. in Asahan
were practically the southern end of the culture area ten years ago,
but now exploitation has reached much farther and has outdis-
tanced transportation facilities.

It is regrettable that the resources of the jungle have not been
known and utilized before its destruction. Of course the chief groups

of economic trees are known, but there are doubtless many localized
types of great interest and value that are doomed to extinction. The
expression of such fears provokes laughter in Sumatra, where the
wonderful tropical forest now seems inexhaustible. However, it will
be only a few years before a patch of virgin forest will be a rarity in
the culture area. As for the flora, it is doubtful if half of it has been
recorded, or can be recorded on the basis of the collections that have
thus far been made. Furthermore, after potentially valuable or scien-
tifically interesting plants have been exterminated, it is small conso-
lation to know that a few fragments may be preserved in our
herbaria. Since leprosy has come under control through treatment
with chaulmoogra oil, what botanist would wish to see any one of
the allies of chaulmoogra exterminated with its properties still un-
known? The type locality of one of Mr. Yates’ beautiful discoveries,
Hydnocarpus Yatesii Merrill, may be cleared any time. The known
range is not over ten miles across. It is a pity that botanical survey
work cannot be pushed more rapidly the world over. Fortunately,
two active botanists, Mr. J. A. Lorzing, in charge of the Sibolangit
Botanical Garden, and Mr. H. S. Yates, until recently botanist for
the U. S. Rubber Co., have been collecting in the East Coast region in
the intervals of their other occupations. The former has assembled a
valuable collection of living plants and has a book on the flora in
preparation. The latter’s collections, in the hands of Dr, E. D. Mer-
rill for determination, will be reported upon by Merrill and Yates.

My own season of field-work extended from January to July, and
included four not entirely distinct types of work.

1. Friendly contacts were made with the old native population at
Silo Maradja, at the edge of the U. S. Rubber Plantations. Off and
on throughout the season I stayed with these people and made col-
lecting trips with them daily, collecting all plants of economic inter-
est, as well as whatever else came to hand, and making notes on
ethnobotany. Since the jungle people and their ancient lore are dis-
appearing even faster than the jungle, this phase of my work was
important. I fitted it into my program throughout my stay, by taking
men from Silo Maradja with me to all the neighboring districts.
Inquiries made on the trail always reminded these men of interesting
things at home. An inseparable companion from Silo Maradja was
Datoe Boersok, a picturesque old pagan priest-doctor, sometimes
more picturesque than useful, whose fund of learning was always at
my disposal. Rahmat was a cheerful boy of inexhaustible industry,
who on one occasion felt so humiliated by his failure to climb a tree

that he invented an excuse to leave his work the next day, returning
triumphant with the flowers we had coveted. Oenoes, being of a
practical turn of mind, preferred collecting seeds rather than her-
barium specimens. I hope that some of his contributions to the Office
of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction may flourish.

2. Several weeks were spent in intensive work at Loendoet, south
of the Asahan River. Several thousand acres of old jungle were
being felled, and I might profitably have spent all my time there.
Loendoet left a vivid memory of crashing jungle, the howling of
disconsolate monkeys surrounded by smoke and crackling fires that
followed the felling, the grotesque skeletons of charred trees that
remained after the first burning, the little infernos watched over by
Satanic Celestials during the second burning, when a hundred fires
kept the sky aglow all night. The burning was followed by turning
of the soil, and drainage of the swamps. Not a plant or animal re-
mained. My day’s routine was to clamber through unbelievable tan-
gles of treetops and interwoven vines, many of them fish-hooked
ratans, sometimes 20 or 30 feet above the ground. Often it rained,
or the sun was scorching, but the wreckage never lost its interest.
It was sad to see things dying that can never be replaced. My chief
regret was for a magnificent Dracaena two feet in diameter. Many
of the species were never seen in flower or fruit and must remain
unrecorded.

3. I botanized hurriedly through the back of Asahan up over the
mountains to Toba. This gave me a superficial idea of the floral
changes as one ascends to the high plateau and the mountains from
the low districts. The waterfalls of the Asahan, however insig-
nificant they might seem in a paper comparison with the giant
Niagara, are nevertheless sublime. No sight surpasses the plunge of
the Asahan into a perfect bowl at the Sampoeran Harimo. This fall
is at the head of the idyllic horseshoe valley of Tangga. Near the
foot of the Tiger Fall I crossed the boiling Asahan on a single strand
of ratan, ignominiously pulled in a basket, whereas the natives go
hand over hand with the agility of monkeys. Then up the face of
the valley, where the path becomes a series of ladders up the cliffs,
and over the lalang plains of the ancient terrace to Toba. To stand
at the mountain rim of Toba and look down at the great lake, the
mysterious, almost-island Samosir, the emerald-green or golden rice
terraces, the villages in their groves of trees and bamboo—nothing
could be more entrancing. And then the mountains—each one
presenting untouched botanical opportunities. The sacred Dolok

Soeroengan was the only one of the larger mountains south of Toba
Lake that I could botanize clear to the top, and its possibilities I
barely scratched.

4. Two trips were made to the Karo plateau at the north end of
Toba Lake, where the U. S. Rubber Co. maintains bungalows at
Bérastagi. From Bérastagi I botanized the two volcanoes, Si Naboen
and Si Bajak, as well as the lesser mountains, Deléng Piso-Piso and
Deleng Baroes and the hills, Deleng Koetoe and Deleng Singkoet.

I collected ample material of several of Ridley’s plants, which will
be of value in interpreting his work, and also got many plants that
will probably be new to the flora.

I stayed in Sumatra a little over six months, and brought back
nearly 2,400 numbers, with many duplicates. At Loendoet my dry-
ing shed was destroyed by fire, with loss of many specimens and
most of my equipment. It took some improvising to take care of the
collections during a few days following the fire, but work was hardly
interrupted.

Ake IGRASSES OF OREGON AND WASHINGTON
3VeAn Oe Hl GHCO Eke

Custodian, Section of Grasses, U. S. National Museum

In connection with the preparation of a manual of the grasses of
the United States, I spent about to weeks in the study and collection
of grasses in Washington and Oregon. During much of the time I
was cooperating with the Forest Service, and many of the trips were
made in company with Mr. D. C. Ingram of the Portland office, a
botanist with a wide knowledge of the flora of Oregon.

The Olympic Mountains were visited at Solduc Hot Springs and
collections were made at Port Angeles and other points in western
Washington. In Oregon Mr. Ingram and I, with the aid of [Forest
Service officials, especially the rangers, visited various localities in
the Cascade, Deschutes, Umpqua, and Siskiyou Forests. Much of
the exploration was by horseback, using camp equipment or stopping
at ranger stations. In this way I was in intimate contact with graz-
ing conditions and could study the grasses in their native habitat under
varying environment. We crossed the divide going east over Mc-
Kenzie Pass. This region illustrates excellently the immense lava
flows that cover large areas with rough lava that does not yet sup-
port vegetation. Older flows are covered with forest. Passing
through Bend in the semi-arid region east of the Cascades we again
entered the forest and visited many of the beautiful lakes, such as
Odell, Crescent, and Davis. After several days’ travel over the moun-
tain trails of the Umpqua Forest we went to Grant’s Pass and started
on an exploration of the Siskiyou Forest. We used the main autobus
road to Crescent City, California, but made side trips to Pearsall
Peak, Tennessee Pass, Sanger Peak and other points. From Cres-
cent City we followed the coast north to Bandon, making  collec-
tions at several points, and then crossed to Roseburg.

Trips were made to Mt. Hood and The Dalles, and, to consult
collections of Oregon grasses, to the herbaria of Willamette Uni-
versity, Salem, the Agricultural College, Corvallis, and the State
University, Eugene. Forest fires prevented proposed trips to Mt.
Adams and Mt. St. Helens, in Washington.

The object of this trip and also of the one made by Mr. Swallen,
whose account follows, was to determine the amount of variation

of each species observed, as it is influenced by its environment, and
to discover the characters by which different but similar species may
be distinguished.

3y riding or walking day after day through meadows, forests, and
plains, observing the cattle and sheep on the grazing areas, one learns
the choice of stock as to the different species of grasses. Some species
are eaten greedily ; others are avoided or eaten only under the pres-
sure of hunger.

A few years ago I described as new a species of mountain blue-
grass sent in by a correspondent from southwestern Oregon. On this

trip I was able for the first time to observe this species in its native
habitat. It is confined to a rather limited area but is abundant there.

Grasses grow under a great variety of conditions, forest, meadow,
plain, marsh, rocky slopes, cliffs, alkali flats, seashore, even to the
highest peaks except where covered by permanent snow. But in
the main each species is confined to a definite set of environmental
conditions.

Specimens of grasses were collected to record the observations
made, the total number reaching some 200, representing about 100
different species. Common and well known species were not taken.

hE S GRASSES, OF ICABIFORNITA
By JASON R. SWALLEN

In order to investigate at first hand the melic grasses (Melica), an
important genus on the Pacific coast, a field trip was made to Cali-
fornia during the summer of 1927. At the same time, critical notes
were made on other grasses which required detailed study. I first
undertook a four-day trip across the Coast Range west of King City.
At the lower altitudes the season was too far advanced for profitable
study, but toward the summit the grasses were in the best of condition.
Later I visited points of interest at San Luis Obispo, Santiago Peak
in the Santa Ana Mountains, San Jacinto Peak, San Antonio Moun-
tain, and Arrowhead Lake, the last in the San Bernardino Mountains.
An interesting feature of San Jacinto Mountain is the presence near
the summit of a small lake called Hidden Lake. Only a few steps
from the edge of the lake one can look down the almost vertical side
of the mountain upon Palm Springs and the Colorado Desert 10,000
feet below. Material of Melica imperfecta was especially good and
abundant among the rocks on San Antonio Mountain. At Arrowhead
Lake I found an annual fescue (Festuca eastwoodae), which is very
infrequent.

In the early part of July, 10 days were spent in investigating the
grass flora of the King’s River Canyon and the adjoining mountains.
This necessitated a camping trip, and Sequoia National Park served
as a Starting point. I used a burro to carry camping equipment, which
proved to be much more convenient than carrying a pack myself.
Because of the beautiful scenery, this part of California has become
more and more popular with tourists and campers, even though it is
inaccessible except on foot or horseback. During the few days I spent
on this trip I passed several groups of as many as 30 campers, accom-
panied by large pack trains.

On the floor of the canyon at this time of year it is quite hot
and dry. The ground cover, composed to a large extent of annual
grasses, was almost completely dried up except in a few low places
near the river. As higher altitudes were reached, conditions became
much better. On either side of the canyon the walls rise almost per-
pendicularly for thousands of feet, making a very impressive sight.

I made as complete a collection of grasses as possible, for there are
but few collections from this region. The season was very backward
at high altitudes owing to the unusually large amount of snow that
fell during the past winter. Alpine work was, therefore, impossible,
and especially was this true of Mount Lassen, which I visited early

in August.

Fic. 128.—Scene just south of the main peak of Mt. Lassen, showing the

Other places included in the summer’s work were the mountains
above Huntington Lake in Fresno County, and those above Lake
Tahoe in the vicinity of Twin and Ward Peaks. The mountains of
California provide excellent opportunity either for natural history
study or for recreation.

Over 500 specimens of California grasses were obtained during

the summer.

ARCHEOLOGICAL AX PE DIELON TLOxCHiINA
By Ce W> BISH@P:

Associate Curator, Freer Gallery of Art

In a previous publication, it has been made clear that the funda-
mental purpose of the Freer Gallery of Art in despatching a Field
“xpedition to China was not merely that of making collections, or
even of conducting researches on its own sole responsibility. The
aim, on the contrary, was to effect a definite and equitable arrange-
ment with the Chinese authorities and scientific bodies themselves
for the prosecution of archeological investigation on a closely coopera-
tive basis. Their considered but cordial response to our overtures has
amply demonstrated the wisdom of this policy and of its continuance.

Accompanied by my Chinese helper, Mr. K. Z. Tung, to whom is
due much of the credit for our subsequent success, | arrived im
Shanghai on March 17, 1923, and remained in the field, with the
exception of one brief interval, until April 30, 1927. During this
period of slightly over four years, close and very harmonious relations
were established with the Historical Museum of Peking, to which,
as previously stated, I was before long appointed Honorary Adviser
at the initiative of the Chinese Government, and also with the newly
founded Research Institute of Tsing Hua University, better known
to the American public as the ‘* Boxer Indemnity College.” Conjointly
with representatives of one or other of these bodies, ten of the Kighteen
Provinces of China, including all those of the greatest historical im-
portance, were visited and studied, and actual excavations were con-
ducted in three.

As part of this work has already been described in previous reports,”
it will not be further discussed here. To take up the account from
the spring of 1925, that season was spent in northern Shansi, where,
besides further study of the famous Buddhist sculptured caves of
Yiin Kang, a detailed exploration was made of a rather large area

centering about the important city of Ta-t‘ung. Many sites of great

historical significance were noted, among them what seems in all
probability to be that of the earlier capital of the Tartar dynasty
known as the Northern Wei (A. D. 386-535). A visit was also paid
to a region near the edge of the Mongolian plateau, where the
Hiung-nu, identified with the Huns who later ravaged nearly the
whole of Europe, are known to have held their great annual assemblies
about the beginning of the Christian Era. Here were secured num-
erous bronze objects, arrow-heads, knives, ornaments, and the like,
showing a decided Scythian or South-Siberian influence.

During the summer our attention was again devoted to the old
fortified site on the rocky promontory of Lighthouse Point, at
Peitaiho, on the Gulf of Chihli, mentioned in the report of our work
for 1924." -xcavations here disclosed remains of at least three periods,
a late Neolithic (prehistoric) occupation, a small but commanding
Han Dynasty fortification of about the beginning of our Era, and a
large entrenched camp apparently of the late Ming period, late 16th or
early 17th century. An accurate large-scale survey of the site made
by my associate, Mr. A. G. Wenley, who had come out to join me in
August, 1923, and Mr. Jas. M. Menzies, formerly Licensed Land
Surveyor for the Government of Canada, confirmed in an interesting
manner the deductions I had drawn the previous summer from an
inspection of the site from the air.

Early autumn found us once more in the northern Shansi area,
where we remained until the advent of severe winter weather, coupled
with local disturbances, put an end to all field activities. Shortly there-
after, Mr. Wenley left for Paris, where he has since been continuing
his Sinological studies under Professor Paul Pelliot and others.

In the following spring, that of 1926, I paid a visit to Ningpo, in
the region once occupied by the non-Chinese state of Yueh during the
Late Bronze Age, in the latter half of the Ist millennium B.C. The
prevalence of banditry prevented the carrying on of my investigations

strate the importance of this area as a field for future intensive study.

Returning from Ningpo to Shanghai, I next proceeded up the

region of Egypt, and for the same reason. The shifting of the water-
courses through the ages and the deposition of enormous amounts of
silt render the prospect of successful excavation doubtful, save in a
few elevated areas; but it is precisely the latter, rising above the
wide-spreading marshes covering the region in ancient times, which
formed the only available sites for habitation.

In ancient Ch'u, on the other hand, corresponding roughly to the
modern provinces of Hupeh and Hunan, conditions are far otherwise.
The ground is higher, and we found ancient city walls and foundation
mounds numerous. Here again, disturbed political and military condi-
tions rendered only a superficial examination possible, even that being
conducted on one occasion under fire from a small group of irrespon-
sible soldiers. Enough was done, however, to disclose innumerable
remains of various periods, from prehistoric times downward, at or
very near the surface, and highly suggestive of the rich rewards
awaiting the systematic excavator.

Dr. Chi Li’s report of his preliminary reconnaissance of the Fen
River valley, in southwestern Shansi province, in the early spring of
1926, has already appeared.’ While engaged in this task, Dr. Li con-
tracted a severe case of typhus fever, always present in interior China,
which lacked little of terminating fatally. In the autumn, his health
being restored, he returned to the same area under the joint auspices
of the Freer Gallery of Art and Tsing Hua University. The Geological
Survey of China, with characteristic breadth of view, loaned us for
this work one of its best men, Mr. Philip L. Yuan, a very ca-
pable cartographer and geologist with large experience in Chinese
archeology.

Dr. Li, after reaching a highly satisfactory understanding with the
authorities and winning the confidence of the local peasantry, began
excavations on a late Stone Age village site of large dimensions, in
the extreme southwestern portion of Shansi province. He continued
his operations here until snow rendered excavation useless, and then
returned to Peking with nearly 80 packing-cases of excavated ma-
terial of all sorts. He is at this writing engaged in the preparation of
a full report of his finds.

It was my original intention, while Dr. Li was working in Shansi,
to devote myself to further work along the Yangtse River. The dis-
order and banditry prevailing in that region, however, made this out
of the question. Consequently I put into execution my long deferred
plan of exploring the province of Shansi throughout its entire length,

of about 500 miles by road. In this undertaking | was accompanied
by Mr. Tung. We traveled by Ford motor-car, finding many sites
new to science and securing a first-hand idea of the topography of the
region highly important to a correct interpretation of the movements
of man and the spread of civilization there in ancient times.

After visiting Dr. Li’s work, I returned to the provincial capital,
T‘ai-yuan, where I had the privilege of being presented to T. R. H. the
Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden, and of accompanying the
former by motor-car to a Neolithic site some distance away, under
the guidance of the eminent Swedish archeologist, Dr. J. G. Andersson.
Then, continuing my journey, I traveled northward for 200 miles,
crossing the Yun Chung Shan or “ Midst of the Clouds” range of
mountains by a pass of about 7,000 feet elevation, according to report.
This chain long formed the ancient Chinese frontier against the north-
ern barbarians, and along its foot to this day runs one of the Great
Walls so numerous in that part of China.

By the beginning of 1927 it had become apparent that the large
amount of material already gathered could be studied and reported
on to far better advantage in Washington than in China. Moreover,
the unsettled conditions almost universally existing in China rendered
the prosecution of further field-work there for the present a matter
of great uncertainty. I therefore arranged that Mr. Tung and Dr. Li
should remain in Peking, to maintain the close relations which we
had established with the leading Chinese scientific bodies and to
do such field-work as might be possible. Our Peking headquarters
were closed on April 30, and after visiting archeological sites and
collections of importance in Korea, Japan, Egypt, and Europe, I
arrived in Washington on August 6, 1927.

Thus, besides achieving the fundamental object for which it was
sent out, viz., that of reaching an understanding with the Chinese
themselves for effective cooperation in archeological research, the
Expedition has made a definite beginning in tracing out the develop-
ment of civilization in several of the historically more important
regions of China. The effort thus inaugurated, taken in conjunction
with the growing collections of the Freer Gallery of Art and the
steady acquisition of Chinese books by the Library of Congress,
promises in time to make Washington a center of Chinese studies
second to none. Further, owing to the ingrained respect for learning
entertained by the Chinese people of all classes, the friendly contacts
established by work such as ours provide one of the readiest means for
promoting a better understanding and closer harmony between Amer-
ica and China.

INDIAN VILLAGE SITES AND QUARRIES IN TENNESSEE

By WALTER HOUGH,
Head Curator of Anthropology, U. S. National Museum

On the report of some recently exhumed burials at Indian Mound,
Tennessee, brought to notice by Congressman Joseph W. Byrns, the
Bureau of American Ethnology sent the writer to investigate. Indian
Mound is a town named for a large mound in its midst. Owing to
wear and tear, the mound has been much reduced from its original
height. Recently several slab lined graves were carefully opened by
Thomas W. Seay, Jr., and protected as exhibits. One piece of pottery,
a polished flesher and beads, and a few other artifacts were found.

The writer, under the guidance of Mr. Seay, visited several village
sites and quarries in the vicinity of Indian Mound. Especially inter-
esting was a site at Brinton Hill having a heavy deposit of broken
flints and shells of Campeloma and Pleurocera from the Cumberland
River, fresh water mollusks which do not exist in the stream now.

The Mississippian limestone, which is the characteristic rock of this
region, is rich in flint. One great quarry on the Brigham place, near
Dover, yields large blocks of homogeneous, liver-colored flint from
which the aborigines struck the hoe blades 12 to 18 inches long typical
of the Mississippi agricultural complex. On a field of Mr. Brigham’s,
chips and worked implements of this flint are found in enormous
numbers. Other quarries were visited, but the quarry yielding a par-
ticularly fine blue flint was not located.

An important collection representing the types of usual worked
flint implements in this region was gathered for the Museum. Ex-
amples of these are shown on figure 141.

A widespread interest in archeological relics is displayed by the
people of this region. In general the land owners are averse to indis-
criminate digging by curiosity hunters, and for this reason most of
the numerous box graves are intact. On the other hand many fine
specimens found on the surface have come into the possession of
professional dealers in antiquities.

The Tennessee archeological field is very rich, and the State
Archeologist, Mr. P. E. Cox, and others are doing much to maintain
public interest in the antiquities of the State.

FIELD STUDIES OF EARLY MAN IN EUROPE, 1927
By ALES HRDLICKA,
Curator, Division of Physical Anthropology, U. S. National Museum

In the fall of 1927, the writer undertook a journey through [urope
in the furtherance of his studies of Early Man. The principal objec-
tives of the trip were: (1) A personal visit to some of the old as well
as the more important recently discovered sites of Early Man; (2) the
re-examination of a number of the skeletal remains of Early Man;
and (3) a study of such of the Aurignacian skeletal remains as the
writer has not been able to examine before. An additional object was
the delivery of the Huxley Memorial Lecture before the Royal
Anthropological Society of Great Britain.

The work began with the examination of the remains of arly Man
preserved in the Museum d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris. Through the
courtesy of Professor Marcellin Boule, the writer was able once more
to see personally the originals of the La Chapelle, La Ferrassie,
La Quina, and the two Aurignacian skeletons, which are preserved
in that institution. From Paris the journey led to Perigueux, where
careful re-examination and re-measurements were made of the contro-
versial Chancelade skeleton. After a day at Les Eyzies, spent princi-
pally in consultations with M. Peyrony, the writer went to the south of
France, where through the courtesy of the local guardians and Museum
men, he secured valuable original data on the Aurignacian skeletons 1n
the Museum of Monaco, and in the Museum and the Cave at Barma
Grande, over the Italian border. The next stop was at Lyon, where
thanks to Dr. Arcelin and Dr. Mayet the writer was able to examine
the five lately discovered Aurignacian and post-Aurignacian skeletons,
which have not yet been fully described. From Lyon the route led to
Paris and then to Liege, where through the kindness of Professor
Charles Fraipont and the brothers Lohest, it was possible to re-
examine and take some additional measurements on the originals of
the Spy skeletons.

From Liége the journey led to Dusseldorf and the highly inter-
esting and beautiful Neander Valley which in 1856 gave us the
original Neanderthal skeleton. The Neanderthal site has been
neglected by anthropology. Since the discovery of the Neanderthal

skeleton in 1856, no serious explorations have ever been carried on
there, and but few scientists have visited the spot. The valley is a
limestone gorge cut by the small stream Diissel. It took its name from
Joachim Neander, a song composer of the Reformed Church, who
frequented the valley in 1674-79. In 1856, workmen engaged in quar-
rying the limestone uncovered an ancient and very primitive human
skeleton, buried in the deposits of a cave. They tossed the bones and
earth down the slope with the other refuse. Later the owner of the
quarries, hearing of the find, asked that the bones be gathered. The
workmen found 14 pieces of the skeleton and these were placed in
the hands of Dr. Fuhlrott of Elberfeld, who eventually brought them
to the notice of the scientific world.

Some prominent scientists of the day were inclined to look upon
the low brow and the heavy supraorbital ridges of the skull, the thick-
ness of the bones, as well as many other characters of anthropological
inferiority, as evidences of an accidental monstrosity, or of a patho-
logical condition. But gradually new examples of this same early
type appeared in different parts of Europe, so that for a long time
now science has been sure they represent a regular phase in the
earlier evolution of man.

New finds of importance have recently been made in the Neander
Valley. Paleolithic implements in conjunction with the fossilized bones
of the mammoth and reindeer are now being found on the other side
of the valley from the earlier discovery, at the base of the very thick
layer of loam covering the limestone. So far the new site has not
revealed any skeletal remains of man.

There is need for systematic research in the Neanderthal Valley.
The rest of the original skeleton not recovered by the workmen after
they threw it in the débris must still be there. With this may possibly
be stone implements or fossil animal bones that were not noticed by
the laborers. Vestiges of the limestone cave in which the original
skeleton was found still exist (fig. 142) and ought to be searched for
extensions and possible additional clues to early man. And new dis-
coveries of the remains of early man in other as yet unexplored parts
of the valley are quite probable.

From Neanderthal the writer went to Berlin, where he secured addi-
tional observations on the Le Moustier and the La Combe skeletons.

The journey then led to Prague where, at the invitation of the
Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and Arts, a lecture was given
before the Academy on the “ Ice Age and its Relation to Early Man.”
At Brno, the capital of Moravia, many of the new as well as older

9
124 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

discoveries relating to early man were examined, and from here an
excursion was made in the company of Professor Karel Absolon,
head of the Museum at Brno, to the new Aurignacian site at Viestonice,
southern Moravia.

This site, discovered three years ago, appears to be vast and rich
almost beyond estimation. It is located on the slopes of an isolated
massif of hills and there is a possibility that it extends over the
larger part of the slopes of these hills. It has already yielded over

300,000 flints and other human artifacts, tons of bones of the mam-
moth, and most recently also the first Aurignacian human skeleton.
The government of Czechoslovakia is considering for the next year
extensive soundings by which the extent of the site and its relative
richness at different points may be determined.

Irom Moravia the writer returned once more to Paris, and thence
to London and Oxford where he was able to examine additional
ancient material, including the Rhodesian remains and the recently
discovered second Gibraltar skull, and to visit various institutions.

The Huxley Lecture was given at the Royal Society, November 8,
and on November 12, the writer sailed for America.

TINNE INDIANS OF THE LOWER YUKON RIVER
VATERY
By HERBERT W. KRIEGER,
Curator, Division of Ethnology, U. S. National Musewin

The Yukon River, like all great streams located in remote parts of
the world, never fails to excite one’s interest and imagination. But
little is known of the story of early human migrations that un-
doubtedly passed up or down its broad valley. At the suggestion of
Doctor A. Hrdliéka, and under the auspices of the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, excavations at certain archeological sites in the
lower Yukon River valley were made during 1927. Investigations
were carried on so far as conditions permitted at Shageluk, Holo-
gochakat, Anvik, and at Bonasila, an old village site 18 miles below
the mouth of the Anvik River. The high stage of water during May
and June did not permit completion of this work, so that another
season might profitably be spent in conducting further archeological
studies in the valley of the lower Yukon.

The site at Bonasila yielded skeletal material and cultural objects
that indicate the early presence there of widely distinct ethnic groups.
A curious contrast was observed in the types of implements re-
covered. Crudely fractured implements of schistose and shale rock,
some of which had been used as knives, were slightly smoothed and
beveled at the cutting edges but were otherwise unworked. There
were also uncovered symmetrically shaped and highly polished neph-
rite celts such as are commonly fashioned by the Eskimo of northern
Alaska. Jadeite adzes, Eskimoan in type, were found along with
erooved, single and double bitted stone axes such as are occasionally
found at various points along the Yukon, Koyukuikx, and Susitna
Rivers. Another contrast noted was that of carved objects of fossil
ivory and of bone tools and stone weapon points. The ancient fossil
ivory culture of north Alaska, of St. Lawrence and the lesser islands
of Bering Sea is characterized by implements of fossil walrus ivory
with beautifully scrolled and spiral surface etchings entirely distinct
from the typical rectilinear and circle and dot etchings of the Eskimo.
There are no realistic designs in silhouette etched on ivory as in the
hunting and fishing delineations of the Eskimo of southwest Alaska.

The find of implements of fossil ivory with etched surface designs
similar to early Siberian and north Alaskan types marks the site at
Bonasila as the most advanced interior point known to have been
reached by this culture.

Fragments of coarse black pottery were exhumed. These were
decorated with rim hachure and were modeled like the heavy thick
earthenware of the Eskimo. However, making of pottery by the
Tinne Indians of the lower Yukon valley has been discontinued.

The art of painting, on wooden grave boxes, fishing or hunting
scenes of special significance in the lives of the deceased is still occa-
sionally practised. One of the grave box panels exhumed contains a
realistic painting with black figures on a red background depicting the
harpooning of a beluga or white whale. Another old panel from a
wooden grave box at Bonasila shows in a spirited manner several
reindeer running before a hunter.

The contrast in cultural objects emphasizing both Eskimo and
Indian influences is complicated by the anomalous find of skeletal
material which according to Doctor Hrdlicka is dissimilar alike to
Eskimo and Tinne physical types.

The valley of the lower Yukon below the mouths of the Anvik and
Innoko Rivers was formerly Eskimo territory. A well defined trail
extends from Anvik, up the Anvik River to the Eskimo village of
Unalaklikmiut on Norton Sound near St. Michael. Another trail
crosses the portage from the Kuskokwim to the Yukon River in the
vicinity of Russian Mission. Eskimo formerly ascended these rivers
beyond their present range of travel and there are many traditions
of hostile encounters with Tinne Indians as far upstream as the con-
fluence of the Koyukuk and Yukon Rivers. The environs of Shage-
luk Slough, east of Anvik, were formerly frequented by herds of
caribou, whose presence there supplied a reason for the Eskimo ad-
vance to the interior. There is now a government herd of reindeer
at Shageluk, thriving and increasing in numbers.

A brief study was made of the Tinne Indians of the villages of
Anvik, Hologochakat, Shageluk, and other villages below the con-
fluence at Fort Gibbon of the Tanana and Yukon Rivers. Many
details of their ceremonial and religious life are similar to those of
the Eskimo, the ceremonial masks and dances in particular being
almost identical in appearance.

Indians of the lower Yukon gain a living primarily by fishing and
hunting, but appear to be less energetic than the Tinne of the villages
of Kaltag, Nulato, and Tanana farther upstream, who are primarily

hunters. Yukon natives are great travelers. They think nothing of
a 100 or 200 mile journey upstream or downstream. The same ap-
plies to trapping and hunting expeditions inland, but the final destina-
tion is always the river, either as a temporary camp or winter home.
An Indian’s trapping line may be 50 to 100 miles from his winter
home, while his fish wheel and fish drying racks are always located
at a distance from the winter village.

A successful season for the Yukon native nets him an income
equivalent to that of many a city dweller within the United States.
The Indian of the Yukon valley has adopted the civilization of the
white man and now lives in a log cabin instead of the semisubter-
ranean, earth covered pit house used by his ancestors. No difference
was noted in the construction of the cabins of the Indians and of the
white men. Log cabins with mossed chinks and moss covered over-
hanging roof are warm in winter but hot in summer. They are fre-
quently infested with vermin and are dark, as many have no windows.

The modern Indian of the Yukon valley builds a small canoe of
sawed boards after the model of the old birch bark canoe “ trich”
with its double overlapping strips of birch bark at the sides. A very
few old canoes of birch bark survive. They were modeled accord-
ing to the same principles as the kayak of the Eskimo and were
covered over with birch bark at prow and stern with an opening
large enough for only one person who operated the boat from a
kneeling position at the center of the canoe. The Tinne make beauti-
ful baskets of birch bark sewn with spruce roots around the margin,
also coiled baskets of willow and grass with decorative panels in
black, blue, and pink vegetable dyes.

The Yukon Indian still spears the lamphrey eel and catches fish in
traps through holes cut in the ice. The ice covering the Yukon in
winter reaches a thickness of from three to five feet. In summer
the native catches one or more tons of salmon in his fish wheel, dries
them, and packs them in bales. The Indian woman stands the entire
day at a fish rack cleaning the fish caught in the fish wheel. In pre-
serving their catch of fish no salt is used, but smoking over a slow
fire of green wood, grass, and moss is resorted to. Cured salmon
are eaten dry and uncooked. The Yukon Indian prefers beef, when-
ever he can get it, to caribou meat as he says meat of wild animals
has no strength. Sugar and tea are in great demand.

The kashim is an organization of the men of the village. A coun-
cil of three under the leadership of the village shaman is the ruling
body within the organization, whose visible incorporation is the

ture to the other, a distance of 30 to 40 feet. The slope of the roof

PR EUS ORIG VINEAABILANTS OF THE COLUMBIA
RIVES Re We IEE"
By HERBERT W. KRIEGER,

Curator, Division of Ethnology, U. S. National Mitsewmn

The tracing of early travel and migration routes in the Pacific
Northwest is one of the most absorbing phases in the study of primi-
tive American civilization. Archeological evidence of culture rela-
tionships that formerly existed between great groups of native
Americans has been found in the upper plateau region, in the basin
of the Columbia River in the states of Washington, Oregon, and
Idaho. In recent years studies of these early cultural relationships
have been made at various points in the valley of the Columbia by
the Washington State Museum, the University of California, the
American Museum of Natural History, and the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology.

During the summer and early fall of the current year archeological
investigations for the Bureau of American [Ethnology were con-
tinued in the arid section of the Columbia Basin and in the valley of
the Snake River. In 1926, the region extending from the mouth of
the Yakima River to the Canadian border was explored. During
the present season exploration of archeological sites was continued
from the mouth of the Yakima River to Mosier, Oregon, in the
vicinity of The Dalles. At this point an appreciable increase in rain-
fall and forest growth marks the dividing line between the humid
northwest coast and the arid plateau of the interior.

Of the many objects uncovered, a small number were of value in
distinguishing sub-culture areas, although in most essentials the
early occupants of the upper plateau possessed a remarkably uni-
form culture. The sub-culture area of north central Oregon appears
to be distinguished by the excellent chipping of weapon points and
tools from obsidian, jasper, agate, and chalcedony. The sub-area of
The Dalles and Miller Island, the so-called ‘ Dalles culture,” is
characterized to a greater degree than is the sub-area of north cen-
tral Oregon by realistically shaped animal and human figurines exe-
cuted in stone and wood and appearing on wooden combs, stone
pestle heads, stone bowls, and as stone plaques. The sub-area of The
Dalles is also unique in the possession of a lozenge or ovoid-shape

stone knife with beveled lateral surfaces shaped by rubbing. This
type of knife was found in abundance at Lyle, Washington. In the
Snake River valley a form of bone or horn knife supplants the
knife of chipped stone which prevails elsewhere in the Columbia
Basin except in the areas mentioned.

The materials used as tools, or as media on which to execute art
designs, are characteristic of very restricted localities and vary in
many instances from village to village. The distinctions are the more
clear cut, the more ancient the site and the more free the area from
the influence of contiguous culture areas. It appears that the realis-
tic carvings of the coast Chinook and Salish, executed for the most
part in wood but also in stone, were copied by the tribes of the arid
interior who used horn or stone as a medium. Jn such cases the more
remote the village from the influence of the realistic coast art, the
more frequently do geometric designs occur. Some Chinookan pieces
were carried up the Columbia River, while objects made by the coast
Salish found their way across the Cascades from Puget Sound and
British Columbia. The presence of nephrite celts in burial offerings
becomes less frequent the farther south one proceeds down the
Columbia River. None was found by the writer below the confluence
of the Yakima River.

The interior Salish tribes living in the valley of the Columbia
north of Saddle Mountains were influenced by the coast Salish, com-
munication being established through the Okanogan and Frazer
River valleys and the intervening mountain passes to Puget Sound.
The Shahaptian tribes were more directly influenced by the Chinook
of the lower Columbia Valley and have consequently a superior com-
mand of realistic art designs principally of animal and human figu-
rines in wood and horn. The so-called “ Dalles culture” is nothing
more than a modified coast culture.

Certain spots along the Columbia River were frequented by tribes
from tributary rivers, such as the Willamette, John Day, Deschutes
and others. These favored spots were near the falls or rapids of the
Columbia or of some tributary stream. Here were caught and dried
the salmon for the winter food supply. Here, also, was carried on
trade in hemp, dentalium shell (the wampum of the west), blankets,
and other native products, as well as in white man’s trade goods ob-
tained from trading posts. From the Shoshonean tribes on the east
and from the Nez Percé Indians in Idaho came native products such
as tanned bison skins, tailored costumes, elbow pipes and ornaments,
while from the north came nephrite celts and an occasional decorated
northwest coast pipe.

At Page, Washington, on the Snake River about 20 miles from
Pasco, were noted definite departures from the general type of
archeological remains characteristic of the sites along the Columbia
River. No copper ornaments or other objects of metal were found;
nor were any objects uncovered, other than dentalium shell, that
might indicate intercourse with British Columbia or with the tribes
of the lower Columbia. Bone knives and scrapers here displaced
those of chipped stone ; weaving implements and perforators were of
antler or bone instead of chipped or rubbed stone as on the Columbia.
Pairs of sandstone arrowshaft rasps; fine-grained, grooved stone
polishers ; basketry fragments, showing styles of false embroidery,
lattice weave, and simple twining ; ovoid stone war clubs; and burials
either with red paint or of the usual cremation group type—all these
characteristics indicate a sub-culture area transitional between the
Shoshoni on the east and south and the Shahaptian tribes of the
middle Columbia Basin.

A unique object exhumed from the cremation burial at Page is a
projectile weapon resembling a lance or atlatl head. The blade point
is of chipped jasper; the shaft is a stem of charred wood eight
and one-half inches long which tapers from a diameter of three-
fourths inch at the nocked base to less than one-half inch at the broken
nock end. A groove one-eighth of an inch deep and of equal width
extends the length of the shaft. The find of an atlatl among the
burial offerings at Page marks the first known occurrence of this
projectile weapon within the area of the upper plateau. The atlatl
dart is identical with that described and figured by Kidder and
Guernsey’ from the San Juan district in northeastern Arizona.

Native rock sculpture is of great interest although its significance
is often obscure. It is usually possible to correlate rock inscriptions
or pictographs with types of culture objects exhumed in cemeteries
or village sites within the area near by. In such cases the finding
of petroglyphs or pictographs becomes a key as to what objects of an
archeological nature one may expect to find in the vicinity. Realis-
tic animal figures carved on the basalt cliffs at Spearfish, Washing-
ton, and at The Dalles, Oregon, are similar to the animal figurines
carved in wood and horn by the Indian tribes of the lower Columbia
and of Puget Sound. Rock inscriptions at Roosevelt, Washington, ex-
cept for one maze-like inscription covering several square feet of
rock surface, are nondescript and have apparently little value as an
archeological key; while the paintings on the cliffs of the John Day

River are again typical of the area and remind one of the animal
figures etched in silhouette on the columnar basalt bluffs of the
Columbia River at Vantage Ferry, Kittitas County, Washington.
Inscriptions on the escarpment of the Snake River at various points,
as at Central Ferry, at Almota, at the mouth of the Alpawa River,
in Washington, and at Nampa and Pocatello, in Idaho, are character-
istic of the art designs of the area in which they occur and differ
markedly from rock inscriptions elsewhere.

differ radically from other nearby inscriptions and are not charac-
teristic of the petroglyphs or pictographs of central Idaho. They
resemble much more what one might expect to find in a typical
Basket Maker environment. It is possible that future investigations
will reveal the presence in the Snake River valley of other evidence
of a similar nature.

The type of early culture that existed within the arid sections of
the Columbia Basin is definitely established. Many of the connect-
ing culture and trade relationships are known. The relationship
with the Shoshoni and with the cultures on the south, those of the
Basket Maker and the Pueblo, is not yet clearly defined. Further
research along the Snake River and in southern Idaho will no doubt
bring out additional evidence of relationships with the pre-agricul-
tural peoples of the southwest.

PREALSEORIC: PUEBLO BONITO, NEW _MEXIEO
BY NER Me JUDD;

Curator, Division of American Archeology, U. S. National Museum

Since 1920, annual explorations* have been pursued under the
auspices of the National Geographic Society in Pueblo Bonito, at
once the largest, oldest and most important of the 17 major ruins
comprising Chaco Canyon National Monument, northwestern New
Mexico. These annual explorations, which I have had the pleasure of
directing, are now concluded and preparation of the final reports
recording the observations made is well under way.

Pueblo Bonito is not only the most important ruin in Chaco Canyon
but it is, perhaps, the most important structure of its period in the
entire Southwest. No other Pueblo village of pre-Spanish times so
far as we are aware exhibits in equal degree the high development in
civic organization, in architecture and the lesser cultural arts, so
evident at Pueblo Bonito. Here is represented the very acme of pre-
historic Pueblo civilization. Here are the crumbling walls of a vast
communal settlement—an aboriginal apartment house—whose 500 or
more connecting rooms, arranged in four terraced stories, sheltered
no less than 1,200 individuals. These were farmers, tillers of the desert
soil; their wide-spreading fields of corn, beans, and squash were
watered by spring and mid-summer floods that poured off the bor-
dering cliffs to be caught and diverted through man-made channels
to areas of cultivation. But in time these fertile lands were rendered
barren through thoughtless sacrifice of neighboring, limited forests
to the ambitious building programs of the villagers. With the forest
growth felled, arroyos formed ; fields were destroyed. Our archeologi-
cal evidence tends to show that altered geophysical conditions 1n Chaco
Canyon was one of two major factors contributing to the gradual
decline of Pueblo Bonito and its final abandonment approximately
1,000 years ago.

The Pueblo Bonito explorations of the National Geographic So-
ciety were brought to an end in 1926 and the season which followed
was devoted wholly to preparation of the writer’s final reports. But
occasional opportunity was found for re-examination of the canyon
walls and the table lands that stretch north and south from the Rio

Chaco. The handiwork of ancient man, his indefatigable energy, is
evidenced on every hand. Stairways, massive walls, “ roadways”
and divergent channels for irrigation are to be found in every section
of the canyon. And much of this ancient work is inexplicable to us
now; much represents a colossal and seemingly useless expenditure
of human labor.

Local works related to prehistoric agriculture are, unfortunately,
not at once apparent in this 20th Century. Chaco Canyon has changed
since Bonitian farmers scratched its clayey soil with their crude dig-
ging sticks and sought to insure more bountiful crops through dra-
matic ceremonials and the planting of feathered prayer plumes to
gods who control the rains. Fields once cultivated now le buried
beneath several feet of silty deposits, washed down from upper levels
and spread uniformly across the valley floor. With concealment of
these acres, time has also hidden from view those divergent channels
the ancients constructed. But here and there, newly formed arroyos
have cross-sectioned such a channel and perhaps disclosed the slab-
stones or the imprint of its wickerwork re-enforcements.

What the Navaho refer to as “ roadways ” offer an entirely different
problem. Imaginative Indians describe these cleared paths and ex-
pound at length upon the use to which they were put in ancient times,
but the more conservative and trustworthy individuals, like old Hosteen
Beyal, frankly admit that although they look like roads their makers
could not possibly have intended them for use as such. Our south-
western aborigines had no beasts of burden, excepting dogs, and no
wheeled vehicles prior to advent of the Spaniards in 1540. What func-
tion then did these “ roadways” serve?

Two seemingly reasonable explanations come to mind: They were
utilized either by religious processions passing from one community
to another at stated intervals or they were prepared for the easier
transportation of large timbers required in house construction. The
latter appears to me the more plausible explanation. Within the
historic period, Pueblo peoples are not known to have sent to neigh-
boring villages messengers on recurrent ceremonial missions of such
significance as to warrant prior construction of a special pathway ;
supposedly, no such necessity existed in prehistoric times. But a
“road” would both expedite and facilitate the transportation of logs.
Thousands of them were utilized in roofing the rooms of Pueblo
Bonito alone ; a newly felled pine is no light burden even for a dozen
men. Since the need for beams was fairly constant, the Chacoans
may well have anticipated the difficulties involved and lessened them
somewhat by preparing the “ roadways”’ under consideration. All

this, of course, is purely speculative. Positive proof is lacking. Yet
it is significant that these so-called “ roads,” traceable on both sides
of Chaco Canyon, often lead from near a major ruin back across
the mesas to another ruin or to some rocky ridge or rincon where pine
trees doubtless grew in former times.

Pecked stairs occur wherever such a “ road” crosses a natural ter-
race or ledge. Frequently these obstacles are so insignificant, com-
paratively, as to raise a question as to the necessity for steps, especially
steps from 5 to 18 feet in width. I have seen Navaho drive their
wagons with little hesitation over far rougher places. Yet, with rude
stone hammers, the prehistoric Chacoans cut these stairs from solid
sandstone to provide surer footing for their sandaled feet. No un-
certainty exists on this score.

On the mesa north of Pueblo Bonito is a vast mound of fallen
masonry known as old Pueblo Alto. Some 200 yards south of the
ruin, a step series leads downward to connect with a “ roadway ” ex-
tending southeasterly more than a mile to the rim of Chaco Canyon
where a stairway, now almost wholly obliterated through weathering
processes, descends into the canyon. For a considerable distance this
“road” is recognizable by the retaining wall on its lower side ; in one
place, it bisects a rounded knoll. Across bare sandstone, occupying
the approximate middle of the “ road,’ a pecked groove follows the
irregular surface to lose itself under drifted sand and to reappear
again and again. Its true significance remains unknown; we have ob-
served no similar groove in connection with other ancient ‘ roads’ in
Chaco Canyon.

3elow the mesa top, half a mile northwest of Pueblo Bonito, and
on the west side of the rincon north of Chettro Kettle are long terraces
whose massive masonry, roughly laid, slopes upward and toward the
cliff. These, too, are known to the Indians as roads but they lead
nowhere. Each is barred by colossal sandstone blocks; cliffs crowd
in at one side. Neither shows trace of former buildings nor indication
of agriculture. In both cases the filled and fairly level area resulting
seems wholly inadequate for any purpose commensurate with the labor
each terrace represents.

Throughout the Chaco Canyon region successive generations of
prehistoric men have left their finger prints to mark a slow but cer-
tain progress from a primitive, semi-nomadic mode of life to that
highly organized social state evidenced by Pueblo Bonito and its neigh-
boring ruins. But not all the diversified achievements of these ancient
folk are interpretable from the fragmentary record we have inherited.

THE ESKIMO OF WESTERN ALASKA

By HENRY Bs COLEINS | IR.
Assistant Curator, Division of Ethnology, U. S. National Museum

From the standpoint of the anthropologist, the section of Alaska,
from Bristol Bay northward along the coast to the mouth of the
Yukon, is one of much interest, for here dwell the most primitive
group of Eskimo to be found in all of Alaska. The region is bleak
and dreary in the extreme, consisting for the most part of vast
stretches of flat monotonous tundra broken in places by low mountains
which extend to the coast and stand out as bold capes and headlands.
The Bering Sea is here very shallow and frequently stormy, making
navigation difficult. There are hardly more than a dozen white people
in this entire region and no industrial or commercial activity of any
kind, hence it is seldom visited by ships from the outside. Due to their
isolated position the Eskimo here have retained more of the essential
features of their native culture than those of any other part of Alaska.

For the purpose of observing these people, their manner of life
and their physical type, as well as to collect skeletal and cultural ma-
terial from inhabited and abandoned villages, the writer and Mr. T.
Dale Stewart, of the Division of Physical Anthropology, U. S. Na-
tional Museum, were detailed to conduct field-work along the coast
of western Alaska, including the island of Nunivak, in continuation
of the anthropological survey of northern and central Alaska made
by Dr. Ales Hrdlicka in the summer of 1926. The work was conducted
under the auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the U. S.
National Museum, the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, and the American Council of Learned Societies.

We were fortunate in obtaining transportation to Nunivak Island
on the U. S. S. Boxer, operated by the Federal Bureau of Education
in the interest of the native schools it maintains throughout Alaska.
The Boxer stopped at Unalaska, Akutan, and Ugashik on the Aleutian
Islands and the Alaska Peninsula, and later at Kanakanak on the
upper part of Bristol Bay. Here the Bureau of Education has estab-
lished an orphanage and hospital and is doing a splendid work in
educating and supporting the native children whose parents have
died during the repeated influenza epidemics of recent years. Thanks

to the willing cooperation of the Bureau representatives, we were
able to obtain measurements on the full blood children, 42 in num-
ber, and in addition to investigate some of the nearby sites of old
settlements.

Leaving Bristol Bay we continued northward along the coast,
stopping at Kulukak, Togiak, Mumtrak, and Tanunuk. The Eskimo
here live in small villages, usually along the coast near the mouth of
a stream. They subsist principally on fish, seal, and birds, together
with berries and a few other native plants. The most important item
of their clothing is the inevitable parka, a long coat-like garment made
of feathers or fur. Their dwellings are semi-subterranean, consisting
of a square or octagonal excavation from one to three feet deep with
walls and roof built up of successive tiers of driftwood logs, for
there is no timber anywhere along the coast north of Bristol Bay.
The outside is completely covered with sod on which in summer there
is growing grass, giving to the house more the appearance of a small
mound than a dwelling. The houses are entered through a small ante-
chamber, connected with the main room by a narrow tunnel-like pas-
sage. A characteristic feature of these Eskimo villages is the kashim,
or kuzhge, where the men and boys spend the greater part of their time
and where the dances and winter ceremonies are held. The kashim
is larger than the women’s house and in construction differs from it
in several respects. For winter travel the Eskimo use sleds and dog
teams while in summer most of their journeys are made in the kayak,
the ingeniously made skin boat so typical of the Eskimo everywhere.
The kayak has a light frame of drift-wood tightly lashed together
with leather thongs and covered over with seal skin. A round opening
is left at the center just large enough to hold two people sitting back
to back. In front of the paddler, resting on ivory pegs along the
sloping top of the kayak, are laid the harpoon, bird spears, and throw-
ing stick, but in addition to these native weapons of the chase, the
Eskimo of today usually has a rifle or shotgun stowed away inside
the kayak.

On June 21st we landed at Nash Harbor on the northwestern end
of Nunivak Island, 48 days after leaving Seattle. Here at the small
native village of Kligachimiuny is located the Bureau school under
the able management of Mr. and Mrs. Irving H. Bird. Shortly after
our arrival at Nash Harbor, our party was increased to three by the
arrival of Mr. C. G. Harrold, Canadian ornithologist, who was col-
lecting for the California Academy of Sciences.

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1927 155

Nunivak Island is 70 miles long and about 45 miles wide, but there
are no dependable charts of its shores except for two restricted locali-
ties. The eastern and central parts of the island are rather flat except
for a few isolated mountains of no great height. To the west, however,
there is a gradual rise and the shore line is rugged and precipitous.

While very little was definitely known of them, the Nunivak Es-
kimo have long been regarded as the most primitive in this remote
region. This we found to be true. Women were found still wearing
the lip, ear and nose ornaments of beads and walrus ivory that were
given up years ago by the other Eskimo of western Alaska. The
elaborate observances and ceremonies relating to the hunting of the
seal and their social and religious life in general, furnish additional
evidence of the extreme conservatism of these people.

Our first work at Nash Harbor was to take measurements and
physiological observations on the natives. We then explored on foot
much of the western end of the Island, collecting bones and ethno-
logical material from several deserted villages and finally from the vil-
lage at Nash Harbor. Having completed the work at the western end
of Nunivak, we moved on to Amolowikimiut, a native village at Cape
Etolin some thirty miles to the east. Work here was continued as
before, and was greatly facilitated by the intelligent cooperation of
Mr. Paul Ivanoff, the native trader.

In August we left Nunivak, Mr. Stewart going to St. Michael with
the trader from Tanunuk village, Nelson Island, while I followed
shortly afterwards with the Ivanoff family. A stop was made at
Hooper Bay, a very interesting Eskimo village on the mainland be-
tween Nunivak and the Yukon, and additional collections and anthro-
pometric data were secured. From St. Michael the outward trip was
made up the Yukon to Nenana, and thence to the coast to Seward,
affording an opportunity to observe the Eskimo along the lower
Yukon and later the Athapascan Indians further up the river.

As a result of the summer’s work there were collected several
hundred skulls with numerous skeletons, while measurements were
taken of some 180 living Eskimo. The measurements on the living
are the first to be made in western Alaska, and these together with
the skeletal remains will furnish the first adequate knowledge of the
physical type of this little known region.

It would be impossible to mention the names of all to whom we

are indebted for assistance. Particular thanks, however, are due to

THE ARCHEOLOGY OF THE PIEDMONT REGION OF
SGU TE CAROEINA
3y J. WALTER FEWKES,
Chief, Bureau of American Ethnology

The eastern horizon or boundary of the Mound Builder Culture of
eastern North America has been very little investigated by archeolo-
gists and, in spite of the fact that it presents instructive local variations,
the character of that portion of it which extended east of the Blue
Ridge is but slightly known. The archeology of South Carolina has
a very limited bibliography, few contributions having been made
during the present century, although the aboriginal tribes of the State
were interesting and important. However, one or two local collections
not reproduced in any publication indicate that this is a promising
area for the field worker. I was induced to visit the Piedmont area
of this State in the summer of 1927 by letters from the owner of
one of these collections, Mr. W. J. Thackston of Greenville, and the
results of my preliminary investigations are here given. Mr. Thack-
ston called my attention to several other collections made by residents
of Greenville and was instrumental in obtaining permission for me
to study and photograph them and describe them in print. He accom-
panied me on excursions to study and compare the mounds and other
major antiquities of the region, but no excavations were undertaken,
such work being postponed until a time when more money would be
available.

The majority of the objects here shown are in the very valuable
collection of Mr. Charles F. Schwing of Greenville, who afforded me
every opportunity to study his specimens and publish a preliminary
description of them, and I take this occasion to thank him and Mr.
Thackston, as well as many others who expressed the greatest interest
in the investigations and aided me in the work. In fact the kindness
shown me on this visit made this one of the happiest months of the
many I have spent in archeological research. I returned to Wash-
ington in the closing days of the fiscal year with a strong desire to
continue my explorations at this point and pursue them at other places
east of the Alleghanies.

A fact that impressed me very strongly was that, while valuable col-
lections had been made in the Piedmont section, there is as yet no
attempt to correlate this material with corresponding material from

the adjacent archeological culture areas. It would be highly desirable,
therefore, not only to gather more artifacts and locate more prehis-
toric sites east of the Blue Ridge but also to determine the relationship
of the Indians of this territory to other Mound Builders. The pre-
historic pipes and pottery contained in the above collections are charac-
teristic of the southern Mound Builders, particularly those of the
Gulf region. Their closest counterparts occur in the mounds of
Arkansas and Missouri. As a rule the pottery is not as varied as
that of the Pueblo Indians, mainly because none of it is painted. The
common types of vessels are unglazed globular food bowls with decora-
tions stamped in. Although the material thus far collected may not
be sufficient to enable the archeologist to determine the tribe to which
its makers belonged, it is probably akin to the productions of the
Cherokee or some Indians of the Muskhogean stock.

The human effigy vase shown in figure 186, C and D, is thought
to belong to the Middle Mississippi group, several specimens of
which were figured by Prof. Holmes (20th Ann. Rep., Bur. Amer.
I:thnol.). This one is of the same general character as others found
in sites near the eastern and western boundaries of the Middle
Mississippi group but rarely at intermediate points. It has passed
through several hands, but the story of its discovery is so definite
that there appears to be no reason to doubt it. According to this, it
was picked up by a boy at the foot of a low cliff on the left bank
of Savannah River not far from Augusta. The cliff had no doubt been
occupied by Indians and the vase washed out of it by the river. I was
not able to visit the locality myself but quote reliable informants. So
far as I am aware, this human effigy vase is the only one of its type
ever obtained from the Piedmont region of South Carolina. There is
no record of anything of the kind from the Ohio Valley mounds or
mounds on the Gulf coast, but Prof. Holmes has figured many from
Arkansas. The two sperical bowls in figure 186, 4 and B, bear incised
designs formed by stamping. They are almost identical with similar
objects from Weeden Mound near St. Petersburg, Florida, but their
marginal decorations are different from those with which I am
familiar on all stamped ware from that State. The row of raised
rings on the outer margin of B is an exceptional feature that has never
been noted on Mound Builder pottery of the stamped variety.

In figure 187, B and C, are represented two beautiful globular bowls
in the Thackston collection, supposed to be ancient Catawba ware.
It is reported that they were found near Catawba River, and thus there
is some support for the identification, but modern Catawba ware

lived in western South Carolina, but, until we have established the
characteristic pottery of each, it is not possible to refer the specimens
figured here to any one of them. Bowl C of the above figure has a
simple ring of incised dots equatorially placed, and B has an original
design of considerable complication covering the whole exterior. It
consists of incised grooves so arranged as to indicate several figures
which are partly decorative and partly conventionalized. The circle
with tripointed figure, shown at the left, is also found repeatedly, in
combination with serpent designs, in the decoration of Mound Builder
pottery. In several figures snake symbols may easily be traced. It
would appear that this vessel was used in some of the Sun-Serpent
ceremonies indicated in the Mound Builder ceramics of several tribes. -
A represents two pieces of partially fractured pottery in the Hertzog
collection. Their form is exceptional; both have similar deeply
grooved parallel markings on the exterior, and remnants of legs, a
feature rare in prehistoric American pottery. From the arrangement
of the markings it would appear that the maker intended to represent
some quadruped.

The clay and stone tobacco pipes of the Piedmont region suffer
little in comparison with those which have been found west of the
Blue Ridge and some of them are unique in their excellence. I do
not remember to have seen, or to have read of, a Mound Builder
pipe as good as that shown in figure 188, A, and it is well known that
in the technique of the “ platform” and “ monitor ” pipes the Mound
Builders excelled. Their productions in this line are among the best
examples of prehistoric American stone work. Some authors have
questioned the antiquity of the bird pipes of the Mound Builders,
but a careful study of the works of those who have done so and of
the examples of these objects in the Greenville collections leaves no
doubt in my mind that they are purely aboriginal and were not made
by white men for the Indian trade. The unfinished “ bird pipe” in
figure 188, C, is very significant in this connection. It is a fine stone
pipe in which the bowl has not been hollowed out or the stem
perforated.

The occurrence of stone bird pipes in the eastern Mound Builder
area proves that they were the occasion for long journeys or passed
long distances in trade, and I am reminded of a stone bird pipe from
Turks Island figured by Rudolf Cronau in his book on America,
which is so close to one from South Carolina shown here as to indi-
cate that it was probably brought to the West Indies from the
continent.

Our knowledge of the Indians who inhabited the Piedmont area
of South Carolina is imperfect, derived mainly from the writings of
a few travelers and traders whose observations were made between
two hundred and three hundred years ago, and they afford us little
information regarding the culture of the people. The artifacts here
figured are the same as those found in the Mississippi Valley belonging
to the so called Mound Builder culture, the most highly developed in
North America north of Mexico, and the recognition of their affinity
is most important. If the people who made them may be classed with
the Mound Builders, they were no longer mere hunters and fishers
but had in fact reached the agricultural stage. They constituted a
marginal area of that great mound building culture, which, in prehis-
toric times, was one of the highest and most widely extended in North
America, and to a knowledge of this a more extensive examination

of these and similar objects will vastly contribute. No addition to
our knowledge of the Mound Builders from documentary sources ts,
of course, to be looked for, and we must therefore rely upon archeo-
logical investigation to add new pages to our limited knowledge of
them and through them to our knowledge of prehistoric man in
America. There are numerous mounds of considerable size in the
region we are discussing which demand investigation and many more
artifacts may undoubtedly be obtained from them. It is highly im-
probable that these mounds were made by the Indians found in
possession when the country was first visited by white men. They are
rather to be attributed to stocks related to those of the Mississippi
Valley which, from causes unknown, had drifted eastward in pre-
historic times. Only the archeologist can solve the problem which
these mysterious people present—the Mound Builders of the Pied-
mont, whose nearest relatives were the better known Mound Builders
of the Mississippi Valley.

ole EA SIGE MAKER VIE EAGE OF THE SOUTHWEST

By FRANK Ho EE ROBERTS, JR;
Archeologist, Bureau of American Ethnology

The remains of a village erected during the late Basket Maker
period were excavated by the writer in the Chaco Canyon, New
Mexico, during the summer of 1927, to obtain much-needed infor-
mation on a little-known phase of prehistoric southwestern archeology.
The site is located on top of the mesa which forms the southern wall
of the canyon nine miles east of the great ruins of Pueblos Bonito and
Chettro Kettle. Originally the village consisted of 18 houses, a large
circular ceremonial room or kiva, and 48 storage bins (fig. 190).

Prehistoric sedentary cultures in the southwest have been grouped
into two divisions called Basket Maker and Pueblo, the latter including
the cliff-dwellers. The Basket Maker group, which is the older, has
three subdivisions and the Pueblo has five. It was towards the end
of the third phase of the Basket Maker era that the village in the
Chaco Canyon was built and inhabited. Intervening between its
abandonment and decay and the present day was the whole Pueblo
cycle.

During the Basket Maker III period, frequently called the Post-
3asket Maker, the crude one-room domiciles which the people erected
to shield themselves from the vagaries of the weather were generally
located on mesa tops and along the upper ledges of canyon walls, 1f a
large natural cavern was not available. The houses were indeed primi-
tive. They consisted of an oval or rectangular excavation roofed over
with a pole, brush, and plaster superstructure. The earth walls of the
excavation were covered with thick plaster made from adobe or were
lined with large stone slabs (fig. 192). In the latter case, the plaster
was applied to the faces of the slabs. our posts set in the floor about
two feet from the corners of the room supported the superstructure.
These posts carried a rectangular framework against which were
placed the upper ends of small poles, the lower ends of which were
embedded in the earth around the periphery of the excavation. These
small poles formed the sloping, upper walls of the house. The rec-
tangular space at the top probably had a flat roof with an opening in
the center to serve as a smoke hole, possibly on occasions as an
entrance. The entire wooden structure was then covered with twigs,
bark, and plaster (fig. 191).

Little remained of the interior furnishings. In the center of each
room was a rectangular or circular firepit. A few inches from the
firepit was a small circular hole in the floor which is possibly anal-
ogous to the sipapu of later day kivas. The latter symbolizes the
mythical place of emergence through which the present Pueblo Indians
believe their ancestors passed on their journey from the underworld
to the surface of the earth. In the days when the Chaco village was
inhabited, each dwelling may have had its own shrine, whereas in
following periods it was deemed essential only to the ceremonial house.
Other small holes in the plastered floor no doubt served as storage
places for small objects. In many of the houses a row of upright slabs

formed a bin-like compartment on the side in which the doorway
was located (fig. 193). There was generally an opening in the center
of this row of slabs immediately in front of the doorway. Associated
with this was an upright slab set in the floor between the doorway
and the firepit. The latter, like the deflector in kivas, would prevent
cold air from rushing through the opening and directly onto the fire.

Most of the houses appeared to have had an entry-way on the
south or southeast side. The doorway of the main room gave access
into a short passage which in turn opened into an oval room. The
latter was roofed in much the same fashion as the dwelling except
that there were no interior supporting posts. Because of its smaller
size the sloping side poles would carry the weight of the superstruc-
ture without additional aid. They probably met at the center, giving
a conical shape to the covering. The ante-chamber of these domiciles
108 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

is suggestive of the entry-ways in earth lodges built by modern Indians,
by the Eskimo, and even by the Palae-Asiatic peoples.

The dimensions of the main room of the houses averaged 12 by 14
feet, and the excavation was three feet deep. The angle of the small
post holes around the periphery indicated that the ceiling of the flat
portion of the superstructure had been about six feet above the floor.

A striking and somewhat unexpected feature of the village was the
large circular enclosure which appears to have been a kiva. As in the
houses, slabs were used extensively in its construction. Large flat

stones lined the periphery of the excavation and the facing of the en-
circling bench was of the same material (fig. 194). The space between
the two rows of slabs was filled with adobe mortar and stone spalls.
On top of the bench was a smooth hard coating of plaster. The roof
was supported on four large posts and no doubt was of the same type
of construction as in the houses. There was a rectangular firepit near
the center of the room but no “ sipapu”’ in evidence. Set in the floor
between the firepit and the south side of the room was the broken
end of a large stone slab, the deflector. There did not appear to have
been an ante-chamber on the southern side and the entrance to the
structure was probably through the roof.

The diameter of the outer circle of slabs was 40 feet, and the inner,
the face of the bench, averaged 36 feet. It is possible that in this struc-
ture is to be seen the predecessor of the great kivas of the Chaco
pueblo cultures.

Bins in which was stored the corn, raised on the canyon floor below,
were simple in form and were constructed in the same fashion as
the dwellings. They differed, however, in that no interior support
poles were used in the construction of the roof. The latter, like the
ante-chamber coverings, was no doubt cone-shaped. The circular
or oval pit averaged about six feet in diameter and three feet in
depth.

Pottery found at this village was crude compared to that of the
following pueblo periods (fig. 195). Characteristic forms were full-
bodied jars with constricted, bottle-neck openings ; full-bodied vessels
with wide orifices ; globular-shaped pots with a small opening at the
top ; pitchers ; bowls; and ladles. There were no corrugated pieces of
the type commonly found in pueblo ruins. The surface finish on the
vessels is rather rough. The general color is a grayish to brownish
white. Ornamentation of the wares was confined to painted decora-
tions on bowl and ladle interiors. The designs were simple and in
general are highly suggestive of the basketry of the preceding period
(fig. 197). The pigment is a brownish black in color.

There was a great variety of bone implements, needles, awls,
scrapers, and hair-pins in the material from the houses (fig. 196).
Stone objects were chiefly in the form of metates, manos, mauls,
scrapers, knives, and a few arrowheads. The bow and arrow was just
coming into use at the end of this period.

The village had no definite cemetery. The dead were interred
wherever it was found convenient to scoop out a shallow grave. In
practically all cases the body had been placed on its back, head to the
west, face to the north, with the knees flexed. Only three of the burials
had accompanying mortuary offerings. The absence of grave furniture
does not necessarily imply that the dead were buried without the
usual offerings of food and water to sustain the spirit in its journey
to the great beyond. At that stage in southwestern development, when
pottery was just beginning to be used, baskets were the main con-
tainers, and it is probable that the funerary deposits were of materials
which long since have crumbled into dust.

THE MISSION INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA

By J. P. HARRINGTON,
Ethnologist, Bureau of American Ethnology

The Presidio of Santa Barbara has been founded only 155 years,
the Santa Barbara Mission, only 141 years. Yet this brief period
has seen two distinct forms of European civilization sweep over the
fertile lands of the valley of Santa Barbara, a Spanish and an Ameri-
can culture, each with its peculiar institutions, language, and details
of life. Only sierra and sea still have the appearance which they
presented in Indian times, and in the valley perhaps a few oak trees
or hillside boulders which have escaped molestation ; but not a trace
is left above ground of the intricate native civilization, the Indian
mode of life, which seemed up to the beginning of this foreign period
so stable and natural and so conducive to health and longevity that
the native people never dreamed that any other mode of living was
possible.

For the purpose of obtaining further important information on the
ancient languages and customs of this region, the writer was sent to
the field at the close of October, 1927, and continued his field studies
until the end of the year, obtaining a large mass of information linguis-
tically correct and in part new, in part corroborative of information
obtained in previous years regarding the ancient culture. Working
with the poor last survivors, and these too young to know many things
except by hearsay difficult of interpretation, the great task has been
correctly to supply the details of the former culture, and this is im-
possible of accomplishment except through an exhaustive analysis of
the language. Much was learned however, from reliable Indian infor-
mants, of the native customs and mode of life of the Mission Indians
of former days.

It was the ideal of these Indians to go about in the lightest costume
possible. Their children were in and out of the water all day long,
and the men and many of the women were expert swimmers. Children
and adults rarely if ever caught cold and attained an excellent mus-
cular development. They were a race of runners, swimmers, hunters,
and fishers. The only clothing prescribed was a petticoat for the
women. Warm blankets sewed or woven of skins were at hand for
those who cared to wear them.

Men frequently wore the hair in a pug on the front of the head,
standing up in Goddess of Liberty fashion, and the women wore bangs.
A wig of Chinese hair was found very useful by the writer in studying
hair dressing. All the effect of a kaiser moustache was given by a
bar of shell inserted through the nose of the men. Face and body hairs
were plucked out, using clam shells as tweezers.

The Indian family would rise at daylight and take a plunge in the
nearest water. After a light breakfast they were off for the adven-
tures of the day. The men would go hunting or fishing or visiting
around on business that seemed as important to them as ours does
to us, the women in quest of seeds, roots, greens, basketry materials.
There was much lunching or munching all day long. The meal of
the day was when the people had returned to camp in the evening.
The staple food was acorn mush, along with a great variety of other
natural products, many of them delicious, prepared by peculiar proc-
esses. Sometimes a midnight lunch was eaten, especially in the long
winter nights.

The principle of the Turkish bath was known to these Indians. In
a lodge that could be shut up tightly, either dug into a cliff or built
semi-subterranean fashion with entrance at the top, a hot fire was
kindled with light wood. After the bathers had become very warm in
these lodges, they suddenly emerged and ran, often with shouts, to
near-by water and plunged in, and after splashing about for a time,
reentered the bath lodge to become dry and warm again.

The Indians were a proud people, alert and shrewd, and carried an
age of eighty or ninety years much more lightly than white people do.
There are authentic records of extreme age among these Indians.
Even when lounging about camp, they were taught to be alert, and to
maintain such positions that they could spring to their feet in an
instant.

The houses were shaped like a half orange, and were constructed
of a framework of willow or sycamore poles, thatched with tule, car-
rizo, brakes, or other material at hand. There was a low door, and
some huts had holes for windows. With a sharp stick one could
poke through the wall of the hut, and mischievous boys sometimes
tried this trick on the unsuspecting inmates. A rancheria or village
consisted of a group of a few of these houses, usually arranged in
chance rows. Each rancheria had a captain, distinguished in no way,
as far as dress or appearance went, from an ordinary Indian. He
arranged fiestas with other chiefs, gave advice in many matters, but
the whole social organization was most simple and democratic. There
were no slaves.

Special attention was given by the writer to the study of the manu-
factures of these people, so few of which are known except from
excavated remains. Roughly speaking, stone, bone, and shell have
survived in the ground, and all else has perished, except by the rarest
coincidence. The nicety of the objects manufactured by these people
called forth admiration in the diaries of early explorers. Considerable
variation existed in the materials and methods of use of utensils and
regalia.

The placenames contained in the Diario of Fr. José Maria Zalvidea,
1806, were deciphered from the original manuscript in the Santa
Barbara Mission archives with the collaboration of my friend, Fr.
Zephyrin Engelhardt, the historian of the Missions, the corrected list
standing as follows: Jonatas, Saca, Olomosoug, Gecp, Jalihuilimit,
Lisahua, Cuia, Siguicon, Sgene, Malapoa, Napolea, Sisupistu, Tupai,
Tacui, Yaguelame, Majagua, Taslupi, Castegue, Atongai, Guapiabit,
Guapia, Moscopiabit, Guapiana. The correct reading of several of
these names is important, for they have hitherto been quoted in incor-
rect form.

At the special request of the Chief of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, a study was made of the finds recently made at the E. W.
Alexander Ranch near Santa Barbara. A large number of objects
were unearthed by chance in the orchard of Mr. Alexander at the site
of the former Los Prietos rancheria. It was a burial cache only a few
feet in diameter, very likely made when the rancheria was abandoned.
Through the courtesy of Mr. Alexander, black and green steatite
dishes of saucerlike size and thinness were examined; also a round-
ended and a straight-ended arrow-straightener, both beautifully made
of black steatite. A pipe of black steatite contained Calandrinia seeds
which had evidently been thrown into the grave as a votive offering,
