PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 18, 1847.]

INTRODUCTION.

!
General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a
Plan of Organization.

1. Witt or Suiruson. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, ‘‘ to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INsTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.”’

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government of
the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the
testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently
supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and
perpetuate his name.

4. The objects of the Institution are, Ist, to increase, and 2d, to
diffuse knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addi-
tion of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus
increased, among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge ; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should
be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either
at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-
sionally, can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or be
abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,
8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

a considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be
added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,
the funds are small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the
construction of the building ; and not only the first cost of the edifice
should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in
repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected
with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-
ported by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be bene-
fitted by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure
on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

_ 14. Besides the foregoing considerations deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements
of the act of Congress establishing the Institution These are, a
library, a museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal
scale to contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of Organization of the Institution in accordance with theaforegoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To Incruase Knoweper. It is proposed—
1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-
ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

To Dirruse Know tener. It is proposed—
1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge ; and

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I.—By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all
branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of volumes,
in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to Know-
ledge.

3 No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for
publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human
knowledge, resting on original research ; and all unverified specula-
tions to be rejected.

4. Hach memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

the branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for pub-
lication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,
and the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a
favorable decision be made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions
of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all the
colleges and principal libraries in this country. One part of the
remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other carefully pre-
served, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand from
new institutions.

7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to
Congress.

Il.—By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects, and the amount appropriated, to be recommended
by counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects, so that, in
course of time, each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,
with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge.

4, Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the
problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,
magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the
formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determination
of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of light;
chemical analyses of soils and plants; collection and publication of
scientific facts, accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches and accurate surveys of places celebrated
in American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the dif-
ferent races of men in North America; also, explorations and accurate
surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of our
country.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

1.—By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year in
all branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interest-
ing, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the
J0 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals, as the
income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of knowledge
may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge.

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publica-
tions, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his report;
to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on the title-
page of the report.

4, The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons
interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it
without purchasing the whole.

5. These reports may be presented to Congress for partial distri-
bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific
institutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in
the reports:

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,
and meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4, Application of science to arts.

II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &c.

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world, penal reform, &c.

III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.
10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.
12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals,

II. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the
direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission
of competent judges previous to their publication.
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. Tl

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of
the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in
the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents providing for the two modes of increasing and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated
the formation of a library and a museum; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the income* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme
before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of
a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible one with another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required,
consisting, Ist, of a complete collection of the transactions and pro-
ceedings of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the more
important current periodical publications, and other works necessary
in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of
experimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those men-
tioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United
States should be procured, in order that the valuable books first pur-
chased may be such as are not to be found in the United States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-
graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any work
which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary
to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts
of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of ex-
pense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other
similar societies.

{2 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of
antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-
sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except
one, to act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to.
the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,
keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and
keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,
employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art ; distinguished individuals should also be invited to
give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-
come the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change
is that expressed by the following resolutions adopted January 15,
1855, viz:

Resolved, That the 7th resolution, passed by the Board of Regents
on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the in-
come between the active operations and the museum and library,
when the buildings are completed, be and it is hereby repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,
be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-
ance, and a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY FOR 1858.

To the Board of Regents of the’ Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: The principal event of importance in the history of
the Institution during the past year is the transfer of the government
collections from the Patent Office to the large room of the Smithsonian
building.

It will be recollected that by the law of Congress incorporating this
Institution ‘‘all objects of art and of foreign and curious research,
and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mine-
ralogical specimens belonging to or hereafter to belong to the United
States which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody
the same may be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be author-
ized by the Board of Regents to receive them.”’

The law thus giving to the Smithsonian Institution all speci-
mens illustrative of nature and art to be found in the several offices
and departments of government was not construed as rendering it
obligatory on the Regents to accept these objects if they considered
it inexpedient to do so. Inasmuch, then, as this collection was
neither essential to the plan of organization nor directly subservi-
ent to the comprehensive purpose of the donor in regard to a
world-wide benefit, it was the ultimate decision of a majority of the
Board that it ought not to be accepted and that no part of the dona-
tion ought to be expended in the care of property belonging to the
government of the United States.

Previous to the discussion of this question it had been assumed that
the Regents were under an obligation to take charge of the museum,
and, on this account principally, a large and expensive building had
been thought necessary. After it was settled, however, that the
Regents were not bound to accept this trust, the work of construction
was carried on more slowly, with a view at once to secure certain
advantages to the building itself, and to increase the principal by
funding the interest of the money which would be absorbed by its
completion.

In the meantime a very large amount of specimens of natural his-
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tory had accumulated at the Institution from numerous exploring
parties sent out by the general government; and as these collections had
been made under the direction of the Institution, and their preser-
vation was of the highest.importance to the natural history of the
country, it was finally concluded that if Congress would make an
appropriation for the transfer and new arrangement of the articles
then in the Patent Office, and continhe the annual appropriation
previously made for their care and exhibition while in charge of the
Commissioner of Patents, the Institution would, under these con-
ditions, become the curator of the national collections. This propo-
sition was agreed to by the government, and the contemplated transfer
has accordingly been made.

It is believed that this arrangement will be mutually beneficial to
the Patent Office and the Institution, since the former will be relieved
from a duty scarcely compatible with the design of its establishment,
and will gain possession of one of the largest rooms in the city for
the exhibition of a class of models to which the public have not pre-
viously had ready access; while the Smithsonian Institution will be
able to present to the strangers who visit Washington a greater num-
ber of objects of interest, and appropriate that portion of the large
building not required for its own most important operations to a use-
ful purpose.

The cost of keeping the collections at the Patent Office, including
fuel, was about $4,000 annually, but the Regents might with justice
have asked for an additional amount sufficient to pay the interest on
the cost of that portion of the edifice occupied by the museum. It was,
however, thought more prudent to restrict the application to the sum
above mentioned, and to request that the appropriation might be con-
tinued under the charge of the Secretary of the Interior, thus obvi-
ating the necessity of an annual application to Congress by the
Institution itself,

The cases at present required for the accommodation of the collec-
tions have been constructed at a cost within the appropriation made
for that purpose; and the Institution is indebted to Hon. J. Thomp-
son, Secretary of the Interior, and Hon. J. Holt, Commissioner of
Patents, for the use of glass sash and shelving no longer needed in
the room which formerly contained the museum in the Patent Office,
but which have been applied to good purpose in supplying deficiencies
in the Smithsonian building. The Regents are also indebted to Thos.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

U. Walter, esq., architect of the United States Capitol extension, for
the beautiful design of the cases, and to Edw. Clark, esq., architect of
the Interior Department, for the inspection of the work during its
progress and the examination of the accounts presented by the con-
tractor.

In order to increase the capacity of the large room appropriated to
the collection, the cases have been arranged in two stories, forming a
series of alcoves and a gallery on each side. By the adoption of this
plan space can be provided for double the number of specimens which
were exhibited at the Patent Office.

A considerable portion of the collections has been arranged, and a
taxidermist employed to repair the specimens of zoology which have
been damaged, and to prepare for exhibition others which had not
previously been mounted. The museum will soon be an object of
continued and increasing interest to the inhabitants of the city and to
strangers who visit the capital of the United States.

Among the specimens many duplicates occur which might be ad-
vantageously distributed perhaps to the principal societies of natural
history in this and other countries; and I respectfully ask the Board
of Regents to determine, regarding this point, whether, in their judg-
ment, the Institution can venture to make such distribution without
further instruction from Congress. If within its power, this measure
would seem evidently calculated to further one of the legitimate ends
of the Institution in diffusing more widely the materials of science and
the means of education.

An assent to the arrangement above stated for taking charge of the
government collections is by no means inconsistent with the regret
expressed in previous reports that the Jaw of Congress directed pro-
vision to be made from the Smithsonian fund for a public museum and
library. It must be evident to any one who attentively studies the
past history of the operations of the Institution that the interest of
the money expended on the building intended for this purpose would
have been much more efficiently applied in the development and publica-
tion of new truths. But, in all cases where many views are to be
consulted, the question is not merely what ought to be, but what can
be accomplished. From the first there has existed a clear conception
of the means by which the idea of the donor could be best realized,
and the aim of the majority of the Regents has continually been to
approximate, as nearly as the restrictions of Congress would allow, to
the plan originally proposed. The policy has been invariably the
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

same, and the present reputation and generally acknowledged success
of the Institution are the result of this undeviating course.

It is a matter of congratulation to be able to announce to the Board
the continued prosperous financial condition of the Institution. The
investment of the extra fund in State stocks has proved to be judicious.
They now yield the Institution an annual income of upwards of seven
thousand dollars. It may also be mentioned in this place, as a fact of
interest to the friends of the Institution, that from the report of the
governor of Arkansas it appears that the original fund received by
the United States,from Smithson’s bequest, and lent by the govern-
ment to that State, will in due time be repaid, and that the general
government will in no respect be a loser by having accepted the
charge and administration of this trust.

The income of the Institution being payable periodically on the 1st
January and Ist July, it is obvious that the current expenses, which
are continuous, cannot all be met as they accrue. An effort has there-
fore been made for the last two years so to curtail the expenditure as
to accumulate in the treasury a half year’s interest. This object will
be fully accomplished during the next year. For the future, there-
fore, we shall be enabled to pay cash for printing, paper, Wc., and
thus save a considerable per centage on the cost of these articles.

Comparatively few repairs have been required during the past year
on the building, though the changes which have been necessary to
accommodate the increasing operations of the Institution have involved
considerable expense. The corridors, which were entirely open to the
northwest wind, have been enclosed with glazed sashes; a large amount
of space has thus been rendered available, and a considerable portion
of the interior of the buildij'g, protected from the inclemency of the
weather.

The heating of the building is a heavy item of expense, and must
continue to be so until double windows can be furnished, particularly
on the north side, and a more economical as well as efficient method
of warming be adopted. The whole length of the building is four
hundred and fifty feet, one-third of which, at least, is occupied by a
series of windows, through which the heat of the air within so rapidly
escapes by contact with the cold glass that the cost of inner windows
would be saved in the course of a few years.

The smaller rooms are mostly heated by stoves, and the larger ones
by furnaces. Estimates have been procured for ;ubstituting hot water
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a ling

apparatus, but the expense of introducing this method is so great that
we would hesitate to advise its adoption at present.

It may be proper again to mention the fact that the grounds on
which the Smithsonian building stands, are under the charge of the
Commissioner of Public Buildings, and that, though several thousand
dollars of the income of the Smithsonian fund were originally expended
for their improvement, the Institution has surrendered all control over
them. It is believed, however, that Congress will in due time make
a more liberal appropriation for the improvement of the public Mall,
of which the Smithsonian reservation, as it 1s sometimes called, forms
a part, and for carrying out the original design of the lamented
Downing, which connects in one common plan a succession of enclosed
parks, extending from the Capitol to the Potomac.

The proposition to supply the public grounds with a complete series
of American trees has long been contemplated, but as no appropria-
tion has been made by Congress for this purpose, the Patent Office,
conjointly with this Institution, has taken the preliminary steps by
issuing a circular asking for seeds of every species of our forest trees
and shrubs that would be likely to thrive in this latitude. This
circular has been widely distributed, and it is hoped will meet with a
favorable response from all who are interested in making more gen-
erally known, and in introducing into more extensive cultivation, the
natural ornamental products of our own soil. The seeds are to be
sent by mail to the Commissioner of Patents, and placed in charge of
the officers having the care of the public grounds.

It may be mentioned in this connexion that the original plan of
Captain Meigs for the supply of the city with water contemplates a
series of fountains to ornament the pub .c reservations. To the same
valuable improvement we shall also owe the introduction, probably
during the present year, of a full supply of Potomac water into the
Smithsonian building.

Publications.—The publications of the Institution may at present
be divided into three classes: Ist, the ‘‘ Contributions to Knowledge,”’
in quarto form; 2d, the annual report to Congress, printed at the
expense of government; 3d, irregular series, such as the meteoro-
logical and physical tables, directions for observations, special reports,
&c., in octavo, to which has been given the name of ‘‘ Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections.”’

The tenth volume of the Contributions has been printed, and is
2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

now ready for distribution. It contains the third and concluding
part of the Nereis Boreali Americana, a Grammar and Dictionary of
the Yoruba Language, and the magnetic observations made under
the direction of Dr. Kane during his last Arctic expedition.

The issuing of this volume has been delayed on account of the in-
terruption in the printing of the Yoruba Grammar, caused by the
absence of the author, the Rev. Mr. Bowen. It was, however, essen-
tially completed within the year 1858, and will bear that date.

The articles which the volume contains have been described in
previous reports, with the exception of the magnetic observations
made by Dr. Kane.

1. It will probably be recollected that the plan of exploration proposed
by Dr. Kane for his last voyage was recommended to the favorable
attention of the Secretary of the Navy by the Smithsonian and other
institutions, and that the expedition was furnished with magnetic
and meteorological instruments jointly by the Coast Survey and this
Institution. The observations above mentioned are a part of those
which were made with these instruments. They were reduced and
prepared for publication at the expense of the Institution, under the
direction of Professor Bache, by Charles A. Schott, esq., and form
additions to our knowledge of the direction and intensity of the mag-
netic force in the inhospitable regions of the north, of sufficient value
to fully justify the interest which was taken in promoting the organi-
zation and the fitting out of the expedition.

The following extracts from the remarks of Professor Bache to the
American Association will serve to exhibit the light in which these
observations were regarded by him, nor can they be otherwise than
acceptable as the expression of an opinion in which all will concur
who were acquainted with our lamented fellow countryman, or who
are capable of appreciating his labors:

‘The scientific reader of the narrative of the second Arctic expe-
dition would be struck by the fact that while in the preface Dr. Kane
disclaimed all pretensions of @ scientific character for his work, it
contained, nevertheless, some of the most important contributions to
our knowledge of the natural history and physical phenomena of the
interesting regions visited by the intrepid explorers. Dr. Kane appre-
ciated highly all the relations, direct and indirect, which science has
to an exploring expedition. He was ever careful to surround himself
with those who could, in their special departments, make valuable

observations, while his own rare administrative capacity always gave
them opportunity for the exercise of their abilities. Himself an
admirable observer and well trained in the use of instruments, he
was always at hand to direct or to assist, as the occasion might require.
The labors in physical observation of Dr. Kane and his associates
had few parallels when the difficulties to be surmounted and the
results produced are considered.”’

The magnetic observations were properly placed in the hands of Mr.
Schott for discussion, as he had been selected for similar service by
Dr. Kane himself, and felt a strong interest in the work. The prin-
cipal. magnetical results were obtained on the coast of Greenland
during the years 1853-’54-’55, andin regard to the high magnetic and
geographical latitudes in which the observations were made, as well as
the completeness of the observations for diurnal changes of the hori-
zontal needle at a station before unknown to geography, ‘‘ they
deserve,’’ says Professor Bache, ‘‘ the attention of those engaged in
the study of the law of the changes of the magnetic elements in the
Arctic regions.’’ Ata late meeting of the British Association reso-
lutions were passed making application to the English government to
send a vessel to the vicinity of Mackevzie river to institute obser-
vations with special reference to the determination of the laws now
known to govern the magnetic storms. The resolutions also insist on
the importance of observations in the northern regions. Captain
Younghusband, of the royal navy, remarks, in his discussion of those of
Sir John Richardson, that ‘‘so few observations of the diurnal variation —
of the declination in high latitudes are up to this time at command,
that not even an approach can be made towards indicating a general
law of the phenomena in such localities.”’

The Winter Quarters at Van Rensselaer Harbor, where most of the
observations of Dr. Kane were made, is in latitude 78° 37’, to the
northward and eastward of Cape Alexander, beyond Smith’s sound.

The following is an outline of the discussion and of the results
obtained by Mr. Schott from Dr. Kane’s magnetic observations at
Van Rensselaer Harbor. The diurnal ranges of the declination were
deduced from observations on seventeen days in January, February, and
March, 1854. The mean diurnal range or motion of the needle was
found equal to 2° 29’, and the greatest range observed amounted to 4°
52’, The results were compared with similar ones at Lake Athabasca,
Fort Simpson, and Port Bowen. A classification was made of the
observed ranges according to their frequency and magnitude. The
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

values of the diurnal inequality of the declination were deduced for
every hour (mean local time) and also compared with similar values
for the same period observed at Greenwich. This inequality at these
two stations presents, in general, the same characteristic features,
namely: the principal deflection of the needle to the west shortly after
noon, and the opposite eastern deflection about midnight. The ex-
treme westerly position at Van Rensselaer Harbor is attained at noon;
the easterly extreme is reached at 2 a. m. A small disturbance is
noted at the hours of 4 and 5 p.m. While the diurnal variation
agrees with that observed at Lake Athabasca, Fort Simpson, Sitka,
Toronto, &c., it shows no trace of that marked deviation exhibited at
Reikiavik, in Iceland, and Fort Confidence. The results were further
compared with similar ones at Whalefish islands and Port Bowen.
The range of the mean diurnal inequality was 1° 7.

The mean disturbance of the declination for each hour was found
greater than at Lake Athabasca and Fort Simpson. The disturbing
force is least from 10 a. m. to 7 p. m., and greatest and equally
regular from 8 p.m. to 8 or 9a.m. At noon, as at Lake Atha-
basca, Toronto, and Sitka, an increase in the mean disturbance is
noticed. The minimum disturbance takes place at 5 p. m. The
mean monthly disturbance was greatest in February. The recog-
nition and separation of the disturbed observations was effected by
application of a method proposed by Professor Peirce, according to
which, one in every eighteen of the whole number was found disturbed,
that is, differing more than 1° 38’ from the mean, while at Toronto
the disturbance was one in every seventeen. The aurora borealis was
carefully noted, and in no case did the needle show any special
deviation during its occurrence—a remarkable circumstance, in con-
sideration of the fact of the great disturbances noted during the
appearance of this phenomenon farther south.

The term-day observations, made once in each month, from January
to July, 1854, were exhibited graphically, and compared with corre-
sponding observations at Washington and Greenwich. The observa-
tions are marked by the absence of any considerable disturbance,
and by the small diurnal range at the time of the equinox. The
absolute declination was determined on three days in June, 1854,
and found to be 108° 12’ west. The magnetic inclination was obtained
at ten stations, which gave for Van Rensselaer’s Harbor a dip of
84° 45/.8 from observations between January, 1854, and May, 1855,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. PAL

The magnetic intensity was derived from observations of deflections
and vibrations made between January, 1854, and May, 1855, the
magnetic moment of the magnet having been determined at Wash-
ington. From twenty-three separate values the horizontal intensity was
found equal to 1.139, corresponding to the epoch of June, 1854. The
total force was 12.48. In thesummer of 1855 the horizontal intensity
at Hakluyt island was found to be 1.344, and at Cape York 1.573.

The remaining series of the Arctic observations under the direction
of Dr. Kane are still in process of reduction; though a portion of the
tabular matter has been sent to the printer to avoid delay in the pub-
lication, and will be included in the eleventh volume of Smithsonian
Contributions. They relate to temperature, winds, moon culminations,
twilight, halos, moisture, atmospheric pressure, and tides. The mere
enumeration of the objects which engaged the active mind of the
distinguished explorer, is sufficient, when we consider his feeble
physical powers, to account for the untimely loss which science and
humanity have been called on to deplore.

2. Another paper shortly to be put to press consists of an account of
the results of a series of physical observations by Dr. Luis Berlandier,
the notice of which may perhaps be best introduced by a statement
of the following facts given in my Report to the Regents for 1854.
Dr. Luis Berlandier, a member of the Academy of Geneva, visited
Mexico in 1826 for the purpose of making a scientific examination
of the country. Soon after his arrival he was appointed one of a
commission, organized by the then new republic, with the object
of defining the boundaries, extent, natural resources, &c., of the
northern or frontier States. The position gave him unusual facilities
for observation relative to the character of the country, and for
making collections to illustrate its natural history. He, however,
never returned to his native country, but married and settled in
Mexico, and there continued his researches until the period of his
death in 1851. In the year 1853 Lieutenant Couch, U.S. A., made a
scientific exploration in Mexico under the auspices of the Institution,
and was so fortunate as to procure the manuscripts and collections of
Dr. Berlandier. He presented to this Institution all of those which
related to meteorology and natural history, and offered to sell to
the government at a low price the remainder, containing historical
and geographical information, chiefly pertaining to the States of the
old republic which lay between the Sabine and the Sierra Madre. It
- is to be regretted that this proposition was not accepted, since in
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

order to reimburse himself for the original cost of the manuscripts
he was induced to dispose of them to a private individual.

The portions of the manuscripts relating to meteorology were
placed in the hands of Professor Coffin for reduction. They consist,
either in summary or in detail, of the results of a series of nearly three
hundred and fifty thousand observations commenced at Havre, France,
October 14, 1826, and continued during the voyage of Dr. Berlandier
to Tampico, and afterwards at intervals in various parts of Mexico,
chiefly at Matamoras, till April 26, 1851; also, of a series taken at
the city of Mexico, in 1827, by General Teran, and at Goliad, Texas,
in 1832 and 1833, by Dr. Raphael Chowell. The whole had been
collected and arranged with care by Dr. Berlandier, preparatory
to a thorough reduction, which was intended to show not only the
mean results, but all the more important relations existing between
different atmospheric phenomena, when death closed his labors, and
put an end +o his interesting and useful investigations.

3. The family of the lamented Dr. Hare has presented to the Insti-
tution a paper describing an instrument denominated by its author a
cycloidegraph. It is intended to illustrate the motions of particles of
air when subjected to a gyratory or whirling motion, combined with
one of translation. This instrument, of which a drawing will be
given, evinces the ingenuity and power of mechanical combinations, of
which Dr. Hare gave so many manifestations during the long course
of his industrious and successful scientific career.

The paper is accompanied by engraved illustrations of the curves
produced by the machine, and contains a series of propositions in-
tended to demonstrate the centripetal theory of storms. As the last
contribution to physical science of one of the patrons of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and its first honorary member, it is proper that it
should find a place in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.

4, The next communication to be mentioned, is an account of obser-
vations made on the great solar eclipse of September 7, 1858, in which
the total shadow of the moon passed obliquely over South America, a
few degrees south of the equator. Accurate observations of the
phenomena presented during the total obscuration of the sun afford
such important means of enlarging our knowledge of the physical
character of that luminary, and the event is of such rare occurrence,
that the opportunity to study the phenomena should never. be
neglected. The Smithsonian Institution, therefore, readily agreed to
a proposition made by Lieutenant Gilliss, to undertake the observation
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 2a

of the eclipse, if an appropriation could be made sufficient to pay at
least a portion of his expenses and his free passage procured. In
accordance with this proposition letters were addressed to the British
Pacific Steam Navigation Company, to the United States Mail Steam-
ship Company, to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and to the
Panama Railroad Company, setting forth the objects of the expe-
dition, and asking for free transportation for Lieutenant Gilliss and
his instruments, and for such other facilities as it might be in their
power to bestow. This request was generously complied with ; not
only were free passages granted to himself and his companion, but
every other facility was proffered which it was in the power of the
officers of the companies to afford.

The British Pacific Steam Navigation Company not only furnished
with great cordiality free transport, but so instructed their agents on
the coast, that when an accident on the Panama railroad separated
Lieutenant Gilliss from his instruments, and caused a delay in their
arrival, the steamer bound to Payta waited in port several hours for
them. When returning home, the commander of another steamer of
the same line was instructed to make all possible speed in reaching
Panama, so as to save Lieutenant Gilliss the detention of two weeks
which passengers coming to the United States from the South Pacific
frequently experience. For the acts of enlightened liberality on the
the part of the above-mentioned companies in facilitating the advance
of science, special acknowledgment by resolution immediately from the
Board of Regents is due.

The necessary meteorological instruments were furnished by the
Institution ; the astronomical by the National Observatory, the Coast
Survey, and Mr. Henry Fitz, of New York.

Lieutenant Gilliss, though highly favored with the necessary means
of accomplishing the desired result, encountered many difficulties in
reaching the proper spot at which to make the observations. Accom-
panied by Mr. C. H. Raymond, of New York, he arrived at Payta,
Peru, on the 21st of August, 1858. The French admiral command-
ing in the Pacific placed the war steamer Mégére at his disposition,
should it be desirable to proceed to any other point on the coast’
Information, however, obtained from residents, and his own experience
during the ensuing eight days, convinced him that there was little
probability of a clear sky in the morning near the sea. But, in
order to obtain observations from a second party, should clear weather
occur there, he arranged with the commandant of the Mégére to pro-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ceed with the vessel to a point south of Payta, where the eclipse would —
be total, and furnished him with a telescope and a special chronometer
for the use of the officers selected to make the observations on shore.
The accounts of these gentlemen are embraced in the report of Lieu-
tenant Gilliss to the Institution.

Leaving Payta, on the morning of August 29, with such instruments
as it was possible to transport on mules across the desert in the northern
part of Peru, Lieutenant Gilliss proceeded to Olmos, a small town
within the outer range of the Andes, and in approximate latitude 6°
south, longitude 80° 10’ west. Illness prevented his reaching the
summit of the Andes, as he intended, and on the 5th of September he
encamped on an eminence one mile southeast from Olmos, and almost
on the central line traversed by the moon’s shadow. From August
21 until the day of the eclipse, there had been but two clear mornings.
On all the other days the sky was obscured until after 9 a. m.,
before which time the eclipse terminated. It was also cloudy at sun-
rise of the 7th, and until after the eclipse had commenced ; but as it
progressed the thin masses of vapor rapidly rolled from a portion
of the sky, and for some time before and after total obscuration only
a delicate film of mist intervened between the observer and the moon.
The observations, though unpromising at the beginning, were highly
successful.

The different astronomical phases of the eclipse were determined
with accuracy, and thus afford data for the improvement of the solar
and lunar tables. Interesting facts were also obtained in regard
to a phenomenon which has attracted much attention during later
eclipses, and is known under the name of the pink-colored protu-
berances or flame-like appearances projecting from the sun beyond
the limb of the moon. Simultaneously with the total obscuration of
the sun, Lieutenant Gilliss observed four marked protuberances of this
character beyond the lunar disk, one of them being more than 30° of
the sun’s circumference in extent. Their elevation did not exceed 1’
or 1’ 10” of the celestial arc, the largest one being scarcely half that
altitude. They resembled clouds, the thinner portions of which trans-
mitted the sunlight, but were wholly destitute of the rose color hith-
erto observed in total solar eclipses, and seen on this occasion by
the French officers at Sechura bay. Those to the west and north
continued visible for one or two seconds after the sun’s limb was
uncovered. These prominences were plainly visible to the unassisted
eye, and their proximate position and the absence of expected red color
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

were also noted by Mr. Raymond, who had been charged with the
meteorological observations. The total eclipse lasted 603 seconds.
A corona light appeared at the same time as the solar clouds, extend-
ing from the sun farthest in radial lines drawn from the centre, and
passing through the clouds, but was nowhere traceable more than 15!
or 16’ from the solar disk. There was no appearance of fasces or
bundles of rays, but only a uniformly diminishing and slightly orange
tinted light, whose brightness and extent were apparently influenced
by the film of mist. It vanished with the first appearance of the sun.

As already stated, Lieutenant Gilliss was accompanied by Mr. Car-
rington H. Raymond, of New York, who rendered him essential
assistance during the whole expedition, as well as at the time of the
eclipse.

The communication of Lieutenant Gilliss will be accompanied by a
drawing of the appearance of the eclipse at the time of greatest obscu-
ration, and will form a part of the eleventh volume of the Smith-
sonian Contributions.

5. The investigations of Mr. Meech relative to the heat and light of
the sun have been continued during the past year and are still in
progress. The memoir containing the result of these investigations
obtained previous to September, 1855, was published as a part of the
ninth volume of the Smithsonian Contributions, and has received the
approbation of the scientific world. It is noticed with credit to the
Institution in the proceedings of the Astronomical Society of London,
and in a letter on the subject from Sir John Herschel.

The memoir already published contains a discussion of solar heat
in all its astronomic phases at the exterior of the earth’s atmosphere.
The labors of Mr. Meech have since been directed to the partial
absorption or extinction which the rays experience in passing through
the atmosphere to the earth’s surface. The phenomenon is one of
special interest, and various instruments have been devised for its
measurement; among which the pyrheliometer of Pouillet, and the
actinometer of Herschel, may be mentioned. The observations with
these instruments, says Mr. Meech, are certainly valuable and in-
structive, but, with one very doubtful exception, they fail to exhibit
any distinct law. The law of absorption not being obvious directly
from observation, the simple hypothesis has generally been adopted
that equal thicknesses or strata of the medium absorb equal pro-
portions of the light or heat incident upon each stratum. Lambert,
Laplace, Pouillet, and others, have expressed this assumption in an
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

analytic form, which applies very correctly at higher altitudes and
near the zenith. For low altitudes, Laplace combined the same assump-
tion with his theory of refraction, and derived an approximate expres-
sion for the relative amonnts.

But the inquiry arises how far the fundamental assumption is sus-
tained by experiments. During the trigonometric survey of India,
the astronomer, Jacob, observed the extinction of light reflected
through an extent of sixty miles of horizontal atmosphere. His results
were found to correspond very nearly with the law that ‘‘as the
first differences of distance increases in arithmetical progression, the
intensity of light diminishes in geometrical progression.’’ The ex-
periments of Delaroche and Melloni also indicate that the hypothesis
of equal thicknesses absorbing equal portions of the incident heat, is
only an approximation, which, in extended media, will differ widely
from the truth ; indeed, their experiments show an increasing facility
of transmission through equal strata in the direction in which the
rays proceed. ¢

The necessity of a change, therefore, in the theory of atmospheric ab-
sorption to render itconformable to such experiments being obvious, the
greater part of Mr. Meech’s time available during the past year has
been devoted to this object. The remaining discussions relative to
the theory of climatic heat, of which this forms a part, are yet in
progress. It may here be stated, however, that on computing by this
method the observations given in the translation of Kaemtz’s Meteor-
ology, p. 150, Mr. Meech shows that out of 100 rays descending
vertically from the zenith, 22 rays are lost or absorbed in the atmo-
sphere, and 78 are transmitted to the earth’s surface. The same pro-
cess applied to the mean of observations made with Herschel’s actino-
meter on the Faulhorn and at Brientz, in Switzerland, leads to
precisely the same result when reduced to the sea level.

6. A proposition was made to the Institution in 1856 by Dr. James
Deane, of Greenfield, Massachusetts, to publish a memoir containing
a series of illustrations of his researches relative to the celebrated fossil
foot-prints in the sandstone of the Connecticut valley. It is now well
established that these foot-prints consist of impressions made by gigantic
birds and other animals, and were first brought to the attention of the
scientific world by the ardent and persevering efforts of Dr. Deane
and the critical investigations of Professor Hitchcock. The number
of plates required to illustrate the memoir, as originally proposed,
would have involved too great an expense to be met in one or even
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 2

two years by the portion of the income of the Institution which
could be appropriated to any single publication. It was therefore con-
cluded that Dr. Deane should continue his investigations, and endeavor,
by means of photography, to produce representations of all the most
important specimens, and that from these a selection should be
made sufficient to illustrate the characteristics of the different
species of animals by which the impressions had been left. Dr. Deane
enthusiastically devoted all the time to this object that he could spare
from a laborious practice, on which the support of his family depended,
until his career was suddenly terminated by death. ‘To assist in the
experiments of photography and in lithographing the illustrations a
small appropriation was made, with which about fifty drawings were
finished on stone by Dr. Deane himself. The work, however, is in
such an unfinished condition that it cannot be published unless some
person well acquainted with the subject will undertake the task of its
completion.

7. The Annual Report to Congress for the year 1857, together with
the appendix, forms a volume of 438 pages. Of this Report the Senate
ordered 10,000 and the House of Representatives 7,000 extra copies,
of which 5,000 of the first and 2,000 of the latter were given to the
Institution for distribution. The volume was restricted in size to 440
pages, and the wood-cuts were furnished, as usual, at the expense of
the Smithsonian fund. The statement may be again repeated that the
Institution is not responsible for the quality of the paper, nor for all
the errors which may be found in the text, since the whole work is set
up by a large number of different compositors, and is driven through
the press without sufficient time being allowed for revision and proper
correction. The distribution, however, of the copies of the Reports
has done much to make the Institution favorably known throughout
the country. The applications for them are constantly increasing,
and even the number liberally furnished by Congress at its last session
has been found scarcely sufficient to supply the demand. They are pre-
sented to the meteorological observers, and to all libraries and educa-
tional establishments. Besides furnishing a kind of knowledge not
readily accessible through any other channel, these Reports serve to
gratify a laudable public desire for information as to the management
and operations of the Institution.

The important truth has now become known in every part of the
world, that the property of Smithson was not given for the support of
a local establishment, but in trust to the United States for the promo-
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tion of knowledge, for the discovery of new truths, and for the diffu-
sion of these among men ; that the honor of the government is pledged
for the faithful administration of the trust in accordance with the ex-
pressed will of the donor, and that consequently every intelligent
citizen is interested in all which relates to the administration of the
bequest.

8. The collection of the meteorological and physical tables prepared
for the Institution by Professor Guyot, has been stereotyped and the
first issue has been distributed to the meteorological observers and to
foreign institutions. It has been received by the scientific world with
warm acknowledgments and special commendation. The Institution
has not lost sight of the proposition mentioned in the Report for 1856,
to prepare other series of tables for facilitating scientific calculations,
and to present in a convenient form the ‘Constants of Nature and
Art.’’ In order, however, fully to realize all the good which will
result from this work, it may be necessary to solicit the aid of foreign
institutions; and we think it probable that the co-operation of the Brit-
ish Association, as well as that of some of the academies on the conti-
nent of Europe, may be secured.

9. Among the miscellaneous publications of the past year should be
mentioned a pamphlet, accompanied by a map of the solar eclipse of
March 15, 1858, with an account of an instrument by which the latter
was projected. This instrument was invented in 1842 by Rev. Thomas
Hill, has since been improved, and now affords a ready means of de-
lineating the general phases of an eclipse, as exhibited over a large
portion of the earth, with sufficient accuracy for a first approximation.
It consequently saves much labor, and obviates, to a considerable
extent, the liability to larger errors in the numerical calculations.
The eclipse here mentioned was visible throughout Europe, Greenland,
and the North of Africa; also partly visible in the northern part of
South America and the eastern part of North America. The map exhib-
its the time of beginning and ending and the different phases of the
eclipse over the greater portion of North America in which there was
any probability of observations being made. Unfortunately, however,
the face of the sky in the United States on the day of the eclipse
was overcast, and few if any observations of value were obtained. The
projection of the map, however, illustrates the use of the ingenious
mechanical contrivance of Mr. Hill, and will serve to make it gene-
rally known to practical astronomers.

10. A new and revised edition of ‘‘ Directions for Meteorological Ob-
servations’ hag been stereotyped and distributed. To the directions
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

given in the first edition there have been added instructions for noting
periodical phenomena, earthquakes, auroras, &c., and special remarks
suggested by the experience of previous years. This publication forms
an octavo pamphlet of seventy pages, and is now, perhaps, the most
convenient and complete work for the purpose to be found in the
English language.

The catalogue of the Dipterous Insects of North America, prepared
by Baron Ostensacken, described in the last Report, has been published.
It forms an octavo pamphlet of ninety-two pages, and constitutes a
portion of a series of works which will be alluded to in a subsequent
part of this Report.

11. It was mentioned in the last Report that the Institution had
subscribed for a few copies of a treatise on the Fossils of South Carolina,
which was commenced by Professors Tuomey and IF. 8. Holmes, and,
after the death of the former, continued by the latter. Copies of five
parts of the continuation have been received, and will be distributed
in exchange for other works of foreign authors of thesameclass. This
work has been patronized by the State, and is alike creditable to the
industry, talents, and knowledge of the author, the skill of the artist,
and the intelligent liberality of the government of South Carolina,

Another publication to which a subscription has been made is Peirce’s
Analytic Mechanics. This is not an elementary compilation, but
consists principally of original solutions of many of the most important
problems of theoretical astronomy and pure physics. The author at
first offered to present this work as a series of memoirs to the Insti-
tution, but by means of the subscriptions which have been obtained
for it, the publication has since been undertaken by private enter-
prise. The copies subscribed for by the Institution will be distributed
to some of the first class learned societies in Europe, and will doubt-
less be regarded as an important contribution of new truths, as well as
of methods of establishing some of those which have been previously
discovered, alike indicative of the genius of the author and of the en-
lightened and liberal appreciation of the country.

A subscription has also been made for a number of copies, for foreign
distribution, of the Mathematical Monthly, edited by J. D. Runkle, of
Cambridge, a journal intended to promote the study of mathematics
in this country. The plan and execution of this work are such as to
commend it to all who are interested in the advance of the important
branch of knowledge to which it pertains; and it is gratifying to learn
that the patronage which it has received, as well as the number and
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

character of the articles furnished, are such as to insure its entire
success.

12. In accordance with the plan mentioned in the last Report of direct-
ing attention to departments of knowledge needing special stimulus, the
Institution has made arrangements for the preparation of a series of
works on the different orders of insects found in North America, with
a view of identifying the species and of systematizing the study of their
relations and habits. This is a subject not only of much scientific
interest, but also of great practical importance in regard to its con-
nexion with agriculture. When it is considered how much loss is
annually caused to this country by the ravages of the Hessian fly, the
army and cotton worms, the curculio, the grasshopper, and numerous
other species of insects, it must be evident that anything that may
tend in however slight a degree to throw light upon the means of pre-
venting such ravages is of great commercial importance. But
before we can make use of the experience of other countries on this
subject, it will be necessary to identify the insects, since, in regard to
them as well as other objects of natural history, the same name is
often popularly applied to widely different species. _

The greatest deficiency in American natural history is to be found
in the department of entomology, there being no original treatise in
reference to this country applicable to the wants of the present day.
The Institution has therefore made arrangements with eminent ento-
mologists for the preparation of the following series of reports on the
different orders, inthe form of systematic lists, of all the North American
species hitherto described, and an account of the different families and
genera, and, whenever practicable, of the species of each order :

Coleoptera, (Beetles, &c.,) by Dr. John L. Le Conte, Philadelphia.

Neuroptera, (Dragon flies, &c.,) by Dr. Hagen, Kinigsberg.

Hymenoptera, (Wasps, bees, &c.,) by H. De Saussure, Geneva.

Diptera, (Flies, mosquitoes, &c.,) by Baron Ostensacken, of the
Russian legation at Washington.

Lepidoptera, (Butterflies, moths, &c.,) by Dr. J. G. Morris, Balti-
more, and by Dr. B. Clemens, Haston, Pa.

Hemiptera, (Chinches, roaches, &c.,) by P. R. Uhler, Baltimore.

Catalogues of the Coleoptera and Diptera have been already pub-
lished, while the descriptions of these orders by Dr. Le Conte and
Baron Ostensacken, and of the Neuroptera, by Dr. Hagen, are in an ad-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. SL

vanced state of preparation. Moreover, it has been thought desi-
rable as introductions to these catalogues to give an account of the
best methods of capturing the insects and preserving them for the
cabinet as well as for breeding the larvee with a view of studying the
habits and peculiarities of the species, and with this object arrange-
ments have been made with gentlemen particularly acquainted with
different orders for articles relating to them.

A commencement has already been made in the preparation of mate-
rials for these works, a part of which will be given in an article to be
found in the appendix to this report.

The description of the method of capturing insects and preserving
them will be widely distributed, and it isto be hoped that the different
correspondents of the Institution interested in this branch of natural
history will assist in completing the collections.

Specimens of Neuroptera were last year referred to Dr. Hagen, consist-
ing chiefly of those collected by Captain Pope’s expedition, in New
Mexico as well as by Baron Ostensacken in the District of Columbia
and elsewhere, together with various series from other sources. Three-
fourths at least of all the specimens of the collection sent to Dr.
Hagen have never before been described. For example, among thirty-
four species of Odonata (dragon flies) twenty-seven were found to benew.
‘‘The materials for study which I have thus received from the Smith-
sonian Institution,’’ says Dr. Hagen, ‘‘are the richest 1 have ever ob-
tained at one time before.’’

Meteorology.—The arrangement between the Patent Office and this
Institution in relation to the collection of meteorological statistics still
continues, and is, we think, producing good results. The number of
observers now reporting is about three hundred, and it is only in re-
gard to the want of persistency on the part of some of these that there
is room for the expression of regret. Incomplete and irregular records,
however, are of importance in furnishing data for the general in-
vestigation of the subject—an investigation which is based, as was
stated in a former report, upon the preparation of a series of maps of the
United States for each day in the year, on which are represented with
different colors the portions of the country over which the sky is clear,
cloudy, snowing, raining, &c., and, by arrows, the direction of the
wind. These maps indicate the place of commencement, the succes-
sive stages of development, the changes and the final disappearance of
storms. Any person, therefore, who may furnish a daily record of the
face of the sky, of the beginning and ending of rain, snow, hail, and
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

storms, and the direction and intensity of the wind, (which can be
done without instruments,) will render valuable service in advancing
a knowledge of the laws of the atmospheric disturbances to which
we are constantly subjected, and which exercise so important an in-
fluence on our health, comfort, and occupation. To induce persons to
furnish this simple but valuable information a blank form has been
prepared for more general distribution than the one required by those
who are provided with instruments. If sufficient data of this kind
could be obtained to complete a series of maps, comprising one for
each day in a single year, over the whole United States, the laws of
the general phenomena of our storms could be determined. Tor this
purpose observations are particularly desirable from regions west of
the Mississippi river, and every traveller over the plains would render
important service by making a record of the weather at least three
times a day, viz: at 7a. m., 2and 9 p. m., and transmitting a copy
to the Commissioner of Patents. The principles which have been
already determined in regard to the development and progress of
storms fully demonstrate the importance of the information to be de-
rived from daily telegraphic despatches as regards probable changes
of weather in the eastern portions of the United States. The Institu-
tion and the public generally are indebted to the Morse telegraph line
for the gratuitous reports which its operators have daily furnished.
An object of much interest at the Smithsonian building is a daily
exhibition on a large map of the condition of the weather over a con-
siderable portion of the United States. The reports are received about
ten o’clock in the morning, and the changes on the maps are made by
temporarily attaching to the several stations pieces of card of differ-
ent colors to denote different conditions of the weather as to clearness,
cloudiness, rain or snow. This map is not only of interest to visitors
in exhibiting the kind of weather which their friends at a distance are
experiencing, but is also of importance in determining at a glance the
probable changes which may soon be expected. It is to be hoped that
reports may hereafter be received from all parts of the country to
which telegraphic lines extend. The value of the information thus
received would be much enhanced if a brief record of the direction of
the wind and the indications of the thermometer were in all cases added.
At the last meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science a committee was appointed, on motion of Major Lachlan, of
Cincinnati, to petition the several States of the Union and the govern-
ments of other portions of the continent to co-operate with the Smith-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

sonian Institution and the Patent Office in establishing systems of sta-
tions for observations furnished with standard instruments. Though
this committee, consisting of Major Lachlan, Dr. Hough, Professor
Coffin, and myself, have not had an opportunity of fully discussing
the several points to be recommended, yet it is thought they will
adopt the following suggestions, which have been considered and ap-
proved by a majority of the members :

1. That stations for observation be established not over sixty miles
apart.

2. That at each station the pressure, temperature, and humidity of
the air, the direction and velocity of the winds, (both upper and lower
currents,) and the kind and amount of cloudiness be observed three
times a day—at 7 o’clock a. m., 2 p. m., and 9 p. m.; also the date
of the commencement and termination of each rain or snow, with the
amount of water that falls, and any other atmospheric phenomena that
the observer may deem of interest to note and record.

3. That each station be furnished with a barometer having a zero
adjustment, a pair of thermometers carefully compared with each
other throughout their entire range, and a rain-gage.

4, That a superintendent be appointed in each State, who shall
select the stations and instruments, secure reliable observers, keep
himself informed as to the condition of the instruments and observa-
tions, and report annually to the legislature of the State, and also to
the Smithsonian Institution.

5. That the superintendent be furnished with standard instruments
with which the others may be compared when necessary.

6. That these standard instruments be themselves compared with
some common standard.

7. That each observer publish his observations monthly in some
neighboring newspaper, as an item of local interest, and have, per-
haps, five hundred extra slips of the same printed for exchange with
other observers ; these slips to be sent to the Smithsonian Institution
for distribution.

8. That monthly and annual abstracts of these observations be
published in a uniform style throughout the United States, and the
continent if possible; and that, for the sake of securing such uniformity
as well as reducing the cost, they be prepared and published by the
Smithsonian Institution, each State contributing a sum sufficient to
defray the expense of its own observations; and the whole being com-
bined in a single volume.

3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

9. That each State receive for distribution within its own limits a
number of copies of the above-mentioned volume of abstracts, equal to
perhaps twenty-five times the number of stations in the State: two for
the State library, six for each observer, one for each incorporated college
within the State, and the remainder to be distributed at the discretion
of the superintendent.

10. That to carry the foregoing provisions into effect, each State
appropriate per station $40 for the supply of instruments, and $36 a
year afterwards; the latter item to be distributed as follows, viz: $20
to each observer to pay for the printing and postage of the slips con-
taining his monthly observations, $5 per station to the superintendent
for his expenses, and $14 per station for preparing and publishing the
abstracts.

It gives me pleasure to state that a system of twenty-five stations for
minute and accurate observations, with standard instruments, has
been established along the northwestern lakes, under the direction
of Captain Meade, of the Topographical Engineers, U. 8. A. The
records are to be made four times a day, and to be reported to the
bureau in charge of Colonel Abert, at Washington, and will thus be
accessible for investigation by the Institution. In this connexion, I
am also pleased to be able to state that the meteorological system con-
templated for some years past in Upper Canada has been actually
commenced, and that twelve stations have been established at the
senior county grammar schools, from most of which reports have been
received during the past year. Copies of these observations will be of
much value in enabling the Institution to extend the area now included
in the field of its meteorological investigations. The report relative
to this system presented to the Canadian legislature will be found in
the appendix. It is also proper to mention that Doctor Shumard,
State geologist, has established a system of stations, furnished with
standard instruments, at three important points in Texas. In this
he has followed the example of Professor Swallow, who instituted a
similar system in connexion with his geological survey of Missouri.

The reductions of all the observations which have been made under
the direction of the Institution and the Patent Office are now com-
pleted, and will be printed as rapidly as the means necessary for the
purpose can be appropriated. A large number of maps have been
constructed for the investigation of storms, and considerable additions
have been made to the material previously collected relative to the
climate of this continent.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

One of the most important operations with which the Institution
has been connected during the past year is the construction of a map
to represent at one view the arable and forest land of the United States.
This work has been intrusted to Dr. J. G. Cooper, a young naturalist,
who has paid particular attention to botany, has been engaged in
government explorations in the western part of the United States, and
has critically examined all the authorities to be found on the subject.
The facts presented at once to the eye by this map are in striking
accordance with the deductions from the meteorological materials which
have been collected at this Institution, and serve to place in a clear
point of view, the connexion of climate with the natural productions
of different parts of the earth.

No appropriation has been made for the last two years for the pur-
chase and distribution of instruments other than rain-gages and ther-
mometers. The attempt to furnish barometers to important stations
at a distance has not been successful. In the majority of cases they
have been broken before they arrived at their place of destination, and
we find from experience that this instrument cannot be safcly trans-
ported, except by hand or by water.

Magnetic Observatory.—F rom the date of the last report the declina-
tion needle of the magnetic observatory, established at the expense of
the Coast Survey and the Smithsonian fund, was in continued opera-
tion until October, 1858, when the introduction of a large iron pipe
for the supply of the grounds with the Potomac water made a new
adjustment of the apparatus necessary, and interrupted the continuity
of the record. Up to that time the remaining instruments had not
been received from London, though they were ordered by Professor
Bache before the erection of the building, several years ago. The
delay, we have since learned, was occasioned by death in the family of
the inventor, who had kindly undertaken to superintend their construc-
tion, and especially to make the adjustments for the compensation for
changes of temperature. The instruments have at length been re-
ceived, and will be put in operation early in the spring of the present
year. They were completed and forwarded under the direction of
Mr, Charles Brooke, the author of this ingenious and truly valuable
mode of automatic registration.

The importance of putting this observatory in full operation will be
manifest by a reference to a communication in the appendix to this
report from General Sabine to the Secretary, in which it is stated that
it is in contemplation to establish similar observatories at Pekin, the
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Falkland Isles, Newfoundland, and Vancouver’s Island, and in which
the hope is expressed that the magnetic observatory on the Smithsonian
grounds may be in a condition to co-operate in the efforts that are thus
about to be made to determine the laws of the perturbations of the
intensity and direction of the magnetic force in a continuous belt en-
circling the globe.

Laboratory.—During the past year the laboratory has been under
the charge of Professor Shaeffer, late of the United States Patent Office,
and Dr. Craig, of this city. These gentlemen have reported to the
Institution on all articles of public interest which have been referred
to them for examination, and have made a series of investiga-
tions on a large number of specimens of guano, which were sub-
mitted to the Smithsonian Institution by the general government.
The policy adopted in regard to the specimens of various kinds referred
to the Institution for examination, is to furnish a report free of cost to
the parties making the reference, provided the information is of general
interest or immediately connected with the advance of science, but if
the examination is required principally to promote the interest of indi-
viduals or companies, a charge is made sufficient to cover the expense
of the investigation. By the adoption of this plan the laboratory is
kept in operation by means of a small appropriation for chemicals and
apparatus from the Smithsonian fund.

Exchange —The system of international exchanges continues to be
highly successful, and the amount of material transmitted abroad and
that received in return is constantly increasing. Few, if any, Ameri-
can Institutions publishing transactions or reports have any other
means of effecting exchanges with foreign societies, and although the
income of the Institution will not warrant a much greater extension of
this part of the operations, yet we trust that nothing will interfere to
lessen its present efficiency and usefulness.

It will be seen from the report of Professor Baird that during the
year there were 913 packages sent abroad by the Institution, weighing
22,674 pounds. The number of parcels received by the Institution from
other parties for foreign distribution was 4,425.

Library.—The fact has been repeatedly mentioned in preceding re-
ports that the principal object aimed at in the collection of the library
is to procure as perfect and extensive a series as possible of the trans-
actions and proceedings of all the learned societies which now exist
or have existed in different parts of the world. It is to works of this
character that the student of science is obliged to refer for the minute
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. St

history of the progress of any special branch to which he may be de-
voted, and to ascertain accurately what has been published on his
particular subject previous to commencing his own labors, or at least
before he gives the results to the world, in order that he may do justice
to those who have preceded him in the same path, and have due re-
gard to his own reputation in not publishing facts and principles as
new discoveries which have long since been recorded in the annals of
science.

Principally by means of the system of exchange, which has been
so successfully prosecuted by the Institution, the library is now richer
in this class of books than perhaps any other in the country, and
every year it is increasing in value, not only from the current publica-
tions of the various societies of the world, but by almost constant
additions of series and of volumes to complete sets which had before
been imperfect.

The value of this library to the country will be much enhanced,
first, by the publication of a list or catalogue of the different series
of transactions and proceedings of which it is now actually in pos-
session ; and secondly, by a general index or list of titles of the various
memoirs or papers contained in the whole collection. The first of
these objects will soon be accomplished by a complete catalogue of
the whole collection, which has been prepared under the direction
of Professor W. W. Turner, and is now in the press, and will be
distributed to all the correspondents of the Institution in the course
of afew months. This catalogue will not only serve to make known
to the men of science in this country what the library actually con-
tains in the line of transactions, but will also indicate to the foreign
contributors its deficiencies, and thus enable them, from their store
of duplicates, to complete imperfect sets, as well as to increase the
series.

The second desideratum is one which is felt as such by the whole
scientific and literary world, and it will be recollected that in the
report for 1855 I mentioned the fact that, in behalf of this Insti-
tution, I had addressed a letter to the British Association, setting
forth the importance of the publication of a list of the titles of the
different memoirs or papers contained in all the transactions of the
learned societies of the world, and offering to co-operate in the im-
portant enterprise by furnishing a list of the contents of the volumes
of transactions and proceedings of the different societies of this country.
I am now much gratified in being able to inform the Board of Regents
that this proposition was favorably considered by the Association, and
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

that the great work has actually been commenced at the expense and
under the direction of the Royal Society of London. It is estimated
that the whole number of titles will amount to 250,000, the cost of
printing which will probably exceed even the income of the endow-
ment of the Royal Society; but the hope is entertained that other
institutions of Great Britain, as well as those of other countries, will
contribute towards defraying the expense.

At the last session of Congress a bill* passed the House of Repre-
sentatives in reference to the present copyright law, which was in ac-
cordance with the views presented in the several reports of the Board
of Regents.

The requirement that three copies of every original work secured by
copyright should be forwarded to Washington, to be deposited respect-
ively in the Libraries of Congress, the Department of State, and this
Institution, has been found as oppressive to the author, in the case of
valuable and costly works, as it was burdensome to the libraries in-
tended to be benefited, in the case of trifling and ephemeral ones.
The change in the law, by which this requirement will be in future
limited to the archives of the Interior Department at the Patent Office,
while it affords relief on the one hand, will on the other furnish ample
security in case of contested title; and, being more easily and con-
stantly complied with, will insure to those who feel an interest in the
progress of American literature at least one entire and connected series
of these publications.

The additions to the library of the Smithsonian Institution by
exchange during 1858 have been large and important, the total being
considerably greater than in 1857. They consist of the following
items, viz: 553 octavo volumes, 156 quarto, 14 folio; also, 1,695 pam-
phlets and parts of volumes, and 122 charts and maps, making in all
2,540; being an excess of 780 volumes and parts of volumes over 1857.
Many of the receipts for the year consist of series of transactions of
societies more or less complete, tending to add greatly to the resources
of the library. Among these may be mentioned the Memoirs of the
Academie des Sciences of Dijon, 30 volumes; of the Haarlem Society
of Sciences, 41 volumes; of the Royal Netherlands Institute at Am-
sterdam, 14 volumes quarto; of the Academy of Sciences of Montpe-
lier, 9 volumes quarto; a full series of the publications of the Hydro-

* Since the date of this report, the bill referred to having passed the Senate also, has

become a Jaw, and henceforth it will be requisite for the author to deposit only a single
copy with the clerk of the district court from whom the certificate of copyright is obtained.

graphical Department of St. Petersburg, in many volumes; the charts
of the British Admiralty Board for the year; the Allgemeine Deutsche
Bibliothek, in 77 volumes, from the library at Cassel ; the Memoirs of
the Landwirthschaftliche Gesellschaft at Klagenfurt, in 14 quarto
volumes; and many others.

Alexander 8. Taylor, esq., of Monterey, California, sent to the
Smithsonian Institution, for examination and use, a manuscript which
he had borrowed from the library of the Right Rev. Bishop of Monterey;
and of which he gives the following account: ‘‘This manuscript con-
taining 94 pages, is a vocabulary of the Mutsun tribe of California
Indians, living in the country around the mission of San Juan Bau-
tista, in Monterey county, and now nearly extinct. It was written in
1815, by P. Felipe Arroyo, an old missionary of great natural talents |
and, as I am informed, very learned in the Indian languages of this
country. He died at the mission of Santa Inez about 1842.’’ This
manuscript, on examination, proved of so interesting a character in its
relation to American philology and ethnography, that to afford to
American scholars opportunities for its study and to lessen the chances
of loss of the work, it was thought advisable to have it copied. This
accordingly has been done, the labor being performed by a Cuban
gentleman, under the supervision of Alexander J. Cotheal, esq., of
New York, who has added an English translation of some portions.
The number of pages in the transcript corresponds to those of the
original. The first seventy-seven pages, after the title and preface,
(which, as well as some of the explanatory matter, are in Latin,) are
occupied with a collection of Mutsun words and phrases, ranged some-
what irregularly, under the letters of the alphabet, accompanied by a
Spanish translation. The Indian words and phrases are written in
black, and the Spanish in red ink. The remaining pages contain
hymns, prayers, and catechetical exercises composed by the priests,
and some specimens of the music used in the native songs and dances.
The original, of course, has been returned, and the copy’is placed in
the library of the Institution.

The extensive alterations in the wing of the building appropriated
to the library, mentioned in the last report, have been completed, and
the additions have been found not only of importance in the better
arrangement and accommodation of a larger number of books, but
also in increasing the general architectural effect of the apartment.
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Museum.—The portion of the Smithsonian income which can be
devoted to a museum, and the $4,000 per annum appropriated by
Congress, would not together be sufficient to establish and sustain a
general collection of specimens of the natural history of the world.
It will, therefore, be the policy of the Institution, unless other means
are provided, to confine the collections principally to illustrations of
the products of the North American continent. For this purpose
efforts have been made, principally through the varicus exploring
expeditions, to obtain a large number of specimens of all the species
of the different kingdoms of nature found in North America; and at
this time the collection under charge of the Institution is more exten-
sive in number and variety than any other which has ever before been
made relative to this portion of the globe. It is not in accordance
with the general organization of the Institution to form a museum
of single specimens, interesting only for their rareness, but to collect
a large number of specimens of each species, particularly of such as
have not been described, and to distribute these among the several
naturalists who may have the industry, ability, and the desire to study
them; the primary object of the Institution, namely, the increase of
the existing sum of knowledge in this case, as in all others, being
kept prominently in view.

The Institution has now become the curator of the collections of
natural history and ethnology of the government, and by law is
empowered, as it appears to me, to make the same disposition of the
materials contained in these collections as it does of those procured at
its own expense; the design will be to render the specimens in
the greatest degree serviceable to the advance of knowledge. The
museum now consists of the following collections, of which, according
to Professor Baird, about one-fifth were brought from the Patent
Office :

First, those of the naval expeditions; second, those of the United
States geological surveys; third, those of the boundary surveys; fourth,
those of surveys for railroad routes to the Pacific; fifth, of miscellane-
ous expeditions under the War and Navy Departments; sixth, those
of miscellaneous collections presented or deposited by societies and
individuals; and, lastly, of an extensive series of the results of explora-
tions prosecuted by the Institution itself. By far the greater portion
of the whole has been made under the stimulus and immediate direc-
tion of the Smithsonian Institution. A number of the special collec-
tions are still in the hands of those to whom they were intrusted for
scientific investigation and description. The arrangement of the cases
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

and the disposition of the articles intended for public exhibition has
been a subject requiring considerable thought and experiment. It was
not only desirable to obtain the largest amount of space for the accom-
modation of the articles, but, also, to arrange the whole so as to har-
monize with the architectural embellishment of the large hall and
thus to produce a proper esthetical effect.

For a particular account of the present condition of the museum,
and for a detailed history of the several series of collections of which
it is composed, I beg leave to refer to the report of Professor Baird,
herewith annexed.

It is proper to add that the Institution continues to be under great
obligations to the steamer line to California via Panama (consisting of
the United States Mail Steamship Company, the Panama Railroad and
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company,) for its most generous and
liberal aid in carrying packages between New York and the Pacific
coast free of all expense. The agents of the line, Mr. I. W. Ray-
mond in New York, and Mr. A. B. Forbes in San Francisco, have
also paid particular attention to the secure and certain transmission
of these pazcels. When it is known that the aggregate amount trans-
ported for the Institution during the year has been not far from one
hundred packages, embracing valuable Natural History material, and
that merely the ordinary expenses of the transit would have been pro-
hibitory of the reception of most of them, some idea may be gathered
of the part taken by these companies in the development of the
Natural History of the west coast of America. Nor must it be for-
gotten that the packages carried free of charge by them contain not
only specimens of Natural History from the Pacific, but also large num-
bers of valuable books, presented by or through the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, to libraries in California, Oregon and Washington, thus adding
greatly to the literary and scientific resources of the west. Hearty
acknowledgments are also due for service of similar character to the
Pacific Steam Navigation Company, and to the Express Company of
Messrs. Wells, Fargo & Co. Mr. Banning, the government freight
contractor between Fort Tejon and Los Angelos, has also transported
several boxes free of charge.

Gallery of Art.—A large number of portraits, formerly in the
Patent Office, of Indian chiefs and a few females of the different tribes
which have from time to time visited Washington, which were painted
at the expense of government, has been added to the Gallery of Art.
These, with the Stanley paintings, now form perhaps the most
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

valuable collection in existence of illustrations of the features, cos-
tumes, and habits of the aborigines of this country.

This gallery is an object of special interest to all visitors to the
national metropolis, and to none more so than to the deputations of
Indians frequently called to Washington to transact business with
the government. A suggestion has been made that there be procured
photographic likenesses of individuals of these deputations, with
which to increase the number of portraits. It would be a matter
regret were the collections ever to be separated, and it is hoped that
Congress will in due time purchase the portraits belonging to Mr.
Stanley, which will become more and more valuable in the progress
of the gradual extinction of the race of which they are such faithful
representations.

A number of busts of distinguished individuals, that formed a part
of the objects of art at the Patent Office, have also been transferred
to the Institution, and although these are not very choice illustrations
of sculpture, they serve as a beginning of a collection in this line
which may hereafter be worthy of the Institution.

Lectures.—Provision was made for the usual number of popular
lectures during the present season, and thus far they have been
attended by large audiences. This part of the operations of the Insti-
tution, though somewhat restricted in its effects to the city of Wash-
ington, has been of considerable importance in awakening a lively
interest in the welfare and operations of the Institution on the part of
a large number of intelligent and influential gentlemen, who have
been invited to lecture, from different and distant sections of the
United States. It has likewise been the means of presenting, through
the annual report, summaries of particular branches of science inter-
esting to the general reader and of value to the teacher of schools
and academies.

It will be recollected that the rooms in the second story of the
Smithsonian building are arranged for the accommodation of associa-
tions and conventions, of which the following have gladly availed
themselves during the past year of the facilities thus offered, namely:
The National Medical Association, the United States. Agricultura]
Society, American Pharmaceutists’ Association, the National Musical
Convention, the Art Association, and the American Colonization
Society. The Teachers’ Association for the District of Columbia also
continues its monthly meetings in one of the apartments.

The influence the Institution is having on the character and repu-
tation of the city of Washington is by no means small. The free
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

lectures, it is evident, from the interest which they still continue to
excite, must tend to promote the intelligence and morality of the citi-
zens, and the various scientific operations which are carried on in
connexion with the Institution diversify the objects of interest to the
public generally in what pertains to the national metropolis. The
following is a list of the lectures delivered at the Institution during
the winter of 1858-59:

Two lectures by Dr. Joun Raz, of Canada, on ‘‘Arctic Explorations
and the Probable Fate of Sir John Franklin.’’

One lecture by J. G. Saxz, esq., of Vermont, on ‘‘ Poetry and
Poets.”’

One lecture by Professor G. W. Greens, of New York, on ‘‘ The
Artistic Life of Thomas Crawford.’’

One lecture by Professor J. D. Dana, of Yale College, on ‘‘ Coral
Islands.”’

Two lectures by THomas CLEemson, esq., of Maryland, on ‘‘ Water ”’
and ‘‘ Nitrogen,”’

Two lectures by Professor P. A. CuapBourns, of Williams College,
on ‘‘ Natural History as related to Intellect, Taste, and Wealth.’’

Four lectures by Rev. H. J. Cominco, of Ohio, on ‘‘ Rome, its His-
torical Reminiscences; its Antiquities and Ruins; its Architectural
Monuments ; its Fine Arts.’’

Four lectures by Professor A. Caswett, of Brown University, on
‘¢The Magnitude and Figure of the Earth;’’ ‘‘ The Law of Gravita-
tion;’’? ‘*The Dimensions of the Solar System, or the Extent of our
Knowledge of Planetary Distances ;’’ and ‘‘ Sidereal Astronomy.”’

Five lectures by Professor J. P. Coox, of Harvard College, on
*¢ Atmospheric Air,’’ ‘‘Oxygen and Ozone,”’ ‘‘ Nitrogen,’”’ ‘‘Water,’’
‘¢ Carbon,’’ &c., &c.

The lectures of Professor Caswell will be inserted in the Appendix
to this report, and, it is believed, will be found interesting to the
teacher, as well as to the general reader, on account of the informa-
tion given relative to many points not usually dwelt upon in popular
works on the subject.

Respectfully submitted.

EXCHANGES,

The system of international exchanges organized by the Smith-
sonian Institution a few years ago continues to be highly successful,
and is rapidly developing to an enormous magnitude. Every year
witnesses a great increase in the amount of material transmitted
abroad and received in return, and it is not too much to say that any
abrupt termination of the undertaking on the part of the Institution
would be felt as a great public calamity. Few, if any, American
institutions of note, publishing transactions or reports, have any
other medium of exchanging them with foreign correspondents.

The details of operations in this department will be found in the
following tables, all of which exhibit a marked increase as compared
with 1857:

MUSEUM.

Additions to the museum.—Independently of the collections of the
Patent Office, transferred in 1858, and of which a more detailed notice
will be found on another page, the additions to the Smithsonian
museum during 1858 have been of great magnitude and importance,
in many respects exceeding those of any previous year, occupying, as
they did, more than 200 boxes, 20 kegs or barrels, and numerous
single packages of greater or less size. It is impossible within my
present limits to mention the contents of these in detail, and a general

statement at the end of this report is all that can be given for most of
them. <A portion, however, of the collections received belong to pub-
lic or private explorations of such interest as to require a further
notice.

%

EXPLORATIONS UNDER THE WAR DEPARTMENT.

1. Exploration of the valley of the Platte river, especially of the Loup
Fork, under Lieutenant Warren, U. S, A.—This exploration was con-
ducted in 1857, but the collections (filling 21 boxes) did not reach
Washington until 1858. The chief features of the collections con-
sisted of the fossil remains of animals and plants, gathered by Dr.
Hayden, geologist of the expedition; but a large and valuable series
of recent species was also procured, embracing several new to science.

2. Exploration of the Colorado river of California, under Ineutenant
J. CO. Ives, U. S. A.—Dr. J. 8. Newberry, geologist and botanist, Mr.
B. Mollhausen, artist and zoologist. Large collections were made in
all departments on the Colorado and across to Albuquerque.

3. Wagon road over the 35th parallel, wader Lieutenant Beale.—A
valuable geological collection was made by this party.

UNDER THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

4, Survey of the northwest boundary, under Archibald Campbell,
esqg.—Dr. CU. B. Kennerly, surgeon and naturalist, George Gibbs,
geologist. The collections of animals and plants, minerals and fossils,
made on Puget Sound and on the boundary line, were very full.

UNDER THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.

5. Survey of the Atrato ship canal route of the Isthmus of Darien, by
Lieutenant Craven, U. S. N., and Lieutenant Michler, U. S. A.—The
natural history operations were conducted by Mr. Schott, assisted by
Wm. S. and Charles Wood, under the supervision of Lieutenant
Michler. A valuable collection of animals and plants of the Isthmus
was brought back by this party.

UNDER THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.

6. Wagon road construction through the South Pass, under Wm, M.
Magraw.—This expedition was fitted out in the spring of 1857, with
Dr. J. G. Cooper as surgeon, and Mr. C. Drexler as hospital steward
and taxidermist. Dr. Cooper returned to Washington before the be-
ginning of the year, bringing large collections with him, Mr. Drex-
ler continued with Mr. Magraw’s party, and wintered on Wind river.
In March he crossed to Camp Scott, near Fort Bridger, where, re-
maining until June, he made a very extensive collection of birds,
illustrating very fully the ornithology of the Rocky mountain region,
and throwing much light on the geographical distribution of the
species. His success in this was mainly due to the protection and aid
afforded by General A. E. Johnston, in command of the forces, by
whose direction every facility was afforded him.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Bl

EXPLORATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

7. Exploration of the vicinity of Fort Tejon, California, by Mr.
John Xantus.—During the year 1858 a natural history exploration,
commenced in 1857, has been nearly completed by Mr. Xantus, while
connected with the military post at Fort Tejon, which, for extent and
thoroughness, has perhaps scarcely a parallel on our continent, con-
sidering the fact that it was made in about sixteen months by one
person, almost constantly occupied in official duties, and under
various discouragements. The collections of Mr. Xantus filled 24
large boxes, and included nearly 2,000 birds, 200 mammals, many
hundreds of birds’ nests and their eggs, with large numbers of reptiles,
fishes, insects, plants, skulls, skeletons, &c., all in the highest condi-
tion of preparation and preservation, and furnishing such accurate and
detailed information of the zoology and botany of Fort Tejon as we
possess of but few other points in the United States. Mr. Xantus
also made copious notes of the habits and characters of the species,
with numerous drawings.

8. Other points on the west coast.—Valuable collections from the
vicinity of Fort Umpqua, Oregon, have been received from Dr. Vol-
lum, from about San Diego, made by A. Cassidy, and from Monterey,
made by A. 8. Taylor. A collection of shells, &c., made by Captain
Stone in the Gulf of California, assisted by Mr. Sloat, has supplied
the first specimens ever received from that region, proving of great in-
terest. Mr. James Wayne has also furnished important collections
from the Columbia river.

9. Rocky mountains.—A collection of birds from Cantonment Burg-
wyn, sent in by Dr. W. W. Anderson, has added a new species of
birds to our fauna. Interesting collections of mammals and birds
from Fort Massachusetts were also made and presented by Captain
A. W. Bowman and Dr. McKee. Captain Marcy, in collecting speci-
mens of the Lagopus lewcurus, or white tailed ptarmigan, has added to
the fauna of the United States an interesting species of bird hitherto
only found in British America.

10. Other regions of North America.—Additional collections of the
animals of the Red River of the North have been received from Mr.
Donald Gunn, and of Texas, from Major G. H. Thomas. Mr. Thos.
K. Blackney, of Chicago, has contributed one of the few specimens of
whooping crane (Grus americana) found in collections. The collections
of Florida animals by Mr. Gustavus Wurdemann, made in continua-
tion of previous years, have been very valuable, adding, as they have
done, several new species of birds, reptiles, and invertebrates to our
fauna ; collections made in northern Wisconsin by Mr. Kennicott,
and in many other regions by contributors, mentioned in detail in the
alphabetical list at the end of this report, have also been of much
value,

11. Other parts of the world.—The exotic additions consist chiefly
of collections made in the Sandwich Islands by Mr. W. H. Pease,
and on the Isthmus of Panama by Captain J. M. Dow and the Rev.
Jos. Rowell.
52 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

12. Astronomical expedition to Peru.—The expedition to Peru, for
the purpose of observing the total eclipse of the sun of September,
1858, by Lieutenant Gilliss, United States navy, under the auspices
of the Smithsonian Institution, was accompanied by Mr. Carrington
Raymond, who made such collections of birds, reptiles, and fishes as
his time and opportunities would allow, and succeeded in obtaining
several species not previously in the collection.

Among the collections received during the year, not strictly made
by single expeditions or individuals, one presented by the Museum
d’ Histoire Naturelle of Paris deserves especial mention. This consists
of the types of many of the genera of serpents described by M. Duméril,
selected with special reference to American forms. A labelled collection
of land shells from Mr. Binney, and of rare eggs of North American
birds from Mr. John Krider, are also worthy of particular notice.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE MUSEUM.

The museum of the Smithsonian Institution, as at present constituted,
has been supplied with materials chiefly from the following sources :

First. The collections brought from the Patent Office, and made up
principally of the results of various explorations. They are as follows:

1. United States exploring expedition, under Captain Wilkes,
United States navy, 1838-1842. The collections made by this naval
expedition are supposed greatly to exceed those of any other of similar
character ever fitted out by a foreign government, no published
series of results comparing at allin magnitude with that issued under
the direction of the Joint Library Committee of Congress.*

The collections made embrace full series of the animals, plants,
minerals, and ethnological material of the regions visited, such as
the coasts of South America, the islands of the South Seas, &c.

2. Exploration of the Amazon and its tributaries, by Lieutenant

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Ho

W. E. Herndon, United States navy. These consist chiefly of verte-
brate animals and ethnological material.

3. Exploration of the valley of Great Salt Lake, by Captain Stans-
bury, United States army. Collections in character much like the
last.

4, Exploration of the Zuiii and Colorado rivers by Captain Sitgreaves,
United States army, and the survey of the Creek Boundary by Cap-
tains J. C. Woodruff and Sitgreaves.

5. Presents made to the United States by the King of Siam and
other foreign governments, deposited by the State Department.

6. Collections of Commodore M. C. Perry, United States navy,
made while negotiating a treaty with Japan, and the presents to the
United States government through him from the Japanese authoritiés.

T. Collections made by Dr. D. D. Owen in his United States geolo-
gical explorations in the west.

8. Collection of birds, &c., of British Guiana, from Rev. C. W.
Denison.

9. African curiosities, deposited by Rev. Dr. Gurley, in behalf of
the American Colonization Society.

10. Miscellaneous specimens belonging to the old Washington
Museum and deposited by Mr. John Varden.

11. Miscellaneous specimens, including paintings and statuary, from
different individuals, presented to or deposited i in the national gallery.

12. Collection of Indian paintings from the War and Indian Depart-
ments.

In addition to the collections above enumerated, the old hall con-
tained numerous specimens of different kinds belonging to or deposited
in the care of the National Institute. These the Smithsonian Institution
offered to take charge of, subject to such future order as the National
Institute might make in regard to them, but the offer was declined at
the time by its authorities and the specimens were left in their places,
but afterwards concentrated in several of the old cases of the Patent
Office hall. As no supervision is now exercised over them it is much
to be feared that great injury will necessarily result to the more per-
ishable portions.

Second. The collections in the Smithsonian Institution belonging to
the United States, and deposited in pursuance of the act of incorpora-
tion, other than those mentioned, are as follows:

13. Collections of the United States geological survey made in Iowa,
Illinois, and Minnesota, under Dr. D. “D. Owen.

14. Collections made on Lake Superior, by Messrs. Foster and
Whitney.

15. Collections made by Dr. Charles T. Jackson.

16. Collections made in Oregon and Washington Territories, by
Dr. J. Evans.

34. Collections made on Red river, by Captain Marcy.

35. Collections made by the South Pass wagon-road expedition,

For an account of the many private collections presented to the
Smithsonian Institution, reference must be made to the annual reports
of 1850—1857, and to another portion of the report for the present
year ; several, however, need special mention here on account of their
extent and value.

37. Collections made in northern Mexico, by Dr. Berlandier, pur-
chased and presented by Lieutenant Couch, in addition to a similar
collection made by himself.

38. Collections made in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, by Mr.
Gustavus Wurdemann. ,

39. Collections made on the Pacific coast, by Lieut. Trowbridge.

40. Collections made in Washington and Oregon Territories, by
Dr. George Suckley.

41. Collections made in Washington, California, and Nebraska, by
Dr. J. G. Cooper. ;

42. Collections made at Petaluma, California, by Mr. E Samuels.

43. Collections made on the Upper Missouri, by Thaddeus Culbert-
son; and others made by Dr. Hayden and Colonel A. J. Vaughan,

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 55

44, Collections made at Fort Tejon, Cal., by Mr. John Xantus.
45. Collections made in Wisconsin and Missouri, by Dr. P. R. Hoy.
46. Collections made in Wisconsin, by Rev. A. C. Barry.

47. Collectious made in Illinois and Minnesota, by Robert Ken-
nicott.

48. Collections made on the New England coast, by W. Stimpson.

49. General collections, deposited by S. F. Baird.

Together with very many others of greater or less note.

As the result of combining all the collections referred to in the
preceding notices, it may be said that the museum of the Smithsonian
Institution is entitled to no mean rank among similar establishments
elsewhere. It is certainly superior to any other in the United States
as a general collection, although in the specialities of exotic birds,
shells, fossils, and minerals it is surpassed by the Philadelphia Acad-
emy of Natural Sciences. The material is not even now wanting to
give it a first class position; only the means to properly determine,
arrange, and exhibit the collections already within the walls of the
Institution. With the enormous amount of duplicates of rare and
new species on hand, it will be possible, after the determinations have
been completed, to make additions by exchange to any conceivable
extent, almost without the expenditure of a single dollar in the way
of purchase. It must be remembered, too, that the collections in the
building have been made since 1850, (with the exception of most of
those brought from the Patent Office, which hardly form one-fifth part of
the whole museum,) and that the additions of the past year, independ-
ently of those just mentioned, have exceeded those of any previous
one.

There are many departments of natural history in which the collec-
tions of the Smithsonian Institution are believed to be superior to any
others extant, not merely to those of the United States. In all that
relates to North America, and perhaps to South America, also, it has
no equal anywhere. The collection of crustacea of the world is said
to be superior even to that of the Paris museum; and the same may,
possibly, be said of the recent corals. And yet no special attempts
have been made to this end. With the general interest of Americans
in such subjects, nothing would be easier than to excite the zeal of
officers of the naval and mercantile marine, government officials
abroad, and travellers, to such a pitch as to yield vast results every
year. Unfortunately the Smithsonian Institution has neither space
for such extensive exotic collections nor funds to devote to their pre-
paration and arrangement, all the appropriation of Congress being
required for the preservation of the specimens belonging to the United
States, and for the arrangement and exhibition of the contemplated
North American museum. This latter it is proposed to make as com-
plete as possible, so as to exhibit to visitors from all parts of the Union
a full series of natural objects belonging to each State.

In view of the importance of having some one public museum, illus-
trating as fully as possible the natural history of the world, and
taking rank with those of London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and others,
and considering that so excellent a foundation has already been laid
by the collections now in the Smithsonian Institution, and the ease
56 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

with which they may be augmented to any desirable extent, it is
earnestly to be hoped that the day is not far distant when the moderate
amount of funds necessary may be placed in the hands of this Insti-
tution.

It is, of course, impossible, in a few words, to give a detailed account
of the collections of the Smithsonian museum. This can only be sup-
plied by the descriptive catalogues of species and specimens already
published or now in course of preparation, after the plan of those of
the British museum. These will serve not only as guides to the cases
and collections, but as manuals by which the same species may be
readily identified elsewhere.

Work done in connexion with the collections.

The chief labor of the year in reference to the museum has con-
sisted in the transfer and partial arrangement of the collections
belonging to the United States, for many years constituting the
national gallery of the Patent Office, at first under the direction of
the Joint Committee of the Library of Congress, but for some years
under that of the Commissioner of Patents.

In the spring of 1857 the appropriation was made by Congress for
the construction of cases in the Smithsonian building for the reception
of the Patent Office collections, but owing to various drawbacks these
cases were not entirely finished until 1858. As soon as the various
technicalities incident to the transfer of this property were completed,
the work of removal was commenced and the whole collection moved
over in July last. Since that time much has been accomplished
towards giving to the different portions of the collections thus trans-
ferred their final arrangement, but much necessarily remains to be
done before this can be completed. An indispensable preliminary
consists in the entry of every specimen in its appropriate record book
and the ineffaceable attachment of a number, by means of which the
displacement or loss of a label (so likely to occur in the operations of
a large and growing museum) will be of comparatively little conse-
quence. The next step is to post all the specimens of each species on
its appropriate invoice sheet, as fast as accurate identification is
accomplished, and after these sheets are systematically assorted the
final arrangement of the specimens themselves can then be completed
and catalogues printed as guides to the collection.

As none of these details had been entered into with regard to the
Patent Office collections previous to their removal, (with the exception
of the labelling of a portion, and the entry of the crustacea in a
record book,) it becomes necessary to carry them out in the Smith-
sonian Institution. This, however, will require a long time to com-
plete, owing to the magnitude of the undertaking, and in the mean time
the specimens exhibited have been provisionally arranged for the
present, to be systematically placed and accurately and legibly labelled
hereafter. This has already been done by Mr. Varden for the ethno-
logical collections in the galleries of the west end of the hall, and by
Professor Dana for the corals.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 57

Considerable progress has been made in recording, determining,
and invoicing the other collections in the Institution, apart from those
brought from the Patent Office. The mammals, North American
birds and their eggs, the osteological collection, and the North Ameri-
can lizards, are at present so well posted up that the number of species
represented in the different series, with the aggregate number in each
series, the locality, donor, and other incidents of all the specimens of
each can be shown at a glance. Nearly all the North American
reptiles, other than saurians, are entered, and many of them deter-
mined ; and the same may be said of the western fishes. The follow-
ing table will show how much of this labor of recording has been
done in 1858.

museum ir 1858, in continuation of previous years.

The actual number of entries during the year amounts to 9,348,
being the difference between the aggregates of 1858 and 1857. As
most of these, however, have been made at least twice in the record
book and on the invoices, the total is nearer 18,000.

From the preceding table it will be seen that the entries already
exceed twenty-five thousand. In the case of alcoholic series, how-
ever, each bottle, though containing only one species from one locality,
may, and almost always does, include more than one specimen, the
average being at least five, which would give to the reptiles and fishes
an addition of 22,024 pieces, which would bring the number of regis-
tered specimens nearly to forty-eight thousand. This is, however;
far from expressing the full statistics of the collection, as there are
at least ten thousand jars of alcoholic specimens not yet entered, to
say nothing of the exotic birds and other objects.

During the year the determination of the North American birds in
the Smithsonian collection has been completed, and the results pre-
sented by myself in the ninth volume of the reports of the Pacific
railroad survey, occupying over a thousand quarto pages. The de-
scription of each species is followed by a list of all the specimens in
the collection, with an indication of the locality, collector, date, and
other details, and the report in question thus serves as a catalogue of
the ornithological collections of the Institution, as the previous volume
(eighth) did of its North American mammals, From this report it
58 REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

will be seen that the number of known North American species of
birds amounts to nearly 720, or about 225 more than given in 1844
by Mr. Audubon, and that nearly all are in the Smithsonian collection.

The North American eggs and nests have been determined and
arranged in the hall, where they form a highly attractive feature.
The North American saurians have also been monographed and
described in detail to the number of about 90 species. This work is
still in manuscript. Much progress has also been made in a similar
memoir on the serpents, with the assistance of Mr. Kennicott.
Detailed accounts of the fishes col’ected by the Mexican boundary and
Pacific railroad surveys, as also of the reptiles of the United States
exploring expedition, prepared by Dr. Girard, have been published
in their several reports.

Other collections belonging to the Smithsonian museum, in process —
of elaboration during the year, are as follows:

Birds.—The report of Mr. Cassin on the birds of the United States
exploring expedition has been printed during the year. The same
gentleman has now the birds collected by Captain Page in Paraguay,
and those of the North Pacific expedition, and has nearly completed
reports upon them.

Rteptiles.—The collection of North American turtles was placed some
years ago in the hands of Professor Agassiz, from whom a detailed
account of them may shortly be expected. Dr. Hallowell has furnished
during the year a report on the reptiles of the North Pacific expedition.

Fishes.—The fishes of the United States exploring expedition are in
the hands of Professor Agassiz for the preparation of a report, to be
published in the series of the expedition. The collection contains
many hundreds of new species. The fishes collected during the North
Pacific surveying and exploring expedition, under Captains Ringgold
and Rodgers, are in the hands of Mr. J. C. Brevoort.

Invertebrates. —Mr. Stimpson has been occupied during the year in
investigating the crustacea collected by him on the North Pacific
exploring expedition. Dr. A. A. Gould has also had in hand the
shells, and Mr. Barnard the echini of the same expedition. The
Neuroptera of the Smithsonian museum are in progress of examina-
tion by Dr. Hagen, of Kénigsberg, the Coleoptera by Dr. Le Conte,
the Hymenoptera by Mr. De Saussure, the Diptera by Baron Osten-
sacken, the Hemiptera by Mr. Uhler.

« Plants.—Large collections of plants collected by government expedi-
tions are still in the hands of Drs. Torrey and Gray, Mr. Sullivant,
Mr. Curtis, and others.

Geological Collections.—The collections made during Lieutenant
Warren’s explorations of the Upper Missouri region have been in
progress of investigation during the year by Messrs. Hayden and Meek,
and those of Lieutenant Ives’ expedition to the Colorado by Dr. New-
berry.

ee the scientific details connected with the administration
of the Smithsonian museum and collections, much has been done
in regard to the mechanical portion, in addition to the more or less®
complete arrangement of the Patent Office series. A beginning has
been made in the cleaning of the mounted animals belonging to the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

Patent Office collection, which had become greasy, dusty, or distorted,
by time and accident, and by their transfer to new stands. Many
skins of mammals and birds have been mounted and placed in the
cases to supply deficiencies, or to replace defective specimens, although
avast amount yet remains to be accomplished in this respect before
the collection will attain its proper condition. A large number of
skulls have been cleaned and put in place; nearly all the jars of
alcoholic specimens in the building, amounting to over 15,000, have
been washed and replaced with fresh spirits ; more than 1,000 gallons
of alcohol having been required for this purpose.

Distribution of Collections.

As the collections of the Smithsonian Institution become properly
indentified the duplicates are laid aside to be distributed to other
parties. It would, of course, be manifestly inexpedient to make such
distribution before determining the species accurately, as nearly all
are referred to in some official report or special monograph, and the
duplicates will be chiefly valuable as the types of such works. For
this reason not much has yet been done in the way of distribution to
public museums, although materials are constantly being furnished to
men of science for monographic investigations.

Even after the species may have been determined some time must
elapse before any extensive systematic distribution of series can be
effected, as the labor of labelling each specimen, making duplicate
catalogues, and of packing, will be very great. No time will be lost,
however, in doing whatever is possible in the case, not only for the
purpose of supplying a great want, but also of relieving the shelves
and cases of the Institution of a redundancy of material.

716 REPORTS OF COMMITTEES,

The estimated income for the year 1858, inclusive of the balance in
the hands of the treasurer, was $38,326 14, and the actual income
was the same, no change having taken place in the amount received
from the interest on the extra fund.

The estimated expenditure was $37,000. The actual expenditure
was $32,498. This difference, which is nearly $4,500, has been
saved principally on the building, transportation, and the payment of
assistants.

The last mentioned item has been somewhat diminished by the pay-
ment from the appropriation of Congress for the keeping of the
museum of the exploring expeditions which has been transferred from
the Patent Office to the Smithsonian Institution. The amount re-
ceived for the last six months on this account has been about $2,000.
This sum is not credited to the Institution, because the money is dis-
bursed by the Secretary of the Interior.

The amount of income above that of the expenditure was $5,828 12.
This sum has been saved with the view of carrying out the design
mentioned in the last report, namely, that of accumulating a suffi-
cient sum in the treasury to enable the payment of cash for all pur-
poses, and thus to save the extra charge which, in almost all cases, is
made when payment is deferred.

The amount in the treasury at the beginning of the present year for
carrying on the operations until the time of receiving the next income
was $16,169 42. Of this, however, $5,000 belong to the extra fund,
which has not yet been invested. According to the statement of the
secretary, the Institution, at the beginning of 1859, had no outstand-
ing debts, and hence it appears that the funds are in a good condition.

The committee respectfully submit the following estimate of the re-
ceipts and expenditures for the year 1859:

BREMEN LEGATION,
Washington, January 25, 1859.

Str: Agreeably to your verbal request, I have proposed to the
president and directors of the North German Lloyd of Bremen, to
manifest their interest in the cause of science, by facilitating literary
intercourse between the United States and Germany, by means of
their steamers plying between Bremen and New York.

It affords me great pleasure now to inform you that, according to
a letter of the president of the Lloyd, dated the 5th instant, and just
received, the said Bremen steamship company have resolved, hence-
forth, and until further notice, to forward by their steamers all the
packages of books and specimens of natural history which the
Smithsonian Institution may be pleased to send to Germany, or which
may be sent from Germany to the Smithsonian Institution, free of
charges between New York and Bremenhaven.

I beg leave to add that Messrs. Gelpcke, Keutgen and Reichelt, 84
Broadway, New York, are the agents of the North German Lloyd at
that place, and that the next Bremen steamer sailing for Europe will
leave New York on the 19th of February next.

I avail myself of this occasion to offer you renewed assurances of
my high consideration.

13 AsHLEyY PLACE,
London, January 8, 1859.

My Dear Sir: I sent you from Leeds, in September, a printed copy
of the report of the joint committee of the Royal Society and the
British Association, on the subject of the continuance of magnetic ob-
servations drawn up by Sir John Herschel. You will have been ap-
‘ PRUCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. SL

prised by it of the serious purpose entertained in this country to
prosecute the magnetic researches which have already, though quite
in their infancy, established so many important laws. The minutes
of the last meeting of the council of the British Association, will make
you acquainted with our subsequent proceedings.

Our government has postponed the decision of the precise measures
to be taken until next year ; and indeed our preparations, both of in-
struments and observers, could scarcely have been ready earlier, but
I think that we may entertain very sanguine hopes of establishing
some observatories at least; and I have the more confident expecta-
tion of this from the letter of the Prince Consort of December 11,
(which you will see in the enclosed minutes,) who is to be our presi-
dent next year, (at the B. A.,) and who will then be the medium of
our communications with government. But still we may derive
great support from any evidence which we may be able to adduce that
other countries besides our own participate in the scientific interest of
these researches, and it is specially in this view that I now write to
you.

Our government appears not indisposed to have an observatory at
Pekin, and we shall no doubt press strongly to have a second at Van-
couver’s Island. Toronto is already a third observatory in action in
nearly the same latitude, and London a fourth. It is obvious that a
chain of stations at moderate distances from each other in the middle
latitudes of the one hemisphere would give us a very reasonable
prospect of establishing with confidence laws the existence of which
we can now only infer. The greatest interval is between London
and Pekin, but this I have some reason to hope may be supplied by
an observatory at Kazan, under the able direction of Professor Bol-
zani, and it is impossible under these circumstances not to desire that
the observatory which you have so long meditated at Washington,
should be brought into corresponding activity.

It is purposed that the instruments for the new British observa-
tories should serve either for eye observations or for a continuous
record of the three elements. They will be in great measure on the
modei of the self-recording instruments at Kew, which have now been
at work for a twelvemonth, and which seem indeed to leave little to
be desired. But those for the colonial observatories will be somewhat
differently arranged, so as to occupy a space not exceeding perhaps
twelve feet by six, and to have all their parts so attached to a solid
floor that nothing is capable of misplacement. We find at Kew
that two persons are sufficient for the manipulations of such an obser-
vatory, the preparation of the paper, &c., and the tabulation from the
traces by instrumental measurement at hourly intervals.

The instruments for the first either colonial or extra English ob-
servatory are in hand, and will be at work we expect in a temporary
building in the grounds of the observatory at Kew in July or August
next, where, should you incline to come once more to our British As-
sociation meeting, which is to be held this year at Aberdeen, under
the Prince Consort, or should any friend do so in whose judgment you
can confide, there will be a full opportunity for examining them.

I cannot conclude this letter without again adverting to the sup-
port which we should derive in our communications with our govern -
ment in the event of the Smithsonian Institution concurring with us
in the importance of prosecuting these inquiries, and being disposed
to adopt corresponding proceedings with, of course, such modifications
as may suit either their convenience or their views of the subject.

Believe me, my dear sir, sincerely yours,

EDWARD SABINE.

LECTURES

ON ASTRONOMY.

BY PROFESSOR A. CASWELL, OF BROWN UNIVERSITY.

1, The figure and magnitude of the earth.

Every person who ventures to address a public assembly is supposed
to have something to present to them which is worthy of their atten-
tion, and which they can understand. In the treatment of scientific
subjects he must occupy himself mainly in giving information respect-
ing the facts and methods and laws of science.

In appearing before you this evening I may be permitted, I trust,
without arrogance on my part or disparagement to you, to say that
my object is instruction. Any object lower than this would ill become
this place and the character of this noble Institution, which is doing
so much to stimulate investigation and develop the scientific resources
of our country. I wish to unfold to you the elementary methods by
which the astronomer advances step by step in investigation, until he
spans the heavens with his measuring rod and weighs the far off
planetary bodies as in a balance, and marks the point in the starry
concave where the flaming comet will disappear in the depths of ether,
and that other point with almost equal precision where it will reap-
pear after the flight of centuries. There are in astronomy refinements
of method, both practical and theoretical, which can be appreciated only
by rare gifts and profound study. But the elementary methods are
quite within the reach of ordinary minds. The law, which it was dif-
ficult to discover, may be very easily understood and its results readily
traced. It might require a Newton or a La Place to unveil the me-
chanism of the heavens, but when that is once done every beholder
may watch the wonderful evolutions.

To accomplish the purposes I have in view, I must first of all secure
your attention. For this I rely more upon the inherent interest and
grandeur of the subject than upon any adventitious attractions which
I may be able to throw around it.

Astronomy has long claimed the pre-eminence of being the most
ancient and the most perfect of the sciences. And yet astronomy, in
some of its aspects, is a rapidly progressive and cumulative science.
86 LECTURES

The number of primary planets known to astronomers has been
quadrupled within the last few years. Instead of the five planets
known to Ptolemy and Copernicus, and even to Newton, we now have
upwards of sixty. Scarcely a month passes that does not add some-
thing to the aggregate of our knowledge of the heavens—that does
not reveal some new wonder to the telescope, or disclose some new
treasure to the far-reaching analysis of the mathematician. Never
could it be said with a profounder meaning than now that ‘‘ the hea-
vens declare the glory of God.’’

The mechanism of the heavens, in proportion as wé comprehend
more and more of its vastness and seeming complexity, bears witness
to the enduring order and harmony of the universe, and points with
unerring certainty to the superintending agency of an intelligent and
infinite -creator.

In the course of our discussions we shall have occasion not only to
state the results of investigation, but to witness the struggles and
triumphs of the human mind in working its way to the solution of.
some of the great problems of science.

We spontaneously pay the tribute of our homage to all great
achievements. But in no case is homage wore just or more enduring
than that which all cultivated minds pay to him who stands as the
minister and interpreter of Nature, and makes known to us her laws
and her mysteries. Many such adorn the annals of astronomy.

But I must not, in these preliminary remarks, encroach upon the
time which belongs to the special subject of the evening, which is —

The figure and magnitude of the earth.

This may be called the great problem of astronomy. Its import-
ance is apparent from this, that the radius of the earth is. the unit of
measure—I may say the measuring rod—which we are compelled to
use in determining the dimensions of the solar system. Whatever
error obtains in our knowledge of this will be repeated and multiplied
in all our estimates of planetary distances. Hence the importance
which attaches to this problem, and the great pains which has been
taken to solve it with the utmost accuracy.

That the general figure of the earth is spherical was an opinion held
by many of the ancient astronomers. This was obvious from the
manner in which vessels disappear at sea. It was also indicated by the
circular shadow of the earth upon the moon in the case of eclipses.
In contemplating the extent of.countries, and the distance of one
country from another, the question of the earth’s magnitude would nat-
urally—almost necessarily, be suggested. It would be useless to
attempt to trace the successive steps in the progress of this inquiry
among the ancients. Aristotle relates that the mathematicians prior
to his time had found the circumference of the earth to be 400,000
stadia. But the length of the Greek stadium is unknown, so also is
the method by which this result was obtained. The fact mentioned
by Aristotle is only of interest as showing that the question had en-
ON ASTRONOMY. 87

gaged the attention of astronomers at a very early period. Eratos-
thenes, of Alexandria, appears to have been the first to form a true
conception of the method by which the problem could be solved; that
is, by the measurement of an arc of the terrestrial meridian. Nearly
three centuries (276 years) before the Christian era, by such rude
methods as were then in use, he determined the distance from Alex-
andria to Syene in upper Egypt to be 34 of the whole circumference
of the earth. From the measured distance between the two cities he
computed the circumference of the earth to be 250,000 stadia. Some-
what later Posidonius, also of the Alexandrine school, resumed the
inquiry and gave as the result of his measurements 240,000 stadia.
But the uncertainty in the length of the stadium renders these results
of little value.

Nearly a thousand years later, (A. D. 814,) when the schools of sci-
ence had been transferred from Egypt and Greece to the banks of the
Kuphrates, the caliph Almamoun, of Bagdad, directed his astrono-
mers to measure a degree of the meridian on the plains of Mesopota-
mia, with a view to determine the problem of the earth’s magnitude.
Their result was so nearly coincident with that given by Ptolemy that
suspicion was cast upon the genuineness and fidelity of the measure-
ments.

After this period the inquiry seems hardly to have awakened any
attention for seven or eight centuries, when it was taken up by modern
European astronomers.

Before adverting to the more recent geodetic operations, as they are
termed, which have given us the exact figure and magnitude of the
earth, I may, perhaps, with advantage point out the general method
of executing those operations and the manner in which we deduce
from them the exact dimensions of the earth.

The geodetic operations to which I refer have for their object the
measurement ot arcs on the earth’s surface and chiefly arcs of the
meridian. There are other observations and experiments subsidiary
to the solution of this problem, to which I shall merely advert in
passing. Thus, for instance, the law of attraction for a spheroid
having been established, the vibrations of the pendulum in different
latitudes will furnish data from which the figure, not the magnitude,
of the earth can be determined. Many thousands of pendulum ex-
periments have been made in different parts of the earth with this
object in view. There are also certain inequalities in the moon’s
motion, which are produced by the oblate or flattened figure of the
earth. These observed inequalities become in the hands of the mathe-
matical astronomer an accurate measure of that oblateness. The
results obtained by La Place and others by this method are received
with great confidence by the most eminent astronomers. We shall refer
to the results obtained by both these methods, which assign the jigure
only, when we have explained the method of finding both the figure
and also the magnitude by the measurements of arcs of the meridian.

The measurement of a meridian line consists of three distinct pro-
CeSsses :

1. The line must be run in true north and south direction.
88 LECTURES

2. The difference of latitude at its extremities, or what is the same
thing, the angle made between the plumb-lines, must be determined.

3. The length of the arc in miles, or parts of miles, must be deter-
mined,

By the aid of a few simple diagrams I can readily indicate to you
how these results are obtained.

1. To run a true north and south line we have only to direct the
telescope of a transit instrument on a theodolite to the north star when
it is directly above or below the pole, and then, the axis being hori-
zontal, sight to some well defined object situated to the north and to
another at thesouth. The line passing through these points and con-
tinued by sighting to new objects will be the line required. The
time, which occurs twice in every twenty-four hours, when the north
star is so situated, is easily known from the Nautical Almanac. This
is the readiest method of fixing the line. Butif the Nautical Almanac
is not on hand, the same result is obtained by so placing the instru-
ment that the time between the upper and lower transits of a cireum-
polar star passing through the western portion of its revolution shall
be the same as that in passing from the lower transit through the
eastern portion of its revolution to the upper.

P 2. To find the angle made be-

Z Z s tween the plumb-line, let a and
sb, fig. 1, represent the arc of the
meridian; C the centre of the
earth; Z and Z’ the zeniths of

the two extremities of the line.

Et It is required to find the angle
\ aC b, This will be the differ-

ence in latitude between the two

stations. But it is most easily

Fig I obtained by observing the zenith

4 distance of any star in the vicinity
of the zenith as it passes the me-
ridian. Thus Z a s/ would be the
zenith distance of the star ata,

and Z' b s' the zenith distance at 6. The difference between these
two is the required angle at C. In practice this element is obtained
very readily and with great precision.

3. By far the most difficult part of the work is to measure the exact
distance between the two points a and b. This is best done by a
system of triangles. Thus, in fig. 2, suppose A and B to be the
extremities of the meridian line, and D E F G and H to be prominent
points of the country at such elevations as to be visible the one from
the other. Commencing the operation at A, a line A D, of several
miles in extent, lying along a level plain, if such can be found, is
selected and accurately measured. This is called a base or base line,
and the utmost refinement of methods is required for its measurement.
The base line having been measured, we place an instrument, adapted
to the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles, (usually a
large theodolite,) at A, and measure the horizontal angle D A EH,
ON ASTRONOMY. 89

and D A M, and also the elevation, if any, of D and E above A. The
instrument is then transported to D, and A D E and E D F are
measured, and also the elevations of F and EK above D; and thus in
succession the instrument is taken to each of the stations and all the

VY

E

horizontal and vertical angles are measured. The sides of all the
triangles, varying in length from 10 to 40 or 50 miles, may now be
very easily computed. Beginning with A D E, and taking them in
succession, we have in each case all the angles and one side given to
find the other sides. To test the accuracy of the work a second line,
as H B, at or near the extremity of the line is measured. This is
called the base of verification. If any considerable error is found to
exist between the measured and computed length of this line the
whole work must be gone over again. But before we can expect any
close agreement between the computed and measured length of the
base of verification the several stations, D E F and G, must be reduced
to the level surface, that is, to the surface of the water, if we should
suppose the ocean to flow freely over
the land. We must reduce each of
the stations to the continued ocean
surface. Thus, in fig. 3, A mey be
situated on the beach, E on the
summit of a mountain, A G the
curve or line of the ocean surface ~
continued. We must, in fact, re-
duce the point E to G and compute
the length of the curved line A G
from knowing the length of the
straight line A E and the elevation
of the point. My object here is not
to give any abstract or synopsis of
the method of making this reduc-
tion, but only to indicate what is required to be done. The process,
though somewhat laborious, presents no peculiar difficulty.

It now remains to find the distance from A to B along the meridian
line reduced to the ocean surface. This we do by resolving in succes-

sion the triangles, fig. 2, ADM, MEN, NFO, OGP, and PHB,

90 LECTURES

in which we shall have known two angles and the included side.
Adding the distances A M, M N, N O, O P, and P B, we shall have
the entire distance from A to B measured along the continued ocean
level. It is thus that science, by her magic touch, levels down the
mountains and fills up the valleys, and makes for herself a path
which, we may truly say, the vulture’s eye hath not seen.

To solve the problem we have in hand, and determine definitely
the figure and magnitude of the earth, we must have the results of
measurements in different latitudes.

We shall briefly refer to some of the principal measurements which
have been executed before we deduce from them the exact dimensions
of the earth.

From the early part of the ninth century, when the Arabian astrono-
mers, as before stated, measured an arc of the meridian on the plain
of Mesopotamia, this question seems to have been lost sight of for
more than six hundred years.

1. In 1528, Fernel, an eminent physician of Paris, revived the
problem by measuring the distance from Paris to Amiens, in Picardy,
by counting the revolutions of his coach wheels.

2. Nearly a hundred years later, (1617,) Snellens, of Leyden,
measured an arc of the meridian, in Holland, between Alkmaer and
Bergen-op-Zoom. He was the first to adopt the principle of trian-
gulation.

3. Some few years after the measurement of Snellens, the English
astronomer, Norwood, (1635,) measured an arc between London and
York. He measured parts of the distance with a chain, other parts
by pacing, and where the ground was rough he estimated the distance
_as well as he could.

The results of these measurements, on account of the imperfection
of methods and instruments, are of little or no value. They only
indicate the growing interest in the problem.

4, Picard’s measurement.

It was not until 1669 that an arc of the meridian was measured
with such care and precision as to inspire confidence in the result.
This was done by Picard, of the French Academy. He was the jirst
to apply the telescope to instruments for the measure of angles. He
commenced his operations at Malvoisin, near Paris, and terminated
them at Sourdon, near Amiens. For the measurement of terrestrial
angles he used a quadrant of 38 inches radius, and for zenith distances
a sextant of 10 feet radius.

He found for a degree 60.812 fathoms, a result very near the truth,
but it was owing to a fortunate balancing of errors which were sub-
sequently discovered in his work.

5. Up to 1672 no doubt was entertained of the perfect sphericity of
the earth During this year a circumstance occurred which had a
most important bearing upon this problem. Richer was sent out by
the French Academy to Cayenne, in South America, to make obser-
vations on the parallax of Mars. He took with him a pendulum,
carefully adjusted to beat seconds in Paris. On suspending it at
Cayenne, three or four degrees north of the equator, he found that it
lost two minutes and twenty-eight seconds per day. He shortened it
ON ASTRONOMY. 91

to make it beat seconds, and on returning to Paris it was necessary
to restore the original length in order again to beat seconds.

Picard had anticipated that a change of temperature would affect
the rate, but by no means to so great an extent as two minutes and
twenty-eight seconds per day.

The cause of so remarkable a fact of course engaged the attention
of astronomers.

Newton and Huygens both assigned the true cause, viz: the dimin-
ished force of gravity as a consequence of the centrifugal force and
the flattened figure of the earth.

The effect of the centrifugal
force may be illustrated by fig. 4. P Hig 4.
Let E P QS be a section of the
earth made by a meridian circle,

PS the axis, E Q the equator,
and P C Q an imaginary tube
extending from the pole to the
centre, and thence to the equa- g
tor. Let this tube be filled with
water and the earth at rest.
The two branches would then be
of equal length. Now let the
earth begin to rotate on the line
PS. The water would imme-
diately settle down in P C and s

rise in C Q.

Newton found the ratio of the two axes to be as 229 : 230. There
could be no doubt that the figure was flattened et the pole, the only
question was how much?

6. To settle a question of so much interest and of so much importance,
the French Academy determined on extending the arc of Picard.

In 1683, under the direction of the eminent astronomer royal, Do-
minic Cassini, the measurement was extended to some distance south
of Paris, when the death of the minister, Colbert, suddenly inter-
rupted their labors. They were not resumed till 1701, when the line
was extended to Perpignan, on the Mediterranean, 6° south of Paris.

In 1718 James Cassini, son of the former, continued the measure-
ment on the north of Paris to Dunkirk. Thus was this great work
completed after thirty years of labor.

The unlooked for result was that a degree at the northern extremity
of the arc was 145 fathoms shorter than at the southern.

The necessary consequence was that the earth was elongated, not
flattened, at the poles, and that the conclusion of the mathematicians
was contradicted by the facts.

This opinion, in opposition to those of Newton and Huygens, was
maintained by Cassini de Thury and his able coadjutors in the
Academy. ‘To confirm so important a result, Cassini measured an
are on a parallel of latitude extending from Strasburg to Brest, and
found it 300 toises shorter than it would have been if the earth had
been a perfect sphere. In an elaborate work published by him in
1735 he says, as quoted by Delambre, (Hist. Ast. 18th Century, p.

92 LECTURES

275 :) ‘Thus all our operations in longitude as well as latitude concur
in giving to the earth a figure elongated towards the pole.’’ Headds:
‘« This discovery, so useful to the sciences and to navigation, and so
glorious to France, will be due to the Academy.”’

7. The conflicting results thus obtained, taken in connexion with
the importance of the problem, determined the French Academy to
send out commissions, one to measure an arc of the meridian near the
equator, another in the most northern latitude accessible.

This was in 1735. The commission to the north was committed
chiefly to Maupertuis and Clairault, while that to the equator was
under the direction of Bouguer and Condamine.

The place selected by Maupertuis and Clairault for the northern
line was at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia, com-
mencing at Tornea, on the gulf, and terminating at a place called
Kittis, in latitude 66° 48’ 44”. The work was accomplished amid
great difficulties, arising from the severities of the climate. The
commission returned after an absence of more than two years. An
account of it was published by Clairault in 1743. he length of a
degree was found. to be 61.195 toises. This result, by subsequent
measurement of Swanburg, was found to be slightly erroneous.

The southern commission commenced their operations at Targui in
Peru, near the equator, and continued the line to Cotshequi, about 3°
south of it. This commission was absent nine years.* A detailed
account of the work was given by Bouguer in one volume, 8vo., pub-
lished 1749. The length of a degree was found to be 60.468 toises.

The results of these measurements dissipated all doubts as to the
earth’s figure. They showed an unquestionable lengthening of the
degrees as we go from the equator to the pole, and a consequent flat-
tening at the pole.

8. In the mean time, while these important measurements were in
progress in Peru and Lapland, Cassini de Thury, third of the name
and grandson of Dominic, in connexion with Lacaille, in 1739, re-
measured the entire French are from Perpignan to Dunkirk, with
every possible care which could insure the utmost accuracy in the
result. Several errors of former measurements were corrected. The
comparison of a degree at the northern and southern extremities of
the arc, of some 400 miles in extent left, no room for doubt as to the
lengthening of the degrees as we proceed to the north. These three
measurements removed all doubts which might have existed as to the
figure of the earth. Thus the mathematicians, who dednced the ob-
lateness from principles purely dynamical, had the satisfaction of
finding their conclusions confirmed by the most elaborate measure-
ments.

The next object of interest was to determine the exact amount ;
that is, to determine the exact length of the two axes of the figure ;
in other words, the equatorial and polar diameters.

9. To determine the exact amount of oblateness, additional mea-
surements in different latitudes and different portions of the earth were
necessary.

* Left France in May, 1735, returned in 1744.
ON ASTRONOMY. 93

In 1750 Boscovich and Le Maire measured an arc from Rome to
Rimini, a distance of nearly 140 miles.

In 1752 Liesganig measured an arc passing through the observatory
of Vienna, and about the same time Beccaria measured another in the
plains of Lombardy.

In 1764 Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon measured a line of
about 100 miles in length along the valley of the Delaware. They were
engaged at the time in running the boundary line between the States of
Pennsylvania and Maryland, and finding a fine locality for measuring
an are of the meridian, they informed the Royal Society of London
of the fact and offered to execute the work if the Society would furnish
the requisite instruments. The Society, under the advice of Dr. Mas-
kelyne, the astronomer royal, gladly accepted the offer of Messrs.
Mason and Dixon. This line is re-
markable as having been actually Hig 6
measured through its whole extent VA B
with wooden rods, or rather a wooden
frame, sent out for the purpose by
the Royal Society. It was made of
fir, 20 feet long and 4 feet wide, with
adjustments for being leveled by 7
plumb line. This measurement has
always been regarded as a very ac-
curate one. The latitude of the
middle point of the line is 39° 12’
nearly. This arc is one of the 13 Ss
used by Airy in determining the
figure of the earth.

10. After the peace 1783 Cassini de Thury addressed a memoir to the
Royal Society of London upon the importance to astronomy of deter-
mining more accurately than had before been done the difference in
longitude between the observatories of Paris and Greenwich. ‘The
suggestion was favorably received and commissions were appointed by
both governments to carry the project into effect by a trigonometrical
survey. General Roy was at the head of the English commission.
The French operations were committed to Count Cassini, (the 4th of
the name,) Mechain and Legendre.

The English had hitherto taken little part in the prosecution of
these important geodetic labors, but the splendid array of instru-
ments and the practical skill which they brought to the work placed
them second to no others. The great theodolite, constructed for the
purpose by Ramsden, 30 inches in diameter, may almost be said to be
the wonder of the age. It certainly marks an important epoch in the
history of astronomical instruments. The three angles of every spheri-
cal triangle are well known to be greater than two right angles. But
this theodolite, in the hands of General Roy, was the first instrument,
in the history of science, to show the fact by actual measurement. It
is recorded, as a singularly gratifying fact, that in all the primary tri-
angles this spherical excess was apparent, and seldom did it exceed
3” or 4” of arc.

The work on both sides of the channel was executed with eminent

94 LECTURES

ability. The computation of the French astronomers, based upon this
triangulation, placed the observatory of Paris 9’ 21” to the east of
Greenwich. The computations of Colonel Mudge gave 9’ 19”.4. In
the mean time, the difference obtained by Dr. Maskelyne from astron-
omical observation was 9’ 20’. And nearer than this, it was sug-
gested, the difference probably would never be known; but the
electric telegraph was not then invented. With this new aid the dif-
ference is fixed at 9/ 20.63. This last is adopted by the English
Nautical Almanac.

The triangulation of Great Britain and Ireland now extends from
the Scilly islands, in latitude 49° 53’, to the Shetland isles, latitude
60° 50’—a distance of about 750 miles. During the progress of the
work, commenced in 1791 and continued to the present time, seven
base lines have been measured. The one on Hounslow Heath has
beeu measured three times—once with deal rods, once with glass rods,
and once with a steel chain of exquisite workmanship, made by Rams-
den. ‘The results were as follows:

Length! by deal rods... 02. cis. .csass00s 27,405.76 feet.
Length) by. class rods... ois a.9 cme 27,403.38 ‘
Length by steel chain.............04 27,402.38 §

The base on Salisbury plains, of between six and seven miles in
length, has been measured twice, first with Ramsden’s steel chain
and subsequently with General Colby’s compensation bars, the latter
measure exceeded the former by about one foot. Sir J. Herschel says
that the greatest possible error in the Irish line, near Londonderry,
of between seven and eight miles in length, is supposed not to exceed
two inches,

11. Many other arcs of the meridian have been measured. Three
of them deserve to be mentioned, on account of their great extent and
the extreme accuracy of the work.

The first is the great French arc, commenced in 1791, under order
of the National Assembly. The object was to determine a new unit
of measure of length, the metre, which should be based on an invari-
able standard in nature. It was determined to make it the =,)° 09
part of the meridian of the earth from the equator to the pole. This
magnificent enterprise was assigned to Delambre and Mechain. De-

took the southern, from Paris to Perpignan, and extended the same
to Barcelona, in Spain. This arc was subsequently extended, (1806,)
by Biot and Arago, to the island of Fomentera, in the Mediterranean.
The whole are from Dunkirk to Fomentera covers about 123° of lati-
tude, or about 850 miles. Delambre’s base of verification, of about
7.3 miles, differed from its computed lengths by only about 11 inches.

12. The second is the great Indian arc, commenced by Colonel
Lancton in 1802 at a place called Punne, near Cape Comorin, the
extreme southern point of Hindostan, and extended northward
through about 10° of latitude (680 miles.) After the death of Lanc-
ton, in 1823, the work was continued by Captain Everest, who had
been his principal assistant, through an arc of nearly 114° (797 miles. )
ON ASTRONOMY. 95

This whole distance, measured with singular ability, extending from
Cape Comorin to the foot of the Himalay mountains, is 1,477 miles.

Two of Everest’s bases of verification, of about 7} miles in extent,
differed by computation, the one 4 and the other 7 inches from the
measured length.

13. The third is the Russian are, extending from Ismail on the Danube
to the Arctic sea near the North Cape, being more than 25 degrees
(25° 20/.) The work was under the direction of the able astronomer
Strové. It was begun in 1816, and-has but recently been completed.
The complete discussion of the observations has not yet been given to
the public. This arc is about 1,750 miles in extent, and is believed
to have been measured with eminent ability.

14. Any sketch of the geodetic operations which serve to determine
the figure of the earth would be incomplete without a notice of the
United States Coast Survey.

The great interest with which this question was regarded in early
times arose from its importance as an astronomical problem; but in
the attempts to devise more accurate methods for the measurement, of
arcs upon the earth’s surface, it was found that, for the construction
of accurate maps of any extended portions of the earth, a knowledge
of its precise figure was not only essential, but that the method of
triangulation which was adopted to connect the extreme points of
the arc to be measured, together with the astronomical positions of
those points, formed the best possible basis of a map of the region
traversed by the system of triangles.

This was the origin of the science called geodesy or geodetic sur-
veying. The interest which was felt in the solution of an impor-
tant scientific question was, therefore, soon merged in that which
attended its practical benefits to the human race, in the construction
of accurate maps, showing the boundaries of States and provinces,
and the configuration of sea coasts.

The French arc was first made the basis of a complete map of
France, and most of the measurements of arcs in modern times have
been incidental to the prosecution of extended surveys of the territo-
ries through which they pass.

The figure of the earth having been approximately determined, the
more accurate measurement of its dimensions, from having been the
primary object of the great geodetic operations of the globe, has,
therefore, become secondary or incidental to geodetic surveys. Thus
the Indian arc, the Russian arc, and numerous measurements in Ku-
rope, would, perhaps, not have been undertaken, except as the result
of extended trignometrical surveys for national purposes.

Every improvement in the construction of instruments for geodetic
and astronomical purposes, and in the methods of observation em-
ployed, gives additional value and weight to subsequent measure-
ments, and hence it is that the data derived from the geodetic opera-
tions of the United States Coast Survey for the more accurate solution
of the question of the figure of the earth may be looked for with great
interest.

The important objects of this survey, united with the great extent
of the coast, requires the highest attainable accuracy in the great
96 LECTURES

chain of triangles which stretches along the coast, forming the basis
of the survey, and in the astronomical determinations connected with
it. It has been demonstrated that, in works of this character, ulti-
mate economy is promoted in proportion to the precision with which
the work is first executed. There is every demand, therefore, for the
most perfect instruments, the most approved methods of observation,
and the best practical skill in establishing the true positions of the
primary points of the survey.

The American Coast Survey now represents, according to the best
authorities, the most perfect forms of practical science applicable to
works of this character; and a general sketch of the methods em-
ployed in the geodetic operations, in order to illustrate the value of
the new measurements of arcs of the earth’s surface which will follow
the completion of the primary chain of triangles along the coast, will
not be out of place in connexion with this subject.

The triangulation of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts when completed
will extend diagonally through 19 degrees of latitude and 30 degrees
of longitude. The extreme points of this triangulation will be dis-
tant from each other, by the general line of the coast, nearly 3,000
miles; the chain of triangles extending from the eastern boundary of
Maine to the western boundary of Texas. It will probably be many
years, perhaps centuries, before this triangulation will be extended
across the continent to the Pacific ocean ; but, ultimately, this will
undoubtedly come to pass; in the mean while the survey of the
western coast of our territory is progressing according to the plan
followed on the eastern coast.

The triangulation of the eastern coast is now continuous from
Mount Desert, in Maine, to Shalotte inlet, south of Cape Fear, in
North Carolina; stretching over more than ten degrees of latitude
and as many degrees of longitude, including the coast of ten States,
and the greater part of the coast of two others ; then, with an interval
of about seventy miles, it extends along the coast of South Carolina
and Georgia.

Large detached portions of the triangulation of the coast of Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas have been completed, and
a few years only will be necessary to fill the intervals so as to makea
continuous chain from the eastern boundary of Maine to the western
boundary of Texas.

This triangulation will rest upon ten or twelve principal base lines,
measured on different parts of the coast, which afford the double pur-
pose of starting the work at nearly the same time at different points,
and for ultimate verification of its accuracy.

The accuracy of the work has been tested by the connexion of several
of these bases in the progress of the survey, and the degree of precision
attained is so remarkable as to justify a somewhat detailed description
of the various processes by which aérial distances of many miles length,
and hundreds of miles from the starting point, or base, may be deter-
mined by the wonderful applications of geodesy, with but a few inches
of probable or possible error.

When it is said that a certain part of this triangulation is completed,
it is meant that all the mechanical work in the field for measuring the
base lines and the angles, and for determining the latitudes and longi-
ON ASTRONOMY. 97

tudes by astronomical observation, has been executed, and the com-
putations performed by which the results of the mechanical work are
made available. The calculations of the elements of a survey from
given data are founded on mathematical formule, and are susceptible
of rigid accuracy ; but the mechanical work in the field depends for
its precision upon the means employed, and on the skill and care of
the operator. In some of the early attempts, as we have before stated,
to measure great distances on the earth’s surface, the only means em-
ployed was counting the revolutions of a carriage wheel, of known
periphery, in travelling over the distance.

When the method of triangulation was invented the line to be
determined mechanically was shortened so that, without too much
labor, the whole length could be measured by rods or chains; and,
finally, an apparatus was constructed especially for the measurement
of base lines.

Any simple material of whatever form is liable to change its dimen-
sions with a change of temperature, so that a line measured on the
ground by a steel or glass rod, or a chain, would appear to have a
different length if measured in summer, from that which it would have
if measured in winter with the same apparatus. This was found to be
the chief source of error, and although the changes in length of a rod
caused by a given change of temperature may be calculated and a cor-
rection applied to the measurements, yet for primary base lines a more
accurate measuring apparatus was devised, by combining two metallic
bars upon the compensating principle, illustrated in the compensation
pendulum.

This method was first applied by Colonel Colby, in the ordnance
survey of Great Britain. It has been brought to great perfection in
this country by Professor Bache in the base apparatus of the Coast
Survey.

The great object to be attained in a measuring apparatus of this
kind is such a combination or arrangement that the extreme points of
the compound bar used as measuring limits shall remain at an invari-
able distance apart under all degrees of temperature, and even while
the temperature is changing.

This is effected in the Coast Survey base apparatus by two bars, one of
brass and the other of iron, each a little less than twenty feet in length,
placed side by side so as to be capable of independent parallel motion
on rollers. At one end, the two bars are firmly attached to each other
by means of a block to which they are fastened by screws, the
medium of connexion at the other or free ends of the bars is a lever of
compensation. ‘he brass bar is attached to the lever by a hinge pin,
and the iron bar abuts agaiiist the lever, the free end of which is
the point that remains fixed during any change in the length of the
bars ; the points of attachment of the bars to the lever being adjusted
at such a distance from the end of the lever that the motion will be
about this end as a centre. ‘These points are determined by the rela-
tive expansions of the brass and iron, and the cross sections of the
bars are so calculated that they will undergo the same changes of
temperature from the same source of heat in the same time. The end
of the lever of compensation abuts against a small secondary rod or

7
98 LECTURES

bar, which is supported parallel to the iron and brass bars, and which
is used for making the contact of the two compound bars during the
operation of measuring. On the opposite end of each pair of compound
bars a corresponding small auxiliary rod is placed, and also a sector
for measuring the slope at which the whole bar is placed.

Two measuring bars being made exactly alike as above described,
are placed in line upon the ground and adjusted so that the small
rods at the end shall be at the same height, the lever end of one
opposite to the sector end of the other; the rod at the sector end of
the foremost bar is so attached to a small spirit level that by a slight
pressure the bubble will be brought to the centre of the level. The
rod on the end of the other bar, which we have described as abutting
against the lever of compensation, has a sliding motion, which is
resisted by a delicate spiral spring ; the end of this little rod is termi-
nated by a smooth agate plane surface, and the end of the opposite
rod by an agate knife edge. The contact is made by bringing these
ends together, the spirit level insuring the same degree of pressure in
every case.

This is the general description of the apparatus ; the sector is used
for measuring the slope of the ground along which the line extends,
the resulting angle giving the means of reducing the measurements
to horizontal lengths. Hach of the compound bars are enclosed in
large tin tubes, to protect them from the air and weather and sudden
change of temperature, and in use these tubes are supported on trestles
made for the purpose.

There are many interesting details of construction which can only
be explained by reference to drawings or to the apparatus itself, a full
description of which may be found in the Coast Survey Report of 1854.

With the apparatus we have described a distance of a mile may be
measured in one day, and a distance of ten miles may be measured
with no greater error than a fraction of an inch. The length of each
of the compound bars is kept constantly compared during the meas-
urement of a base line with a standard metallic bar, the length of which
at a given temperature is known.

The necessity for the greatest attainable accuracy in such opera-
tions is apparent, when we remember that any error in the base line
will be greatly multiplied in the triangulation depending upon it.
The true cause of the erroneous results of the measurement of the
first French arc was an error in the base line of Picard, which was
subsequently discovered and corrected as before stated.

A base was measured on Kent island, in Chesapeake bay, to verify
the triangulation between a base on Fire Island (on the south side of
Liong Island) and the Chesapeake. The shortest distance between
these base lines is two hundred and eight miles, but the distance
through the triangulation is three hundred and twenty miles. The
Kent Island base, five miles and four-tenths long, was first calculated
from the triangulation, which embraces thirty-two triangles. The
computed length differed from the length found by measurement only
four inches.

On some parts of the coast, where it is desirable to commence the
work of the survey in advance of the main triangulation, preliminary
ON ASTRONOMY. 99

or secondary base lines are measured by means of wooden or iron bars
of simple construction; but all such measurements are, in time, super-
seded by the progress of the primary triangulation.

In measuring the angles of the primary triangulation theodolites
of various sizes and construction are employed. The largest instru-
ment of this class belonging to the Coast Survey has a circle of thirty
inches diameter. It was designed by Mr. Hassler, the first superin-
tendent of the Survey, and constructed by Troughton and Simms of
London. The circle is graduated to five minutes, and may be read
to single seconds by means of micrometers. It is provided with a tele-
scope of great power, by which signals many miles distant may be
seen distinctly. This instrument is employed principally on the north-
east part of the coast, where the lines range from twenty to eighty
miles in length. ‘The accuracy of this instrument is such that the
probable error of a single measure of an angle is about one second and
a quarter ; a mean of about thirty measures is taken for each angle.

Another theodolite of nearly similar construction and of twenty-
four inches diameter is also employed in the survey. Besides these,
smaller repeating theodolites of various sizes are used on different
parts of the work.

Various instruments have been employed for the determination of
the latitude of the most prominent points of the triangulation, among
which may be mentioned vertical circles, repeating theodolites, and
especially the zenith sector, designed by Mr. Airy, the astronomer-
royal of England; but all, except the last named, have been found
liable to considerable errors. The zenith sector is accurate and gives
good results, but its great weight and the labor attendant on its use
make it less available for such surveys than an instrument called
the zenith telescope, designed by Captain A. Talcott, late of the United
States engineers. This instrument is designed to measure by means
of a micrometer the difference of zenith distances of stars which cul-
minate within a short time of each other and near the zenith, on oppo-
site sides of it. It is portab-e, accurate, and simple, and is perhaps
destined to supersede all others for geodetic purposes.

In the progress of the latitude observations of the survey discrep-
ancies have occurred which can only be accounted for by local irregu-
larities in the figure and density of the earth. These irregularities
are still the subject of investigation. For the determination of the
longitudes of the various points of the survey every means which sci-
ence can afford has been resorted to. All the observations obtainable
by eclipses, occultations, and moon culminations, made in this coun-
try previously to 1844, together with the simultaneous observations
abroad, so far as they could be found, have been collected and redu-
ced, and similar observations have since been continued at Cambridge,
Philadelphia, Washington, Charleston, and Cincinnati. All these
stations being connected by the electric-telegraph, their differences
of longitude have been determined with great accuracy, and all the
results are referred to Cambridge, as a common station of reference.

The difference of longitude between Cambridge and Liverpool has
also been determined by means of large numbers of chronometers
100 LECTURES

carried repeatedly between the two stations on the Cunard steam-
ships.*

“The differences of longitude between Cambridge and the prin-
cipal stations of the survey in other sections are determined by the aid
of the electric telegraph, wherever this has been established. In this
method, which is by far the most accurate for determining difference
of longitude, the Coast Survey has taken the lead, and has brought it
to a state of perfection which subsequent operations of a similar nature ©
executed in Europe have not yet reached.

‘«The idea of comparing the local time of different places by means
of the electric telegraph is sufficiently obvious, and dates from the
conception of the telegraph itself; but the refined methods by which
the intervention of human senses and operations, and the consequent
liabilities to error, are, in the greatest possible degree, avoided, and
by which the time of transmission is measured and eliminated from
the longitude, have been the result of careful study and long expe-
rience. The method of recording observations of time on a chrono-
graphic register, by means of a galvanic circuit, known in Europe as
the American method, originated in the Coast Survey with the first
attempts to determine longitude by means of the electro-magnetic
telegraph. The chronographic record is made on a cylinder, revolving
with nearly uniform velocity, covered with a sheet of paper, upon
which a pen traces a line, interrupted or deflected for an instant
through the agency of an electro-magnet, every time the pendulum
of the clock passes the vertical, and in doing so interrupts a galvanic
circuit. Hither cylinder or pen are at the same time slowly moving
lengthwise, so that the line formed is a long spiral, which is thus
graduated into spaces corresponding to seconds of time, and described
with uniform velocity. When any instant of time is to be recorded,
the observer strikes a finger-key, which also breaks the galvanic
circit and causes a similar mark to be made on the record, the position
of which, in reference to the adjacent seconds marks, can be read off
with great precision. In the chronographs employed in the Coast
Survey a second is generally represented by from one-half to three-
quarters of an inch, the cylinder being regulated so as to make one
revolution in half a minute.

‘« By an ingenious arrangement in the clock the break for every sixty
seconds or minute is omitted, and every five minutes two breaks are
omitted. By this means a whole sheet may be read off without any
other note than the time of beginning and ending.

““The method of determining longitudes by means of the electric
telegraph is substantially and in brief as follows: A transit instru-
ment, astronomical clock, and chronograph are mounted at each
station. Atter suitable observations for instrumental corrections at
each station, which are recorded.only at the place of observation, the
clock at the eastern station is first put in connexion with the circul
so as to write on the chronographs at both stations.

* The preceding account of the details of the operations of the Coast Survey has been
furnished by Professor Trowbridge, and what follows is copied from the report of a com-
mittee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
ON ASTRONOMY. 101

<¢ A number of stars, culminating near the zenith of the two stations,
are selected by the observers. As they appear first upon the eastern
meridian their transit is recorded by the observer striking the finger-
key upon the chronographic registers at both stations. After an
interval of time equivalent to the difference of longitude between the
two places, which is measured by the clock, the same stars appear on
the western meridian, and the observer at that station records this
transit precisely as the other had done, and the difference of the two
records of time is the measure of the difference of longitude.

‘<Tt will be observed that these records have been obtained at both
stations, and a little reflection will show that if there be any sensible
interval of time consumed in the transmission of signals, the differ-
ence of longitude obtained from the record at the eastern station will
be too great by that interval, and that at the western station will be
too small by the same amount. The mean result will give the longi-
tude free from this error, and the difference of measure the time of
transmission of the signals through the whole circuit.

‘‘Ten stars are generally exchanged with the eastern clock in the
circuit, and, after the first five, the transit instrument is reversed so
as to eliminate any residual error in the correction for collimation.
The western clock is next put on and the same operation repeated
with ten other zenith stars. Not only is the result improved by the
accumulation of individual results, but the advantage is gained that
the interval is measured by another clock, and the time of transmis-
sion eliminated in the inverse order of effects. The transits of the
stars are generally recorded over fifteen wires. After the exchange
of signals by the second clock is completed, local observations for
instrumental corrections are again made, which conclude the night's
work. ‘These operations are repeated on, at least, three different
nights, after which the observers and instruments exchange places, so
as to eliminate the possible errors arising from causes connected with
their individual peculiarities.

*« By the perfect and admirable method just sketched we are able to
measure arcs of longitude with the same degree of accuracy with which
arcs of latitude have heretofore been ascertained, and a new element
has thus been introduced into geodesy. Since the general introduc-
tion of the electric telegraph and the development of the American
method of longitudes it has been applied to many of the older Euro-
pean geodetic surveys ; and, in general, a very full acknowledgment
has been made of their indebtedness to American science by the emi-
nent geometers having charge of such works.

“<Tt was one of the earliest discoveries resulting from the telegraphic
determinations of longitude that the time transmission of signals
between stations several hundred miles apart is quite sensible, and
that it appears, in a great degree, to depend on the distance. On the
telegraph lines used in this country, where large iron wire is employed,
and the circuit is completed through. the earth, the rate of transmis-
sion has been found to be from 11,000 to 20,000 miles per second.
Whether this actually was the velocity of the galvanic current, or
whether it rather measures the time during which the current must
102 | LECIURES

be established in order to produce the effects that we observe, is for the
present an unsolved question.

‘“The telegraphic determinations of longitude have been extended
from Washington northward to Philadelphia, New York, Cambridge,
Bangor, and Halifax, and southward to Petersburg, Wilmington,
Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, and New Orleans. \

“¢ Great credit is due to the public spirit of the telegraph companies,
who have extended every facility to the operations of the Coast Survey,
and have given the use of the line after working hours free of charge.

‘In sections of the coast to which the telegraph has not yet pene-
trated, such as Florida, Texas, and the Pacific coast, the longitudes of
cardinal points are determined by observations of moon culminations
and by chronometer.

“¢ Corresponding observations of moon culminationsare made at several
American observatories, at the expense of the Coast Survey ; and most
valuable aid is derived from the series of meridian observations of the
moon made at Greenwich, which are always most promptly obtained
through the kindness of the astronomer-royal. The manner in which
the reductions are made to keep pace with the observations at the
latter observatory is admirable, and worthy of general imitation.

‘<The chronometric determination of longitude between Savannah
and Fernandina, in Florida, the details of which have been communi-
cated tothe American Association at the Montreal meeting, may serve,
in plan of execution and mode of discussion, as a model for operations
of a similar character.

“<The triangulation of the eastern States will furnish a measurement
of one arc of meridian of over three degrees in length between the
island of Nantucket and Mount Blue, in Maine; another of equal ex-
tent along the Chesapeake Bay and southward ; and, by the admirable
method of determining differences of longitude by the electric tele-
graph an arc of aan of latitude embracing over ten degrees of lon-
gitude, may be measured along the Gulf of Mexico.’’

These measurements cannot fail to be of great importance in estab-
lishing correct values for the elements of the earth’s dimensions, and
the result will be one of those valuable contributions to science which
attend the thorough prosecution of works of this character.

The results of all the measurements in different parts of the earth
indicate a lengthening of the degrees as we go towards the pole ;
but there are many discrepancies, some, no doubt, the result of
the imperfection of instruments and the unavoidable error of observa-
tion. But there are still others which are not probably traceable to
these sources. They clearly show that the earth is flattened at the
poles, but they also show it has irregularities of figure which are not
yet fully explained. If we take the mean results of all the best mea-
surements, we have for the length of a degree at the equator 68.7
miles, nearly 362,626 feet; at the arctic circle, 66° 20’, 69.4 miles,
nearly 365,744 feet; difference 3,118 feet.

15. With the measured length of the degrees it is easy to obtain
the exact figure of the earth.

Thus, fig. 5, if A B is a measured arc of one degree near the pole,
ON ASTRONOMY. 103

the plumb-line at the two extremities will not meet at O, the centre
of the earth, but at C, some distance below. We may now suppose
A B to be an arc of one degree upon the circle whose radius is A OC,
That being supposed, we shall readily know the whole circumference,
which is 360 times A B; and knowing the circumference we can
readily find the radius, A C, which is known as the radii of curvature.
And by this is meant that the arc A B will coincide with a circle
drawn round C as acentre, and A C as a radius, more nearly than
with any other circle which can be drawn.

Assuming the meridian curve to be an eclipse with two radii of
curvature, we can compute the two semi-axes of the figure N O and
OE. The ratio of these two, the polar and equatorial radii, gives the
oblateness or ellipticity.

Professor Airy, some years ago, selected thirteen of the most reliable
arcs, and from the combinations, two and two, deduced the probable
value of the polar and equatorial diameters, as follows:

Polar diameter in miles...... eee 7899.17  Radii 3949.58
Equatorial diameter in miles.............06. . 7925.65 ‘6 3962.82

Difference...... Mobs Bat Ree RRA Lae

More recently, Bessel, selecting eleven arcs, some of them the saine
and others different from those of Airy, by widely different methods
computed the values, as follows:

Polar diameter in miles.........ccesscccesscces 7899.11 Radii 3949.55
Equatorial diameter in miles........... siaieaisnd he 20:00 «¢ 3962.80
Difference......... Ss wats aide wdinta tases nicks 13.25

It is not a little remarkable that results based upon different mea-
surements and computed by different methods, and in both cases, as
Sir John Hershel remarks, ‘‘ the mass of figures to be gone through
with being enormous,’’—I say it is most remarkable that the differ-
ence in the length of the earth’s radius, as determined in the two
cases, should be less than the ;25 part of a mile. Any residual
error which may affect these results must be extremely small.

We then have for the figure of the earth a spheroid flattened at the
poles to such an extent that the polar radius is 13} miles shorter than
the equatorial. This difference divided by the equatorial radius gives
the oblateness or ellipticity. It comes very near to 345, more exactly
zoy.r- This variation from perfect sphericity in a 20-inch globe could
scarcely be detected by the most accurate eye, and yet this oblateness
of the earth enters as an essential element into many of the most
important and curious problems in astronomy. The equatorial cir-
cumference of the earth is 24,886 miles. It is proper to remark, in
104 LECTURES

conclusion, that there are so many discrepancies in the results of these
computations as to force upon astronomers the conviction that the
figure of the earth is not that of a spheroid of revolution. There
must be in different portions of the surface local depressions and eleva-
tions which are most probably due to unequal densities in the interior.
The surface, strictly speaking, is warped and irregular. But these
irregularities, though capable of being detected, are very small.

Such are the results of two centuries of arduous scientific labor
upon the figure and magnitude of the earth; labor in the field and
in the study, which has put in requisition the utmost skill of mechanic
arts, and exhausted the resources of mathematical analysis.

LAW OF GRAVITATION.

In my previous lecture I endeavored to explain the method of find-
ing the exact figure and magnitude of the earth.

1. I shall this evening call your attention to the law of gravitation.
This may be termed the great law of the material universe. There
is no single law of nature which reveals so much, none which controls
and determines so many physical conditions and events, none which
carries us so far into,the distant future, or conducts us back so far to
contemplate the past. This law determines alike the fall of a pebble,
the mighty swell of the ocean, and the vast sweep of the comet,
coursing its fiery track of a thousand years. It guides every planet
in its orbit round the central sun, and, in the midst of inevitable and
endless perturbations, ¢ cuarantees the final stability and harmony of
the system. In its immense range of applications it invites to the
sublimest contemplations of which the human mind is capable.

2. The law of gravity may be stated as follows, viz: every particle
of matter altracts every other particle by a force proportional to the
mass, and inversely as the square of the distance.
ON ASTRONOMY. 105

Each separate body in the system attracts every other body by the
same law. ‘The earth, for instance, has a fixed mass; it attracts the
moon and the sun, and each of the planets, by a force proportional to
its mass, and inversely as the squares of their respective distances.
To illustrate this law, as it applies to the solar system, let S in
fig. 6 represent the sun.

Suppose the planets placed at their relative distances, the earth’s
distance being unity, then the figures in the upper part of the dia-
gram wil] represent the relative distances of the other planets, viz:
Mars 1.5, Ceres, as the mean of the asteroids, 2.8, Jupiter 5.2,
Saturn 9.5, Uranus 19.1, and Neptune 30. The force of the solar at-
traction upon them will then be represented by the figures on the
lower part of the diagram, which are inversely as the squares of the
distances. The attraction on the earth being 1, on Mars it will be 55,
on Ceres ==, on Jupiter ,1;, on Saturn ';, on Uranus 3}+5, and on
Neptune ,},. If their orbitual motions were stopped, the earth would
move toward the sun 900 times as fast as Neptune.

This enables us to form a true conception of what this law is. Of
the nature of gravity itself we know nothing. We give the name of
law to the effects which it produces. Everything connected with the
history and progress of so grand a principle in nature must awaken a
special interest. Any law or principle which enables the astronomer
to determine, not with uncertainty and vague conjecture, but with the
utmost precision, the relative position of the heavenly bodies for ages
past and for ages to come, challenges our admiration. The astrono-
mer turns his telescope to the heavens and watches the progress of the
stars as they enter and cross his field of view, and marks the hour,
minute, and second when one of them disappears for an instant behind a
spider’s web which is stretched across his field of view. Suppose the_
telescope to stand unmolested, it is not difficult to predict the hour,
minute, and second when the same star will disappear behind the
same spider line after the lapse of a hundred years. The earth will,
in the mean time, have made a hundred revolutions around her orbit
of nearly 600,000,000 of miles, but the force of gravity will have kept
her in her appointed track. She pursues her elliptic course without
weariness or change.

3. But let us glance at the history of the discovery of this great law.
Speculations upon the causes of the heavenly motions were probably
coeval with the observations which served to make them known.
Many of these speculations which have come down to us are charac-
terized by great crudeness, but they all show the perpetual tendency
of the human mind to ascend from phenomena to their causes.

The earlier Greek astronomers introduced a system of crystalline
transparent spheres, revolving one within another, and carrying the
planets with them round the earth as acentre. Far beyond these
crystalline planetary spheres was the ‘“‘ primum mobile,” the starry
sphere, revolving trom east to west in twenty-four hours. This system
was incorporated into the philosophy of Aristotle, and seems to have
commanded the assent of mankind for many ages. Its truth was
hardly drawn into doubt till the revival or commencement of true
106 LECTURES

astronomical science in the seventeenth century. And even then the
clearest and strongest intellects were slow in extricating themselves
from the trammels of the Aristotelian philosophy.

It was not until the time of Kepler that any real progress was
made in discovering the true laws of planetary motion. He discarded
all dependence upon authority. His views were independent and
bold, but in many respects extremely defective and often whimsical.
Yet his labors will ever be regarded as forming a brilliant epoch in
the history of astronomy.

It is true that Copernicus had established the true system of the
world, which fixes the sun in the centre; Galileo had demonstrated
the laws of motion, in falling bodies, and laid the foundation of
dynamical science; Tycho Brahé had, for a quarter of a century, most
diligently watched and recorded the motions of the heavenly bodies.
But neither of these illustrious astronomers had ventured any hypo-
thesis for explaining the cause of those motions.

By the laborious comparison of the observations of Tycho, Kepler
discovered the three laws of planetary motion which bear his name,
and which constitute the ground work of physical astronomy. They
are familiar to every student. The first is, that the planets revolve in
elliptical orbits ; the second, that the radius-vector, or the line drawn
Jrom the sun to the planet, describes equal areas in equal times, in what-
ever part of the orbit it is located ; the third, that the squares of the
periodic times are proportional to the cubes of the mean distances. This
third law may justly be regarded as one of the grandest inductions in
the whole range of physical science. But Kepler was still far from
having any just conception of the true physical cause of these motions.

He rejected the crystalline spheres of the Greeks and located in the
sun a kind of central virtue, by which the planetary motions were
maintained. But this force or virtue, for he uses both terms, must
have the effect, as he perceived, not of drawing bodies directly toward
the sun, but of moving them across or athwart this line of direction.
It must, in some way, carry bodies round the sun.

In order to render this idea plausible he was obliged to introduce a
whirling fluid which bore the planets round in the same manner that
a running stream carries a boat. This was substantially the same
hypothesis which, nearly half a century later, was propounded by
Des Cartes, and was known as his celebrated system of vortices.

But, in addition to his other agencies, Kepler gravely believed and
taught that each planet was animated by a spirit which held to the
matter of the planet a relation analogous to that which the mind of
man holds to his body. This great animal spirit acted an important
part in giving to the planet the right direction.

Nor can we be much surprised at this fancy when we find even the
great Newton gravely recording his suspicion, as he does in his Prin-
cipia, that ‘‘ the spirit which constitutes the most subtile and best
portion of our atmosphere, and which is necessary to all life, is derived
from comets.”’ .

But, unsuccessful as Kepler was in discovering the true physical
cause of the planetary motions—the law which was underlying his

ON ASTRONOMY. LO

laws—he gave a great impulse to the spirit of inquiry. The energies
of all the ablest mathematicians and astronomers of the age were con-
centrated upon this problem.

In the mean time other branches of science were throwing light
upon this. Gilbert, of England, had investigated the laws of mag-
netism, and in 1600 had published a work, remarkable for that period,
on the magnet. This work was known to Galileo and Kepler, and
was much esteemed by them. The attraction between two magnets
suggested the idea that some analogous force might exist between
other bodies. Gilbert explained the influence of the earth upon the
moon by regarding the earth as a great loadstone. In like manner,
he supposed the moon to have a reciprocal action upon the earth,
not only upon the matter of the earth but upon ‘‘certain subterra-
nean humors and spirits’? which are drawn out and modified by the
moon’s action. Galileo and Kepler, as Grant says, both professed
themselves to be much indebted to the views contained in Gilbert’s
work upon the magnet.

Kepler fully adopted the principle of some sort of attraction, but
how that force acted in maintaining the orbits he did not comprehend.
His great work on astronomy, the ‘‘Astronomia Nova,’’ was published
in 1609. In this work he maintains that some sort of attraction
exists between all the planets of the system, and that the planetary
motions are maintained by some sort of influence emanating from the
sun. He seemed to be constantly impressed with the idea that a cen-
tripetal force alone would not keep a planet in motion. It must have
some force either pulling it or pushing along in its course. And hence
he was obliged, on this hypothesis, to make the sun-force propel a
planet in a direction perpendicular to the radius-vector. '

We may judge how slow was the progress of true ideas upon this
subject from the fact that the law of gravitation was not discovered
till considerably more than half a century after the publication of
Kepler’s work, before mentioned.

In the mean while the law of planetary attraction engaged the
attention of Galileo, of Borelli, of Boulliau, of Des Cartes, Cassini,
Huyghens, Hooke, Halley, Sir Christopher Wren, and finally of
Newton. Among these Christian Huyghens, by common consent, is
second only to the illustrious Newton. Huyghens, who preceded
Newton bya few years published a very remarkable work in 1671 on
the pendulum. In this work, entitled ‘‘ De Horologio Oscillatorio,’’
he inserts several important theorems respecting the motion of a
heavenly body, which is constantly drawn to a fixed centre. Borelli,
of Pisa, had, a few years before, (1666,) published a work in which
he quite accurately describes the action of centrifugal and centripetal
forces, and shows that they would together cause a body to revolve in
a circular orbit.

At this time, 1665, when Newton’s attention was first drawn to the
subject, it had become a common opinion, though by no means a uni-
versal one, that the planets were retained in their orbits by a force
residing in the sun. And the great point at issue now was to deter-
miine what kind of an orbit it would produce, and how it varied with
the distance ; whether it was inversely as the distance, or inversely as
108 LECTURES

the square of the distance, or whether it varied in some more compli-
cated ratio of the distance.

Bouilliau,* a French astronomer, cotemporary with Newton, though
older, is said to have been the first to suggest the inverse ratio
of the square of the distance as the law of variation, which he did in
1645. Kepler maintained the opinion that the variation was inversely
as the distance simply. Hooke made the announcement that he had
demonstrated the law to be as the square inversely, but declined show-
ing his demonstration, and it finally appeared that he never had one.
It, indeed, seemed to be the prevailing opinion that the force must vary
inversely as the square of the distance. Wren concurred in this
opinion, but he could give no proof. Halley was in the same predica-
ment. They had both made the question a subject of special study.
Huyghens had once adopted this view of the question, but failing to
find any satisfactory proof had rejected it. Such was the state of the
problem when Newton entered upon its investigation. The progress
and result of his inquiries will always possess a singular interest in
tue history of astronomy.

It was in the summer of 1665, when the breaking out of the plague
in Cambridge had forced Newton to leave the place, that he retired
to his native village of Woolsthorpe. Witnessing the fall of an
apple, as the story is usually told and sanctioned by Brewster,
he conceived the idea that this same terrestrial gravity which caused
the apple to fall, and which certainly extended to the highest attain-
able elevations, might extend even to the moon, and be the force
which retained her in her orbit. To produce this effect there must
be a certain determinate force directed towards the earth, acting
constantly upon the moon, and deflecting her from a right line into
the curve which forms the orbit. With the distance of the moon and
the velocity of revolution this force could easily be computed. It only
remained to see whether the terrestrial gravity at that distance was
sufficient to produce precisely that effect.

The principle upon which this conclusion rests will be readily
understood by reference to figure 7.
Let E be the earth, M B a portion
of the moon’s orbit, and suppose
that M B is so small a portion as to
be passed over by the moon in one
minute of time. It was a well es-
tablished principlein mechanics that
any body moving in a curved line
tends to recede from the centre, and
if not constantly restrained by some
force, to move in a straight line tan-
gent to the curve. Thus if the at-
traction of the earth should be sus-

E pended at the instant the moon
reached the point, she would move
in the straight line M O and not in the curved line M B. Now, if we

* Written also Bouilland and Boulliand, born 1605, died 1694.
ON ASTRONOMY. 109

suppose the velocity of the moon to be such as to carry it from M to
O in-one minute, how large a force directed towards the earth would
be necessary to make it move in the arc M B? If we construct a par-
allelogram having M O for oneside, M A for another, and M B (con-
sidered as a straight line) for its diagonal, then M A must be the
measure of the force necessary to keep the moon in her orbit. But
this line M A is the versed sine of the are M B. Hence we know, and
this was Newton’s mode of investigation, that the force, whatever it
is, which retains the moon in her orbit must he directed to the earth,
and must be such as to cause a body to fall through the versed sine
of any small arc in the same time that the body is actually occupied
in describing that arc. Now, the distance of the moon being known,
as it was proximately, and the time of revolution being also known,
it was easy to compute the length of the arc passed over in any small
portion of time and also its versed sine. Hence the distance M A
becomes a known distance. A body at the earth’s surface falls through
a known distance inone minute, Call this distance / and let R be the
radius of the earth, and D the distance of the moon, and x the distance
through which the earth’s attraction would cause a body to fall if
placed at the moon, then we should have D?: R?::h: x. ‘To answer
the required purpose, x must equal M A. This was Newton’s course
of reasoning.

Taking the measure of a degree on the meridian to be 60 miles,
as determined by Fernel, and then generally adopted, he deduced the
earth’s radius, and then found, by making the calculation, that the
attraction of the earth at the distance of the moon was insufficient
to produce the required effect. It equally failed whether it was supposed
to vary inversely as the distance simply, or as the square of the
distance. And the difference was too great to be attributed to any
error in the calculation, or in the moon’s motion.

In the spirit of true philosophy he rejected the hypothesis which
was insufficient to account for the facts. And, singular as if may
appear, he seems, from anything now known of his labors, to have
dropped the investigation for nearly twenty years.

The measurement of arc of the meridian, in France, by Picard, which
gave a more correct measure of the earth’s radius, recalled his atten-
tion to the subject. And repeating his calculation with this corrected
measure, he had the satisfaction of finding that with the inverse ratio,
the square, the intensity of the terrestrial gravity was almost pre-
cisely that which was required in order to keep the moon in her orbit.
This was the ‘‘experimentum crucis.’’ The great law of nature was
established.

We now know that the mean distance of the moon is very nearly
60 times the earth’sradius. The terrestrial gravity varying according
to this law, it will at that distance be 35,5 part of waat it is at the
earth’s surface. Hence a body at the moon will fall through the same
distance (16.1 feet) in one minute, that it will fall at the earth’s surface
in one second. And this is almost precisely the versed sine of the
arc for one minute described by the moon’s mean motion.

A like test was applied to the planets as influenced by the attraction
of the sun, and the same law was found to obtain.
110 LECTURES

The final verification of the law of gravity is, that it predicts the
disturbing effects which one body must have upon another.

With this law in his hand the astronomer in his study has pre-
dicted inequalities in the planetary motions which no observer had
detected, and many which, though real, were too small to be detected
till they were pointed out and made the subject of special observation.

The attention of Newton was particularly called to the law of gravi-
tation in 1665. The Principia, in which his discoveries were given
to the world, was not published till 1687. The doctrines which he
announced were slow in winning their way to scientific favor. Out of
England, for a period of nearly forty years, they were either not known
or were known only to be rejected. The theory of vortices, as promul-
gated by Des Cartes, had obtained great popularity on the continent,
and was adopted by most of the eminent continental astronomers of
the age. ;

Huyghens adopted the Newtonian doctrines only in part. Leibnitz
and John Bernouilli were conspicuous in opposition to them. Cassini
and Miraldi, to the end of their lives, were borne along by the vortices
of Des Cartes. ‘‘On the continent,’’ says Grant, ‘‘all the great
mathematicians were unanimous in their hostility to the Newtonian
theory.’’ At length, in 1732, forty-five years after the publication of
the Principia, and five after the death of Newton, Maupertuis, of
the French Academy, was the first to adopt and defend the doctrines
of the Principia. But the writer who did most to commend the New-
tonian theory to favor in France was, probably, Voltaire, who, in
1738, published a brief, popular exposition of Newton’s work, which
was widely circulated and did much to conciliate the favor of the
learned to the views of the great English philosopher. But if the
French astronomers in the first instance sinned against true science
in rejecting the doctrine of Newton, the labors of Clairault and La
Place have made ample atonement for it since. The theory of Newton
is universally received ; the vortices of Des Cartes survive only as a
memorable example of scientific error.

Having given a sketch of the history of the law of gravitation, I
must content myself with adverting to two or three illustrations.

1. What kind of a curve may a heavenly body describe, under the
action of this law?

Newton showed that the curve might be a circle, an ellipse, a par-
abola, or a hyperbola, being the four curves made by the section of a
cone, and it could not revolve in any other. Thus, in figure 8 let S
represent the place of the sun, and let A represent any body placed
at any given distance, as at A. Now suppose it receives an impulse in
a direction perpendicular to the radius-vector 8 A, the form of the
orbit which it will describe will depend upon the intensity of this
impulse. Any impulse in that direction will produce a centrifugal
force. If this centrifugal force is exactly equal to the centripetal force
of the sun, the body will describe a circle, A C, about S as a centre;
if it receives a less impulse it will describe an ellipse, as A E, of which
A is the aphelion and S the remoter focus; if it receives a greater
impulse it will still describe an ellipse, as A H, of which A is the peri-
ON ASTRONOMY. 111

helion and S the nearer focus. If we now suppose the impulse to
grow stronger and stronger, the ellipse will become more and more
elongated, the aphelion E receding farther and farther, until the curve
changes into a parabola, aud the two branches never meet. The par-
ticular impulsive velocity necessary to produce a parabola is that
which a body would acquire under the action of the sun in falling
from an infinite distance. This velocity would not be infinite. The

i

velocity due to an infinite distance is finite, and hence might be in-
creased. Any increase of that velocity would cause the body to move
in a hyperbola, as A H. One impulsive velocity only will produce a
circle, one only a parabola; an infinite number an ellipse, an infinite
number a hyperbola. Hence the antecedent probability of a truly
circular or parabolic orbit is only as one to millions, while the proba-
bility of an elliptical or hyperbolic orbit is as millions to one. And
this accords with the facts of astronomy, so far as they are known.

2. The secular acceleration of the moon’s mean motion in longitude.

By the comparison of some ancient eclipses with their computed
times, Halley, as early as 1693, suspected an acceleration in the
moon’s mean motion, but the question was not fully investigated till
half a century later, when more accurate calculation placed the fact
beyond all doubt. In 1749 Dunthorne presented to the Royal Society
of London an elaborate paper upon the subject, in which he deter-
mined the acceleration to be ten seconds in a hundred years, reckoned
from 1700; that is, the mean motion being taken, the moon arrives at
the meridian of any fixed star ten seconds sooner, at the close of a
century, than she would if her mean motion had continued the same
as it was at the beginning of it. And, as a consequence of this, she |
would come to the meridian of any particular place ten seconds later
than she otherwise would. The recent profound researches of Hansen,
of Seeberg, upon the lunar irregularities have led him to adopt 13
seconds as the secular acceleration. ‘‘The moon,” says Grant in his
excellent History of Physical Astronomy, ‘‘is about two hours later
HZ LECTURES

in coming to the meridian than she would have been if she had re-
tained the same mean motion as she had in the time of the earliest
Chaldean observations.’’ If we adopt the new coefficient of Hansen,
13”, it will increase the difference by about half an hour. Hence, in
assigning the moon’s place in any remote period in the past by the
use of the modern tables, the assigned place will be less advanced in
longitude than the actual place. The accurate determination of this
coefficient of acceleration is of the utmost importance in verifying the
ancient eclipses.

The cause of this acceleration for a long time bafiled the severest
scrutiny. The French Academy offered its astronomical prize of 1770,
1772, and 1774, for an investigation which should have for its object
to show whether it could be produced by the law of gravitation. The
first prize was taken by Euler, the second was shared by Euler and
Legrange, the third was awarded to Legrange alone. Both of these
eminent mathematicians concurred in the conclusion that it could not
be produced by the action of gravity. The language of Euler in the
memoir which bore off the prize is very explicit, as follows: ‘‘There
is not one of the equations about which any uncertainty prevails, and
now it appears to be established by indisputable evidence that the
secular inequality in the moon’s mean motion cannot be produced by
the forces of gravitation.’’ The failure of Euler and Legrange in at-
tempting to trace this inequality to the effect of gravity, and the
great weight of their authority, may have deterred others from re-
peating the investigation, and turned their attention to some other
quarter for a solution.

Newton was inclined to refer it to the resistance of the medium in
which the moon moved, and his conclusion—the only one, indeed,
which his premises permitted—was, that the moon was winding in
toward the earth, and must ultimately fall upon it.

But the profound analysis of Laplace, in 1787, revealed what had
escaped the sagacity of Newton and Legrange. He traced it to a very
slow and almost imperceptible change in the form of the earth’s orbit,
technically called the secular diminution of the eccentricity of the
earth’s orbit.

The general manner in which this inequality is produced is not
difficult to be understood. One of the consequences of gravity deduced
by Newton was, that the disturbing force of the sun’s attraction upon
the moon had the effect to diminish the gravity of the moon to the
earth by about 1, part of it. If the earth and moon were removed
to a greater distance from the sun the consequence would be that the
moon would be drawn down nearer to the earth, and would make her
revolution in a shorter time, because, with an unchanged actual
velocity, she would revolve in a smaller orbit. Now, this is precisely
the effect of the diminution of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit.
Thus, in fig. 9, let A C B D represent the earth’s orbit, S the
place of the sun, A B the major axis, and C D the minor. The form
of the orbit has been for many ages undergoing a gradual change,
almost imperceptible, but still continuous. ‘This change is due to the
disturbing action of the planets upon the earth, and is one of those
ON ASTRONOMY. 113

periodic inequalities which stretches
over an immense cycle of ages. The
nature of this change will be readily
seen by a reference to fig. 9. AB,
the major axis, remains always the
same, while C D, the minor axis,
increases in length, and the sun
comes nearer to the centre. If we
suppose the full line, A C B D, to
represent the orbit as it was some
ages back, the broken line, AG BF,
will represent it now. The earth
and moon, by being carried into
a wider curve, are less affected by
the disturbing force of the sun. The earth’s power upon the moon
becomes relatively increased, and hence, as before stated, the gradual
acceleration.

The eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is now about 0.0168; that is,
the distance from the centre to one of the foci is +468, part of the mean
radius. lLeverrier, in a remarkable memoir upon the secular varia-
tions of the orbits of the seven principal planets, has shown that the
eccentricity of the earth’s orbit will continue to diminish for about
24,000 years, when it will be reduced to 0.0033, or about + of its
present value. It will then begin to increase, and will go on in-
creasing for many thousands of years. The moon will then begin to
wind oud instead of winding in, and will enter upon her appointed but
immense cycle of secular retardation. The anticipated catastrophy of
a collision between the earth and moon will be happily prevented.

3. I select as a third illustration the discovery of the planet Nep-
tune. This will ever be regarded as one of the grandest achievements
of science.

The planet Uranus was discovered by the elder Hersch 1 in 1781.
On searching the records of previous observers it was found that the
planet had been observed and its place recorded nineteen times before
it was suspected to be a planet. By this means it was possible to
determine the orbit and construct tables much sooner than could other-
wise have been done. The French Academy made its orbit the subject
of a prize in 1790. Delambre was the successful competitor. He
subsequently computed tables of this planet. It was pretty soon
found that Delambre’s tables did not well represent the observed
places of the planet. These inequalities were so great that new tables
were computed by Bourvard in 1821. But these, again, in a few
years, were found to be nearly as defective as Delambre’s, and required
correcting. from 1795 to 1822 the observed longitude was in advance
of the computed. The planet then fell back till 1830 and 1831, when
the observed and computed longitudes agreed. The observed place
then rapidly fell behind the computed place. The error of the tables
in giving the geocentric place, in 1835, was 30”; in 1838, 50”; in
1841, 70’. The attempt further to correct the elements as given by

8

114 LECTURES

the tables soon revealed the fact that no orbit could be assigned which
would harmonize the observations. Bourvard himself was the first to
suggest that the motion of Uranus might be disturbed by an unknown
planet outside of it. This soon became the prevailing impression
among astronomers. So confident had astronomers become of its
existence that just two weeks before its discovery Sir John Herschel,
in addressing the British Association at Southampton, (September
10, 1846,) says, ‘‘its movements have been felt trembling along the
far-reaching line of our analysis with a certainty hardly inferior to
occular demonstration.”’

Supposing such a planet to exist, the problem of determining its po-
sition was one of extreme difficulty, yielding only to the very highest
powers of mathematical analysis. It would seem that but few astrono-
mers in Europe had the hardihood to engage in the enterprise. The
illustrious Bessel had it in contemplation, but death removed him too
soon from the scene of his labors and left the task to other hands.

The problem, as is well known, was oslved, separately and almost
simultaneously, by two youthful astronomers, Adams and Leverrier,
“nar nobile fratrum.’’ Leverrier was the first to announce his result.
He wrote to his friend Dr. Gallé, of Berlin, assigning the place of
the new planet. ‘‘Turn your telescope,’’ said he, ‘‘to that point,
and there you will see it.’” The letter was received in Berlin on the
23d of September, 1846. On the same evening Dr. Gallé turned his
telescope to the point designated by Leverrier, and both he and the
veteran Enké saw a star of the eighth magnitude in a position where
no star was laid down in Dr. Brenicker’s chart, then recently pub-
lished by the Berlin Academy. It was the veritable planet which
had so long had a finger in disturbing the good order of Uranus,
The heliocentric longitude of the new planet, as fixed by Leverrier,
was 326° 0’. That assigned by Adams, without any knowledge of
Leverrier’s work, was 329° 19’. The same, deduced from Dr. Gallé’s
observation, was 326° 52’, being within a single degree of the place
assigned it by the computation of Leverrier. Never had science a
prouder triumph than was achieved on that memorable night.

On examining the record of Lalande, it was found that he had
twice observed this planet as a star, viz: on the 8th and 10th of May,
1795. Imay remark, in closing, that the first computation of the orbit
of Neptune was by an eminent American astronomer, the late Sears C.
Walker, and that Professor Pierce, of Harvard University, solved the
inverse problem, namely, that of deducing from the data the pertur-
bations which Neptune ought to produce on the planet Uranus.*

SOLAR PARALLAX AND PLANETARY DISTANCES.

In the two preceding lectures I have considered the jigure and mag-
nitude of the earth and the law of gravitation. I shall this evening
call your attention to the method of determining the solar parallax
and planetary distances.

One of the first wants of astronomy was, to ascertain the distances
of the moon, sun, and planets from the earth. It was long, however,
before any considerable progress was made in the solution of this
important problem. The first and indispensable requisite for solving

* Smithonian Report for 1853,epage 161.
ON ASTRONOMY. 115

it, viz: the size of the earth, was wanting. The instrumental means
known to the ancients were insufficient to furnish the elements of the
calculation. .

Aristarchus, of Samos, in the third century before the Christian era,
instituted observations for the purpose of determining the relative
distances of the sun and moon from the earth. He wrote a treatise
upon the subject which has come down to modern times. His method
was to observe the angular distance of the moon from the sun at the
time when the moon appeared just half illuminated. This method, as
a preliminary one, is ingenious, and worthy of a passing notice.
Thus, in figure 10,

iT
= It 910

—_!

when the one-half of the moon is illuminated, the angle E M8 will
be a right angle. If the angle M E §S is accurately measured, the
angle at S will be known, and we shall have this proportion:

EM: ES:: sin. ESM: sin. EMS — 1.

This was the substance of Aristarchus’ method. The lines of the
angles are known, and this makes known the relative distances of the
sun and moon.

The measurements of Aristarchus must have been very inaccurate.
He concluded that the sun was nineteen times more distant than the
moon. We now know the sun to be about four hundred times more
distant than the moon, which shows how extremely wide of the truth
this ancient determination was; and yet Ptolemy, four centuries later,
adopted the determination of Aristarchus, and, combining it with
observations of his own, or more probably those of Hipparchus, com-
puted the sun’s parallax to be three minutes, which is more than
twenty times its true value. The parallax of three minutes would place
the sun at only one-twentieth of its real distance. This conclusion of
the great Alexandrian astronomer appears to have been adopted down
to the time of Kepler, including Copernicus and Tycho Brahé. Kep-
ler’s researches on the orbit of Mars led him to conclude that the
sun was at least ¢hree times more remote than Ptolemy had supposed.

But it is time to explain the method by which modern astronomers
have determined the distances of the planetary bodies within narrow
limits of error. And here it may be remarked that the relative dis-
tances of the planets from the sun were quite accurately known long
116 LECTURES

before any absolute distance was determined. The periodic time of the
several planets was very easily and very early known. And Kepler’s
Third Law at once determined all the relative distances. Taking the
earth’s distance from the sun as the unit of measure, we readily obtain
all the others in terms of this by the following proportion :

P?: p?2:: 1: d*; in which P represents the periodic time of the
earth, p that of the planet, and d the distance of the planet, which
is the only unknown term.

The radius of the earth being known, the absolute distance of a
body is determined by its parallax. This depends upon the solution
of a plain triangle, and, in point of principle, the problem is precisely
the same as that of determining the distance across a river by means
of measurements made on one of its banks. Thus, in fig. 11,

*\
Z oe
eB

if we suppose E to be the earth, M’ the moon in the horizon as seen
from the station O, then O M’ E will be the horizontal parallax.
Now, if this parallax is known, which is simply the semi-diameter of
the earth seen from the moon, then knowing E O the radius of the
earth, and the right. angle E O M’, we have in the triangle EH O Mall
the angles and one side to find E M’ the distance of the moon, which
is done by the proportion :

Sin. E MO: radius:: EO: E M’, in which the first three terms
are known.

Again: Suppose the moon to be at M, let O and O’ be two stations
in the same meridian, whose latitudes are known, which makes known
the angle at the centre O EO’. The object is to find the distance
EM. To do this, we want the observed zenith distances ZO M and
Z! O'M, which will make known their supplements EH O M and E O!
M ; then in the quadrilateral figure H O M O’, having already three
of the angles, we can easily obtain the fourth O M O’, by subtracting
the sum of the three, which are known, from four right angles. With
all the angles and the two sides EK O and E O’ it isa simple trigno-
metrical problem to compute the distance E M. The radii of the
earth being known, the only error in the result will depend upon the
determination of the latitudes and the zenith distances. But, with
the instrumental means now at command, these errors are extremely
small. The angle O M O! may also be determined by observed distances
ON ASTRONOMY. 117

of the moon from some star in the vicinity. This method is applicable
to the moon, to Venus in conjunction, and to Mars in opposition. We
shall again have occasion to refer to it. The strict mathematical
treatment of the subject is quite elementary, but, to avoid tedious-
ness, I shall omit further reference to it.

The moon’s mean distance from the earth is found, by measure-
ments of this kind, to be very nearly 240,000 miles. Herschel gives,
more exactly, 237,000.

But the great problem is, to determine the distance of the sun from
the earth. This, which gives the means of expressing the distance of
all the planets in miles, the British Astronomer Royal pronounces to
be the grandest problem in astronomy. It is solved by two different
methods. One is by observations on the planet Mars in opposition,
when it is, of course, nearest to the earth; or on the planet Venus
when in conjunction, and also nearest to the earth. The other is by
the transits of Venus across the sun’s disc,

I have already stated that the relative distances of all the planets
from the sun have been known, with considerable accuracy, since the
time of Kepler. It only remains to find the absolute distance of one,
and then, as the periodic times are known with great precision,
Kepler’s Third Law will furnish all the other distances.

The semi-diameter of the earth, seen from the sun, subtends an
angle of a little more than 83”, (8.6.) This is the sun’s horizontal
parallax. It reduces the earth, as seen from the sun, to less than
one-half of the apparent diameter of Jupiter, as seen from the earth.
To appreciate the delicacy of this problem, it must be borne in mind
that an error of one second of arc in the parallax involves an error
of about 12,000,000 of miles in the distance of the sun. Moreover,
one second of arc is an extremely small quantity. None but the most
perfect instruments can pretend to measure it directly. The ;j55
part of an inch, as any one will perceive, is an extremely small quan-
tity to deal with. But a circle must have nearly 18 feet radius in
order that 1’ may occupy the space of ,;';5 part of an inch. Kepler
found reason to reduce the solar parallax from 3’, as given by Ptolemy,
to 49”, which necessarily placed the sun at nearly four times the dis-
tance assigned by his great predecessor. And yet Kepler’s measure
was only one-sixth part of the true distance.

To settle this question, or at least with the hope of getting a nearer
approximation, the French Academy, in 1672, sent Richer to Cayenne,
in South America, to make observations on the parallax of Mars in
opposition, while Cassini made contemporaneous observations at Paris.
By computation based on these observations the sun’s parallax was
reduced to 9.5 as the probable value, which removed the sun to five
times the distance adopted by Kepler.

Flamsteed compared his own observations on Mars with those of
Richer, and deduced 10”. With the hope of obtaining still nearer
results, Halley visited the island of St. Helena to observe the transit
of the planet Mercury across the sun’s disc in 1677, October 28, but
the result was not satisfactory. He was inclined to adopt 15” as the
true value.

The celebrated astronomical expedition of La Caille to the Cape
of Good Hope, in 1750, had for one of its objects to observe the
118 LECTURES

planet Mars in opposition, contemporaneously with Cassini in Paris,
Wargentin in Stockholm, and others in the north of Europe. These
observations gave for the parallax of the sun 10”.4 nearly. The
parallax of Mars was about 25”.

The method by which the results were obtained will be understood

by a reference to figure 12. S on the left is the position of the sun,
E the earth, M Mars in opposition. The stations of Wargentin at
Stockholm and La Caille at the Cape of Good Hope were nearly on
the same meridian. Let them be represented by O and O’, their
latitudes being known. Then in the quadrilateral figure O E O! M,
the angle at His known by the latitudes; the angles at O and O’ are
known by the observed zenith distances ZO M and Z O’ M. These
three angles would make known the angle at M. But to avoid the
possible errors in determining the first three it is better to obtain
M by direct observation. Its value will serve as a test of the cor-
rectness of the other angles. This angle at M is most accurately
found by measuring the apparent distance, at each station, be-
tween Mars and some star near it which passes the meridian at
nearly the same time. At O this distance would be S O M; at O!
it would be 8S’ O! M. The angle at M is the difference between these
two. For, on account of the great distance of the star, O S and O! 8’
are parallel ; and thereforeS O M= O X O’; but this latter being
exterior to the triangle O’ X M, wehave X M O/= O X O’—X O'M ;
hence the angle at M is equal to the difference between the observed
distances of the star from Mars. The radii of the earth E O and EK O’
being known, it is easy to compute the distance H M, the distance of
Mars from theearth. It will now be very easy to find E'S, the distance
of the sun from the earth. From Kepler’s Third Law we know that the
relative distances of the earth and Mars from the sun are as 100: 152
nearly ; that is, if the earth’s distance were divided into 100 equal
parts the distance from the sun to Mars would be 152 of those parts,
and the distance from the earth to Mars in opposition would be 52 of
the same parts. But the foregoing process gives us the absolute value of
those 52 parts, and hence we can by asimple proportion find the value
of the 100 parts between the earth and sun. Let m = the number of
miles in EK M; then to find the number in ES, we have 52: 100::m:
ES; orks = ==

The observations of La Caille and Wargentin were made on the 6th
of October, 1751. They gave for the parallax of Mars 24.7, for that
of the sun 10.4, and for the distance of the sun a little more than
ON ASTRONOMY. 119

76,000,000 of miles. These results agreed pretty nearly with those
derived from the observations of Richer, Cassini, and Flamsteed, three-
quarters of a century earlier.

In 1760 Mayer, from analytical equations involved in the lunar
theory, deduced a value for the sun’s par. = 7.8.

But the transit of Venus was now near at hand, which alone could
satistactorily solve this great problem. Dr. Halley was the first to
perceive and urge the importance of the passage of Venus over the sun
tor this purpose. As early as 1716 he called the attention of astronomers
to the two transits which were to occur in 1761 and 1769, and most
earnestly urged them not to neglect so precious and so rare an oppor-
tunity of determining the planetary distances of the solar system. If
these opportunities were neglected the like would not again occur for
more than a century.

The transits of Venus invariably occur in June or December—those
at the ascending node in June, at the descending, in December. The
intervals between them are 8 years and 1053, then 8 and 1214, then 8
and 1054, and so on successively in that order.

The transit of 1639, December 4, was observed by Horrox and
Crabtree, two young men engaged in astronomical studies, in seclu-
sion, as Grant says, in one of the northern counties of England.
They, by good fortune, (for the time of the transit was not accurately
kaown,) had ‘‘the privilege of witnessing a phenomenon which human
eyes had never before beheld, and which no one was destined again to
see till more than a hundred years had passed away.’’

In anticipation of the transit of June 6, 1761, encouraged by the
earnest appeal of Dr. Halley, several European governments and
learned academies sent scientific commissions to different parts of
the earth to observe it. The English sent Dr. Maskelyne to St.
Helena, Mason and Dixon to the Cape of Good Hope. The French
Academy sent Pingré to the island of Rodrigues, in the Indian Ocean.
The Russians sent Chappe to Tobolsk, in Siberia, and Rumouski to a
station near Lake Baikal, on the Mongolian frontier. All the observa-
tories in Europe were put in requisition.

I shall here explain the method by which the sun’s parallax is de-
termined by the transit of Venus. At different stations on the earth
the planet will be seen to traverse the sun’s disc in different lines, and
will occupy unequal times. As the relative motions of Venus and the
sun are accurately known, the duration of the transit will show the
particular’ chord along which it passed. The two chords, as seen by
two observers favorably situated, being known, will make known the
perpendicular distance between them. This perpendicular distance is
then compared with the diameter of the earth or some known part of
that diameter, and at once gives the sun’s parallax. The peculiar
advantage of this method is, that the distance between the two ap-
parent chords traversed by the planet is more accurately known by
the difference of times than by any direct micrometrical measurement.
This process will be easily understood by reference to fig. 13, where
A B represents the earth, V Venus, and § the sun. For the most
successful result, the stations A and B should be at the extremities of
a diameter perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. At A Venus
will be seen to traverse the chord E n L, at B the chord Dm H.
120 LECTURES

Now, by observing the instant of the several contacts of the limb of
Venus with that of the sun, the exact time in which the centre of the
planet traverses the chord will be known. The mean diameter of the
sun is 32’ 3” nearly, or 1,923”. By the known angular velocities of

Kigl3 Pp

the two bodies the time of traversing the diameter becomes known.
Calling ¢ the computed time of traversing the diameter, ¢’ the ob-
served time of traversing the chord, we shall find the number of
seconds in the chord by the proportion ¢: ¢ : : 1,923”: the number of
seconds in thechord. By drawing radii from 8 to E and D we readily
find S 2 and 8 m from the right-angled triangles Sn E and S m D,
and hence n m the perpendicular distance between the chords; that is,
we shall know the number of seconds subtended by the line mn, as
seen from the earth. We can also compare mn with A B, they be-
ing parallel lines in the same plane perpendicular to the plane of the
ecliptic. Seen from V, these lines subtend the same angle. Their
relative lengths must, therefore, be as their distances. Butitis known
that vn: uv A:: 72: 28 nearly; hence, we have 72: 28::mn:AB.
But we have determined the number of seconds subtended by mn as
seen from the earth; this proportion, then, gives the number of
seconds subtended by A B, seen at the same distance; that is, as seen
from the sun. We then have the angular diameter of the earth as
seen from the sun. One-half of this is the long-sought element in
astronomy, the sun’s horizontal parallax. On account of the great
importance of this process, and the great interest which always at-
taches to the transit of this planet, I have ventured to give the details
which are necessary to appreciate the grounds upon which the result
rests. It is proper to remark, before leaving this point, that the two
stations A and B cannot well be at the extremities of a diameter, nor
will it often happen that the right line joining them will be perpen-
dicular to the plane of the ecliptic. But, what comes substantially to
the same thing, the line joining the stations will always be known,
and can easily be reduced to an equivalent perpendicular one, so that
the accuracy of the final result will scarcely be impaired by this cir-
cumstance. ,

The only observation of that transit made on the American conti-
nent, so far as I am aware, was by Professor John Winthrop, of
Harvard University. The transit came on early on the morning of
June 6. For the purpose of a favorable station Mr. Winthrop re-
paired to St. John’s, in New Brunswick. His observations were com-
ON ASTRONOMY, 121

municated to Mr. James Short, of London, and, with others, were
published in the transactions of the Royal Society for 1764. From
the discussion of seventeen observations made at different places Mr.
Short found the parallax to be 8’.6.

The same observations were discussed by Mr. Thomas Hornsby,
professor of astronomy at Oxtord. His result is 9.”7, more than 1”
greater than Short’s. Pingré’s computations gave 10”.1. Rumouski,
8.3. On account of such large discrepancies these results were not
very satisfactory.

But another transit was to occur June 3, 1769; and renewed and
more extended preparations were made to secure the best possible
observations. Scientific societies and enlightened governments united
their efforts to establish stations in distant parts of the earth most
favorable for observation.

Besides the observations of Dr. Maskelyne at the Greenwich
observatory, and many others in England, the Royal Society, with the
aid of the government, sent out the famous expedition of Capt. Cook
to the South Seas, where the transit was observed by Mr. Green, the
astronomer, by Captain Cook, and Dr. Solander, the botanist of the
expedition.

Another commission, consisting of Messrs. Wales and Dymond, was
sent to Hudson’s Bay ; while Mason and Dixon, who had observed
the transit of 1761 at the Cape of Good Hope, observed this in
Ireland. And still another, under the direction of Mr. Call, was sent
to Madras.

The French Academy sent Pingré to St. Domingo, and the Abbe
Chappe to California, both of whom had observed the preceding
transit, the former in the Indian ocean, the latterin Siberia. Chappe
made his observation at the village of St. Joseph, in California, and,
lingering a short time to complete some observations for the longitude |
of the place, was seized with an epidemic and died on the Ist of
August following. His observations were preserved and sent to Paris
by one of his assistants.

The Academy of St. Petersburg took the most enlightened interest
in the event, and sent astronomers to three different stations in Lap-
land, to one on the banks of the Lena, to another on the shores of
the Caspian, and to several places in the interior of Asia.

The King of Denmark sent Father Hell, professor of astronomy in
Vienna, to Wardhus, at the northern extremity of Norway. Lanman
went to Cajanebourg, in Finland.

In this country the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia,
under the lead of Dr. Rittenhouse, took the most active and conspicu-
ous part in this enterprise, which united the astronomical labors of
all countries. As the time for preparation drew near the society
appointed commissions to make observations in the three separate
places : one at Norriston, (now Norristown,) the residence of Ritten-
house, seventeen miles northwest of Philadelphia; one in Philadelphia,
and one near Cape Henlopen. Dr. Rittenhouse had the principal charge
of the first station, Dr. Ewing of the second, and Mr. Biddle of the
third. The liveliest interest was felt in the subject. The day was
remarkably fine, and the observers were able to get excellent observa-
tions.
122 LECTURES

This transit was also observed by Professor Winthrop, of Cambridge,
who had observed the previous transit in New Brunswick, and by Dr.
West of Providence. Observations were also made by the Earl of
Stirling, at Baskenridge, in New Jersey, and by Captain Holland near
(Quebec.

Several valuable papers, devoted to the record and discussion of
these observations, will be found in the transactions of the American
Philosophical Society for 1769, and many in the transactions of the
Royal Society of London for 1769 and 1770.

Professor Hornsby, of Oxford, who had computed the sun’s parallax
from the observations of 1761, computed the same from five or six of
the best observations of 1769. But the most complete discussion of
the subject was by Lalande, who, by the close of the year 1769, had
collected a great number of observations, and discussed them in the
most elaborate manner. His results were published in the Gazette of
France, in January, 1770.

In consequence of the unfavorable state of the weather only two of
the northern stations furnished full and complete observations, viz :
Wardhus and Cajanebourg. And, unfortunately, there was strong
reason to suspect that those at Wardhus, by I'ather Hell, were not
genuine. There was a delay and a reluctance in giving them to the
public, which much required explanation. And, after the fullest
investigation, there was reason to believe that some of them, at least,
were interpolations.

The close agreements of the computed results of observations, most
widely separated, taken two and two, gave assurance of a close
approximation to the truth. The following were obtained by Lalande:

The result of an immense amount of calculation by himself, Lexell,
Kuber, Pingré, and Duréjour, gave, 8’.5; 8”’.7; 8.8. In England,
Hornsby found 8’.8, Maskelyne 8”.7, Smith 8”.6. Asa mean of all the
results, 8’.6 was adopted, which is the same as Short obtains from the
observations of 1761. The importance of arriving at the nearest tenth
of a second will be seen by considering that one-tenth of a second in
parallax corresponds to about 1,000,000 miles in the sun’s distance.

‘‘Such,’’ says Lalande, in closing his history of this astronomical
event, ‘‘such is the result of this celebrated transit of Venus, which
has occasioned so many voyages and so many volumes, and which has
taught us, much better than we knew before, the extent of our
universe, or at least of our solar system. ‘This transit may be re-
garded as one of the memorable epochs of the astronomy of the
eighteenth century.”’

But succeeding astronomers were far from being content to adopt,
without further inquiry, the foregoing conclusion.

Encke, the eminent veteran astronomer of Berlin, has re-examined
and most elaborately collated and discussed all the observations made
at both the transits of 1761 and 1769, and given to the public the
results in two volumes, published, the one in 1822, the other in 1824.
ON ASTRONOMY. 128

From the transit of 1761 he finds P = 8.53
From the transit of 1769 he finds P = 8”.60

Mean P = 8.57

The sun’s distance is therefore very nearly 95,300,000 miles. From
this all the other planetary distances are easily obtained by Kepler’s
Third Law. Airy, in,his Lectures on Astronomy, puts the distance
at 95,500,000, with a probable error of not more than 500,000 miles.

It is worthy of remark, as showing that all true methods are in
harmony with each other, that Professor Burg, in 1824, following the
footsteps of Mayer, deduced the solar parallax from analytical in-
vestigations of the Lunar Theory, and found for a result 8”.62, very
nearly coincident with that of Encke. Laplace had obtained, in the
same way, 8.61, a result almost identical with that of Burg.

These remarkable coincidences of analysis with observation in the
remote and untrodden fields of science furnish, as Laplace suggests,
one of the most striking proofs of universal gravitation. -

Before bringing these remarks to a close, I must call your attention
to one other effort to approximate still nearer to this fundamental
element in the solar system, an effort recommended by the ablest
astronomers, at home and abroad, and deemed worthy of the combined
labor of different countries. I refer to the United States naval astro-
nomical expedition to the southern hemisphere during the years 1849,
1850, 1851, and 1852, under Lieutenant J. M. Gilliss.

In 1847 Dr. Gerling, a distinguished astronomer and mathema-
tician of Marburg, in Germany, called the attention of astronomers
to the importance of repeating the observation on Mars in opposition,
and especially of making observations on Venus during the inferior
conjunction, for the more exact determination of the sun’s parallax.
He suggested reasons for believing that, with the increased power
and accuracy of instruments, together with the delicate and refined
methods of observation now in use, most valuable results, additional
to any hitherto realized, might be obtained. He particularly urged
the importance of observations on Venus, which had not heretofore
been rendered available for this purpose. The principle of this will
be understood by reference to figure 14.

124 LECTURES

being within two or three degrees of the sun, this distance will differ
but little from HV’. The horizontal parallax of Venus will then be
readily found.

But the parallax of Venus and the sun will be inversely as their
distances. By Kepler’s Third Law we should have—

SH: 8V! : 3.614 :' 37 nearly.
Whence SE: VE :: 514: 143
or 514 : 144 :. Par. Venus : Par. Sun.

In this proportion the terms are all known except the last, and
hence we have the sun’s parallax.

The letter of Dr. Gerling to Lieutenant Gilliss was in anticipation
of the publication of his views in Germany. Lieutenant Gilliss
promptly brought the subject to the notice of our ablest astronomers,
and, with their hearty concurrence, enlisted Congress, the government
and the Smithsonian Institution in the enterprise.

The manner in which the expedition was undertaken and carried
out reflects the highest credit upon the ability and untiring energy
of Lieutenant Gilliss. The very moderate appropriation of $5,000
was authorized by Congress to enable the Secretary of the Navy to
defray the expenses of the expedition. Furnished with instruments
fitted expressly for the expedition, viz: two telescopes, a larger and
smaller, equatorially mounted ; a meridian circle, of large size and
exquisite finish; clock and chronometers; and two assistants, Messrs.
MacRae and Hunter, Lieutenant Gilliss, by order of the Secretary of
the Navy, repaired to Santiago de Chile, and erected his observatory
so as to commence observations in December of 1849, which were con-
tinued till September of 1852. By previous arrangement, simultaneous
observations on both Venus and Mars were to be made at the Wash-
ington observatory, under the direction of Lieutenant Maury. It was
expected also that other observers, both in this country and Europe,
would, as far as possible, co-operate in a work in which all astrono-
mers were alike interested.

On the return of the expedition the vast mass of observations were
placed in the hands of Dr. B. A. Gould, jr., for reduction and discus-
sion. The well known ability of Dr. Gould gave assurance that
nothing would be wanting to insure the most accurate results. The
laborious undertaking has been accomplished, and the result published
in the third volume of the Naval Astronomical Expedition. The
parallax thus obtained from purely American observations, and by a
method entirely new, at least so far as the observations on Venus are
concerned, agrees very nearly with those obtained by the transit of
Venus, viz: 8.5. If we cannot say that our own astronomers have
attained a closer approximation to the truth than had before been
reached, which could hardly be expected, we can say that by a new
and independent method they have added a most valuable confirma-
tion to results before obtained. It is not too much to say that this
enterprise, in its conception and consummation, reflects honor upon
‘the scientific character of our country, and will be highly appreciated
wherever astronomical science is cultivated.

The next two transits of Venus will be on December 8, 1874, and
ON ASTRONOMY. p25

December 6, 1882. It may be expected that American astronomers
will take an important part in the observation of these transits.

Of these two transits, that of 1882 will be the more favorable to an
exact determination. In a very interesting paper communicated to
the Royal Astronomical Society of London, in May, 1857, the astrono-
mer points out the special advantages which the United States will
possess for making accurate observations.

In the first place, the two regions of country most favorable for
observation are the United States and a portion of the Antarctic land
discovered by Captain Wilkes, of the United States navy. In the
second place, we have a large number of observatories situated at
such convenient distances that any local cloudiness which might pre-
vent observations at some stations would not affect others. In the
third place, we have the great and peculiar advantage of an extended
system of magnetic telegraphs by which the clocks and chronometers
of all the stations might easily be connected so that all the observations
might be made by one clock, say that of Washington.

Humanly speaking, therefore, he remarks, we may say that the
probabilities for the accurate and efficient observation of these phe-
nomena in the United States are vastly superior to any that could
have been reckoned on in any former time, or to any that could now
be anticipated in any other region.

SIDEREAL ASTRONOMY.

In my last lecture I discussed the methods of determining planetary
distances, first by finding the sun’s distance from the earth, and then,
by means of Kepler’s Third Law, computing the distances of the other
planets. The distance of the sun I stated to be 95,300,000 miles, with
a probable error of not more than half a million of miles. This pro-
portional error, and no more, will run through all the measures of
planetary distances. In this respect all has been done, or nearly all,
that can be done before the next transits of Venus in 1874, December
8, and 1882, December 6.

I shall, this evening, invite your attention to the subject of Sidereal
Astronomy. A glorious and an inspiring sight it is to look at the
starry heavens. So vast, so brilliant, so pure, they seem to raise the
soul to diviner contemplations than any scene which pertains to earth.
The first impression on looking at the heavens is, that the stars are
absolutely innumerable, but on a more careful consideration we be-
come satisfied that this first impression is erroneous. If the attempt
is actually made to number them, it will be found that not more than
about 3,000 can be seen at any one time by thenakedeye. The whole
number thus visible in the heavens does not probably exceed 6,000
or 7,000.

Very early in the history of astronomy the stars were distributed.

into groups called constellations, to which particular names were given,
depending upon some fancied resemblance between the configuration
of the stars and the form of the object or animal from which the name
was taken. Thus we have the constellation of the Great Bear, the
Little Bear, the Kagle, the Swan, the Lyre, &c. These constellations

126 LECTURES

are convenient in reference to a general description of the heavens.
The more conspicuous stars have individual names as Sirius, Procyon,
Regulus, &c.

The principal classification of stars, however, is in reference to their
magnitudes. But we must here bear in mind that the stars have no
assignable area or size. They have no measurable disc, like the plane-
tary bodies. The stars of the first magnitude, when viewed with a good
telescope under favorable atmospheric circumstances, sharpen down
to a mere brilliant point. The classification is really based on
brightness ; and stars of the first magnitude are simply the brightest
stars. Any one on looking at the heavens on a clear, moonless night,
will be able to distinguish many degrees of brightness between Sirius,
the brightest star in the heavens, and one that is barely visible to the
naked eye. It would not be difficult, perhaps, to select twenty stars
within these limits, which twenty different persons, without any con-
cert, would arrange in the same order. And this only shows how
quickly and how truly the eye discriminates slight shades of differ-
ence in brightness. Astronomers have, however, divided the stars
visible to the naked eye into six classes, and the telescopic stars into
ten additional ones, making sixteen in all. Stars of the 15th and
16th classes are test objects for the best telescopes which have been
made. It must not, however, be supposed that there is any very well
defined difference between the faintest star of the first magnitude and
the brightest of the second. These will not differ more from each
other than several of the stars of either class.

While it is very easy to arrange the stars in the order of their
brightness, it is not easy to determine how much they differ the one
from the other. Many attempts have been made to ascertain photo-
metrically, (that is, by measuring in some way the quantity or intensity
of light,) how much the light of Sirius, for instance, exceeds that of
Aldebaran, or any medium star of the first magnitude. These efforts
have extended to the comparison of a star of the 6th magnitude with
Sirius, and, again, Sirius with the moon and the sun. Researches
upon this subject are attended with many difficulties, and the results
cannot, of course, be considered very exact, and yet they afford toler-
able approximations to the truth. From comparisons which have
been made by different methods and by different persors, itis concluded
that the light of Sirius is fully equal to three times that of a star of
medium first class magnitude ; in other words, three first class stars
of the brightness of Aldebaran or Regulus, united, would only make
one of Sirius. The comparison being restricted to medium stars
of their respective classes, one of the first class is equal to four of the
second, eight of the third, and one hundred of the sixth.

Astronomers have agreed to place in the first class not more than
23 or 24 of the brightest stars ; in the second, 50 or 60; in the third,
about 300. Beyond the third class the numbers increase with great
rapidity. The whole number which have been accurately catalogued,
down to the seventh class inclusive, is about 15,000. Descending to
the telescopic classes, the numbers have become immensely great.
Struvé, whose researches have been specially directed to this branch of
astronomy, concludes that the number of stars situated in Bessel’s
ON ASTRONOMY. 127

zone, extending 15° on each side of the equator, which were visible
in Herschel’s 20-foot reflector, amounted to more than 5,800,000.
But this zone covers only about one-quarter of the heavens, and is by
no means that portion which is the richest in telescopic stars. The
great belt known as the Milky Way presents vast regions where the
minute stars are incomparably more dense than in Bessel’s zone. To
say, then, that the whole number of stars visible in the telescope
amounts to many millions, is but an imperfect and inadequate state-
ment of the fact. We might still say, the half is not told us. But,
then, turn away from the contemplation of single, scattered stars, and
look at the close clusters, of which there are so many in the heavens,
where many thousands of minute stars are so densely crowded together
that the very best powers of the telescope are required to separate
them. If they were thrown together, a million of visible stars would
scarcely occupy so large a space in the heavens as the sun’s disc.
Then, from these stars, which are separately and distinctly visible,
look again at the ‘star dust,’’ as Herschel calls it, which gives a
general illumination to the Milky Way, and is visible only in the
aggregate, and which yet dimly shadows forth the existence of indi-
vidual orbs more numerous than all that are seen. Who, then, shall
count the stars, or tell the number thereof? Down to this time more
than 100,000 have been accurately catalogued. Lalande’s Catalogue,
republished by the British Association, in 1837, alone contains 47,390,

Sidereal astronomy presents many points of interest. It may be
asked, what the stars are, and where they are, and whether they are
unchangeably the same? Are they subjected to any law of motion?
Is there any bond of union between them? Do they tell us anything
of time and space, of creative power and infinite intelligence, that we
should not have known without them? ‘To some of these questions
we shall advert this evening. Others of them belong to after ages in
the world’s history.

Following out the plan which I have proposed to myself in these
lectures, I shall first endeavor to show how we arrive at some esti-
mate of the distances of the stars. I have, in the previous lecture,
explained the method of finding the dimensions of the solar system,
ip miles. The distance of the nearest fixed star is so vast that we
shall best express it in terms of the velocity of light. Butif I tell
you that light moves at the rate of 192,000 miles in a single second
of time, you will very naturally ask me how this can be known.- So
extraordinary a statement certainly ought not to be credited but upon
good and sufficient grounds. This problem is one of so much interest
in itself, and so needful to our progress, that I shall venture to givea
few moments to its illustration before proceeding to discuss the
distances of the stars.

The velocity of light is known by three separate means: 1. By
the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites, 2. By the aberration of light. 3.
By direct experiment.

Immediately on the discovery of the telescope by Galileo, in 1610,
his attention was drawn to the satellites of Jupiter, then for the first
time seen, They revolve round the primary in periods of from less
than two to more than sixteen days. Their periodic times were soon

ie
128 LECTURES

determined with considerable precision. Butit was also found that
they presented remarkable inequalities. When the earth in her orbit
was receding from Jupiter, the periodic times were too long. On the
contrary, when she was approaching him they were too short. These
discrepancies were the occasion of much perplexity.

Arago, in his popular astronomy, gives to Lord Bacon the credit of
having first suggested that the inequalities might be due to the fact
that time was occupied in the transmission of light; that the effect of
light was not, as had been supposed, simultaneous at all distances,

Roemer, an eminent Danish astronomer, was the first to urge this
fact as necessary in order to account for the apparent irregularities.
Researches upon these satellites occupied the attention of eminent
astronomers for more than half a century. And it was not until after
the lapse of more than a hundred years from the time of their
discovery that their motions were fully explained ; and no explana-
tion was sufficient which did not involve the ‘‘ equation of light.’
The subject will be easily understood by reference to fig. 15.

Let S be the sun, E E! the orbit of the earth, I I’ a portion of the
orbit of Jupiter, s and s’ the orbit of one of the satellites. The pri-
mary casts a shadow behind it in a direciion opposite to the sun, by
which the satellites are often eclipsed. In some portions of the earth
the immersion and the emersion ot the satellites can both be seen ; in
other positions only one of them. When the earth is at EK and Jupi-
ter at I, the emersion of the satellite is seen ats. When the earth
has advanced in her orbit to E/ and Jupiter to I’, the emersion will be
seen ats’, While the earth is passing along the side of her orbit
approaching the planet the immersions are seen. While she is mo-
ving from the point of her orbit nearest to the planet the intervals
between the eclipse are too long ; and while returning from the most
remote to the nearest they are too short. And this difference, in the
course of a complete synodic revolution, amounted to more than 163
minutes. It was at length found, by accurate calculation, that ight |
occupied 16 m, 36 sec. in traversing the diameter of the earth’s orbit,
or eight minutes and eighteen seconds in coming trom the sun to us.
With this allowance, the discrepancies between the computed and
observed times of the eclipse entirely disappeared. This result fixed
the velocity of light at about 192,000 miles per second.

:
ON ASTRONOMY. 129

But the foregoing result was not, perhaps, fully concurred in by
astronomers till Dr. Bradley, in 1725, discovered the aberration of
light, one of the most beautiful discoveries in the whole history of
science. Dr. Bradley, while prosecuting researches for the purpose of
detecting, if possible, the annual parallax of the stars, found that all
the stars were subject to an annual change of position, and that they
described orbits about their mean places having 40” of arc for their
major axis. Those situated in the ecliptic moved backward and forward
in a straight line. In proportion as they are removed from the ecliptic
the minor axes of the orbits increased, while the major axes of all
remain the same. And, what is quite singular, they are all displaced
or projected forward in the direction of that point in the heavens
towards which the earth is at the moment moving. The true expla-
nation of this fact was far from being obvious. It was at length sug-
gested to Dr. Bradley, on an occasion of being rowed across the
Thames. He observed that the streamer, at the top of the mast, indi-
cated a change in the direction of the wind while the boat was getting
under way. He inquired of the boatmen what made the wind change
when the boat began to move? They could give no explanation, but
said they had often observedit. But, on reflecting upon the subject, Dr.
Bradley explained it on the principle of the parallelogram of forces
The streamer would necessarily take the direction of the diagonal of a
parallelogram which should have for one side the velocity of the
wind, and for the other the velocity of the boat. This at once
explained, also, the displacement of the star. It must appear in the
direction of the diagonal of a parallelogram which should have for
one side the velocity of the earth, and for the other the velocity of
light.

In figure 16, if E B represents that portion of the earth’s orbit
which is described in one second of time, and E § the distance traversed
by light in one second of time, then the star which is really at 8S will
appear to be at S’, determined by the parallelogram formed on E B
and i Sas sides. The angle S B 9’, which measures the displace-
ment, is called the aberration, and when largest is always equal to
20” of arc. With every star this maximum occurs twice in the
year, e the time when the line of direction of the earth makes a right
130 LECTURES

angle with the visual ray from the star. In the triangle EH BY the
angle 8’ EB, very nearly equal to S E B, is always known from the
position of the star, the angle ES’ B=S8 ES is known by obser-
vation, E B = velocity of the earth, B 8’ = ES = velocity of light;
we then have sin. ES’ B: sin. SV EB:: EB: BS’. But twice
in the year ES’ B= 20” and 8’ E B = 90°, we then have—

sin, 20" : R:: vel. of earth : vel. of light ;

or, converting the R = sin. 90° in seconds and leaving off the sines,
we have—
20” : 206265” :: vel. of earth : vel. of light.

206265 >< vel. of earth.

Whence the velocity of light = 3

If we introduce into this equation the velocity of the earth, which
is nearly nineteen miles per second, we shall obtain a result very
nearly equal to 192,000, as given by the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites.

The effect of aberration for the entire year will be seen by figure
17, where E HE! HE’, &c., is the earth’s orbit, 8 the mean place of a
star, and S’ 8’ 8’, &c., the apparent orbit described by the star, or
the ellipse of aberration.

There is a third determination derived from direct experiment,
which is too important to be omitted in this connexion. In 1849, M.
Fizeau, of Paris, constructed a most ingenious apparatus, which had
the requisite delicacy for so difficult an experiment. The outline of
it is given in figure 18.

sis a lamp, ua lens placed ina tube which serves to converge @
beam of light on m, a plane unsilvered glass, placed in a tube; thei
glass m reflects the convergent beam of light toa focus ato. « is ai
lens which receives the light and refracts it into a parrallel beam & y;
at y is another lens, which converges it to a focus on the plane mirror 7,
from which it is reflected directly back, passes again through the lens
y, thence through the lens w, thence through the unsilvered glass m,
and reaches the eye ate. At the point 0, where the light is brought
to a focus, an opening is made in the tube in which the toothed
wheel ¢ is made to revolve with great velocity by mechanism not
here represented. There is also a diaphragm placed across the tube,
ON ASTRONOMY. 131

directly behind the wheel, with a rectangular opening in it. The
form of the opening in the diaphragm and in the teeth of the wheel are
seen enlarged in a part of the wheel c’, figure 18. As the wheel c
revolves, the opening in the diaphragm is successively opened and
closed with great rapidity. If it were to be permanently open, then
the light from the lamp would fall upon the plane glass m, a portion
would be transmitted and a portion reflected, which latter portion
would pass through the lenses # and y, be reflected at n, return
again, fall a second time upon m, and be transmitted to the eye at e.
In this state of the apparatus the eye sees a bright point at the focus o.
The bright point continues visible until the velocity of the wheel c is
such that one of its teeth passes over the notch in the diaphragm and
thus prevents the reflected light from coming to theeye. The bright
point is then eclipsed. This will necessarily take place whenever the
time occupied by the tooth in passing the space of the notch is the
same as that required by light in going from o to n and returning.

When the velocity of the wheel becomes so great as to close and
open the notch again while the light is going and coming, the bright
point will reappear. As the rotary speed of the wheel increases, the
point will be successively eclipsed. The rotary velocity of the wheel
is registered by appropriate mechanism so as to mark with precision
the number of turns to a second, while the number of teeth in the
wheel will serve to determine the time in which one tooth passes the
notch. The distance between the stations was 8,633 metres, equal
to five and one-eighth miles nearly. The apparatus indicated the
time of traversing the double distance, or ten and two-third miles, to
be about 5+155 or pehoo of a second, which makes the velocity of light
very nearly the same as that given by the preceding methods. Physi-
cal science presents few more striking results than this of M. Fizeau.

From the near agreement of these three independent methods of
determining the velocity of light we may safely conclude that the
probable error is small. Light moves with the amazing velocity of
192,000 miles per second.

We shall now proceed to inquire into the distance of the fixed stars.
And we may state, in the outset, that the only means of arriving at
an indication of this is an annual change in the position of the star.
But there are certain changes which are dependent upon known causes
which must first be allowed for. These are refraction, aberration,
and nutation. The refraction varies with the altitude of the star ;
aberration for any particular star depends on the season of the year ;
nutation, (another fine discovery of Dr. Bradley, in consequence of
which the star describes a little ellipse about its mean place once in
about nineteen years,) depends upon the position of the nodes of the
moon’s orbit. This inequality is due to the action of the moon upon
the spheroidal figure of the earth. The amount of these corrections
is well known. Now, if there is any change in the position of a star
over and above what is due to the above causes it must be referred
either to its own proper motion or to the change of position of the
earth in its orbit. But these two are not lable to be confounded the
one with each other. ‘The proper motion will be progressive from year
to year in the same direction. Any change due to the motion of the

132 LECTURES

earth will necessarily be periodic and the star must return to the
same place at the expiration of a year. A proper motion has been
detected in many of the stars, amounting in some to 4” or 5” ina
year.

Any change due to the motion of the earth is called the annual
parallax. The only means within the reach of astronomy of finding
the distance is by means of this parallax. ;

An obvious proof that the stars are immensely distant is that, except
under the severest possible scrutiny, they appear to hold the same
relative places at all seasons of the year. Our change of position,
involving a distance of nearly 200,000,000 of miles, dwindles down to
nothing in comparison with the line which extends from the earth to
the star.

In figure 19, let S be the sun, A E B the earth’s orbit, ands a

star; then the angle A s§, or the angle subtended by the radius of!
the earth’s orbit, as seen from the star, would be the annual parallax:
of the star. If this angle were so much as 1”, it would follow that:
the distance of the star must be 206,265 times the distance of the:
sun. In that case light would require more than 3} years in coming:
from the star to us. But in no case is the parallax of a star so large
as 1’. As Biot has remarked, ‘‘an angle so large as 1” could not
have escaped universal recognition.’’ What we are now entitled to:
say then is, that light from the nearest fixed star would require at least
more than 34 years to reach our earth.

There is no presumption that the stars are all equally distant. On
the contrary there is every probability that their distances are very,
unequal, and hence that some stars of the first order of intrinsic splen-
dor appear faint from their vast distance. Huyghens, assuming that
Sirius was equal in intrinsic brightness to our sun, concluded from a
computation based upon the well known law that the intensity of light
diminishes inversely as the square of the distance, that Sirius must be
28,000 times more distant than the sun; in other words that our sun
at that distance would appear no brighter than Sirius does now. But
this estimate of the distance, as we now know, is far too small. At
only that distance the parallax would be four times as great as that
of the nearest known star. Dr. Wollaston, by very ingenious photo-

ON ASTRONOMY. 133.

metric measurements, concluded that Sirius must be 140,000 times more
distant than the sun. But even this is much within the true distance.

But let us glance at the actual measurements which have enabled
the astronomer, in some few cases at least, to sound the amazing depths
of the heavens.

The star 7 Draconis, of Flamsteed’s catalogue, has a very large
proper motion, amounting to nearly 5” annually. Under the suppo-
sition that those stars which have the greatest proper motion are
nearest to us, and therefore most favorable to researches on the par-
allax, this star was selected by Dr. Bradley for special observations,
with a view to detect this element. It had also the great advantage
of passing near the zenith of the Wansted observatory, by which the
troublesome irregularities of refraction would be avoided. He failed
to detect any parallax, but his labor was rewarded by the beautiful
discovery of the aberration of light. Bradley depended upon finding
a variation in the elements of right ascension and declination. But
this is by no means the most delicate test which can be applied for the
determination of a minute annual change in the position of the star.

Galileo was the first to suggest that where a large and a small star
are very close together the smaller star might appear faint from being
placed at a vastly greater distance than the larger. If this were not
always the case, of which there is no probability, it would be likely to
occur in some instances. Wherever this holds good the stars will
undergo an annual change in their relative positions, either approach-
ing and receding from each other, or the one revolving about the other.
Thus, in figure 19, if we suppose s and s’ to be two stars situated in a
right line from the sun and in the direction of the pole of the ecliptic,
as the earth goes round in her orbit A E B the star s may appear to
revolve round s’, and it must do so if the radius of the earth’s orbit
holds any assignable ratio to the distance of the nearer star. Thus,
when the earth is at A, s will appear at @ in the distant heavens;
when the earth is at E the star will appear at e; the earth at B will
carry the star to b; and hence while the earth goes round in the orbit
A E B the star 8 will appear to go round s’ in the curveaeb. No
instance bas been discovered where this idea has been fully realized.
Nor indeed could any available results be obtained from it until a
very late period, for the want of instruments fitted to measure so small
an angle as the largest annual parallax. The micrometer in its dif-
ferent forms supplies this want. The manner in which very minute
angles are measured by this appendage to the telescope will be under-
stood by a reference to figure 22,
which is a rectangular frame
with a fine screw at each end
passing through the frame and
attached to sliding pieces within
it. These sliding pieces carry
the spider lines a and b, which
by turning the screws are made
to approach or separate from each other. Graduated circles are
fixed to the heads of the screws. Suppose one complete revo-
lution of the screw changes the position of the spider lines by 2’ or

134 LECTURES

120”, and let the circles be divided into 360 parts, then one division
on the circle will correspond to one-third of a second between the
spider lines. This apparatus, called the micrometer, is placed in or
across the tube of the telescope near the eye piece. It is sometimes
furnished with a slip of metal just below the spider lines, which marks
the interval in seconds between them. The distance between two stars
or the diameter of a planet is measured by adjusting the instrument
so that the stars shall be bisected by the lines, or the disk of the planet
will lie exactly between them. The turns and divisions of the screw
which bring the lines together will give the angular distance sought
in this case to the one-third of a second. Large telescopes fitted with
micrometers are indispensable to researches upon the distances of the
fixed stars. The value of one turn of the screw is fixed by directing
the telescope to two well defined objects of a known angular distance
apart.

Special researches upon this branch of astronomy have been made
by Struvé, Bessel, Peters, Henderson, Maclean and Groombridge.

In 1835 Struvé, then of Dorpat, now of the Great Russian Obser-
vatory at Pulkowa, near St. Petersburg, commenced a series of obser-
vations on the bright star in the Lyre. This star has a very minute
companion at the distance of 43”. Struvé was able to detect an annual
variation in this distance, from which he deduced the annual parallax
of a Lyre to be 0”.261, from which it follows that light would be
about fourteen years coming from that brilliant star to us. The light
which it sheds upon us to-night started on its career fourteen years ago.

But the researches of Bessel in connexion with the star 61 Cygni,
form an important epoch in the history of stellar astronomy. He
was furnished with a magnificent heliometer, made by Frauenhofer,
with a micrometer of the greatest delicacy. He brought to the re-
search an array of instrumental means which no previous astron-
omer had been able to command. His consummate skill as an observer,
in connexion with the exquisite instruments in his hand, enabled him
to furnish results which have commanded universal confidence. His
observations were commenced at Konigsberg in 1835, and continued
to 1840. His field of view is presented in figure 20, where S is the
double star 61, @ and 6 are two
minute stars, situated nearly at
right angles from 8, the former at
the distance of 7’, the latter at 11’;
the middle of the two stars S was
the point from which the distances
of a and b weremeasured, From
the configuration of the stars, if
S approached a, it would, three
months later, approach b; at the
expiration of another three months
it would have receded from a, and
then after the same interval, from
b. This, in fact, was the order
of change which was observed.
In other words, S revolved in a little orbit about its mean place. In

Fig 20

ON ASTRONOMY. 135

the discussion of his observations, on which, as Herschel remarks,
‘‘every imaginable cause of disturbance was taken into careful con-
sideration and its effects rigorously calculated,’’ he reached the con-
clusion that the parallax of 61 Cygni was 0”.348.

From this we infer that light would reach us from this star in 94
years. This result of Bessel has received the most ample confirmation
by Peters of Pulkowa, who, in a series of observations, made in 1842
and 1843, with consummate address in the use of every refinement
which could insure accuracy, found the parallax of this same star to
be 0.349, differing from the result of Bessel by only the =, of a
second. Such a coincidence between the results of different observers,
with different instruments and in different places, cannot but inspire
great confidence in the conclusion to which they have come.

The star a Centauri, the brightest star in the southern constellation,
has been much observed with a view to its parallax; first by Hen-
derson in 1832 and 1833, then by Maclean in 1839 and 1840, and
again in 1848, both at the Cape of Good Hope. The mean of the
results gives for the parallax of this star 0.915, which places it nearer
to our system than any star whose parallax has been determined.
And yet light would be nearly four years in coming from this our
nearest stellar neighbor.

The parallaxes of the following stars have been proximately de-
termined. I give them in a tabular form, with their parallax, the
name of the observer, and the number of years required for light to
come from the star to us:

The parallax bears no definite ratio to the magnitude of the star.
The severest scrutiny of the bright star a Cygni, by the powerful in-
struments of Peters, shows absolutely no indication of any measurable
parallax.

We can now give at least a partial answer to the question, how far
off are the stars? An infant is born, and at the same time a beam of
light starts from the bright star in the Swan on its way to our distant
world. The child passes through the slow-recurring stages of life,
reaches manhood and old age, and lingers his full century and dies ;
and the light has not yet reached us! Such is the distance which we
vainly try to contemplate.

136 LECTURES

We may also give a partial answer to the question, how far off maya
star be seen? Photometric measurements, deemed reliable, show that
Sirius would be as bright as an ordinary star of the sixth magnitude
at ten times its present distance ; the light would then be 220 years
in coming to us. But Sir John Herschel’s twenty-foot reflector, and
still more the great telescope of Lord Rosse, would bring out a star of
the sixth magnitude at seventy-five times its present distance. Hence
Sirius might be seen at 750 times the distance which now intervenes
between it and us. To traverse so vast a space light would require
the long period of 16,500 years! But why should we stop here? No
law of the universe bars our progress. And yet, again, what were
the use of attempting to advance farther ? The steps become so vast
that we hesitate to take them. We labor under the oppressive convic-
tion that, if millions of them were taken, we reach no end. ‘There is
every presumption in favor of the hypothesis — nay, there is positive
inductive reason for believing, that, from groups of stars and nebule,
light reaches the human eye which has been 100,000 years in its tire-
less flight from the distant verge of the universe.

From what we now know, can we then doubt that the stars which
beam effulgently upon us, or merely twinkle from the serene depths
of ether, are great central suns? Nay, that many of them are great
central suns, far surpassing our own in their intrinsic splendor?
Wollaston has shown, by photomdiscal measurements, in Herschel’s
opinion, ‘‘ apparently unobjectionable,’’ that the intrinsic splendor of
a. Centauri is equalto nearly 23 suns, and that Sirius is probably equal
to 63 suns. Such is the vastness and the grandeur of the starry heavens.
We look upon the millions of those brilliant orbs, which, scattered
through illimitable space, light up the universe of God, and these
are but parts of His works! What, then, do they tell us of time and
space, of infinite intelligence, and omnipotent power! Well might
we ask with the patriarch, ‘‘canst thou by searching find out God unto
perfection ?”’

There is one other topic to which I shall briefly allude, it is that of
double stars. We here speak of stars connected together so as to form
a system, not of those which are only optically double, in consequence
of the two being nearly in the same direction. Of the double stars,
which evidently form systems of their own, some are binary, consist-
ing of two stars; some triple, and others, perhaps, quadruple.

Sir William Herschel was the first to recognize the importance of
this particular branch of stellar astronomy, and the first to enter upon
it. He made a catalogue of 500 double stars, which were suspected
to have motions of revolution about each other. Since his time the
catalogue, by the labors of Struvé, Peters, and others, has been
extended to 3,000. Two observed elements indicate a motion of revo-
lution of two stars, the one about the other, or both about their com-
mon centre of gravity. The first is a variation of the angular distance
between them, and the second is a progressive rotary movement in the
line joining them. Both these elements of position can be observed
with great precision. The first will tend to develop the form of the
orbit, the second the time of revolution. If the plane of the stellar
orbit should chance to be perpendicular to the visual ray, we shall see
ON ASTRONOMY. 1S

it developed in its true form If that plane should coincide with the
visual ray, then, whatever the real form of the orbit, it would appear
tous to be a straight line. The companion would make a transit
across the principal star, or be occulted by it every semi-revolution.
It is now well known that, in the binary systems, the stars revolve in
elliptical orbits. Of this class Sir John Herschel gives a catalogue of
15, in which the periodic times and the forms of the orbits have been
proximately determined. The periodic times vary from 31 to 736
years. 7 Leonis, not included in his catalogue, indicates a period of
1,200 years. Of these stars, some have completed more than a revo-
lution since their orbits were computed. One of the most interesting
of the double stars is 7 Virginis. The companion passed the peri-
helion of its orbit in 1836, when no telescope in Europe could sepa-
rate the two. The periodic time is 182 years, the major axis 3.5, the
orbit very elliptical.

Fig. 21 gives a view of the re-
spective positions of the companion
from 1830 to 1844.

These orbits of the double stars
furnish the most conclusive evi-
dence that the law of gravitation
controls the movement of the most
distant stars no less than the orbits
of the component members of our
own system. It is truly and em-
phatically the law of universal
gravitation, and binds together, in
the strictest sense, the material |
universe of God.

Such are the methods by which
we ascend to the vast heights of sidereal astronomy, and such are the
lofty conceptions which it gives us of the works and attributes of the
Great Creator.

MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.

READ BEFORE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FRANCE BY M. OUVIER, JUNE 27,
1805.

[Translated by C. A. Alexander. |

[The discourses by which the French Academy of Sciences is accus-
tomed to commemorate its deceased members, whether native or for-
eign, constitute, it is known, a body of highly interesting biographical
and scientific literature. Far from being limited to encomium, as the
title of ‘‘ Eloges,’’ by which they are usually called, might suggest,
they maintain a tone of candid criticism, and in dispensing Justice to
scientific discoverers deal in enlarged and original views of science
itself, The names of their authors—of Delambre, Fourier, Cuvier,
Arago and others—would teach us to expect no less.

Those delivered by Arago, late perpetual secretary of the academy,
have been recently translated and published in England among the
works of that distinguished and lamented individual. A few others
may be found dispersed through the volumes of scientific periodicals
of Great Britain, but as these are little accessible to the general
reader, and as many have not been translated which well deserved
to be so, it has been thought that a more extended collection than has
yet appeared would not be unacceptable to the literary public.

In this view, a translation, not indeed of the whole series, but of
such as, having not been already published in this country, may
serve to give a connected and popular exposition of the progress of
science, has been undertaken at the suggestion of the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution; and the proposed work will appear under
the auspices of the Institution, in so far, at least, as to guarantee the
correctness of its views and the fidelity of its execution.

As a specimen of the work, as well as for its own intrinsic interest,
the following memoir of one of the most original and ingenious pro-
moters of modern science, who closed his eventful life in our own
country, is appended to the present report. |

JosePH PriustiEy, the subject of the present discourse, was an
English clergyman, whose important discoveries in physics occasioned
his being chosen a foreign associate of the Academy of Sciences of
Paris, and the National Institute lost no time in associating him with
itself by the same title.* As he belonged besides to most scientific
academies of his time, it may be that the homage which we this day
render him has been already offered to his memory in all the great
capitals of the civilized world.

This unanimity of commendation will appear the more encouraging

to the friends of enlightenment, and attest more strikingly the irre-
pressible influence of true merit, when it is considered that he who
was its object used no address or management in securing it; that,
on the contrary, his life was one of almost ceaseless controversy ; that
he seemed on all occasions to take pleasure in contesting the most ac-
credited opinions, and attacked without scruple the most cherished
interests of certain classes of men.

It is true that this excessive ardor in the assertion of his own ideas
drew upon him the bitterest resentments, exposed him to all sorts of
calumny, and more than once rendered him the victim of cruel perse-
cution. A mob, excited by the false reports of his enemies, snatched
from him in a single day the fruits of all his labors, and only by
withdrawing from his country did he succeed in baffling the fury of
his persecutors. But when his own countrymen seemed to forsake
him, there were others eager to offer him an honorable asylum. And
now, when the principal literary institution of a nation at war with
his own, tenders him through my voice the last sad tribute which it
owes to all its members, I see among the audience many to whom
Priestley has been heretofore opposed, who yet seem to join their suf-
frages with mine and crown by their generous concurrence the measure
of his triumph.

Science and philosophy will have nothing to fear from their bigoted
adversaries so long as such a recompense shall await the man who has
enlarged the noble edifice of our knowledge; so long as genius shall
be regarded apart from its merely local relations, and the development
of new truths shall procure indulgence for any incidental way wardness,
singularity or even rashness of opinion ; for it must not be dissembled
that in matters of opinion Priestley has made himself liable to ex-
ceptions of this nature.

In effect, his history will exhibit him in the light, as it were, of two
different—I had almost said, two contrasted—individuals.

One, the circumspect observer of nature, confines himself to the
examination of objects which lie within the domain of experience,
subjects every procedure to a strict and cautious logic, indulges neither
in speculation nor prejudice, but seeking only truth, whatever it may
be, seldom fails to discover and to establish it in the most satisfactory
manner: the other shows us the adventurous theologian, who grap-
ples boldly with the most mysterious questions, rejects authority
however consecrated by the respect and belief of ages, and, abandon-
ing himself to the heat of controversy, with opinions formed in ad-
vance, evinces as much solicitude for the success as concern for the
validity or even consistency of his hypotheses. The former calmly
resigns his discoveries to the examination of the learned, and finds
them received without hesitation and his own merit acknowledged
without contradiction: the latter invests himself in the warlike
panoply of erudition and metaphysics, attacks with little discrimina-
tion whatever sect or dogma presents itself, and too often revolts
the conscience by the aggressive zeal with which he seems bent on
subduing it.

It is against the divine, the minister of peace, that all are in arms ;

he is accused of exciting animosity, arousing vengeance, and troubling
society. The physical inquirer, on the other hand, meets with in-
variable respect; every one acknowledges that, in the defence of truth,
he relies only upon reason, that his discoveries are directed solely to
the welfare of his fellow-men, and that his writings breathe nothing
but a spirit of candor and of modesty.*

Thoroughly to know Priestly, then, it is necessary that he should
be sketched under both these characters ; that the theologian, meta-
physician, and politician should be reproduced, no less than the inge-
nious physicist and associate of the National Institute. At the same
time there can be no mistake as to the comparative prominence which
should be given, on the present occasion, to one or the other, and as
little probably as to the interest which posterity is likely to attach to
them. He has himself somewhere remarked that, asa means of last-
ing renown, the labors of science are as far superior to all others as
the laws of nature to the organization of societies ; and that no states-
man who ever rose to power in Great Britain has approached in
celebrity its Bacons, Newtons, and Boyles ; a maxim somewhat exag-
gerated, perhaps, but which it would have been fortunate if he had
always kept before his own eyes. Priestley, however, is not the first
celebrated man, whose judgment has shown itself incapable of mas-
tering his character.

Mean while it is to be carefully noted that in no respect did his
divergent opinions influence his conduct, but that, with the exception
of the unmerited misfortunes which overwhelmed him in old age, the
whole course of his life was alike uniform and simple. The mere list
of his works would indicate as much; for, when it is known that he
produced more than a hundred treatises, no one can suppose that
society engrossed much of his time, or that his history can consist of
much more than an analysis of his writings.

He was born at Birstal-Fieldhead, near Leeds, in 1733. His father
was a cloth-dresser; his first master a dissenting minister. After
several years study he obtained the situation of [tutor in the Belles
Lettres{] at the provincial academy of Warrington, and afterwards
became pastor of a congregation of dissenters at Leeds. Lord Shel-
burn, secretary of state and afterwards first marquis of Lansdowne,
under a sense of Priestley’s merit [which had then been established
by his first discoveries] induced him to accept the position of [his
lordship’s librarian and philosophic companion, with a salary of £250,
reducible to £150 for life should he quit the employment.] This con-
nexion was terminated, without loss of confidence or friendship on.

toral functions among the dissenters at Birmingham. Here he

* Whether the contrast here presented be not pushed, in the spirit of antithesis, to too
great a length, will probably be differently decided, according to the previous views of the
reader. But that, in some of his metaphysical speculations and interpretations of prophecy,
Dr. Priestley has laid himself open to the charge of temerity, will be denied by few ; nor is
it surprising that Cuvier should regret that such astonishing activity of intellect had not been
restrained to the paths of induction, where he himself had found so secure a footing.—Tr.

remained eleven years, up to the time of the disturbances which com-
pelled him to quit that city and determined him to seek a refuge in
the United States. Such is the brief yet complete outline of his pri-
vate life; the history of his works, as it is more important, must be
more extended.

The first of them were intended for the service of education, and an
English grammar, his earliest production, is still used in the schools
of Great Britain. His historic and geographic charts deserve to be
used everywhere for the ingenious manner in which they represent the
origin and fall of each State and the career of every celebrated man.
His lessons on history evince both the comprehension and knowledge
requisite for a profitable study of the revolutions of nations. Those
on oratory and criticism are recognized as useful guides to the exer-
cises of the young.*

This didactic form was that which he still employed in his first
works on physics ; his histories, namely, of electricity and optics, and
his elements of perspective. The history of electricity was judiciously
timed, for it appeared just when Franklin, by the boldness and suc-
cess of his investigations, had thrown the brightest lustre around this
interesting branch of physics, and as all that had been done up to
that date was here presented in a clear and concise form, it was trans-
lated into several languages and first drew some notice in foreign
countries to the name of its author.

The ungrateful task, however, of recounting what had been done
by others was not long to limit the activity of Priestley. He proceeded
without loss of time to place himself in the line of physical discoverers,
and it was chiefly by his researches into the different kinds of air that
he merited that title and established the most durable monument of his
own renown.

It had long been known that many bodies give out air and that
others absorb it under certain circumstances. It had been observed
that the air of neglected privies and of the bottoms of wells, with that
evolved by fermentation, extinguishes light and destroys animal life.
A light air, also, had been observed in the interior of mines, floating
mostly about the vaults of the passages, and kindling sometimes with
fearful explosions. The former had received the name of fied and
the latter that of inflammable air. They are the same which we now
call carbonic acid gas and carburetted-hydrogen. Cavendish had
determined their specific gravity; Black had ascertained that it is
the fixed air which renders the alkalies and lime effervescent ; and
Bergman had not been backward in detecting its acid properties.
Such was the state of knowledge in these particulars when Priestley
laid hold of the matter and treated it with a felicity altogether peculiar
to himself.

Happening to be lodged, at Leeds, next door to a brewery, he had
the curiosity to examine the fixed air which is exhaled from beer in

* Referring to these productions, Lord Brougham remarks: ‘ It is difficult to imagine any-
thing more adventurous than the tutor of an academy afflicted with an incurable stutter,
and who devoted his time to teaching and theology, promulgating rules of eloquence to the
senators and lawyers of his country.”

142 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.

fermentation, with reference to its deleterious influence on animal
life and its property of extinguishing the flame of candles.

His experiments having given him some remarkable results, he was
induced to extend them to inflammable air.

In aiming to determine all the circumstances in which these two
kinds of air manifest themselves, he soon remarked that in many
instances of combustion, especially during the calcination of metals,
the air in which such operations are conducted is altered in its nature,
without there being either fixed or inflammable air in the product.
Hence his discovery of a third species of deleterious air, which he
named phlogistic air, and which has been since called azotic (or nitro-
gen) gas.

He had availed himself of small animals to test the pernicious
action of these different products, and was thus obliged to give pain
to sentient beings. His character is displayed in the joy which he
felt when the discovery of a fourth species of gas enabled him to
dispense with this cruel expedient. This was nitrous air, which has
the property of suddenly diminishing the volume of any other with
which it mixes, very nearly, in the proportion in which that other
air is respirable, and which consequently affords the means of mea-
suring to a certain point the degree of salubrity possessed by different
kinds of air.

This discovery, which was the origin of that branch of physics
known as eudiometry, was of great importance; all the natural
sciences were interested in possessing such a measure, and medicine,
above all, might have turned it to account but for the difficulty of
introducing scientific processes into the practice of even the most
scientific arts.

Combustion, fermentation, respiration, and putrefaction are found to
produce sometimes fixed air, sometimes inflammable, and sometimes
phlogistic air. There is thus no end to the causes which may vitiate
the atmosphere, and yet its purity has undergone no sensible altera-
tion during all the time those causes have been acting. Hence it
follows that in nature there must exist some constant means of restoring
that purity.

Priestley detected these means in discovering that vegetables possess
the property of decomposing fixed air during the day, and that they
thus purify the atmosphere. This property, besides being the first
key to the whole vegetable economy, when taken in connexion with
that exerted by animals of vitiating the air by respiration, disclosed
then, what has since been better developed, that the restorative ener-
gies of life consist chiefly in a perpetual transformation of elastic
fluids.

Thus these discoveries respecting air opened an altogether new
field to the researches upon living bodies, and shed a light on physi-
ology and medicine till then unknown. But still more unexpected
and brighter rays were soon to issue from the same focus.

Having applied the heat of a burning-glass to the calx of mercury,
Priestley had the good fortune to obtain, in a pure and isolated state,
that respirable constituent of atmospheric air which animals consume
MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 143

vegetables restore, and combustion alters. He named it dephlogisti-
cated air.

The other aeriform fluids which differed from the atmospheric air
had been found to extinguish lights: this caused them to burn with
a brighter flame and with wonderful rapidity. The others deprived
animals of life: in this they lived longer than in even the common
air, without need of renewing it, while their faculties seemed to acquire
from it a greater energy. For the instant it was imagined a new
means of existing, and perhaps of prolonging life, had been discov-
ered, or at least an assured remedy against the greater part of the
maladies of respiration.

This hope has proved deceptive, but dephlogisticated air has not the
less remained one of the most brilliant discoveries of the eighteenth
century; itis this which, under the name of oxygen, modern chemistry
regards as one of the most universal agents of nature. By its means
all combustion and calcination are effected ; it enters into the compo-
sition of all acids; it is one of the elements of water, and the great
reservoir of fire; to it we owe almost all the artificial heat which we
procure in common life and in the arts; this it is which, in respira-
tion, gives to all animated bodies their natural warmth and furnishes
the material principle of their movements. The energy of different
kinds of animals is in proportion to the force of its action upon them,
and in the growth of vegetables there is no period when they do not
combine with or disengage it in different manners. In a word,
physics, chemistry, and physiology, both animal and vegetable, have
scarcely a phenomenon which they can entirely explain without the
element in question.

What has been said is but a slight sketch of the most remarkable
discoveries of Priestley ; time forces us to neglect a multitude of others
which would of themselves furnish ample materials for the eulogy of
another man. Lach of his experiments has proved fertile in conse-
quences, and it can scarcely be doubted that there are some of them
which only await a closer attention to become the germ of new and
important deductions.

His labors, as might be expected, were received with general interest ;
his works translated into all languages, and his experiments repeated,
varied, and commented upon by the ablest inquirers. Tor his earlier
researches on phlogistic air the Royal Society had awarded him Cop-
ley’s medal, which is bestowed for the most important physical labor
made public within the year, and which England regards as the
noblest prize of scientific merit. The Academy of Paris accorded him
a prize not less noble, and, because rarer, of more difficult attainment,
the place of one of its eight foreign associates ; an object of compe-
tition to all the scientists of Hurope, and whose list of names, com-
mencing with those of Newton, Leibnitz and Peter the Great, has
never degenerated from that original splendor.

Priestley saw with surprise this accumulation of honors and mod-
estly wondered at the multitude of precious truths which nature
seemed to have reserved for his sole discovery. He forgot that her
favors are never gratuitous, and thatif she had so freely disclosed her-
self, it was because he had known how to extort her answers by the

a I i
144 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY

indefatigable perseverance of his inquiries and the number and variety
of his expedients. While others sedulously conceal how much they
owe to hazard, Priestley seemed inclined to credit it with everything.
He tells us, with unexampled candor, how often he was indebted to it
unconsc.ously, how often new substances presented themselves to him
without being recognized ; nor does he ever dissemble the erroneous
views which sometimes governed him and from which he was only
detached by further experience.

These avowals did honor to his modesty without disarming jealousy.
Those, whose own views and methods had proved abortive in discovery,
called him a mere experimenter without method or design ; no wonder,
they observed, if, among so many trials and combinations, some should
be lucky.

But the true physicist is not to be duped by such interested criti-
cisms. He is well aware how many efforts it costs to arrive at those
happy ideas which are the source and regulating principle of all others ;
while the very men who have thought fit to augment our admiration
of their own great achievements in science by the luminous order in
which they propound them, will be far from taking it amiss, that
others, like Priestley, have chosen to give us their discoveries just as
they made them, and have ingenuously retraced all the windings of
the path over which they have travelled.

This peculiarity results from his manner of composition. We have
here no finished construction, no digest of theorems rigidly deduced
the one from the other, as they may be supposed to present them-
selves in the conceptions of pure reason. What he has given us is
the journal of his thoughts in all the disorder of their succession,
wherein we see him at first feeling his way in profound obscurity,
spying out the faintest rays of light that he may collect and reflect
them, sometimes misled by a treacherous and transient glimmer, but
sure to arrive in the end at some region of vast extent and fertility.

Should we be displeased if the great masters of the human race,
an Archimedes or a Newton, for instance, had thus admitted us to the
confidence of their genius? Newton, when asked how he arrived at
his great discoveries, replied, ‘‘ By long thinking about them.’’ With
what pleasure should we not have learned that long series of thoughts
by which Newton was conducted to that master thought which has
inspired the meditations of all his successors. If his works at present
teach us to appreciate the forces of nature, we should, by thus knowing
the actual processes of his mind, have been enabled thoroughly to
comprehend that noblest of nature’s works—the genius of a great
man.

We must not suppose, however, that the discoveries of Priestley were
all perceived by himself, or that they were set forth in his writings as
clearly or in the same manner as we should now state them. At
the time of making them he knew no chemical theory but that of
Stahl, and this, being founded on experiments in which air was taken
no account of, was of course incapable of providing for its phenomena.
Hence there results a degree of hesitation as to priaciples, and of em-
barrassment and uncertainty as to results. Seeking everywhere for
phlogiston, Priestley is obliged to suppose it differently constituted
MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 145

He finds it now in fixed air, which is heavy and acid ; now in inflam-
mable air, which is light; and again in phlogisticated air, which has
no property of the other two. Sometimes there are cases where an
accumulation of phlogiston diminishes the weight of the combination
and communicates an absolute levity to the mixture; in other cases
it produces a directly contrary effect. Thus there is no uniformity,
nor is it possible to arrive at any general and precise conclusion.

That conclusion it was left for modern chemistry to draw, and for
this purpose it has needed but one or two formulas. T'here is no such
thing as phlogiston; pure air (or oxygen) is a simple substance, as are
also phlogisticated air and inflammable air; combustion is only the com-
bination of pure air with combustible substances. 'These few words
have served to disembroil the chaos; every fact has fallen into its
proper place, and chemistry has emerged in the fair and consistent
form in which we possess it.

But chemistry, like the gods of the pagans, could create nothing
out of nothing ; elementary material was still needed for its dispo-
sal, and this material, Priestley, beyond all others, has furnished.
Under this point of view, therefore, he may justly be considered one
of the fathers of modern chemistry and be worthily associated with
the authors of that celebrated revolution in science. He was a father,
however, who never consented to recognize his offspring.

His perseverance in combatting on behalf of his original ideas has
probably no parallel. Without being shaken in his convictions he
saw the most skilful defenders of those ideas pass into the opposite
camp; and when Kirwan, the last nearly of all of them, abjured the
phlogistic doctrine, Priestley, unsupported and alone, still occupied
the field and addressed a new defiance to his opponents, the principal
French chemists of his time.

This challenge was at once taken up and replied to by Adet, who
was then ambassador of France to the United States, and thus proved
himself a worthy representative of French chemistry. The new argu-
ments of Priestley against that theory originated, in fact, from his own
want of familiarity with the operations of more recent chemistry,
however ingenious and dexterous he might be in those processes which
he had himself created. When he drew fixed air from substances
into which he did not suspect it of having entered, he would deny
that it invariably owes its origin to the carbon. And in forming water
from oxygen and hydrogen, though a small quantity of nitric acid
was always present, he would take no account of the portion of azote
which produced it.

His later writings failed, accordingly, to bring back to his opinion
any of those who had abandoned it. Like so many others who have
endeavored to arrest movements first communicated by themselves, he
experienced that ideas once dispersed abroad are as the seed whose
product depends upon the laws of nature, and not the will of those
who have scattered them. To which we may add that, when they
have once taken root, no human power is any longer capable of eradi-
cating them.

It remains now to trace, with painful interest, the career of Priest-
ley in that other branch of his labors to which reference has already

10

146 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.

been made. We have just seen him marching from one success to
another in the cultivation of the merely human sciences, which he
looked upon only as the employment of his leisure moments. We
must now observe him engaged in the struggle to unveil those first
principles which the nature of things hides from our reason beneath
the folds of impenetrable mystery, striving to force the world into an
acceptance of his conjectures, consuming almost his whole life in these
fruitless efforts, and sinking at last into an abyss of misfortune.

Every indulgence will be here needed as well for the recital as its
subject. It may even appear to some that such details are out of
place before this audience ; but where else ought the admonition they
affurd to be listened to with more interest ?

It has been already said that Priestley was an ecclesiastic ; it must
now be added that he passed successively through three creeds or
forms of belief in arriving at one which he could conscientiously adopt
as the basis of his teachings.

Reared in all the severity of the Presbyterian communion, which is
called Calvinistic in France, he passed at the age of twenty years into
the ranks of Arianism. * * *  * Arianism, while holding
Christ to be a creature, regards him as a Being of superior nature, pro-
duced before the world, and himself the organ of the Creator in the
production of other beings. It is the doctrine which the ‘‘ Paradise
Lost’’ has invested with so magnificent a garb of poetry. Priestley
professed it for a length of time, and then abandoned it to become
what we should call in France, a Socinian. Few, perhaps, of those
who hear me know in what these two sects differ; but the Socin-
ians deny the pre-existence of Christ, and regard him only as a
man, though they revere in him the Saviour of the world. This subtle
distinction between two creeds occupied for thirty years a head
which the most important questions of science might rightfully have
claimed, and was to Priestley the occasion of incomparably more
pages than he has written on the different kinds of air. * « ie
7 "i 4) Nor was he less peculiar in the metaphysical part of
his creed. It seems to have been demonstrated by the sounder meta-
physics of modern times that it is impossible for the thinking sub-
stance to take direct cognizance of its own proper nature, just as it is
impossible for the eye to see itself. For any such purpose, to contem-
plate itself or compare itself with other existences, it should be able to
do so from without, while it is only within and through its own pecu-
liar modifications that it perceives, or receives the impression of those
existences. Priestley either overlooked or disregarded these conclu-
sions. In his view, Scripture and experience agree in making the soul
material; the fibres of the brain are the depositary of the images
produced by the senses, while the power which these fibres possess of
communicating their vibrations to one another is the source of the
association of ideas. Sensation perishes with the body, but will revive
with it at the day of resurrection, in virtue of the will and power of
God. ‘Till then we shall sleep in absolute insensibility ; the distribu-
tion of punishments and rewards awaits us only thereafter.*

*]t should be remarked that the above is far from being an accurate representation of the,
materialism of Priestley, which should not be confounded with the grosser forms of that doc-
MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 147

A material soul must necessarily be submissive to exterior impulses,
and thus absolute necessity, not free will, becomes the law of our deter-
minations. Ifrewards and punishments are attached to our conduct
it is only to give one more determining cause in favor of virtue.

These doctrins are, many of them, those of the earlier Socinians, to
which Priestley only brought the support of new arguments. Without
stopping to discuss questions so foreign to the ordinary studies of the
Academy, and which it is enough to have briefly recalled, it is proper
to say that he sustained his opinions with but too much skill. Even
his adversaries give him credit for great erudition and singular dex-
terity in combining and disposing of his resources, and look upon him,
therefore, as one of the strongest controversialists and enemies of
orthodoxy in these latter times. = 5 * “

It might be thought that in rejecting so many opinions Priestley had
but one more step to take to fall into the most absolute incredulity.
But.this he never did; on the contrary, it seemed to please him to
occupy, in theology as in physics, a post by himself, which, however
perilous, he distrusted not his own courage or ability to defend.
Those who went farther than himself or not so far, the orthodox and
the skeptical, were alike the objects of his attack, and wherever, in
all Europe, anything appeared which seemed to menace, in the least
degree, either revelation in general or his own manner of interpreting
it, that he felt himself called upon to refute. His activity in this
species of warfare was without bounds ; atheists, deists, Jews, arians,
quakers, methodists, calvinists, church of England men, and catho-
lics, were all taught to recognize him as an opponent. There are
publications of his against each of these forms of belief, the very
titles of which it would be almost endless to recite.

A proof that all this was done in good faith is the fact that he
thought himself authorized to predict trom Scripture events that were
near at hand. Prophets who have not his confidence take care to
postpone the accomplishment of their predictions, so as not to have
them falsified during their own lifetime. But Priestley felt more
secure of his facts; he published, in 1799, an address to the Jews, in
which he announced to them, from the revelations of Daniel and St.
John, their speedy re-establishment in Palestine, with a reunion of
all creeds and the foundation of a reign of glory. Besides the calcu-
lation according to years, which referred this great event to the com-
mencement of the nineteenth century, it was to be heralded by such
tokens as the destruction of the papal power, of the Turkish empire,
and of the kingdoms of Europe. ‘The French monarchy, firm as it
seemed, had already fallen; the rest would soon follow; the Pope
was dethroned and in exile; the Turk only subsisted through the
compassion of his neighbors. Priestley lived long enough to see the
failure of at least a part of these supposed tokens.

Details like these, however extraordinary, could not be passed in

trine. He had adopted the theory of Boscovich, as presented in the Theoria Philosophie
Naturalis, &c., 1758, according to which, matter consists inemanations of force from definite
portions of space, and is in reality devoid of any other substratum.—Tr.
148 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY,

silence, for the eloges of the Academy are historic, and, as was ex-
pressly prescribed by the first and most illustrious of our predeces-
sors, are bound on every occasion to a fair exposition of the pro and
con. Nor can it be otherwise than useful to observe, as in the present
example, to what lengths the finest genius may be misled when it
attempts to overleap the limits which Providence has prescribed to
our understanding. There is even more instruction in the errors of
such a man as Priestley than in his actual misfortunes ; for where is
the generous mind that would not suffer even greater misfortunes
than his if it were only sure of having announced truth and vindi-
cated right?

Yet it was not precisely the theology of Priestley which occasioned
his misfortunes ; in England every one dogmatises as he pleases. It
was his politics, too closely allied to that theology; the politics of
dissenters being in almost every case the politics of opposition.

We have been accustomed, in France, to consider protestants as
republicans from religion; they are only so from oppression. In
Treland it is the catholics who pass for republicans, while the protest-
ants, who rule, are royalists, because the king is of their party.
This natural opposition is more vehement in England than else-
where, precisely because there dissenters are tolerated by halves, and
only by halves. Excluded from honors and employment, they are
constrained to the rigid payment of tithes for a form of worship
which is not their own. Their children are not even admitted into
the national universities, and yet, influential both from their numbers
and wealth, they are left at full liberty to assemble, to debate, to
print—to exercise, in fact, every means of inflaming their resentments.

For thirty years Priestley was the most eloquent, bold, and perse-
vering organ of their grievances. He put forth twenty volumes in
this service. In this service solely did he write against the celebrated
treatise in which Burke predicted in so true and startling a manner
the evils which must flow from the French revolution. Apparently
the object of Priestley’s reply was not well understood in France, for
he owed to this his nomination as French citizen and member of the
convention, two titles which, at that time, seemed to sit but ill on so
warm a defender of revelation and universal toleration. The first he
did not decline, but the exercise of the second was evaded on the plea
that he did not sufficiently understand the French language.

Without pronouncing as to the substance, it must be conceded that
the political writings of Priestley unite a rare moderation in terms to
a consistency of principle not less rare. He asks nothing for dissenters
which he does not equally ask for catholics, and with more urgency
for the latter as the greater sufferers. No catholic has more vividly
painted the oppression under which nine-tenths of the Irish people
labor. :

I know not what gratitude the catholics may have evinced for
these efforts of a unitarian in their behalf, but this extension of his
good will had no tendency, we may well conceive, to reconcile him
with the Anglican party. To the high churchmen he had become by
these means the obiect of a concentrated hostility ; those who wrote
MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 149

against him were held in peculiar favor, and in some cases were, on
this very account, rewarded with prelacies ; which led Priestley pleas-
antly to observe “‘ that he might be considered as holding the portfolio
of such benefices in his own hands.’’ But the aversion he inspired
did not stop within these venial limits; there is too much reason to
think that the popular turbulence of which he was the victim was
greatly fomented by the intemperate writings and discourses of min-
isters of the establishment.

The first movements of the French revolution had at that time
wrought division, not only in France, but in all the States, cities, and
even families of Europe. As yet there was no outbreak but in France,
but men disputed everywhere, and, strange to say, it was precisely in
the freest countries that the greatest ardor for revolution manifested
itself. Under these circumstances the partisans of the British gov-
ernment had recourse to means of which the enemies of government
in France were setting a successful example, and prompted the popular
riots by which the revolutionists, or those suspected of being such,
were assailed,

Not the least formidable of these riots was that which occurred at
Birmingham, July 14, 1791. A banquet was given on that day by
persons of different sects, including some episcopalians, to celebrate
the anniversary of the attack upon the Bastile, and it was reported
that Priestley was the chief promoter of the festival. As his enemies
had spared no means of inflaming the popular mind, resorting even
to the fabrication of tickets of invitation replete with sedition, and
of toasts steeped in criminality or absurdity, a heated crowd is soon
collected ; the calumny circulates and is aggravated by the most
odious imputations ; and the tavern finally, where the guests are assem-
bled, is assaulted and sacked. The furious multitude exclaim aloud
against Priestley ; he is the organ of dissent, the file leader of revo-
lution, the man against whom has long been levelled the hatred of
every true friend of his country. The moment has arrived when they
can avenge themselves.

The unfortunate philosopher, so far from participating in the dinner,
was ignorant of what was imputed to him and of all that was passing
in the city. But an excited rabble listens to nothing ; they conclude
that he has taken flight, and proceed with torches and other instru-
ments of destruction to his mansion.

This was a modest retreat, half a mile in the country, where he
lived with his wife and two sons in the simplicity of ancient manners.
Here it was that he had received the homage of men illustrious by
birth or merit, none of whom would have been content to leave Eng-
land without seeing him; and here for eleven years he had divided
his time between the pursuit of science, the instruction of youth, and
the exercise of that charity which he considered the first duty of his
ministry.

Here there was only one ornament to beseen, only an incomparable
one ; the rich collection of instruments, in great part devised and con-
structed by himself; the focus from which had radiated so many new
truths, and which had diffused inestimable benefits among those who
now rushed to its destruction; for these were almost all artisans of

150 MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY.

Birmingham, and among the numerous manufactures of that city,
there is scarcely one which does not owe some improvement in its pro-
cesses to the discoveries of Priestley.

But what avails gratitude against the spirit of party, or does the
people know ought of services of this kind? A1l was laid in ashes ;
apparatus, in which experiments designed for the solution of import-
ant questions had been for months in process of development, records
of the observations of many years, works in course of preparation, a
large library, enriched with notes, additions and commentaries, were,
in a few moments, with the house itself, utterly destroyed.

It was truly afilictive that such a man should thus see the fruits of
forty years of honorable assiduity and wise economy suddenly snatched
away—a loss not merely of his moderate fortune, which he might
have disregarded, but of the works of his hand, the conceptions of his
genius, the fund which he had reserved for the meditations and em-
ployment of his remaining life. Fortunately his family had been
apprised of the approach of the mob, and had withdrawn him in time
from the dreadful spectacle.

The riot continued three days, and the houses of his friends under-
went the same fate with his own. As usual, it was the victims who
were accused, and the public journals failed not to announce that there
had been discovered among the papers of Priestley the proofs of a
wide-spread conspiracy.

This calumny is sufficiently refuted by the fact that he openly resided
two years more near London, in the college of the dissenters at
Hackney, where he succeeded the celebrated Dr. Price in the professor-
ship of chemistry. There was time enough to bring him to justice,
and no want of zeal on the part of his accusers, if there had existed
the slightest proof.

They confined themselves to painting him in the most odious colors
in political pamphlets and periodicals. Few instances can be found
of such overflowing rancor, nor would it be easy to credit this rage
of defamation against a man who conferred so much honor on his
country, had we not before our eyes the examples which the last fifteen
years have furnished of the power of party spirit to envenom men’s
opinions, and those which the last fifteen centuries exhibit of the fury
with which personal crimination may be urged when the pretext is
religion.

Nothing in the character of Priestley seemed calculated to produce
such hostility ; his sentiments were never influenced by his contro-
versies, as might be shown by his friendly intimacy with Dr. Price,
though they had often written against each other. So far from any
turbulence or haughtiness of manner, his conversation was always
noted for the same modesty which pervades his writings, and nothing
was easier with him than to say, J do not know—words which the
generality of professedly learned men find it so difficult to pronounce.
His countenance bore rather the impression of melancholy than of
animation, though he was by no means indifferent to the company of
his friends, and enlivened their intercourse with a natural and becom-
ing gaiety. This man, so profound in many parts of science, passed
several hours of each day in teaching the young. This was with him
MEMOIR OF PRIESTLEY. 151

a favorite occupation, and his pupils still revere his memory with
filial tenderness, many of them with genuine enthusiasm.

But no consideration could induce him to pause when he thought
there was some truth to be defended, and this trait of character, so
admirable in itself, destroyed the effect of more amiable qualities and
constituted the torment of his life; because he carried it to exaggera-
tion, and because he forgot that reasoning is the least of the means
which must be used to make men adopt opinions which conflict with
their habits of thought or temporary interests.

The insults heaped upon him, and the fear of again compromising
the lives and fortunes of his friends, at last made a sojourn in his own
country intolerable. In his new engagements at Hackney, industry
and patience might repair, as they had already in part repaired, the
disasters of Birmingham; but this consideration was not sufficient to
detain him; and as coming to France during the war would have
given countenance to the charges of his enemies, he could see no
chance of repose except in the United States of America. Yet was it
some time before he found it even there; English prejudices followed
him beyond the seas, and not until the accession of Jefferson to the
Presidency was he free from the apprehension of being obliged to quit
that asylum.

The dedication of his Ecclesiastical History to that great magistrate,
in acknowledgment of the tranquillity restored to him, and the reply
of Jefferson, afford a noble specimen of the relations which may sub-
sist between men of letters and men in place without humiliation to
either.

Priestley proposed to consecrate the rest of his life to the work just
mentioned, in which he intended to comprise the development and
proofs of all his theological opinions; but he was arrested at the fourth
volume by a fatal accident. His food, by some unknown means,
proved one day to have been poisoned ;* his whole family was placed
in jeopardy, and his own health languished from that time forward.
A gradual decay terminated his life after three years of suffering. He
died at Northumberland, in Pennsylvania, February 6, 1804.

His last moments were marked by the effusions of the same piety
which had animated him through life, and which, from not being well
regulated, had occasioned all its errors. He caused the Gospels to be
read to him, and thanked God for having granted him a useful life
and peaceful death. Among his chief blessings he ranked that of
having personally known all his celebrated cotemporaries. ‘‘I am
going to sleep lke you,” he said to his grandchildren, who were
brought to his bedside; ‘‘ but we shall all awake together,’’ he added,
looking towards the attendants, ‘‘and I trust to everlasting happi-
ness.’’ ‘These were his latest words, and they bear witness to the
belief in which he died.

Such was the end of a man whom his enemies accused of wishing to
subvert all religion and morals; but whose chief fault was to have
misconceived his vocation, and to have attached too much importance

The statement made here, as well as in some other works, of the poisoning which
occasioned the decline and death of Dy. Priestley rests on little or no authority.—TZranslator.

to his private sentiments in matters where the most important of all
sentiments must be the love of peace.

[Nore.— We are informed by Lord Brougham that, on settling at
Warrington, ‘‘ Priestley married the daughter of Mr. Wilkinson, a
respectable iron master in Wales. She was an amiable woman and
endowed with great strength of mind, which was destined afterwards
to be severely tried.’’ By her he had three sons and one daughter,
of whom the youngest son, Henry, the peculiar companion of his
father’s agricultural labors at his new home, in Pennsylvania, died at
the age of eighteen, in 1795. The mother died ten months later.
‘«' These blows,’’ says Lord B., ‘‘ though he felt their weight, did not
at all crush him; his resignation was exemplary, and his steady,
enthusiastic faith in revelation gave him a certain hope of meeting,
before many years should elapse, with those whom he had lost. It
was, indeed, quite evident that religion was as much an active princi-
ple in him as in any one who ever lived. Not only is it always upper-
most in his thoughts, but he even regards temporal concerns of a
public nature always in connexion with the Divine superintendence,
and even with the prophecies of Scripture. His letters are full of
references to those prophecies as bearing on passing events, and he
plainly says that, since his removal to America, he should care little
for European events but for their connexion with the Old Testament.
He also looked for an actual and material second coming of Christ
upon earth.”’

The descendants of Dr. Priestley appear, from an account received
through the courtesy of a grandson, Joseph R. Priestley, to be widely
dispersed. Not only do several of them remain in his native country,
at London and Birmingham, but others are to be found at Northum-
berland, Pennsylvania, where he settled in this country ; at New
Orleans ; at Atlanta, in Georgia; and even at Melbourne, in Austra-
lia. He was buried at Northumberland, and the following is the
inscription on his tomb :

Dr. JosePH PRIESTLEY,
Who departed this life on the 6 Feb., 1804,

NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 15

INSTRUCTIONS IN REFERENCE TO COLLECTING NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH
AMERICAN BIRDS.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

The Smithsonian Institution is desirous of collecting as full a series
as possible of the nests and eggs of birds of North America, with the
view not merely of exhibition in its museum, but to furnish ma-
terials for a work on North American Oology, in preparation by
Dr. Brewer, of Boston, and to be published in successive parts by
the Institution.

This memoir is intended to give an account of the geographical
distribution of North American birds, as well as of their habits and
peculiarities during the breeding season, and to be accompanied as far
as possible by accurate figures of the principal varieties of the egg of
each species, based upon photographic drawings. Of this work, the
first part, embracing the aptores (vultures, hawks, and owls,) and
Fissirostres, (swallows, swifts, and goatsuckers,) is nearly ready for
publication, and will be issued during the year 1859.

The object contemplated by the institution is not merely to procure
specimens of eggs not previously in its possession, but also to obtain
positive evidence as to the limits within which each species rears its
young. Jor this reason it respectfully invites donations from all parts
of the country of as many kinds of nests and eggs as can be procured,
with the exception of a few of the very commonest species hereafter
to be mentioned; and requests that special effort be made to procure
a full series for each locality. As duplicate eggs of all kinds, and
in any number, can be readily used in the exchanges of the Institu-
tion, and in supplying other cabinets, no fear need be entertained of
sending more than enough for the purposes in view.

The eggs, of which a single set only need be collected for the present,
are chiefly those of the eastern blue bird, (Sialia sialis,) the robin,
(Lurdus migratorius,) the cat-bird, (Iimus carolinensis,) the red-winged
black bird, (Agelaius phoeniceus,) and the crow black bird, (Quiscalus
versicolor.) Those to which particular attention should be paid as
groups, are the hawks, owls, woodpeckers, small waders, ducks, &c.,
of all portions of the country ; but, as stated, all kinds of eggs, and
particularly those from the regions west of the Mississippi, and {rom the
northern parts of America, are desired. A subjoined list embraces the
specimens more particularly wanting to the collection of the Institution ;
those having an asterisk prefixed being, with rare exceptions, entirely
unknown to science. The numbers in the list refer to a printed cata-
logue of North American birds, published by the Institution, which
will be sent to any one who proposes to collect eggs for its museum.
154 NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.

In this catalogue about 720 species are enumerated as now known,
while of these the eges of more than five hundred are marked as
desiderata, more than three hundred, or nearly one-half, being
unknown in American collections. Among easily identified species
most wanted are the California vulture (Cathartes californianus ;)
the swallow-tailed hawk, (Nauclerus furcatus,) and the black-should-
ered hawk, (Zlanus leucurus) of the south; the burrowing owl of the
plains, (Athene hypugaea,) the ivory-billed woodpecker, (Picus princi-
palis,) the western hairy woodpecker, (Picus harrisit,) the red cock-
aded woodpecker of the south, (Picus borealis,) the red-bellied
woodpecker, (Centurus carolinus,) the red-shafted woodpecker or
flicker of the west, (Colaptes mexicanus,) the Oregon robin or varied
thrush, (Zurdus naevius,) the California blue bird, (Sialia mexicana,)
the Rocky mountain blue bird, (S. arcéica,) the western nuthatch,
(Sitia,) the fish-crow of Puget Sound, (Corvus caurinus,) all the jays
of the Rocky mountain region; the Canada jay, (Pertsoreus cana-
densis,) the band-tailed pigeon, (Columba fasciata,) the wild turkey
of New Mexico, (Meleagris mexicana,) all the quails or partridges of
western Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona; the whooping or white
prairie crane, (Grus americana,) the glossy ibis, (Ibis ordii ;) most of
the snipes, sandpipers, curlews, and other small waders; the two
species of swans, (Cygnus,) most of the geese and ducks; the booby
gannet of Florida, (Sula jiber,) the wild pigeon, and many other
species,

The following details will be found to contain all the instructions
necessary to the preparation and preservation of oological collections:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING AND PRESERVING.

The nests of birds are to be sought for in all localities and in diffprent
months of the year, according to the latitude, May and June being
generally the most productive. Many of the rapacious birds, how-
ever, begin to lay much earlier in the middle States, even in February
and March.

When a nest containing eggs, or one newly constructed, is dis-
covered, it should not be disturbed, if possible, before the parents have
been observed hovering around or near, and thus identified. If the
species cannot be otherwise positively determined, a parent bird should
be secured, and either the whole skin be prepared, or a portion—as
the head or wing, and preserved for identification. The whole bird
may be thrown into alcohol, and thus easily kept.

The services of boys and other persons on farms, plantations, &c.,
may be called to great advantage into requisition in collecting eggs.
Whenever they have found a nest, however, it should not be disturbed
before information is communicated to and the spot visited by some
one competent to determine the species, unless the parents can be taken
with the nest. No pains should be considered too great to secure the
certain identification of each set of eggs. If, however, this identifi-
cation should be impossible, the eggs should still be preserved, as the
species can usually be approximated to, if not absolutely determined,
by an expert oologist.
NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 155

Sometimes by removing all the eggs in a nest, except one or two,
without handling those left, quite a Jarge number can be obtained
from one pair of birds; generally, however, the nest will be found
abandoned on a second visit.

The nests may not always be removable, and in such cases, full men-
tion of their position, character, &c., should be carefully made. Nests
constructed in bushes er on trees usually need but slight precautions
for their preservation intact. Those on the ground often require to
be secured against falling to pieces by a little judicious tying
together, or even by a few coarse stitches with a thread and needle.
A little cotton packed in the nest above the eggs will generally keep
the latter whole until reaching home, unless subjected to a violent
shock. It will be safer, however, to enclose each one in an envelope
of cotton.

It is absolutely necessary, in all cases, to empty every egg of its
contents, in order to preserve the shell for cabinet purposes ; and this
should be done at the earliest moment possible. It is accomplished in
various ways: the simplest, when the egg does not contain a young
bird, being to prick a small aperture at each end (or better, perhaps,
on opposite sides) with a sharp needle, (a three-cornered one answers
best,) one rather the larger, through which the contents are blown
by the application of the mouth at the other. Delicate eggs, how-
ever, when fresh, can be best emptied by suction, a small quantity at
a time of the contents being drawn into the mouth, and then dis-
charged.

Should there be an embryo in the egg, or should the contents have
become thickened by long standing, it will be necessary to make a
larger aperture in the side by pricking out a circular piece of shell
carefully with the needle. A smaller hole may then be made opposite
to this, at which to apply the mouth in blowing, or the embryo may
be picked out through a single large hole. It will be of much interest
to preserve all embryos in alcohol for further investigation.

European collectors usually make two small apertures close to each
other on one side, instead of on opposite sides. The discharge of the
contents of the egg is facilitated by the use of a small conical blow-pipe
or tube, the smaller end so fine as to enter the smaller aperture. A
stream of water injected by the mouth through the tube into the
aperture will be found an expeditious method of emptying the egg,
but it must be conducted very carefully. When a large hole is made,
the tube may be directed through it to the opposite side of the egg,
and a current of water forced in this will soon discharge the contents.
When practicable, the white membrane, the edge of which usually
protrudes from the opening after the liquids are forced out, should be
seized with a pair of forceps and pulled out, as, if left, it may discolor
the egg, and will always attract insects. If not too small, the egg
should then be partly filled with water through the tube, or by laying
one hole against a saucer of water and sucking through the other,
and carefully rinsed out. After the water is again blown out, the
egg may be allowed to dry by placing the larger hole downwards on
blotting or absorbent paper or cloth. When dry, the eggs should be
replaced in the nest, or laid carefully away, care being taken to add
156 NESTS AND EGGS OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.

a number or other mark showing the locality, date, collector, and
supposed species, as well as relationship to an embryo removed, or to
any portion of the parent preserved. It will in most cases be best
to attach the same number to nest, eggs, embryo, and parent
belonging together. This mark may be made neatly on the eggs,
itself with ink and a quill pen, or on a label carefully packed with
them. <A record book showing what has been taken and preserved,
with dates and explanatory remarks, should always be kept.

In making the apertures in eggs that have peculiar markings, care
should be taken to select some inconspicuous spot that will leave the
pattern of coloration undisturbed. Hggs that are cracked may be
greatly strengthened by pasting tissue or other thin paper along the
line of injury, or what is easier, and in most cases even better, by brush-
ing collodion along and over the cracks. It is often well to cover the
punctures or holes cut out, especially if large, with thin paper or gold-
beaters’ skin. Ifa piece be removed, it can usually be easily replaced
and kept in by pasting thin paper over it and the line of separation,
or around the latter.

Notwithstanding the apparent fragility of eggs, a very little expe-
rience will enable any one to empty them of their contents with great
ease and safety. The principal accident to be guarded against is that
of crushing the egg by too great pressure between the fingers ; these
should be applied so as to barely hold the egg, and no more. If the
operation of emptying be performed over a full basin of water, the
occasional dropping of the egg from the finger into the water will be
attended with no harm.

To pack eggs for transportation, each one should be wrapped ina
light envelope of cotton and laid down in layers separated by strata
of cotton. They should be kept in rather small boxes of wood, or if
pasteboard be used, these should always be transmitted in wooden
boxes, as the eggs are thereby less likely to be broken by a sudden jar
or shock. If the nest is sent along, it may contain the eggs belong-
ing to it, each one wrapped in cotton, and the vacancy of the nest filled
with the same or other light elastic material. It will be well to pin
or tie up each nest in paper to keep it secure, and to prevent entangling
of the materials when several are laid together. A temporary box
may often be readily constructed of pasteboard, to contain the more
delicate or valuable ones.

Whenever practicable, the embryos or young found in the egg
should be carefully preserved in alcohol, great care being of course
taken to mark the specimens properly. The better plan will be to
keep each set in asmall bottle or vial, and a slip of stiff paper or
parchment placed inside with the number or name. Whenever the
abundance of the eggs will warrant it, a large number with the
young in different degrees of development, even as many as fifty of a
kind, should be secured. The embryos in this case need not be re-
moved from the egg, which should, however, be cracked at the blunt
end to facilitate the entrance of the spirit. _ Researches at present in
progress relating to the embryology of birds promise results of the
highest interest in reference to ornithological classification.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

The Smithsonian Institution has undertaken the preparation of a
series of reports cn the insects of North America, with the view of
attracting attention to and facilitating the study of a department of
natural history, which, though so much neglected, is yet of great
practical importance to the agriculturist and rural economist. These
works will consist—first, of catalogues of all the known genera and
species of each order, with reference to the places of publication ; and
secondly, of monographs and detailed descriptions of both old and new
species, so as to enable any one interested in the subject to identify the
insects met with, and to prosecute investigations respecting them.

Towards the accomplishment of this object the Institution has
already published a catalogue of the North American Coleoptera, by
Dr. F. E. Melsheimer, andalso one of the Diptera, by Baron Ostensacken,
while similar catalogues of Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera,
and Diurnal Lepidoptera are in an advanced state of preparation. It
is now proposed to take up a very interesting and extensive group,
that of the Moths or Night Butterflies, and contributions of materials
towards a work on this subject are, therefore, respectfully solicited.
There is no locality in the country where new species may not be
readily obtained, and from which complete collections are not desira-
ble, although novelties are most to be looked for from the regions of
the west. From every region the most common and familiar species are
equally desirable, with the rarest and most striking ; the object being
not merely to collect all the species, but also te determine accurately
their geographical distribution.

In the following pages will be found special instructions for collect-
ing insects, furnished for this article by different entomologists, with
some general remarks on the subject taken from Samouelle’s Entome=
logist’s Companion.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 159

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.

<¢ Insects are so various in their habits that they may be found in
every part of the world, at all seasons of the year, and in every situa-
tion.

As some localities are more congenial to their nature than others, I
shall mention such as will be likely to furnish the best result to the
Entomologist :

Woods, Hedges, and Lanes.—These situations furnish by far the
greatest number of insects. In woods the Entomologist must beat the
branches of trees into his umbrella, or folding net, and must select
for this purpose open paths, the edges, &c. The trunks of trees,
gates, and felled timber, should be carefully examined, as many of
the Lepidoptera and Coleoptera are found in no other situations.
Many rare and very beautiful insects are found in the hedges, in
lanes, as also in the nettles, &c., which grow under them; these should
be well beaten, especially when the white thorn is in blossom, in the
months of May and June. Hedges in dusty roads are seldom pro-
ductive.

Heaths and Commons.—Many insects are confined to these situa-
tions, not only on account of plants, which grow in such situations,
but by the cattle and their dung, in the latter of which many thou-
sands of insects may be found—mostly in the months of May, June,
and July; these are principally Coleoptera.

Sand-Pits.—In such places will be found many minute Coleop-
terous insects, as well as wasps, &c.; the roots of grass, at which the
former are found, should be closely examined.

Meadows, Marshes, and Ponds.—In meadows when the Butter-
cups (Ranunculi) are in blossom, many Dipterous and Hymenopterous
insects are found. The drills in marshes should be examined, as many
species of insects are found on the long grass, as also the larve of
many Lepidoptera. Neuroptera are abundant in such situations, espe-
cially if any hedges or trees are near the spot.

The mud which is brought up from the bottom of ponds should
be thoroughly examined, and such small insects as are found may be
put in a small bottle filled with water, which will not only clean them
but keep them alive. ‘To the Entomologist this mode of collecting
will be very advantageous, as he will thereby obtain many species of
Dysticide, Notonectidee, &e.

Moss, Decayed Trees, Roots of Grass, dc.—Many insects will be
found in moss and under it ; the roots of decayed trees afford nourish-
ment and a habitation to a number of insects; many of the larve of
Lepidoptera penetrate the trunks of trees ; most of the Cerambycids
feed on wood, as well as some species of Elaters, &c. In seeking for
these a sharp digging instrument is generally used, as it is sometimes
necessary to dig six or seven inches into the wood betore they are found.

460 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

Banks of Rivers and Sandy Sea-shores.—These situations are pro-
ductive of a great variety of Coleoptera, and other insects.

The dead animals that are thrown upon the shores should be care-
fully examined, as they are the food of Silphide, Histeride, Staphy-
linide, &c. May and June are the best times for collecting in these
localities.

Dead animals and dry bones should be constantly examined, as
these are the natural habitations of many insects.

Fungi, boleti, and flowers, should be carefully, when met with,
examined, as many exceedingly rare insects inhabit them.’’

General Remarks.

The insects of this order are mandibulate, or furnished with jaws,
and may be distinguished by the upper wings being converted into
hard corneous shields, which protect wholly or part of the upper sur-
face of the abdomen. They are very numerous, more than 8,000
species having already been collected in the United States, while
several thousand species probably remain to be discovered, especially
in our Territories west of the Mississippi.

On account of the ease with which the specimens are obtained and
preserved, this is the favorite order of insects with collectors, and
although not equalling in beauty the Lepidoptera, the gem-like lustre
of many is not without merit, and above all the very distinct generic
and specific differences leading to more accurate classification have
induced many scientific men of high ability to devote their time assidu-
ously to this order, and with the happiest results in philosophic
generalizations.

The species are to be found in almost every variety of situation,
among which may be here specified, under stones, especially where
the soil is not very dry ; under bark of dead trees in ants’ nests; in
fungi, on leaves of plants, especially on the low trees and shrubbery
on the edges of forests and streams; in dead carcases of animals; in
excrement. Many are seen flying and alighting again in roads
during the hotter part of the day ; some live in water, and can only.
be procured by small nets, while a great number of minute species
may be taken on the wing just before sunset. Many are found only
on the shores of the ocean, under material cast up by the waves; @
large number will be attracted by a light near an open window at
night. For the purpose of more easily securing these, the table on
which the light is placed should be covered with a white cloth. Fi-
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 161

nally, many minute species will appear on throwing with the hand
water on the damp mud of the banks of streams and lakes.

The most suitable times for collecting Coleoptera are the spring and
autumn ; during the great heats of July and August they diminish
greatly in numbers; the search for them should begin as soon as the
frost is out of the ground; at such times water beetles and those
found in ants’ nests, under bark, and under stones, are numerous.

COLLECTING INSTRUMENTS.

The collector of Coleoptera will require three nets: a large one,
fourteen inches in diameter, made of thick white muslin, of strong
construction, suitable for beating the bushes or for taking specimens
on the wing, provided with a handle not more than fourteen or
eighteen inches long; a smaller one, ten or twelve inches in diameter,
also of strong construction, with a bag of millinet, suitable for raking
up material from the bottom of ponds, streams, &c.; and a third, with
along handle, provided with a bag of gauze for catching cicindele,
(the actively flying species seen in roads.) These nets are suitable
for the collection of all insects, and their form and construction have
been described under the directions given regarding other orders.

A very convenient bag may be made for beating bushes, &c., out
of a bar hinged at two places, so as to form an isosceles triangle ;
the long legs serve as handles, and the bag of muslin may be fastened
to the short leg and the bases of the long ones. An umbrella frame
covered with white muslin also answers an excellent purpose.

Much may be done in the collection of minute Coleoptera by passing
the material washed up by the waves of a lake or stream, or the earth
of an ant’s nest, through a sieve having not very fine meshes; the
material passing through is received on a sheet of paper or a hand-
kerchief, gently pressed, and then watched carefully for a few moments;
the insects may be detected by the moving of particles,.and can then
be easily secured.

METHOD OF PRESERVING SPECIMENS.

A. For Transportation.

Coleoptera obtained on journeys, where economy of time and space
is of importance, should be always placed in strong alcohol. The
bottles to receive them should be small, not more than eight ounce
bottles for large species, and one ounce or smaller for the minute
ones. When the bottles are filled with specimens, the liquid should
be poured off and replaced by strong alcohol; thus the specimens will
be rendered firm and can be preserved indefinitely. Z’he colors do not
change.

If bottles are in danger of being broken, the specimens, after re-
maining for a day or two in alcohol, may be taken out, partially
dried by exposure to the air, but not so as to be brittle, and then
packed in layers in small boxes between soft paper ; the boxes should
then be carfully closed with gum paper or paste, so as to exclude all
enemies.

B. For Collections.

Where the specimens are intended to be placed immediately in a
cabinet, the smaller species should not be put in spirits, but rather
in homeopathic vials, in each of which is a small piece of bibulous
paper moistened with ether. Thus the specimens do not become wet,
and can be gummed on cards without delay.

Pinning.—Coleopterous insects, more than one-tenth of an inch
long, unless of very narrow form, should be pinned through the right
elytron, in such manner that the pin passes out beneath, between the
middle and posterior coxa of the right side ; the pin must be graduated
to the size of the specimen. German pins alone should be used ; they
are not so long and of harder and more elastic metal than the French,
and much better pointed. Short English pins should always be
avoided ; they bring the specimen too close to the bottom of the box.

Insects less than a tenth of an inch long, or very narrow species of
larger size, must be gummed on cards, which are placed on pins of
No. 1 or No. 2. For economy in travelling, several cards may be
placed on one pin, in which case the cards should be larger and put
on No. 3 pins; they can afterwards be cut down to the proper size.

I have found the most convenient method of preparing cabinet
specimens to be the following: Cut thin Bristol board into strips
about one-fifth of an inch wide; from these, with sharp-pointed
dissecting scissors, cut small isosceles triangles, in number equal to
the specimens to be prepared; place each one on a pin about three-
fourths of its height; then selecting the specimen to be prepared,
arrange the feet and antenne with two camel’s hair pencils, or with
one pencil and a pin; clip the end of the triangle so as to give a base
about one-third or one-fourth of the length of the insect, holding the
pin with the card in the left hand; touch the tip of the card with a
pin dipped in the cement, then lifting the insect with a moistened
pencil, place it at right angles to the altitude of the triangle and on
the left hand of the pin; this position, if neatly given, and without
any superfluity of cement, enables the under surface of the specimen
to be very thoroughly examined.

The best cement is a mixture of inspissated ox gall, gum arabic,
and water, and should be so thick that the specimen will remain in
the position in which it is placed. Gum arabic alone is too brittle; the
specimens prepared with it are apt to come off. Gum mixed with a
little brown sugar answers very well; so does the common mucilage
of the shops.

Setting.—The antenne and feet of small specimens should be drawn
out so as to enable them to be examined when necessary; of large
specimens, they should be moved with brushes or fine forceps, with
the same object in view. Any system of regular setting such as is
adopted by English collectors of bringing the feet and antenne as
nearly as possible on a plane with the body is reprehensible ; nothing
can be more awkward than the appearance of a box of specimens thus
prepared, and the specimens themselves are much more liable to injury.
The posture should be as nearly as practicable that assumed by the
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 163

animal when moving, and the legs should therefore be in a somewhat
depending position.

Cabinets.—The specime.s should be preserved, either in drawers with
tight covers in which are fitted panes of glass, or in boxes with very
carefully fitting covers which lift off; boxes in the form of books are
also used, but the cover being affixed to the box is in the way of the
student. I have found that the best size for boxes required for con-
stant study is 12 inches by 81 or 9 inches, (inside measurement ;) the
depth is to be proportioned to pins used, but one inch and a half clear
of the cork, with which the bottom is lined, will be found ample. The
boxes should be made of thin, well seasoned board, so that they will
not become warped, lined with sheets of cork, such as used for boot
soles, then neatly papered, and kept horizontally in a piece of furni-
ture made for the purpose, the doors of which fit very closely by means
of a tongue and groove running all around. Camphor should be kept
always in abundance in the boxes or in the cabinet alongside of the
boxes, and during the warm season every box should be looked at at
least once in each month. The presence of infection is seen by the
dust at the bottom of the pin bearing the infected specimen ; this
should at once be removed and dipped in alcohol or boiling water,
Where it can be procured, benzine is the best material to use; it is to
be applied with a pencil over the whole surface, and then the speci-
men is to be brushed with a clean pencil. Such preparation is con-
sidered in Paris to protect the specimen ever afterwards from infection.

I have tried various poisonous solutions, such as tinctures of strych-
nine, picrotoxine, piperine, &c., without avail. Arseniate of potassa.
will protect the specimens but injure the appearance very much.

When a specimen is badly gummed or pinned, it is to be thrown in
boiling water for a short time, varying from half a minute to five
minutes, depending on the size of the specimen, and the pin or card
can then be removed, and the specimen repinned or reset on a clean
card,

For the purpose of distinguishing specimens from different regions,,
little disks of variously colored paper may be used ; they are easily
made by a small punch, and should be kept in wooden pill boxes ready
for use; at the same time a key to the colors, showing the regions
embraced by each, should be made on the fly leaf of the catalogue of
the collection, or in the Melsheimer catalogue, so as to be ever at hand
for persons consulting the collection.

The specimens should all be pinned at the same height; the ease
of recognizing species allied in characters is greatly increased by hav-
ing them on the same level, and a general appearance of neatness is
given which cannot otherwise be obtained.

It is better, even where numbers with reference to a catalogue are
employed, that the name of each species should be written on a label
attached to the first specimen. Thus the eye is familiarized with the
association of the species and its name, memory is aided, and a greater
power given of identifying species when the cabinet is not at hand,

No manual applicable to the Coleoptera of the United States has
yet been prepared ; such a work is much needed, as the student is now
obliged either to seek in a large number of works the information he
164 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS,

desires, or to rely on his specimens being named by some person who
has already mastered the difficulties of this bibliographical maze.

HYMENOPTERA.*

The Hymenoptera are insects furnished with four membranous wings,
and which, in general, are capable of wounding by means of a sting,
such as the wasps, hornets, bees, ichneumons, &c. They should be
taken in a net or in pill boxes, but never more than a single insect
should be put in one box.

They are found on flowers, bushes, and on walls, exposed to the sun
or warmed declivities, in sandy places and in the earth. Their
presence is often at once recognized by the existence of numerous
holes in sandy places or in walls forming their habitations or the
places where their young are deposited; all the ants belong to this
order of insects. When an ant’s nest has been found it is necessary
to open it in order to secure a large number of individuals; in the
interior, individuals with wings are found; these are the males and
females, which it is very important to obtain.

The collector should secure the nests of Hymenoptera; they will be
found fixed to the roofs of houses, in the holes of trees, pendent from
branches, &c. The nests are often closed and have but one orifice ; this
may be frequently stopped up and the branch containing it cut off and
secured with all its contents. When they are more fragile they should

vbe carried in boxes, with which the collector should provide himself,
for this purpose, and protected by means of cotton or soft moss. It
is very important to know what are the species which construct these
nests, and it 1s therefore indispensable either to pin the insect and in-
clude the nest on the same pin, or fix the two on pins designated by
the same number.

The collector should make a record of his observations, designating
the individuals by numbers in case he is unacquainted with their
names, and note the peculiarities of their habitations, their prey, their
utility or their injurious qualities or habits, &c.

Hymenoptera should be set in the same manner as the Diptera, and
should be killed by means of the fumes of sulphur or with chloroform.

‘The legs should be placed in a natural position, and the tongue
pushed forward so that this important organ, when present, as in bees,
xmay be easily examined.

ORTHOPTERA.+ (Linn.)

Earwigs, cockroaches, spectres or walking-sticks, praying-mantes,
grasshoppers, katydids, crickets, We., belong to this order; their
habits are generally to feed upon vegetable matter of all kinds, and
some of them, as the cockroaches, prey upon various materials of food

in houses, &c. : :
Ear-wigs are mostly to be found, during the day time, concealed in

the corollas of flowers and between the leaf and stock of certain plants
having no foot-stalks to their leaves; in the evening they are active,
and may frequently be taken with a net, whilst flying, just before
sunset. |

Cockroaches of various kinds may be found beneath sticks, stones,
rubbish, &c., and under the bark of decayed trees, mostly in damp
situations.

Spectres or walking-sticks are to be found upon trees and shrubbery,
and require very close searching to discover them, their color being
generally so much like that of the bark or twigs of the trees they
inhabit.

Praying-montes are usually most abundant in gardens upon all
sorts of vegetable matter, and, being large and conspicuous objects,
may be readily seen and captured with the hands or net. Their time
of appearing is from the middle of July to the end of summer.

Grasshoppers are abundant everywhere ; some of the species fly very
swiftly, and can only be obtained by following them with the net. The
species are usually most numerous upon heaths, commons, and fields
of grass. There are also a few kinds found jumping about near the
margins of streams upon bare sandy places not covered by the water
at high tide. These insects may be found during the whole year, but
their numbers greatly increase as the warm weather comes on.

Katydids live wpon trees and high shrubbery, and may be best
collected by beating into an umbrella; this must be done quickly,
howeyer, as they very soon recover from the effects of their fall, and
their long legs enable them to jump to great distances ; their time of
appearing is late in the summer or early part of autumn.

Crickets are found the whole year round under logs, sticks, and
stones ; their numbers are considerably increased by the early part of
autumn, when they may be collected by sweeping from the grass, d&ec.

All the kinds of insects before enumerated may be placed in alcohol
and suffered to remain in it for a considerable time without much
change in their colors; it is very necessary, however, to have the
bottles filled quite full in order to transport them; shaking about
separates the parts, Wc.

This order of insects may be collected during the entire year, but
the best times are in the warm parts of spring and autumn ; at these
seasons their eggs are generally laid and the creatures arrive at their
full state of perfection.

HEMIPTERA.,

This order includes what are properly so called bugs, harvest flies,
or cicadas, (improperly called locusts,) tree-hoppers, vine-hoppers,
plant-lice, &c. The bugs are divided into terrestrial and aquatic.
The terrestrial kinds are all found during the warm weather upon
vegetable matter, and may be collected in all the ordinary ways, sha-
king into an umbrella, sweeping from the grass and low plants with
a net, picking up with the hands, &c. The aquatic species can be
obtained by fishing with a net amongst the mud at the bottom of
ponds and streams and amongst water plants, and some are found
166 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS,

skimming over the surface of the water. There are also a few kinds
to be obtained from the banks of streams in the sand and among the
stones, under the bark of decayed trees, &c.

All the remaining insects of this order may be found on trees and
plants, some living upon the leaves and others upon the trunk and
stems; they may be captured by beating into an umbrella or sweep-
ing with a net. Grape-vines will be found specially productive.
Their time of appearance is during the warm weather, from the begin-
ning of summer to the end of autumn.

NEUROPTERA.

Dragon Flies, Ephemere or Mcy Flies, Lace-winged Flies, Ant
Lions, White Ants, Caddis-worm Flies, (Phryganide,) Scorpion Flies,
dc.—Dragon Flies inhabit the water in their first stages, and the
perfect insect will be found most numerous in the vicinity of pools,
marshes, and watery places. They are found only during the warm
weather of spring and summer. The best method of collecting them ~
is to station yourself close to the bushes, sticks, &c., upon which
they settle, and wait till they alight, when the net may be thrown over
them. A little practice, however, will enable you to capture them
upon the wing, and by this means you will secure many rare species
which could not be otherwise obtained. These insects had better not
be placed in alcohol, as it will soon destroy their colors, and render
them valueless; the best method yet discovered is to have little paper
bags adapted to the size of the insects, into which they may be slipped
after closing their wings against each other, and having wetted their
bodies all over with alcohol by means of a camel’s hair pencil, which,
together with a small vial containing the alcohol, may be carried in
the pocket.

The Agrionide, sometimes called Darning-needles, must be treated
differently ; it will not do tu place them in papers; they must be
pierced through with a pin and then stuck into the hat, a box, or
something the collector must carry for the purpose. They are usually
very abundant in meadows, near small brooks, ditches, &c., settling
upon bushes and projecting objects.

Ephemercee are generally best collected during the evening. The
young of these and the Caddis-worm flies inhabit the water, and near
it the imago will be found, sometimes in immense flocks, each one
making a gyratory motion and flying with prodigious swiftness,
usually around some adjacent tree. They must be collected with the
net and pinned at once.

Lace-winged Flies are to be found upon trees, plants, &c., and, with
the Scorpion Flies, may be beaten into the umbrella or swept into the
net. All the remaining insects of this order, together with these two
kinds of flies, must be pinned at once, and not placed in bags or
alcohol.

Ant Lions will be found flying about near the margins of woods and
in sandy places, near fences, &c. They are distinguished from the
Dragon flies by the greater length of their antenne, which always
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 167

have a knob at the end. They must be killed, like the Dragon flies,
by applying alcohol with a brush.

White Ants will be found swarming in decayed logs, beneath stones,
&c. They are very tender, and must be pinned at once. The insects
of this order live during the warm weather only, and can be collected
in the greatest numbers when the sun shines warmest and the days
are fine. Many of them may be obtained by spreading a sheet in the
woods or near some stream, among the bushes, during the night, and
placing over it a bulls-eye lantern; the insects will be attracted by
the light, and by means of the white sheet they can be more readily
seen and taken with the net. This is also a most excellent method of
mothing during the hot summer evenings.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING DIPTERA.
BY H. LOEW, WITH ADDITIONS BY R. OSTENSACKEN.

The first instrument I use in a locality, the fauna of which I am not
well acquainted with, is a linen bag, fourteen inches in diameter and
two and a half feet long, a little rounded at the top or apex, and
attached to a strong iron ring, with a hollow metallic handle, in which,
if necessary, a cane or other piece of wood may be inserted. With
this bag I begin to sweep, and in a short time ascertain what insects
abound in the grass, on the flowers, or in moist or dry places, &c.
After the last sweep, by a dexterons twist of the handle I throw the
apex of the sack over the ring, so as to prevent the escape of the
insects, and give them time to compose themselves at the bottom. It
is then opened, and I insert my head into it to see what I have cap-
tured. They immediately begin to move upwards. The common
specimens I allow to pass; but if there is one which I desire to take,
I let it advance to the middle of the bag, and then gently grasp it,
from the outside of the bag, with the right hand. The other captives
I drive down to the bottom by blowing moderately on them, and con-
fine them there by letting the ring fall over the right hand, which
holds the insect, which is now easily seized with the left hand. This
operation is repeated until everything desirable is taken out, when the
bag is emptied of its contents by inversion, and the sweeping recom-
menced.

This is the most important of all the implements used by the Dip-
terologist. Its employment prevents him from wasting his time in
barren localities, promptly indicates the presence of rare species, and,
by furnishing this information, enables him afterwards to have an
abundance of specimens.

When I have, by the use of the bag, discovered the locality of rari-
ties, I use another instrument, which is nothing more than an ordi-
nary insect-forceps, of the form shown in fig. 1. Here, 6 is the place
for the thumb, c is the joint placed near the handle in order that the
168 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

forceps may be closed rapidly ; the remaining portion of the arms
should be made so stout that they will not spring when closing the
blades ; d is a pin to prevent lateral motion when the blades are closed;

\ eS angle and straight
S side are useful in
capturing insects in particular situations. Then the space between the
rings, on their internal side, must be covered with the best bobbinet,
tightly drawn and securely sewed, so that a perfectly level surface be
formed, in order to prevent the captured insect from struggling. The
insect is pinned through the openings of the bobbinet, and is then
easily transferred to the collecting box, or stuck into the sides or top of
your hat, at pleasure. Two views of the instrument are given to
illustrate its form more fully.

This instrument is not adapted for very small insects. For such, a
forceps with finer bobbinet is used, but even this is superfluous, if you
have become expert in employing the bag in sweeping, as well as in
holding it under plants, bushes, and flowers, and, by gently striking
or shaking them, allowing the insects to fall into it. Neither does it
answer for the capture of very active species. It is, for the most part,
useless to pursue such, and only betrays the intemperate zeal of the
beginner. It is better to ascertain where such species pass the night,
and thus you can easily capture that with your fingers which at other
times would cost much labor. An excursion early in the morning,
before the dew is off, is often very productive.

To carry more instruments with you than those just mentioned is
an unnecessary burden.

Besides the capture, the breeding of Diptera, is of the greatest im-
portance, and, for the most part, easy. The principal rule I follow,
in order to secure the perfect insect, is, to be in no hurry about
taking the imperfect one. If there is reason to presume that the
larvee will change into the pupa state at the place where it is found,
I wait until then and gather the pupas. On a contrary presump-
tion, I take the larvee only when I observe that they are preparing for
the pupa state. Decaying wood, mould in hollow trees, manure, and
ground-earth under manure, stems of plants, grass, stalks of hollow
weeds, dried flowers and their seed vessels, particularly of the Com-
posite, furnish me the richest booty.

A bag full of the dried flowers of the Composite, or a bundle of dry
burdocks and thistles, which I have had gathered for a few pennies, has
always furnished me with something good. ‘The pupe of Diptera do

a

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS, 169

not require much care; only do not let the place in which they are
kept be too warm. Those I wish to separate are put in large glass
jars, the tops of which are covered with paper. The others I place in
a wooden box, which I keep in an unheated room, on the window-sill.
When they are developed from the pupa towards spring, they natu-
rally fly to the window, from which I take them with a glass vial, or,
what is better, with a small chip-box furnished with a glass bottom.

The third point of great importance is the preparation and pinning
of the specimens for the cabinet. Sulphuric ether and chloroform are
but inferior means of killing them. Specimens too long exposed to
these agents are apt to spoil, and, if too little exposed to them, they
revive. They answer only for certain tender minute species, of which
I shall speak below. The best means of killing them are kreosote and
the smoke of a strong cigar. The general rule is, to pin the flies
whilst living, and thus to put them into the collecting box, which
should have the bottom well moistened with kreosote, and be made
tight. The captives will soon die, and thus, time afier time, fresh
subjects may be put in as they are caught. I have had boxes in which
the largest Diptera were almost immediately killed, although the kreo-
sote had not been renewed for six days, and which were still fatal to
smaller species for six months afterwards. If you have no boxes thus
prepared with kreosote, or, if you wish to avoid the odor of it, then
prepare a box, so that, when it is full of pinned specimens, you may
blow a few strong puffs of cigar-smoke into it, and all life will soon
cease.

In the pinning of specimens, the long pins are greatly to be "s- *
preferred to the short ones. Five-sixths of all the entomolo- @
gists now use the long pins. mn, fig. 2, is the normal length ta
of pins which are used for Diptera; the finer kinds may be of +4
the length md. The insects must be pushed high enough up
the pin to enable the surface of its back to be examined with an
ordinary lens without being incommoded by the pin’s head.
The back of the insect must, of course, be a little nearer the
pin’s head than the length of the focus of the glass. As smaller
insects must be examined by glasses of higher power, they must
be brought nearer the pin’s head than larger ones.

Large flies may be pushed up so that their backs come to 8, ‘
which smaller ones should reach a, Since the beautiful magni-  !
fiers of Oberhauser, which allow the application of a lower power,
have come into use, insects may be pinned at a greater distance from
the head, but not much greater.

The minute and tender species, such as the smallest Cecidomyic,
Campylonyze, and others, must be treated differently. They cannot
be pinned in the ordinary way with safety. Van Heyden has pro-
posed the most rational and elegant method. The smaller species are
caught by the linen bag, and are then put into very porous chip pill
boxes, and are killed with cigar smoke, if boxes moistened with
kreosote are not preferred. When twenty or thirty are captured the
box is turned up so that specimens fall into the cover. They are then
transfixed from below on fine silver wire, but not so as to allow the
wire to project beyond the thorax, The silver wire must previously

Iv
170 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

be cut with ordinary scissors into pieces of proper length and taken
with you. The wire must be inserted into the insect by means of a
very delicate pincers, and with the same instrument the other end of
the wire must be stuck into a box, the bottom of which is covered
smoothly with the pith of plants. Over the pith thin paper may be
fastened in order to render the surface still more smooth. The top or
cover of the pill box, in which the insects are placed while transfix-
ing them, must not be too shallow, so that they may not be blown
away by the wind, if the operation is performed in the field. The use
of a glass vial for the capture of small insects is not to be recommend,
as the moisture separates their parts and thus spoils them. The vial
may be used on excursions, when you desire to take home a single
living insect for the purpose of examining the organs of its mouth or
its internal structure.

Those specimens which have been transfixed on the silver wire, as
above indicated, are prepared for the coliection in the following way:
In the fall, stalks of weeds with pith not too porous, and before it is quite
dry, must be collected. The best adapted for this purpose is the pith of
Artemisia, and, still better, of Verbascum, (mullein.) It is cut into small

insect pins of moderate size are inserted through these
small pieces at the place indicated by the dot, (fig. 5,) and the
pieces are pushed up nearly to the pin’s head. As the pith
is still moist it will adhere to the pin in drying, and by the
slight coat of verdigris which will soon be developed, the
insects, which have been previously attached to the silver wire
are now inserted on the free end of the pith with the delicate
pincers, where they will stick fast enough if the proper kind
of pith has been used. Pith of Sambucus, or elder, Helianthus,
or sunflower, and similar plants, do not answer the purpose,
because it is too porous. The insect should stand a little
higher than the head of the pin, so that it may be conve-
niently examined from all sides. The silver wire used for this purpose
should be of the very best quality so as to prevent the development
of verdigris.

In regard to the Tipularia, and some others, whose legs easily break
off, my method is the following: I capture them with the forceps and
pin them as other large specimens. Before pinning, I press the thorax,
so as to prevent all struggling ; I then stick the pin through a piece

Fig. 6. of paper of this form, (fig. 6,) and push it up far
enough to receive the legs of the insect neatly spread
out or turned under it. When the insect is dead I
remove the paper, which, however, might as well
| be suffered to remain.

The boxes in which Diptera are kept should be
about a foot square, the top should be glass, and
made to fit tight to the other part by a double rab-

bet. Some persons, in addition, fasten the cover down by means of
brass hooks, to prevent warping, (fig. 7.) Fig. 7.

The boxes may be made of any well seasoned
wood. The bottom of the boxes should be |
made of wood cut horizontally from the trunk
in plates one-fourth to one-third of an inch |
thick, and in this case we may use the harder
kinds of wood from deciduous leaved trees,
except when the rings making the last growth ————_______
of the year are very hard, or else a very soft wood may be used, such
as the partially decayed wood of dead linden or poplar trees ; but the
pieces are cut out lengthwise in the ordinary way. In both cases the
finest pins can be easily inserted into the wood without risk of injuring
their points and hold very well. But in the latter mentioned kind of
bottom a fine pin readily takes a wrong direction, and after having
been taken out it is difficult to insert it again in a perpendicular posi-
tion. The use of soft material for lining the bottom of the boxes has
been generally abandoned in the best collections. It is only when
perfectly tight boxes cannot be procured that the lining is used, and
then not so much with reference to the insertion of the pin as to facili-
tate the poisoning of the box and to exclude the acart, psoci, and other
insects. The best material for this purpose is blotting paper spread
over with mercurial ointment, and over this is laid a fine oiled silk of
light color. The oiled silk may be faintly ruled with cross lines to
facilitate the symmetrical arrangements of the specimens. If the oiled
silk is fine enough it offers no perceptible resistance to the finest pin.
But a more serious inconvenience is, that it prevents us from seeing
the texture of the wood at the place where the pin is to be inserted,
and hence the points of the very fine pins are lable to injury. On
this account it is much better to use wooden boxes without any lining,
and these when neatly made look well enough. But if it is deemed
desirable to still further improve the appearance of the boxes, a sheet
of thin paper may be spread over the bottom, provided the texture of
the wood is very uniform or very fine pins are not to be used. This
paper may be renewed from time to time, and should be fastened by
glue and not by paste, which only furnishes a bait for destructive
insects.

If it is deemed advisable to poison the boxes, it is most conveniently
dore by means of bits of felt smeared with mercurial ointment, which
are fastened in the covers. During the examination of the insects the
covers may be set aside, if any injury to the health is apprehended ;
but of this there is not the slightest danger.

In securing the insects in the collection there is one indispensable
rule: nothing should touch the bottom. The labels of genera and
species, as well as those on the pin, with each specimen, should be as
high as possible; the first being nearly.on a level in the specimen.

The labels are best made of stout paper, as they are then better
kept in position on pins of moderate thickness.

to allow the head of the loosening pin to

Note by R. Ostensacken.—Collectors of
Diptera should always endeavor to obtain
both sexes of every species. The sexes in
the families of the Tipulidae and of the
Asilidae (for the greater part) are easily
distinguished by the form of the abdomen,
which is generally club-shaped or obtuse
in the male, and more or less pointed in the female. In other fami-
lies (Z'abani, Syrphi, Strationydae, Bombylii, and in most of the true
Muscidae) the eyes are close together in the male, and separated by
the “front’’ in the female. Sometimes they are separated in both
sexes, but then the front of the male is generally narrower than that
of the female. If these characters fail to help in distinguishing the
sexes, the size, and especially the shape, of the abdomen will be sufli-
cient. The males are, for the most part, smaller than the females,
and have the abdomen more slender.

It often happens that one of the sexes appears in great abundance,
while not a single specimen of the other can be seen. In such cases

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 173

the following observations of Dr. Schiener (Wiener Entomol. Monat-
schrift, 1858, p. 175) may prove useful :

‘‘Hrom manifold and repeated experience I have arrived at the con-
clusion that whenever one sex of a Dipterous insect appears in great
numbers, the other is always to be found somewhere in the immediate
neighborhood.

“Tf the males soar in the air we can generally predict with certainty
that the females are not far off quietly reposing on trunks of trees, as
is the case with the Anthomyzide, or on the under side of leaves, as
with the Syrphide.

“Tf every indication of the resting place fails, I then commence
catching everything living and flying in the immediate vicinity,
sweeping in the air and shaking or beating the leaves and grass, and
in this way I have generally succeeded in obtaining, among one hun-
dred specimens of the one sex, at least one of the other.

“The males soaring on the tops of mountains are generally isolated,
but on descending several hundred feet we will seldom look in vain for
the other sex resting on leaves or the heads of umbelliferous plants.

‘‘T have even succeeded, by patient perseverance, in discovering
single males among the numerous female horse-flies (Zabant) which
attack cattle.’’

Those who wish more detailed information about the localities where
rare species of Diptera have to be looked for will find them in Bremi’s
excellent paper on this subject, (Isis, 1846, p. 163,) as well as in an
article of Mr. Hoffmeister, in the ‘‘Entomologische Zeitung” of
Stettin, 1844, p. 350.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING LEPIDOPTERA.
BY BRACKINRIDGE CLEMENS, M. D.

This order of insects includes the butterflies, sphinges, and moths,
and is divided by systematists into two very distinct and easily recog-
nised sections.

The members of the first are known as diurnal Lepidoptera, or
Rhopalocera, and are characterized by possessing antenne that are
always club-shaped at the extremity, by their diurnal flight, and the
wings being held elevaied during repose. They are commonly desig-
nated butterflies, and their diurnal habits and beauty render them
familiar objects to the most casual observer. Their natural history,
also, is much better known than that of the members of the second
great group under this order, the great majority of those belonging to
the United States having been described in Boisduval and Leconte’s
Iconographie des Lepidoptéres de |’Amerique Septentrionale, and in
the works of the older entomologists, Cramer, Drury, &c. There
are, however, doubtless, many species still undescribed, but the writer
wishes to direct special attention to the individuals of the following
group, which, being far more unfrequently the objects of attention,
174 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

are but little known, and it is particularly to them that the following
instructions must be understood to apply, while at the same time they
are applicable to the diurnal species.

The second section, to which the attention of students and observers
is specially called, is composed of the sphinges, or hawk-moths, and
millers or moths, and known as Heterocera. Their antenne are of vari-
ous forms, and never club-shaped at the extremity; their flight is usually
nocturnal, and their wings, in repose, with a few exceptions, are flat.
The merest novice in entomology, by keeping in mind these marks of
distinction, can have no difficulty in recognizing the members of these
two great groups. The nocturnal lepidoptera or heterocera differ
greatly in size, some being very large and beautiful; others, again,
are small, even minute, and their colors frequently sombre and dull;
but it is hoped that none will be neglected on account of this diminutive
size or unattractive appearance. When, however, the specimens are
minute a certain degree of manipulative delicacy, acquired by prac-
tice, is requisite either to pin them successfully or to set the wings
subsequently. For this purpose small pins, manufactured especially
for this use, may be procured. Those made in London are preferable
either to the German or French.

HOW TO COLLECT LEPIDOPTERA.

The body and wings of lepidoptera are covered by minute scales,
which are attached by a slender stalk to the external surface. They
are easily detached from their connections, and it is very important
that the collector should avoid, as much as possible, denuding the
surface whilst taking specimens, or manipulating them after their
capture. Badly denuded specimens are quite worthless, because,
when the peculiar markings or ornamentation of the wings are effaced
or injured, they are not attractive objects for the cabinet, and if new,
a good specific description cannot be made from them, This caution
should attract, therefore, the particular attention of every one who
undertakes to collect. Moths should never be taken by the wings with
the fingers. If no other means of securing them is at hand, it is far
better to permit them to enjoy their life and liberty than to endeavor
to make specimens of what would be only an incumbrance to any col-
lection. When it is necessary to seize them, either for the purpose of
pinning or to cripple them after capture, it must be done according to
a prescribed mode, in the application of which the specimen is sub-
jected to the least possible injury. In order to accomplish this the
insect is seized firmly with the thumb and forefinger by the sides of
the thorax, beneath the wings, or, rather, in such a manner as to elevate
them and hold them immovable. The pressure is applied at the base
of the wings, and must be firm and steady, for the insect is able to
make strong resistance with the muscles of the thorax, and is liable
to escape.

It would, perhaps, be proper to mention here that two divisions of
lepidoptera are frequently mentioned by name in entomological works,
the one as macro-lepidoptera, including the rhopalocera, sphinges,
bombyces, geometrides, and noctuides; the other as micro-lepidoptera
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 175

which is composed of the pyrolides, tortrices, tineides, oterophorides,
and alucitides. Some of the macro-lepidoptera, however, are of small
size, whilst, on the other hand, many ot the ‘‘micros’’ are comparatively
large; but there is a certain convenience in the use of the terms, as
standards of comparative size, which renders their occurrence quite
frequent.

The implement most used in capturing lepidoptera is the ring-net,
made as will be hereafter described. By means of this they are taken
on the wing, and as they hover over or after having alighted on flow-
ers, leaves, &c. The requisite dexterity in using it efficiently is soon
acquired by practice, and a little experience respecting the habits and
mode of the flight of the objects sought. When the insect is once with-
in the net it can be kept quiet and at the bottom, by keeping it in
motion from side to side, so as to permit the air to rush through its open
end, But how can the specimen be secured with the least amount of
injury? There are several ways by which this can be accomplished.
When the specimen is of large size the net should be seized with the
left hand in such a manner as to prevent fluttering as much as pos-
sible, and to guard against its pushing itself into the folds ; and it is
then seized by the thorax with the thumb and forefinger of the right
hand in the manner heretofore described, and smartly squeezed so as
to crush it and thus deprive it of life; or it may be touched on the
head through the net with the glass stopper of a bottle containing
chloroform ; the bottle having been shaken previously to removing the
stopper it will carry enough to benumb completely the largest moth
after two or three successive applications. I much prefer this to com-
pression of the thorax, although the insect usually revives, but this
can be prevented after pinning by using some one of the poisons to be
hereafter mentioned. The effect of chloroform applied thus is almost
instantaneously to quiet the most violent flutterer, nor is it necessary
that any other portion of the insect than the head should be wetted by it,

When the captive is a “ micro,’’ it may be prevented from escap-
ing by blowing a vigorous stream of breath on it through the open end
of the net; but if it proves to be too strong to be kept down thus, the
net must be immediately put in motion again to prevent its escape,
turning the open end alternately trom one side to the other. After
throwing the specimen well in the apex by this means, my own mode
of operation is to grasp it with the left hand, taking care to have the
thumb and first finger upward, just above the specimen, and thus close
the net. Then by elevating the hand through the ring or on a level
with it, a common cupping glass of about two inches diameter, or a wine
glass, carried in the pocket, is placed on the top of the left hand over
the constricted portion, the grasp relaxed, and the insect permitted to
escape through the opening into its interior. The glass is then closed
below by the left hand on the outside of the net, and may be trans-
ferred to the top of the collecting box, where it can be quieted with
chloroform and pinned. All lepidoptera, except those of large size,
can be easily secured thus, and without in the least stripping any por-
tion of the body of its scales. The smaller tortrices and tineae, which
can be kept within the net by blowing, may be likewise secured by the
glass, which is placed over them as they sit on or ascend the sides of
176 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

the net, andI much prefer it to the ordinary mode of securing them in
pill boxes. The English entomologists all use the pill box, I believe,
to secure a micro after it is within the net, but it involves the neces-
sity of carrying a great many of them in the pockets, and the trouble
of killing one’s captures after returning from the field wearied with
exercise. Therefore I much prefer to kill and pin on the field, although
to accomplish the latter satisfactorily often requires, in consequence of
the minuteness of the objects, a steady hand.

When walking over grassy meadows or amongst low herbage I am
in the habit of using the net by sweeping, and to very great advantage.
This operation is performed by giving the net an alternate right and
left motion as the collector walks forward, keeping the open end in-
clined at about an angle of 45° to the plane of the surface, touching
with the lower part of the ring the tops of the grass and herbage, and
as the net distends itself with air, being careful that the apex does not
drag or strike when it is turned at the extreme right and left points
of the sweep. The motion should be gentle and continuous, and the
mouth of the net merely reversed in the alternation, so that the apex
is kept constantly flying in the air and free from contact with any sur-
rounding bodies. By this means he secures everything that rises as
he advances, and after every half dozen sweeps the net is brought to
the face, and a stream of breath blown into it whilst the collector in-
spects the interior. Should it contain anything he desires, it may be
selected, or even a half a dozen ‘‘ micros’ secured one after the other
by means of his glass, and all brought at the same time to the top
of his collecting box in the most perfect condition. In this manner I
have often collected 150 specimens during a few hours’ walk in the
afternoon and evening. The operation may not be made very com-
prehensible by description, but a few endeavors to practice it, will
soon put tbe collector in possession of the art. Of course, sweeping is
inapplicable when the grass and herbage are wet with dew.

In addition to these means of collecting, the ‘‘ micros’’ may be taken
in pill boxes wherever they may be seen, should the net not be at hand,
and the collector will find it advantageous always to carry a few in his
pocket during the entire collecting season.

The wide-mouthed bottle, presently to be referred to, forms an excel-
lent collecting agent in the field, or to capture those which are attracted
to our rooms by light during the nights of summer. Or the cupping-
glass or wine-glass will enable one to secure many exquisite specimens
in the field during the hot, sultry days of June and July, when they
will be found on the leaves of the herbage of the cool, shady wood,
gamboling over their surfaces like veritable elves, or so immovable
that they seem to be enjoying an afternoon siesta, or feasting on odor-
ous wild flowers. In using the glass for this purpose, the object must
be gently approached so as not to alarm it, and the glass cautiously
advanced until it is just over the spot occupied by the specimen, whilst
the left hand is advanced beneath ; the glass is then brought down
rapidly over the object upon the left hand which closes it, and if you
have struck skilfully, secures you perhaps a rare species in all its

original beauty.
The collector will soon ascertain what are the most productive
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. b hy a

localities in his neighborhood, and where particular species are to be
had in greatest abundance. When these are once ascertained, let him
learn to hunt quietly, and endeavor to bring into exercise his powers
of observation ; never moving until he has scanned every leaf and
object around him, noting the habits of the little people of the great
unknown world by which he is surrounded, their peculiar mode of
flight and concealing themselves, and the situations which appear
most agreeable to them. His net should always be in readiness to se-
cure everything which his motions and footsteps may startle, but should
he fail, let him not, to the infinite alarm of the minute inhabitants of
the forest, rush headlong after it through brambles, herbage, and
grass, and over the decayed trunks of trees, striking frantically this way
and that, until he glows with a heat above the summer point, and is
bathed in perspiration and fairly disgusted with Entomology, which
involves so many discomforts. Let him rather be self-possessed and
cool, mark where the coveted object alights, and he can easily secure
it without affecting the steadiness of his nerves, and perhaps rendering
the specimen worthless subsequently, during the operation of pinning.
This, of course, is advice to the incipient collector.

The nocturnal Lepidoptera may be taken by stratagem as well as by
coup de main. Prominent among the expedients used for this purpose
are what is called sugaARING, and the use of LIGHT.

To obtain moths by means of the former, a mixture of coarse vrown
sugar and ale, with the addition of a little rwm, should be made. The
mixture should have the consistence of treacle. The collector, with an
assistant, should take his mixture to the wood about sunset, or a little
before or after, and daub it on the trunks of the trees by means of a
brush, or saturate strips of cotton cloth with it and tack them to the
trunks. Assoon as it gets dusk the sugared places should be revisited,
and the light from a bull’s-eye lantern thrown on the sugared spots.
For several hours the moths will continue to arrive, sometimes in con-
siderable numbers, and may be taken with the net, which should. be
held beneath the sugared spot previously to turning on the light, as
many have the trick of falling; or captured, as they sit feeding on the
dainty bait, by means of a wide-mouthed bottle having ammonia or
chloroform on cotton or a sponge on the bottom. The noctuae are
principally obtained by this means, and one or two expeditions should
be made every week during the collecting season, viz: from early
spring until the latter part of autumn, avoiding localities where odor-
ous flowers are plentiful. The collector should not be discouraged if
troops of moths do not come at his first invitation, or even if he should
be compelled to return home rich in patience but very poor in specimens.

The fascination of the ‘‘ foolish moth’’ by light has a time-honored
use, having served to adorn many a tale and point many a moral; and
yet there is beneath the fact a hidden meaning or moral, perhaps,
unsuspected by either poet or moralist. Itis sufficient for the collector
to know they are fire-worshippers, and to avail himself of this tendency
to secure their fleeting forms in their season. This may be done by
taking a lantern into the open country near a wood, and suspending
it over a white sheet spread on the ground, thus showing their forms

12
178 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

more distinctly, when they may be captured with the net. But this
expedient is very far inferior to sugaring.

Many specimens can be taken with but little trouble by placing a
light within a room on the ground floor before a closed window, par-
ticularly one facing a garden or the open country. The moths will
flutter on the outside before the light, or alight on the panes of glass,
when they can be easily secured in pill boxes, killed and pinned as
they arecaught. Moonlight nights are unfavorable to the use of light.

Those who live in towns lighted by gas will be able to secure many
specimens around the lamps; or by making friends with the lamplighter
and supplying him with pill boxes, he may furnish you every morning
with many specimens and sometimes rarities. In using the light for
making captures, care should be taken to guard against the moth
singeing its antennae or wings in the flame.

The males of the Bombyces chiefly may be taken by exposing the
virgin females with crumpled wings on trees, or enclosed in cages,
exposed in the open country.

I would earnestly recommend every collector to note the date of
capture of all his Lepidoptera on a little square of paper, and pass the
pin transfixing the insect through it. It is simply necessary to indi-
cate the month by its initial letter and to give the day in figures. By
following this plan, which will indicate approximately the earliest and
latest periods of their appearance, and the numbers of broods during the
season, he will be able to tell at any time when to look for the species
he may desire, and to form a calendar showing the periods of appear-
ance of species, and will enable one to make accurate comparisons in
this respect between widely separated geographical areas. Many
species of our lepidopterous insects are spread over immense areas,
and some of them appear to be common to the entire continent, and a
calendar of this kind, when once formed, would show the successive pul-
sations of lepidopterous life, (as it advances along the broad sun-track
from the genial regions of the Gulf to our northern boundaries, and
throbs over the great western plains to the Rocky mountains. )

HOW TO KILL LEPIDOPTERA.

Insects should be killed with at least some manifestation of humanity,
so as not to engender a spirit of cruelty in the minds of the young who
may witness the operation, and it should be accomplished, at the same
time, with poisons or agents that can be trusted in the hands of the
young and those inexperienced in their effects. A great variety of
agents have been recommended for this purpose, and it would be quite
unnecessary to allude to all of them.

CHLOROFORM is exceedingly useful to the collector, in consequence of
the rapidity of its effects. It is objectionable, however, inasmuch
if its influence is carried too far it causes rigid contraction of the
thoracic muscles, which throws the wings into. positions that renders
setting them subsequently almost impossible. Moths should there-
fore merely be benumbed by it. A few seconds is sufficient generally
to produce this effect, and the influence of the agent intermitted for
the purpose of pinning the insect. When this has been done, if it is
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. ° 179

of large size, its revival may be prevented by using oxalic acid, as
will be presently explained ; or if a ‘‘ micro,”’ the pin containing the
specimen should be fixed in a piece of cork and introduced into the
ammonia bottle. When using chloroform for benumbing the very
small moths, care must be taken that they do not fall or introduce
themselves into the drop used for this purpose; for it ruins them
irretrievably ; therefore it should be spread by passing the glass which
contains the specimen over it; or, what is perhaps better, the top of the
collecting-box, (since it is in the field that this accident most frequently
occurs, (should be covered with dark colored cloth glued to the surface,
and this will absorb the liquid sufficiently to prevent its occurrence.
The collector should not, then, kill the smaller moths in the field with
this agent, but permit them to revive, and kill and set them after
returning home. It should never be applied to a varnished surface,
for it is a solvent of all varnishes. ;

I would recommend this agent, then, to be used as the means of
abolishing the power of voluntary motion in moths, thus giving the
collector plenty of time during which he may pin them without
struggles or efforts to escape on their part.

OxaLic AciD is employed to kill large moths after they have been
pinned, and should be in the form of a strong water or alcoholic solu-
tion. In using it asteel pen, or a quill pointed like a pen, but without
the slit, should be dipped in the solution and passed into the side of
the thorax under the wings. The pen should be held there for a short
time and moved from side to side so that the whole of the solution
may enter the body. In killing large females it is best to make more
than one application. The objection to the acid is, that it leaves
a white spot, which is apt to spread and disfigure the specimen, but
this can generally with care be obviated. It is possibly scarcely
necessary to state that it is a violent poison when taken internally,
and that the bottle containing it should be the object of some care.

Ammonia is an excellent agent for killing Lepidoptera; the strong
spirits of ammonia should be used. In order to make use of it a wide-
mouthed, moderately deep glass jar should be obtained, and the edges
of the mouth ground down accurately on a piece of sheet lead with
emery and water, so as to allow a piece of heavy plate glass to close
it air-tight. If the jar rises in the centre, the bottom may be filled
with cotton so as to obtain a level surface. When the jar is to be
used, a piece of sponge is wet with a few drops of the ammonia, (the
operator should have some care for his fingers and nose at the same
time,) and the insect introduced, either pinned to a piece of cork or
free as the operator pleases. They soon become motionless, whatever
be their size, but will revive if taken out at once; a half an hour is
sufficient to prevent the revival of the largest moths, but they may
remain without injury 24 or even 48 hours, perfectly relaxed and fit
for setting any time during that period, in consequence of the moisture
within the jar. The small Lepidoptera, tortrices and tineae, taken
in pill boxes, may he killed by placing the lid aslant previously to
introducing the box into the jar. The smallest kinds, the leaf miners,
nepticula and lithocalletis, should be pinned and set out immediately
they are dead. Green moths have their color affected by ammonia,
180 - INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

The carbonate of ammonia is recommended as a substitute for the
spirits, in consequence of no vapor collecting in the bottles, and being
cheaper and safer in the hands of the young. The best way to use it
is first to reduce it to small pieces, (not powder,) and to enclose it in
a small bag made of any porous material, and place it with its con-
tents at the bottom of the bottle, covering it with a perforated card.

HOW TO PIN LEPIDOPTERA.

In the first place, the pin should be adapted as far as possible to the
size of the specimen. The pins in use amongst the German and French
entomologists are too long and slender, and are lable to bend in
thrusting them into the cork unless carefully used. In these respects
the English pin is much to be preferred ; that used for the ‘‘ micros’’
being only three quarters of an inch long. The common pin, about
14 inch long, answers very well for the large moths, and the size
somewhat short of an inch will do for those of moderate size ; but for
the micros it is indispensable to have a supply of Nos. 10, 19, and 20
of the English make. They are manufactured by Messrs. Edleston &
Williams, Crown Court, Cheapside, London.

The pin should be thrust vertically through the body in the centre
of the thorax, or the part to which the wings are attached. After it
has fairly entered the thorax a piece of soft cork is used, by pushing
the point of the pin into it, to raise the specimen the requisite distance
up the pin. At least one half of the pin should be exposed below, and
uniformity in this respect can be obtained by always using the same
thickness of cork for this purpose. When about to pin a specimen
it should be placed on a cloth-covered surface to prevent it slipping
about, and if, under the effect of chloroform, it has turned on its back,
be reversed with a pin; or those of moderate or large size may be
taken by the thorax and feet with the thumb and finger of the left
hand and pinned whilst being thus held, and the position of the
specimen atterwards regulated by the cork. Specimens can be easily
transfixed on the top of the collecting box, if it is covered with cloth,
without the necessity of touching them with the fingers. Many of the
micro Lepidoptera, however, turn upon their backs and project their
posterior legs; if they cannot be easily reversed again with a pin,
they must be taken between the thumb and forefinger of the left
hand, by their projecting legs, and permitted to fall in the space formed
by the contact of these members, with the head to the left or front
according to the position of the hand. Then, by taking a small pin
between the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, and resting the
unoccupied fingers on those of the left, in order to insure steadiness,
the pin is easily pushed through the thorax of even the smallest
species. The success attending this operation depends on taking up
the specimen so that it will rest closely in the sulcus of the thumb
and forefinger, with the head well forward. Of course, previously to
taking it up, the head should be turned to the right. A few failures
in the first instance should not discourage the beginner.

HOW TO SET LEPIDOPTERA.

The wings of lepidoptera are usually set, that is, expanded as
though in the act of flying; but it is well to have one or two speci-
mens showing the wings in their natural position during repose. The
collector should prepare, in the first place, a number of braces of
stiff card, varying in length from half an inch to two inches, cut so
as to taper towards one end, square at the other, and about the fourth
of an inch broad. Through the broad end of each, a large strong
pin should be introduced. A piece of board should then be covered
with sheet cork glued to the surface; this forms what is called the
setting board. When a specimen is to be set, two of the braces are
fixed on the board at a sufficient distance.apart to receive the body
between them, and to support the wings well after expansion. Then,
with a setting needle, a common needle thrust into a piece of wood so
that it can be used more conveniently, the wings are expanded on
the lower braces and fixed there by placing over them additional ones.
Another form of setting board is made by having grooves in it to
receive the body and then by applying braces to the expanded wings
they are easily retained perfectly flat. Some use pieces of plate glass
of different widths to press down the expanded wings, but it is not
the best plan, strips of paper pinned over the wings being preferable.

The wings should be expanded by introducing the setting needle
on their inner margin, or where they meet over the top of the body.
Insects should be left on the board from a day or two to four or five,
according to size and the condition of the weather. Care must be
taken to exclude mites from the board; this can be done by using a
mixture of equal parts of oil of thyme, oil of anise, and spirits of wine.
It should be spread over the setting board, and especially laid on the
grooves, and for this purpose spirits of turpentine is also very effectual
and much cheaper than the mixture of essential oils.

REARING THE CATERPILLAR.—THE VIVARIUM.

The study of Lepidoptera does not consist in the collection of
perfect insects and the investigation of their peculiarities of structure.
They have all lived an active, voracious, and interesting life pre-
viously to transformation from the embryonic state to that of maturity,
and it is the aim of the naturalist, as well as of natural history, to
look kindly into their individual existences, and seizing the particu-
lars of each little life by observation, to write their biographies.
The student must free his mind from the worship of the idols of size
and physical beauty, which incline him to regard with respect him
who devotes his powers to the study of mammals, whilst he smiles
pityingly on one who falls into ecstacies over a new found beetle.
Wherein is the superiority of the former pursuit? The same evidences
of thought are discernible here as there, adaptations more wonder-
ful, habits more interesting and more injurious to our interests, an
anatomy more complicated, physiological questions more difficult of
solution, and even life itself seems to laugh at regularity or harmony
182 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

among the insect world in its manifestations of strange, wonderful,
ridiculous forms, and their mode of ornamentation and clothing. But
here, as elsewhere in the animated world, we have expressed in vital
characters the thoughts and conceptions of a living God.

It is imperatively necessary to entomological science that the habits
and transformations of larvae should be studied and known, and their
forms and ornamentation well described. The study possesses these
advantages over most other departments of natural history, that it
can be pursued during leisure and unoccupied time, its inexpensive-
ness, and the abundance of the objects to be observed. In the trust that
many into whose hands these instructions will fall may become ob-
servers and students of Lepidoptera, and being conscious that to the
novice everything in this connexion is of value, the attempt will be
made to anticipate much that may embarrass him.

Those who delight to ramble in forests and green fields during
the genial days of spring and the cool mornings of summer for ‘‘ air
and exercise,’’ little know how much pleasure and profit result from
such rambles when undertaken with some definite object in view.
Things which were before unmeaning or unquestioned become the
subjects of inquiry and information when that object is connected
with natural history, and every field and hill side, every shrub and
plant becomes the theatre of startling scenes of life and death, of
artifices and devices more incredible and wonderful than the most
fanciful creations of fairy lore. With observation thus kept con-
stantly on the alert, the student will have but little difficulty in finding
the objects he seeks; but we will help him by pointing out such indi-
cations of the presence of larvae as may at first escape his attention.
The early morning is the most favorable time to seek for the cater-
pillar, which seems to prefer its food moistened with dew, although
they may be found during any other portion of the day. When they
cannot be at once seen, their presence is indicated by finding their
‘‘frass’’ or ejectamenta beneath the plants on which they feed ; by partly
eaten leaves, or leaves contorted and rolled into cylinders and cornets
and secured by bands of silk, or superimposed and bound together in
the same manner; by the existence of a hole surrounded with ‘‘frass’’
in the pithy stalks of various plants, or in subcortical mines near the
roots of various trees and shrubs; in the stems and leaves of various
grasses, or living in portable cases on the leaves of plants, or within
houses, feeding on various articles of food and apparel; or by the
existence of discolored patches on the surface of the leaves of various
plants and forest trees, the oaks, the linden, the beech, the iron wood,
the elms, the hickories, the sycamore, &c , caused by minute leaf
mining caterpillars freeing the epidermis in the process of feeding on
the parenchyma, or feeding on grains and the seed heads of composite
plants, on lichens and fungi. Besides the lepidopterous leaf miners
there are coleopterous and dipterous miners, which are rather difficult
to distinguish fromthe former; in general, however, the dipterous
larvae are more maggot-like in appearance, and the coleopterous leaf
miners, in many instances, stain the whole surface of their mines
with their ‘frass,’’ which appears to have been dissolved, whilst
that of the lepidopterous larvae is in little pellets. There is, how-
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 183

ever, no certain mode of distinguishing but by experience, for the
oldest collectors are sometimes deceived. Many caterpillars hyber-
nate during winter, and may be found concealed under stones, &c.
when the cold weather of autumn approaches, or are dug up at the
roots of trees during search for pupe. They should never be kept in
a warmed room, but exposed as soon as taken to the temperature of
the external atmosphere. And lastly, we must not forget to mention
that a number of species inhabit the water plants, growing in quiet
pools and on the margins of little lakes.

With regard to the means of collecting specimens, the student
should supply himself with a number of pill-boxes of various sizes, in
which to carry his captures when found, remembering that some of
them are carnivorous, and will make a meal of their companions
when forced into intimate association. He must note particularly the
plant on which the larva has been found, and put a portion of it in
the box, and remember that in general they will eat of nothing bué
the species of plant on which they were found. Hence it is almost im-
possible to rear a larva which has been met with under conditions
that give us no information respecting its natural food plant, unless
by trying it with a variety we at last accidentally find one it will eat.

He should carry an umbrella, and by beating bushes and the
branches of trees into it with a cane or rod, it will receive the dis-
lodged larvae, and save him the trouble of search. Or several yards
of white cotton sheeting may be spread beneath a tree, and the upper
branches above it beaten with a pole, when we have reason to suspect
the presence of larvae. An ardent collector, living in a little village
in this vicinity, carries with him during his excursions a stout rope
and hatchet. If, in examining the ground beneath forest trees, he
finds fresh ‘‘ frass’’ from the larger caterpillars, he scans the branches
until he detects the eaten leaves, and then, casting his rope over a
stout limb by means of a stone, he ascends the tree rapidly, severs
with his hatchet the branch on which he supposes the larvae to be,
and, descending, secures his well-earned prize. In this manner he
has frequently collected on the hickory during one day twenty larvae
of the rare and beautifuljDryocampa imperialis.

When leaves are unrolled to ascertain if a larva is present, it should
always be done over a spread handkerchief, as otherwise the disturbed
inhabitant may make its escape by falling to the ground. All falling
larvae, however, attach their thread previously to deserting their food
plant, and can usually be found, if they have reached the ground, by
- passing the hand beneath the place where it was, when it will come
in contact with the thread, and this will serve as a guide to find it
again. ‘The mines of leaf miners should not be opened to ascertain
whether they contain an inhabitant ; this information can be obtained
by holding the leaf between the light and the eye.

The collector will sometimes find the egg of some species of ichneu-
mon attached to the skin of the larvae. We do not mean the cocoon
of the larva of a small ichneumon, so frequently mistaken for eggs by
the uninitiated, but veritable eggs, which, if permitted to remain, pro-
duce larvae that will destroy the pupa. This is very easily prevented
by crushing the eggs with a pair of fine-pointed pincers, being careful
184 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS,

not to include the epidermis of the larva. He must learn early to
distinguish the larvae of saw-flies from the true caterpillar. These
Salse caterpillars have globular heads and cylindrical, naked bodies,
sometimes covered with a white flaky substance that easily rubs off,
or have a dark-colored, slimy skin, and are either entirely deprived of
abdominal legs, or have from eighteen to twenty-two, and are unarmed
with hooks. The true caterpillar never has more than ten abdominal
legs, which are always armed with minute hooks.

Every caterpillar undergoes periodical moultings, and they must on
no account be disturbed whilst undergoing this change. When one
of these periods arrive they cease to eat, and appear to be sick and
languisning, remaining steadfastly fixed on some portion of their
food plant, with the hooks of their false legs fastened in a little web
of silk, and, even though irritated, are unwilling to change their po-
sition. It is always a critical time in the life of the larva, during
which it not only changes its skin, but appears in one or two new
dresses before reaching that characteristic of its maturity. The stu-
dent should, therefore, learn early to recognize it, and to respect the
necessities of the little creature of which he has made a captive. When
larvae are dissatisfied with their food plant or about to change to pupae,
they never indicate it in this manner, but traverse their place of con-
finement incessantly and restlessly, travelling over the same track
until they wear it into a pathway.

The chief indications to be observed in rearing larvae is to place
them in as nearly a natural condition as possible, and to keep their
food plant fresh for the longest practicable period. In order to fulfil
these conditions in all cases, something must be left to individual in-
genuity and intelligence, but for the great majority of larvae I would
heartily recommend the following elegant and easily constructed
vivarium :

It consists of a circular wooden box, from six to twelve inches in
diameter or more, at the option of the observer, and from four to six
inches deep, lined with sheet zinc or lead, so as to be water-tight. A
stratum about an inch or two inches thick of washed, fine gravel-
stones is placed on the bottom, and the remaining space is filled with
moisiened but not wet loam, and the surface covered with moss. Into
this various small, humble plants may be set for the purpose of gen-
erating oxygen, and consuming the carbonic acid gas exhaled by the
larvae, and the whole is covered with a bell glass, that rests upon the
rim, proportioned in height to the diameter of the box. When it is
to be used, a portion of the food plant of the larva should be stuck
into the moistened loam, where it will remain fresh quite a long
time, in consequence of the atmosphere within the bell glass being
saturated with watery vapor, which condenses on the sides, and
trickles down to the soil again.

The arrangement of the earthy materials closely resembles that of
natural soil, and if the transformation of the larva is subterranean,
there is no necessity to remove it in order that it may undergo the
change toa pupa. If the larva is a large one, or if it contains more
than one, the bell glass should be elevated every few days, and their
ejectamenta removed from the surface.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 185

The glass merely stands on the rim of the box, and should not be
perfectly air tight; and the vivarium should be exposed to the change
of temperature between night and day, so that the included atmo-
sphere, by its expansions and contractions, may be also renewed from
the external air. It should never, however, be exposed to the direct
rays of the sun, but always kept in the shade.

To those who may regard this apparatus too expensive, another
form is recommended, but it is neither as convenient nor successful,
except in the case of leaf miners and micro-lepidoptera. The top of
a glass jar, at least five or six inches in diameter, is ground down on
a piece of sheet lead with emery and water, so as to be perfectly level,
and to receive accurately a piece of plate glass as a covering, in order
to prevent the escape of moisture. The bottom of this is covered with
moistened sand, a little loam, and the surface with moss. Into this
the food, plant, and caterpillar may be introduced, with the expecta-
tion that the insect will do very well. It is, however, apt to become
foul from the accumulated ‘‘frass,’’? and is inconvenient to clean.

In order to rear leaf-mining larvae that never leave the leaf in
which they are found, or at least not until about to transform, a com-
mon large drinking glass, the top of which has been ground level
and covered with a piece of plate glass, answers a very good purpose.
The bottom should be covered with white sand, moistened, but no
water should be permitted to rest on the surface. It is not necessary,
of course, to place in this apparatus anything more than the leaf,
with a portion of its stem containing the leaf miner. The collector
should provide himself with a tin canister in which to carry the leaves
containing leaf miners during his entomological excursions.

A still cheaper and very effectual breeding cage consists of a frame
of any convenient size, say twelve inches square, covered with bob-
binet, and with a door in front. The bottom must be of wood, and
the plant may be kept fresh for several days by inserting it in a vial
half filled with water.

We have now to touch on what devolves upon the observer, in
making use of these contrivances, to enable him to record the habits
of larvae, and to make good and useful descriptions. In the history
of the life of any being one of the most valuable traits of the observer
is truthfulness, not that we mean to say any one would wilfully mis-
represent what he sees, but that he should be truthful in recording
what he sees and knows to be facts, not what he may imagine or con-
jecture; and however strange it may appear to those not familiar with
these studies, the temptation or inducement to depart from what is
evidently so proper is often strong and of frequent occurrence. Some-
times it is the consequence of hastiness or of inattention, or it is an
apparently plain and obvious deduction; but the ways of nature some-
times surpass in strangeness the ways of our reasoning. All this
involves the idea of accuracy in the description of natural objects, and
it is far from easy to give a clear and graphic conception of larvae by
attempting to represent its physical characteristics in words. The
observer should not be content merely to describe the ornamentation
of larvae, but should endeavor to give, in a clear and concise word
picture, a definite conception of its form, clothing, and external pecu-
186 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

liarities ; and if he can sketch and color natural objects with facility
and accuracy, a collection of drawings representing the larvae, food-
plant, and pupa would be very valuable and interesting.

There are certain terms employed by entomologists which will be of
use to the observer, and which we will endeavor to explain.

Any particular family will always be found to show a variety of
larval forms, which, whilst they conform to a certain type, indicate
by their modifications the relationships existing in every direction
between it and other families. Hence, whilst there is no standard or
invariable larval form for any family, it may be well, by the employ-
ment of general terms, to give the novice some conception of the
affinities, at least, of those which will most probably first attract his
attention.

1. Sphingiform would, therefore, characterize larvae having naked
bodies and a horn or shining lenticular tubercle on the eleventh ring,
and broad, strong anal prolegs.

2. Notodontiform larvae generally have the body furnished with
fleshy elevations, and usually hold the hind segments elevated.

3. Chelonidiform larvae have the body covered by long thick hair,
arranged in verticillate bunches or whorls, arising from verrucose
points or warty excrescences.

4. Geometriform larvae are characterized by the absence of some of
the abdominal prolegs, or the want of development in some of them.

5. Catocaliform larvae have the head rather small, flattened, and
carry it horizontally ; the body is semi-cylindrical, tapering anteriorly
and posteriorly from the middle; a small transverse, fleshy ridge or
prominence on the eleventh segment; the anal prolegs rather long
‘and thrown backwards, generally the first two pairs of abdominal
prolegs not well developed, and the rings of ventral surface marked
with round spots; they arch the body in motion, particularly when
young.

6. Phaleniform larvae consist of the geometers, properly so called,
or measuring worms ; they are characterized by the absence of the first
three pairs of abdominal prolegs quite constantly, leaving but one
pair of abdominal and one pair of anal prolegs, in all ten feet ; the
true or thoracic feet are placed on mammillons, which increase in size
to the third pair; the body is generally cylindrical, and the middle
segments longer than either those of the anterior or posterior portions ;
the eleventh segment is marked on the dorsum by a transverse ridge
or small excrescences, and frequently the fourth, fifth, and eighth
have fleshy excrescences or appendages.

7. Uranidiform larvae will be found possibly in southern Texas or
in Florida; their forms are not well known: They are described as
being either semi-geometrical—that is, having some of the prolegs
absent or atrophied, arching their bodies when in motion, swollen in
the middle, having two retractile tentacles on the head,(?) and living
on the terebinthaceae; or they have sixteen feet complete, are thick,
with deep incisions between the rings, a large head joined to the body
without any intermediate constriction, the first segment having a
corneous and shining shield, and the body furnished with quite long
isolated hairs ; they hide during day under a transparent web of silk
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS 187

spun amongst the leaves, Both forms are of large size, and are
tropical insects.

8. Liparidiform larvae are simply hairy, and generally with brushes
and long tufts of hair in addition.

9. Saturnidiform larvae have thick, heavy bodies, deeply incised,
and furnished usually with rows of blunt or slender acute rigid spines,
and large, strong anal prolegs.

10. Ceratocampiform larvae are also furnished with rows of rough-
ened acute tubercles, but have long rigid horns on the anterior rings.

11. Cochliopodiform or onisciform larvae are very short and small,
either semi-cylindrical or oval, having no visible head, being retrac-
tile, nor visible feet or prolegs. The whole surface of the abdomen is
applied to the object to which they adhere. We have many most re-
markable forms of this family.

12. Gastropachiform larvae are nearly naked, semi-cylindrical,
very much flattened beneath, with fleshy protuberances or tufts of hair
above the legs. They are generally found flatly applied to trees, the
bark of which they resemble. ‘

13. Psychidiform larvae, or basket-carriers, inhabit silken cases,
and attach pieces of leaves, sticks, &c., to the outside.

14. Zortriciform larvae and tineiform larvae, except among the leaf
miners, differ but little in form. They are generally of small size,
smooth, semi-cylindrical, tapering anteriorly and posteriorly, with a
semi-elliptical horizontal head. The former usually roll and bind
leaves together, and the latter live in cases made of portions of leaves,
&c., or in seeds, fungi, on rotten wood and decaying vegetable sub-
stances, or in the interior of leaves between their cuticles.

There are a few very convenient terms which should be used in
describing the ornamentation of larvae.

The dorsal line is a colored longitudinal line on the middle of the
back of the larvae, and follows the course of the dorsal vessel.

The sub-dorsai line is also longitudinal, and placed nearly or quite
at an equal distance from the dorsal and the following :

The stigmatal, which is placed on the sides a little above the feet,
and about the height of the stigmatal or breathing holes.

The papiliform points are dots on the body of larvae, nearly plain,
and scarcely elevated above the surface, each giving rise to a hair.
When they are rougher and more salient, and give rise to one or more
visible hairs, they are called—

The verrucose points, and, as well as the above, are usually disposed
on the dorsum in a more or less restricted trapezoid, or in squares.

: The dorsal region is that portion included between the sub-dorsal
ines, ,

The lateral region is that between the sub-dorsal and stigmatal lines,

The ventral region, all the portion below the stigmatal lines.

The cervical shield is a corneous plate on the dorsum of the first ring.

Shagreened or granulated, when the skin of larvae is roughened by
minute raised grains, but at the same time naked.

Naked or smooth, when the cuticle is without appendages or covering
of hairs.

Scabrous, when any portion is roughly and acutely shagreened,
188 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

Tubercles are hardened elevations, spined, scabrous, plain, cylin-
drical, or lenticular.

Spines are rigid, slender, and acute, and resemble small thorns.

Compound spines, a stalk furnished with numerous simple spines.

Hairs are fine dermal appendages like the ordinary hair; they are
arranged in tufts, pencils, or are verticillate.

Horns are projections from the surface either corneous or fleshy, and
are simple, spined, rigid, roughened, flexible, fleshy, or penniform.

Velvety, when the surface is clothed with soft short hair.

Hairy, when covered with hair either in tufts or verticillate bunches.

Mammillated, when short fleshy projections exist ; they are simple,
spined, or hairy; also called papillae.

Attenuated, when the body diminishes in breadth anteriorly or pos-
teriorly.

Moniliform, when the rings are separated by deep incisions and re-
semble a succession of globular bodies like beads.

Cylindrical and sub-cylindrical, when the body has these geometrical
forms.

Elongated, when the body is slender and appears to have been drawn
out.

Sristles resemble hairs, but are stiff and rather rigid.

The direction in which the longitudinal diameter of the head stands
to the axis of the body is—

Aforizontal, when they form one plane.

Nutant, when its long diameter forms an obtuse angle with the
body.

Perpendicular, when a right angle is formed with the axis of the
body.

Respecting its connexion with the body, it is—

Free, when distinctly visible and not covered by the first ring.

Inserted or retracted, when the occiput, or top, is partly concealed.

Concealed, when entirely withdrawn within the first ring, or is
covered by it.

Retractile, when a concealed head can be thrust out.

Elevated, when the top of the vertex is above the level of the dor-
sum or back.

Bifid, when the vertex is divided into two distinct lobes.

The object in following larvae through their embryonic develop-
ment is to obtain a full and complete history of the species. A good
description, therefore, should correspond to the particulars detailed
below, arranged, in the first place, at the option of the observer, but,
when completed for each species, should begin with a description of
the egg, and follow the history to the development of the perfect
insect,

1°. The date when the larvae was found, and under what conditions.

2°. Lhe name of its food plant, botanical and common.

3°. A description of its physical peculiarities ; commencing with the
head, its size as compared to the body, form, position, and relations
to the body ; then the general form of the body, whether. it varies
from the cylindrical, and how, whether attenuated anteriorly or pos-
teriorly, or swollen or prominent in any portion or deeply incised, and
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 189

the relation of the segments to each other; all protuberances should
be designated, and the nature of the dermal appendages, if any,
noticed ; the number of feet, abdominal and anal prolegs, and the
position of the latter with reference to the plane of the body, on what
rings they are absent or are weakly developed, or are modified.
To indicate the number and situation of the legs and prolegs, I use
the following formula, which is not intended to supplant description:
Every larvae having thirteen segments, including the head, the dots
indicate ssgments without feet thus: (-%--4--+). The formula rep-
resents the most common form, that having sixteen legs.

4°, Its peculiarities of coloring; giving first the general color of
both head and body, and then the ornamentation on each.

5°. The date at which it began to prepare for pupation, and the nature
of its preparations.

6°. A description of the pupa itself. It is not advisable, usually, to
make a description of this from the first or a single specimen.

7°. The date at which it became a perfect insect, and method of us
escape from the cocoon, if tt has one.

8°. The number of broods of the perfect insect during one season, and
whether the period of larval development is annual or bi-annual.

The observer should also endeavor to ascertain and describe—

9°, The egg of the perfect insect, its form, color, and peculiar mark-
ings under a lens. When the perfect insect of a larvae is once
known, this and the following can be ascertained by preserving the
egg layer.

10°. The appearance of the young larva on first emerging from the
egg; the successive changes in appearance it undergoes during its
moultings until it reaches the condition indicative of maturity.

11°. Lhe habits of the larva, including everything pertaining to
larval life, from the time of leaving the egg to maturity, whether
characteristic or not. :

12°. The habits of the perfect insect, as far as they can be ascertained.

The student should begin, in the first instance, with the endeavor
to refer his caterpillar to one of the larval forms characterized here-
tofore, in order to gather his descriptions under general heads. Prob-
ably he will not be successful in referring it to any there indicated,
for several groups have been omitted in consequence of the difficulty
of representing them by any graphic characters. These he may
arrange under any general heading that appears most appropriate to
himself. Each vessel containing a larva should be marked with a
special numeral, beginning with one for the first, and so on, and the
description should be indicated by the same number ; if the pupa is
removed from the vivarium in order to receive another larva, (for two
dissimilar larvae should never be placed in the same vessel at one
time,) that containing the pupa should be designated by the number
referring to the description of the larva, and the numeral should be
marked on a little square of paper and fixed on the pin containing
the perfect insect when it appears and has been killed and pinned.
A specimen of the mature larva described, whenever it can be ob-
tained, should be drowned in alcohol and enclosed in a piece of foil,
such as is now commonly used for wrapping fine-cut tobacco, with
190 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

the number referring to its description, én pencil, on a slip of paper.
Thus prepared, it should be dropped into a bottle of alcohol, together
with the cocoon and pupa, or pupa alone, if it has no cocoon, treated
in a similar manner, and marked with same number. When the
student desires to forward his collection to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the bottles containing the larvae and pupae should have the tops
filled with cotton, then completely filled with liquid to prevent the
agitation of its contents, and tightly corked. The name and locality
of the collector should be written on the top, as also on the box con-
taining perfect insects, and on the copy of his notes. When it is
possible to obtain them, at least from three to six specimens of the
same species of perfect insects are desirable.

I would recommend those who are desirous of becoming better
acquainted with the subject of entomology, and of acquiring some
insight into the classification of Lepidoptera, to obtain The Introduc-
tion to Entomology, by Kirby and Spence, republished by Lea & Blan-
chard, Philadelphia, in addition to ‘‘A Treatise on some of the
Insects of New England which are Injurious to Vegetation. By
Thaddeus William Harris, M. D. Boston: Printed by White &
Potter.’’ There is also another work published by the State of New
York in its natural history series, the chief merit of which, at least
with respect to Lepidoptera, consists in its rather indifferent plates.
It is much more expensive than Dr. Harris’ treatise, and by no means
as reliable, but may enable the student to ascertain the names of some
species by comparing the perfect insects with the plates. Besides
these works there is also a Catalogue of the North American Sphinges,
by Dr. Harris, in the 36th volume of Silliman’s Journal of Science
and Art, 1839; and the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia
will soon ‘publish a synopsis of the same family, representing the
present state of its classification, and describing all the new species
which have been discovered up to the present time. This can be
obtained by students and observers, upon application, for the cost of
paper and press-work, which will be comparatively nominal. This
paper will be followed by synopses of other families as rapidly as they
can be worked up, one of the most serious difficulties being that of
obtaining specimens of all the perfect insects described by foreign
naturalists. If, therefore, those who intend to collect for the Institu-
tion would commence during the present season, and forward to
Washington a box of perfect insects from their respective localities,
it will facilitate the labors of those engaged at present in the study
and hasten the development of this portion of entomological science
in the United States. Any observations the student may desire to
make public should be transmitted to the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia for publication in their ‘‘ Proceedings.”’

THE PUPAE.

The larvae that issue from the egg of the perfect insect in early
spring reach their full development about its latter portion, and en-
tering the pupa state, appear as perfect insects usually in about two or
' three weeks. The representatives of these, generally speaking, do not
become pupae until the beginning of the fall and re.nain in this con-
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 191

dition throughout the winter, emerging as imago during the succeeding
spring. ‘The observer should: therefore begin his search for young
larvae and eggs with the first appearance of vegetation, and either
make them captives or mark the places where they may be found ; but
in general the former is preferable. Feeding and rearing larvae in
spring time has also this advantage: that the food-plant is kept fresh
longer and with less difficulty than in the latter part of summer and
the autumn, and specimens of the perfect insects are obtained the same
season.

After the insect has changed to the pupa it should not be unneces-
sarily disturbed, and never handled with the fingers, except when it
cannot be avoided, and then the utmost gentleness of pressure should
be used. This applies more particularly to pupa which have been
developed in the atmosphere of the vivarium, where its humidity pre-
vents the hardening of the pupa case as completely and rapidly as it
takes place in the external air. When it is removed from the viva-
rium it should be placed as nearly as possible in the same condition
that the larva chose for it, and the new vessel containing it should be
designated by the number of its caterpillar, so that the perfect insect
may be referred properly toits larva. The observer need not be soli-
citous about the apparent impossibility of the perfect insect making its
escape from very dense cocoons, and attempt to aid them by opening
them ; nature has provided a very efficient and powerful means to
effect what is at first view, and what naturalists themselves have re-
garded, a most curious puzzle. Without entering into particulars, I
may say here that the effective and only agent by which this is ac-
complished is the action of the powerful thoracic muscles. The larvae
of the fall months should not be disturbed after entering the ground,
for many of them hybernate until spring in their cells or cocoons made
on the surface when they change to pupae.

The pupae of cochliopodiform or onisciform larvae are always enclosed
in a small ovoid, brittle, silky cocoon, and are difficult to bring to
maturity. The larvae hybernate in them until the following spring,
when they change into pupae covered by a very thin and delicate pupae
case. Their cocoons should be permitted to remain amongst the moss
where they are usually woven, and the moss should be kept moist and
exposed to the external air beneath some convenient and protecting
shelter, and covered with a layer of fine, dried grass during winter.
I have found a great number of very remarkable forms belonging to
this family, but as it was during the period of my own inexperience
in rearing larve, and being unable to obtain hints from others or from
books, for there are none | believe in which the subject is treated, I
lost the greater portion of them and have since looked vainly for other
specimens,

The vessel containing pupae should always be provided with ob-
jects, such as portions of the branch of a tree, fixed in the ground, in
order that the imago when it appears may ascend one of them and
expand its wings. For when they first appear their wings are unde-
veloped, flaccid and moist; they immediately ascend the first encoun-
tered object that is perpendicular or nearly so, and seek to place them-
selves in such a position that their wings may be dependent or hang
downwards fromthe back. Then they begin to grow and develop
192 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

themselves in every direction, and spots which were previously very
small in consequence of the overlapping of the scales, when the pro-
cess is completed, have twice or thrice the original dimensions. The
process of wing expansion should not be permitted to take place in
the moist atmosphere of the vivarium, except in the ‘‘ micros,”’ nor
should the insect be disturbed or killed until after it begins to use its
wings voluntarily ; otherwise it will be difficult to make good prepa-
rations of the wings. These bred insects on first being handled or
when they first feel the effect of chloroform, void a quantity of excre-
mentitious matter, which the student must be careful does not soil the
wings.

The practice of the old trans-Atlantic collectors of obtaining pupae by
digging for them at the roots of trees has been recently revived in Eng-
land with the most successful results by the Rev. Joseph Greene. He
says that ‘‘ meadows and parks, with scattered timber trees, are gene-
rally the best localities; next to meadows and parks come woods ; but
searching in woods is a tedious and fatiguing affair, and requires some
experience ; it is in vain to examine the dense portions, it is equally
vain to dig at the roots of trees in such localities, and you will rarely
find anything unless upon trees of considerable growth ; the thick
moss which collects about the trunks and roots is the part to be
examined. Bombyces are generally found under the moss which
covers spreading roots and not on the trunks, which seem to be pre-
ferred by the Geometrae. The best localities in woods are the borders
or open places; such places when elevated or facing the north are
generally the most productive. The only instrument I use is a com-
mon garden trowel ; the form is immaterial, perhaps a rounded blade
is best, as passing with greater ease between the roots. The trees
which I have found the most productive are the following: elm,
oak, ash, poplar, beech, willow, and alder. [I would likewise add,
for the American collector, the walnut, the wild cherry, the apple
tree, the linden, and the hickory.] In digging, it must be borne in
mind that all pupae are close to the trunk of the tree, seldom more
than two inches distant ; frequently the trunk of the tree forms one
side of the cocoon, especially the cocoon of such insects as spin ; the
chrysalis also les almost invariably close to the surface of the earth.
Insert the trowel about three inches from the trunk, to the depth of
two inches or so; then push it to the tree and turn up; if the soil be
dry and friable, without grass, knock it gently with the trowel, which
will be sufficient. If, however, there be grass, you must proceed more
cautiously ; take up the sod on the left hand, knock it very gently
with the trowel, and those pup which merely enter the ground will
drop out; to find those which spin, you must carefully examine the
sod, tearing the roots of the grass asunder ; these are, of course, much
the most difficult to find, the cocoons being generally of the color of the
earth. Itis useless to try sticky or clayey grounds, the caterpillars being
unable to penetrate it; in searching under moss the best plan is to
loosen the edge, then to tear it gently off, observing whether any
pupae fall. Look at the trunk of the tree to see if anything adheres
to it, and then carefully examine the moss itself; experience alone
will enable you te detect a spun cocoon,
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 193

In another place Mr. Green remarks: ‘‘ With regard to localities,
the best are unquestionably parks and meadows with scattered timber
trees. Those trees from which the surrounding grass has been worn
away by the feet of cattle, and those situated on the borders or banks
of streams, dykes, &c., when the soil is dry and friable, will be found
the most remunerative. When the roots of trees, particularly large
ones standing alone, form angles, pups will nearly always be found
in the spaces ; the trowel should then be inserted at least eight inches
from the trunk and to the depth of about four. In digging round a
tree, whose roots form no angles, it is not necessary to go deeper than
three inches, nor farther from the trunk than four. Always replace
the sod when you have done with it, or at least the débris. When
first taken up, the sod may be so hard as to render it impossible for
the caterpillar to penetrate it; but if, after beiag loosened by the
pup-digger’s manipulation, it be restored to its place, the larva,
which, in the original instance, would have wandered away to some
more convenient spot, will now find one ready made, and will almost
certainly make use of it.”’

‘¢ He should havea small box, filled with damp moss, for the purpose
of carrying the pupe, which should be handled as seldom as possible,
and with the utmost tenderness. I may here remark, that some of
the pupe may dry up. This is caused by some unlucky, probably
unseen, injury, inflicted at the time of capture, and, however great his
caution, will not unfrequently occur.’’ The best months for digging
are July and August for the summer and autumn specimens, and
September, October, and November, for the following spring and sum-
mer insects. Mr. Green has found the months of September and
October the most remunerative to the pup hunter.

In order to rear the pupe thus collected, ‘‘ when brought home they
should be placed in a large box, with the inside surface rough, and
covered with gauze or wire frame; at the bottom of the box should be
some fine earth on which the pupe are to be placed and covered with
a thick layer of moss, which may or may not be occasionally damped.
Be sure to keep them from the sun.’ It is best also to keep them
exposed to the external air during winter. Theone obvious principle
to be observed, as far as possible, is always to place them under the
natural conditions in which they were first found. The student may
also derive from pup hunting valuable hints, at least respecting the
food plants of many larve, and the periods of the season during which
they may be found near maturity.

HOW TO PACK LEPIDOPTERA FOR EXCHANGE, ETC.

Tn order to send insects to a distance safely, a box well made, of
light, thin material, should be obtained. It should be double, the
two portions attached together by hinges, and the bottoms lined with
cork, glued down, and covered with unsized paper; it should be about
twelve inches square, and each portion an inch and one-half deep,
before the cork lining is added ; but if the collector uses pins longer
than an inch and a fourth it should be deeper. The pins containing
specimens should be introduced firmly in the cork, and enough of the

13
194 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS,

pin should always be exposed to permit it to take a good hold; and if
the abdomen be large and heavy it should be supported by cross pins:
that is, two or more fixed crosswise over this portion of the body, with
a pellet of cotton fixed on the pin beneath and drawn under the abdo-
men, so that it will rest on it. If the specimens are placed very high
on the pins, and raised considerably above the surface, the pin should
be first passed through a little cotton, and the specimen permitted to
rest on it, or the whole surface may be covered first with a layer of
cotton. A large number of specimens may be secured in the box by
pinning one over half the other, like shingles on a roof.

When the box is filled with specimens, the front should be secured
by a little hook and socket ; and it should be then wrapped in several
thicknesses of cotton wool, and the whole enclosed in a piece of cotton
sheeting made secure witha needle and thread. The object of wrapping
the box well in cotton is to prevent the specimens being broken or
injured by any jar or concussion the box may receive during transmis-
sion from one place to another. Bottles containing specimens of larvee,
&c., in alcohol, should be enveloped in cotton and enclosed in a
paper box.

It may happen, sometimes, that those who desire to collect may be
in such a position that none of the expedients heretofore mentioned
may be available. Expeditions to the new countries of the west, or
persons stationed at military outposts and forts in the Indian territo-
ries, may be unable to obtain pins, or the agents heretofore mentioned
as being used for destroying the life of Lepidoptera, and will be, of
course, unable to make preparations in the ordinary manner. As
specimens from the Territories would be exceedingly interesting, in
order to anticipate the condition of those at military outposts and sta-
tions who would be willing to advance the cause of natural history by
collecting, I will suggest how it can be accomplished without any of
the conveniences heretofore mentioned.

If the spirits of ammonia cannot be obtained, insects may be killed
by the fumes of one or two sulphur matches, after having been con-
fined under a glass, or by means of tobacco smoke, or by pinching the
thorax, as heretofore described. The wings should be then turned
upward, so as to be perpendicular to the back or erect, together with
the antennae or feelers situated on the head, and placed in this posi-
tion between a few folds of porous paper, and submitted to light pressure
until they have become partially dried, and the wings will retain their
position. They should then be placed on a square piece of puper,
which should be folded in a triangular form, and the open ends of the
sides turned over, so as to admit of as little motion to the included
specimen as possible. These papers, properly marked as to localities,
may afterwards be packed between layers of cotton in paper boxes, or
in any manner most convenient to the collector, provided they are not
submitted to pressure.

We can imagine no more pleasant and healthful employment during
levsure and unoccupied hours for the men who are stationed at the
military outposts of the Indian territories than collecting these objects
of natural history; and we would respectfully call the attention of
their officers, many of whom have shown so much intelligence and
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 195

manifested so much interest in the collection of specimens belonging
to other classes, to the advantages which may result from it both to
those under their care and to entomology itself. If we remember
aright, the British government authorized such collections to be made
some years since in the neighborhood of the military stations in
Canada, with the most gratifying results, both to those engaged in
collecting and to this branch of natural history.

CABINETS, IMPLEMENTS, ETC.

The ring net is made of bobbinet of fine mesh, or, what is much
better, book muslin, and should be cut in three pieces, the sides of
which are rounded from the base to the apex, so that when sewed
together the net will have the form of a sugar loaf. It should be
rounded at the apex, and the circumference of the base, previous to
being fixed on the ring, should be somewhat more than the ring itself.
This may be moderately thick iron or brass wire, and should be from
eight to twelve inches in diameter. The depth of the net should be
at least once and a half that of the diameter of the ring, so that the
bottom may be thrown over the top of the ring by a twist of the rod.
This is frequently necessary, when a large and active moth has been
taken. An iron socket, with a male screw on the end, may be made
to receive the bent ends of the ring; or these may be fixed in a piece of
tubing by means of melted lead, one end being left open to receive the
rod ; or the bent ends of the wire may be fixed directly to the end of
He rod itself. The rod should not be more than three or four feet

ong.

Any substitutes for cork will answer only for cabinet use ; there is:
nothing that will supply its place in the exchange box. The follow-
ing substitutes have been recommended on account of their cheapness:
‘* Inodorous felt’’ is cut to fit the bottom of the boxes and glued to
the surface, and then covered with paper, or thick ironing blanket is.
used for the same purpose. ‘‘Cut the blanket the size of the drawer
or box and glue it down with good fresh glue; when perfectly dry,
soak it well with fresh paste, and paste one side of the paper also,
place the paper on the blanket, and smooth it well down with a warm
linen cloth. In four days it will, in a favorable situation, be fit to
hold insects.’’ Thesheet cork may be cut into strips, if one wishes to
economize, and glued in drawers or boxes, at a sufficient distance from
each other to admit of the specimens being arranged in rows.

The preservation of specimens after a collection has been once made
is by no means simple or easy; they should not be exposed to the light
of day, because many species in the course of time are deprived by
the light of their brilliancy of color, and become faded ; and hence
being kept in darkness, and the objects generally of merely occasional
inspection, they are apt to be destroyed by various insects that live on
dried animal substances, such as mites, the larvae of a species of coleop-
terous insect, an Anthrenus, and the larva of a species of Tinea, which
makes its case of the scales and portions of the moths. When the
two latter have been permitted through neglect to accumulate in a col-
lection, the only certain mode of putting an end to their ravages, and
196 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS.

at the same time to destroy the unhatched eggs, is to submit them to
a degree of heat sufficient to coagulate albumen. This is accomplished
by placing the box in an oven, turning the open portion downward,
and elevating it a little above the surface by means of supports so
that they may not, be burned, and the insects themselves must be
watched lest they are scorched by the heat. The heat will soon dis-
lodge the larvae, which falling on the heated surface are killed, and
the albumen of the eggs is coagulated; thus preventing the develop-
ment of those in ova. Iam acquainted with no means of preventing
the invasions of the anthreni, except perfect seclusion of the objects
themselves ; it is usual to recommend the introduction of lumps of
camphor into drawers and boxes, but it has very little effect on them;
the English entomologists use a few drops of Borneate of Petroline,
(probably a mixture of oil of camphor and petroleum,) but as I have
never seen it nor used it, I can say nothing respecting its efficiency.
According to my experience, too, it is useless to paint the bodies witha
strong solution of corrosive sublimate ; it spoils the specimens and
does not protect them. I have also tried disembowelling the large
moths and stuffing them with cotton, subsequently saturating it with
corrosive sublimate; but this does not protect the thorax against their
ravages. The boxes and drawers of a collection should therefore be
inspected frequently, for the purpose of ascertaining if any destruc-
tive insects are present, this being immediately revealed to the eye by
a little heap of dust or excrement beneath the specimens attacked.
The collection may be kept either in drawers covered with glass, or
in wooden boxes; the latter should be three inches deep and twelve by
eighteen or twenty inches clear measurements, opening in the centre
of the depth on hinges, and defended from dust by a short rabbet
around the inside of the lower portion. The boxes should have one
of their measurements about twelve inches, because the cork is usually
cut in pieces about this length. A cabinet of drawers, each lined
with cork and covered with a glass, enables one to view the insects
without danger of accident by touch, but it would be more expensive
than simple boxes. Mr. Titian Peale, of Washington City, has an
extensive cabinet, which for beauty, security, and convenience, excels
anything I have ever seen. The cases consist of a light square frame
about twelve inches by nine inches, which are bound in an ordinary
cover like a folio volume, and arranged on the shelves of a case like
books; the frame is supplied with a glass on each side and made per-
fectly tight in grooves by means of thin foil. The space the insect
occupies having been previously ascertained, a section of a cork for
vials is fixed to the glass, together with the number of the specimen,
by means of black varnish. This arrangement enables one to examine
both sides of the expanded insect without any difficulty, and excludes
insects and dust completely. It will be a source of pleasure to Mr.
Peale, I am sure, to give those who are desirous of forming a cabinet
in imitation of his plan more specific directions than I can respecting
the construction of these entomological volumes. He assured me they
are not expensive, and that any one can soor learn to make and bind
them as they are wanted, as he himself has been in the practice of
doing for many years. His collection has been in his possession more
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING INSECTS. 197
than twenty years, and he has never lost a specimen during that
period from the ravages of other insects; those, therefore, who wish
to accumulate a cabinet would do well to commence from the begin-
ning on a plan which will release them from all future care respecting
it, besides forming a most appropriate ornainent either for study or
arlor.
, We have now reached the conclusion of a pleasing task, undertaken
in the hope that it might subserve the purpose of leading many active,
intelligent, and inquiring minds to observe the little people of the
insect world, to share the delights, pleasures, and knowledge that
communication with Nature never fails to bestow, or to contend for
the honorable distinctions which always follow an earnest and per-
severing devotion to the study of natural history. As this paper is
intended chiefly for the use of the novice, we have sought simply to
show how that which is manipulative can be best performed, and to
record such experience as might benefit them on their entrance into
this new world. It is, I know, looked upon as insignificant, the
domain of plagues, pests, and human annoyances, by many, a great
many in our own country who should be better informed, but are,
perhaps, unobserving and unreflecting, and the attention and study
given to these beings considered a waste of the fleeting hours of life
which should be devoted to lofty and noble purposes. They forget,
or do not know, that the works of Nature are all alike intricately
planned, the result of thought and premeditation which binds the
most dissimilar departments into intimate and dependent relation-
ships, that no one can be studied without involving a knowledge of
the others, which meet us boldly and constantly face to face on every
pathway of knowledge. ‘They forget that all branches of natural
