REPORT

OF THE

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN
INSTITUTION
C. G. AsBot
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1931

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report
showing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and the Government bureaus under its administrative charge dur-
ing the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931. The first 21 pages contain
a summary account of the affairs of the Institution. Appendixes
1 to 11 give more detailed reports of the operations of the United
States National Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Freer
Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Interna-
tional Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical
Observatory, the Division of Radiation and Organisms, the United
States Regional Bureau of the International Catalogue of Scientific
Literature, the Smithsonian library, and of the publications issued
under the direction of the Institution.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
OUTSTANDING EVENTS OF THE YEAR

An appropriation of $10,000 was made by the Congress for pre-
liminary architectural plans of the extensions to the Natural History
Building of the United States National Museum authorized by Con-
gress last year. The new reptile house of the Zoological Park was
completed and formally opened to the public on February 27, 1951.
A reorganization of several exhibition halls of the Arts and Indus-
tries Building of the National Museum has added greatly to the
attractiveness of the exhibits of costumes, coins and stamps, and
machinery. A small souvenir guide to the Institution and its
branches has been published privately by the Smithsonian and seems
highly appreciated by visitors. For unity of policy, greater effi-
ciency, and simplification of records and accounts, the separate edi-
torial staffs of the Smithsonian, the National Museum, and the Bu-

BE
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

reau of American Ethnology have been consolidated under one gen-
eral management and the offices brought closely together. Two ex-
ceptionally valuable publications, The Skeletal Remains of Early
Man, by A. Hrdlitka, and A History of Applied Entomology, by
L. O. Howard, were completed. A bequest netting approximately
$50,000 has been received from the estate of the late James Arthur.
Its income is to be used for promoting knowledge of the sun. A
friend of the Institution has announced to it a large intended bequest
to promote and reward original investigation. Numerous valuable re-
search and collecting expeditions by the National Museum, the Bu-
reau of American Ethnology, and the Zoological Park have returned
highly successful. Accounts of their results will be found below. A
gigantic dinosaur, Diplodocus longus, 75 feet long, whose skeleton
has been in preparation for several years, has been placed on exhi-
bition. Improved methods of solar-radiation research have been
perfected and applied in connection with the observing stations at
Table Mountain, Calif., and Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa.
Volume V of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, con-
taining all results of the years 1920 to 1980, inclusive, on the meas-
urement of solar radiation has been sent to press. The numerous
variations of the sun since the year 1920 are represented by monthly
mean values whose average probable error is less than 0.1 per cent.
Long-continuing regular periodicities in solar variation are demon-
strated. Highly accurate results on the spectral distribution of
phototropism in plants have been obtained by the Division of Radia-
tion and Organisms. By cooperative work with the Fixed Nitrogen
Research Laboratory, excellent results on the absorption of pure
organic chemicals in the infra-red spectrum have been reached, and
an independent method for determining the ozone content of the
earth’s atmosphere has been worked out and applied at Table Moun-
tain, Calif.
THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of
England, who, in 1826, bequeathed his property to the United States
of America “ to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” ‘In receiving the property*and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore con-
stituted an “ establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the Presi-
dent, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the
executive departments.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “ the Vice President, the Chief
Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of the
House of Representatives, together with six other persons other than
Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the city of
Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State,
but no two of them of the same State.” One of the Regents is elected
chancellor by the board. In the past the selection has fallen upon
the Vice President or the Chief Justice, and a suitable person is
chosen by the Regents as Secretary of the Institution, who is also
secretary of the Board of Regents, and the executive officer directly
in charge of the Institution’s activities.

Changes in the personnel of the board during the year consisted
of the loss of two citizen Regents: Robert S. Brookings, of Missouri,
through expiration of his term, and Dwight W. Morrow, of New
Jersey, through the automatic expiration of his term as a citizen
Regent upon his induction into the office of United States Senator
from New Jersey.

The roll of the Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as
follows: Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States,
chancellor; Charles Curtis, Vice President of the United States;
members from the Senate, Reed Smoot, Joseph T. Robinson, Claude
A. Swanson; members from the House of Representatives, Albert
Johnson, R. Walton Moore, Robert Luce; citizen members, Irwin B.
Laughlin, Pennsylvania; Frederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C.;
and John C. Merriam, Washington, D. C.

FINANCES

The permanent investments of the Institution consist of the

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST
PRESENTATION OF LANGLEY MEDAL TO MANLY AND BYRD

As mentioned in my last report, the fifth and sixth awards of the
Langley Gold Medal for Aerodromics were made late in 1929 to
Charles Matthews Manly (posthumously) and to Admiral Richard
Evelyn Byrd, respectively. On December 11, 1930, at the annual
meeting of the Board of Regents of the Institution, the posthumous
presentation of the medal to Mr. Manly was made through the person
of his eldest son. In presenting the medal, the chancellor of the
board, Hon. Charles Evans Hughes, spoke of the previous awards
and then said:

It was awarded posthumously to Charles Matthews Manly at the board’s
meeting of December 12, 1929. This exceptional action was taken in recognition
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

of the fact that the outstanding merit of Mr. Manly’s invention and construc-
tion of the light, radial, gasoline airplane engine has become more and more
apparent in the last years.

Mr. Hughes then quoted Mr. Charles L. Lawrance, president of
the Wright Aeronautical Corporation, in part, as follows:

When we consider that the most popular type of airplane engine of to-day is
almost identical in its general detail and arrangement with the one evolved by
Charles Manly in 1902, we are lost in admiration for a man who, with no data
at his disposal, no examples of similar art on which to roughly base his design,
and no workmen capable of making the more difficult parts of his engine, never-
theless, through the processes of a logical mind, the intelligent application of
the science of mathematics, and the use of his surprising mechanical skill, suc-
ceeded in constructing an engine developing 52.4 horsepower for a weight of
125 pounds, or a weight of 2.4 pounds per horsepower, which stood up under
severe tests, once even going through a full-power, nonstop run of 10 hours.

Mr. Manly accepted the medal on behalf of his father, and con-
cluded with the words, “I am sure that if he were living there is
no honor which he would so greatly treasure.”

The presentation of the medal to Admiral Byrd was made at the
Smithsonian on the morning of March 27, 1931, by Chancellor
Hughes. After reviewing the purpose of the founding of the Lang-
ley medal, Mr. Hughes said:

Your investigations in connection with the science of aviation have included
severe tests of airplanes, their navigating instruments, and the possibilities
of using them for geographical exploration. In these enterprises you have
made the nonstop west-east passage of the Atlantic, the first nonstop flight to
the North Pole, and the first nonstop flight to the South Pole. You have ex-
plored and photographed great regions of the globe hitherto unseen by man.

It gives me great pleasure to present to you, Admiral Byrd, the Langley
Gold Medal for Aerodromies, in recognition of your outstanding investigations
relating to the application of the science of aerodromics to geographical
exploration.

Admiral Byrd, in expressing his appreciation of the award, con-
cluded:

All fliers have the deepest respect for the work of Professor Langley. My
own feeling of respect is so profound that this rare medal is doubly precious
to me in bearing his name.

His work was epochal in the evolution of aviation, and may I remark here
that I believe ali age-old things in a state of civilization must follow the great
law of evolution as do all things in a state of nature. *.* * But here is
the big point—because space is practically unlimited the evolution of aviation
has fewer limits than ground-held things.

SMITHSONIAN SCIENTIFIC SERIES

In 1926 the Institution reached an agreement with a New York
publishing firm for the issuance of a series of popular, illustrated
volumes dealing with the branches of science covered by the activi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

ties of the Smithsonian and its branches. ‘The Institution receives a
definite royalty from the sale of the books which provides greatly
needed additional funds for the continuation of its researches. Vol-
umes 1 to 4 were issued in 1929, and volumes 5 to 8 in 1980. The
titles are as follows:

1. The Smithsonian Institution, by Webster Prentiss True.

2. The Sun and the Welfare of Man, by Charles Greeley Abbot.

3. Minerals from Earth and Sky. Part I, The Story of Meteorites, by George
P. Merrill. Part IJ, Gems and Gem Minerals, by William I’. Foshag.

. The North American Indians. An account of the American Indians north
of Mexico, compiled from the original sources, by Rose A. Palmer.

. Insects: Their Ways and Means of Living, by R. HE. Snodgrass.

Wild Animals in and out of the Zoo, by William M. Mann.

. Man From the Farthest Past, by C. W. Bishop, C. G. Abbot, and A. Ardlicka.

. Cold-Blooded Vertebrates, by C. W. Gilmore, D. M. Cochran, and S. FE.
Hildebrand.

_

iva)

Volumes 9, 10, and 11 were in press at the close of the year, and
the manuscript of volume 12 was practically completed.

The first edition of the series to be put on the market was a
limited de luxe set known as the James Smithson memorial edition;
this was quickly sold out. The publishers are now selling two dis-
tinct editions known as the patrons’ edition and the William Howard
Taft memorial edition.

RESEARCHES IN EUROPEAN ARCHIVES

Dr. C. U. Clark continued his research work among the European
archives under the grant furnished by Ambassador Charles G.
Dawes in 1929. In addition to the important materials listed last
year, Doctor Clark has made some very interesting new discoveries
of manuscripts relating to the ethnology of many tribes of North
and South America. In the hbrary at Evora in Portugal he brought
to light a great many documents of unusual interest which had been
deposited by Jesuit missionaries of the early colonial period in
Brazil. In the British Museum Doctor Clark discovered some im-
portant works of Francisco Cardenas relating to the Maya Indians
of Yucatan. In addition to the new work in Portugal and Eng-
land, Doctor Clark continued his researches in the archives of the
Indies at Seville and in the Vatican Library and the Propaganda
Fide in Rome. Insomuch as the Dawes fund will expire in Sep-
tember, Doctor Clark will bring his work to a conclusion at that
time. The results that have been obtained through this research .
have been exceptionally valuable, and the interesting material
brought to light was considerably more than might have been
expected. Although the research was undertaken primarily for the
purpose of locating material on the Maya Indians of Yucatan, in
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

the course of the work documents of unusual interest were found
which concerned tribes covering most of North and South America
and the islands of the West Indies.

COOPERATIVE ETHNOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

In 1928 an appropriation of $20,000 was authorized by Congress
for cooperative ethnological and archeological investigations in the
United States. Proposed investigations were to be approved by the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who allotted from this ap-
propriation a sum equal to that raised for the work by the organiza-
tion proposing it. Seven projects were approved during the past
year and sums were allotted to them as follows:

Allotments from the fund for cooperative ethnological and archeological

inwestigations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931
1930

July 3. Laboratory of Anthropology, to conduct archeological investigations
of Basket Maker culture in the Guadalupe Mountain area of south-
eastern New Mexico for the purpose of locating, exploring, and
thoroughly examining both disturbed and undisturbed Basket Maker
sites and establishing the principal characteristics of this area.
A study and recording of pictographs found in this area will also
be made, $900.

July 8. University of Utah, to conduct archeological investigations and explora-
tions in the State of Utah and the intensive excavation of one or
two sites chosen as a result of the explorations, $800.

19381

Feb. 18. Laboratory of Anthropology, to continue the reconnaissance and
excavation, where desirable, of Basket Maker sites in the Guadalupe
Mountains and adjacent sections on the north and west, $213.15
(together with unexpended balance of $386.85 from previous allot-
ment).

Mar. 26. University of Utah, to conduct archeological investigations at
Promontory Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, and to continue the
archeological reconnaissance begun in the fall of 1930 in the
drainage of the Sevier River in west central Utah, $250.

Mar. 26. Logan Museum, to conduct archeological investigations along the upper
Missouri River, excavating earth-lodge villages belonging to the
Arikara before 1850, $250.

Apr. 21. The State Historical Society of Colorado, for a general investigation,
reconnaissance, and mapping of the so-called Paradox Valley
country with intensive work on a single site to be selected as a
result of the reconnaissance, $175.

May 28. University of Denver, to complete the archeological survey of eastern
Colorado begun during the summer of 1930, $250.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance of the fund for
cooperative ethnological and archeological investigations was very
low, but by combining the unexpended balances on a number of the
allotments it was possible to make the above grants.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 11
EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Twenty-nine expeditions went out during the year in the interests
of the Institution’s investigations in geology, biology, anthropology,
and astrophysics. Besides numerous localities in the United States,
these expeditions visited many other parts of the world, including
Africa, Alaska, Canada, China, Haiti, Santo Domingo, the South
Sea Islands, Spain, and the West Indies.

Many unique specimens were brought back to the Institution for
study, and much-needed information was obtained in the field.
The Smithsonian is indebted to its friends and to other scientific
institutions for a considerable part of the expense of these expedi-
tions, as its own meager funds for this purpose were exhausted early
in the year.

Among the year’s expeditions I may mention particularly Dr.
Paul Bartsch’s third year of explorations for mollusks in the West
Indies, this year’s work covering the southern Bahamas, the islands
off the south coast of Cuba, and the Caymans; further anthropologi-
cal researches in Alaska by Dr. AleS Hrdlicka and Henry B.
Collins, jr., Doctor Hrdlitka working along the Kuskokwim River
and Mr. Collins on St. Lawrence Island; biological collecting on
“Tin Can Island” in the Tonga Archipelago by Lieut. Henry C.
Kellers, United States Navy, through the cooperation of the Navy
Department and the United States Naval Observatory; the Parish-
Smithsonian expedition to Haiti, organized by the late Lee H.
Parish with the financial assistance and cooperation of his father,
S. W. Parish, for the purpose of making general biological collec-
tions on the little-worked islands off the Haitian coast; and the
continuation of the collecting explorations of the Rev. David C.
Graham near Suifu, China, which resulted in over 62,000 specimens
for the National Museum.

Brief accounts of certain of the year’s expeditions will be found
in the reports of the National Museum and the Bureau of American
Ethnology appended hereto. All are described and illustrated in
the Institution’s yearly pamphlet, Explorations and Field Work of
the Smithsonian Institution, 19380, publication No. 3111.

PUBLICATIONS

On March 1, 1931, the editorial work of the Institution and its
branches was consolidated in a central office under the direction of
the editor of the Institution. The steadily increasing output of the
Smithsonian made it desirable to centralize authority to a certain
extent in the interests of a more uniform policy and style and to
prevent duplication of effort in the keeping of financial and other
records. The volume of work passing through the editorial office
1 Ws ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

will be apparent from the fact that nearly $120,000 is now spent for
printing each year; at certain periods of the year as many as 60
separate publications are in press at one time, some of them con-
taining hundreds of manuscript pages, and most of them highly
technical papers requiring careful editing and proofreading. It is
hoped that the increased efficiency from a business standpoint of
the recent reorganization will result in releasing more time of the
small editorial staff for straight editorial work, to the end that
Smithsonian publications may appear with greater accuracy and
promptness.

The Institution’s publications constitute its primary means for
accomplishing the diffusion of knowledge. They are issued by the
Institution proper and by the bureaus under its administrative
direction and appear in 18 distinct series, as follows:

Smithsonian Institution:
Annual report (with general appendix made up of selected articles review-
ing the year’s advances in science).
Contributions to Knowledge (suspended).
Miscellaneous collections.
Special publications.
National Museum:

Bureau of American Hthnology:
Annual report (with accompanying papers on ethnological subjects).
Bulletin.
Astrophysical Observatory:

Freer Gallery of Art:
Publications.

Ninety-eight volumes and pamphlets were published during the
year in these various series, and 205,711 copies of Smithsonian pub-
lications were distributed. This number included 27,425 volumes and
separates of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 25,984 vol-
umes and separates of the Smithsonian annual reports, 4,627 Smith-
sonian special publications, 86,680 publications of the National
Museum, and 29,475 publications of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology. ‘The titles and authors of the year’s publications will be
found in the report of the editor, Appendix 11.

LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library contains about 800,000 volumes, pam-
phlets, and charts, pertaining largely to science and technology. It
comprises 10 divisional libraries, one of which—the National Museum
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

library—inciudes 36 sectional libraries, the small working units
maintained in the offices of the curators and other Museum officials.
The year’s accessions totaled 14,050, including 6,972 volumes and 7,078
pamphiets and charts. Among the many gifts received during the
year may be mentioned several thousand volumes and pamphlets
from the library of the late Dr. George P. Merrill, presented by Mrs.
Merrill and the other heirs; 600 scientific publications from Mrs.
Dora W. Boettcher; and 386 volumes and pamphlets from the heirs
of the late Dr. O. P. Hay.

Work on the union catalogue progressed satisfactorily. The staff
completed the shelf list of the Museum library, catalogued the pub-
lications of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and the John
Donnell Smith collection, and made progress in reclassifying and re-
cataloguing the library of the Freer Gallery of Art. A number of
special activities were carried forward, such as the checking and com-
pleting of sets of publications, the transfer to other organizations of
certain publications not needed at the Institution, and the exchange
of duplicate publications for others needed to complete sets.

GOVERNMENTALLY SUPPORTED BRANCHES
NATIONAL MUSEUM

The appropriations for the maintenance of the Museum totaled
$830,394, which included provision for four additional employees,
namely, an associate director, a clerk in the library, and two guards.
Although these additions are of great help to the eflicient operation
of the Museum, there are still many offices, particularly in the scien-
tific departments, where the need for more workers is urgent. The
second deficiency bill for 1931 carried $10,000 for the preparation of
preliminary plans for the two wings to be added to the Natural
History Building under an authorization by Congress in the pre-
vious year. These plans, in course of preparation by the Allied
Architects Incorporated, will provide for two wings similar in
arrangement to the present building, that is, with the ground floor
and the third floor devoted to offices and Jaboratories and the two
floors between occupied by exhibits. This additional spacg will
relieve the present badly overcrowded condition in the natural his-
tory department of the Museum; a similar need for space will still
exist, however, in the arts and industries department and the divi-
sion of history, and it is hoped that buildings for these collections,
which are of such great interest to the public, may soon be provided.

The year’s additions to the collections exceeded in number those
of any previous year in the Museum’s history, reaching a total
of 1,022,850 individual specimens. Gifts of duplicates to schools
totaled 7,384 specimens, and 31,516 specimens were loaned to scien-
tific workers outside of Washington.
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

The department of anthropology received additional ethnological
material from Alaska resulting from the explorations of Dr. Ales
Hrdlitka and H. B. Collins, jr., giving the Museum the most
complete collection in existence of the ancient ivory culture of the
Bering Sea region. About 5,000 specimens illustrating the life of the
American Indian were received as a bequest from the late Victor J.
Evans, of Washington. Further material representing the native
tribes of West Africa was given by C. C. Roberts.

The most important accession in the department of biology was
the Barnes collection of Lepidoptera, purchased by a special appro-
priation of $50,000 to the Department of Agriculture and transferred
to the Museum. Additional material has been received as a result
of the field activities of Dr. David C. Graham in China and of Dr.
Hugh M. Smith in Siam. Dr. H. C. Kellers obtained large collec-
tions of material for the Museum from the island of Niuafoou in the
Pacific. A large collection of birds, mammals, reptiles, and plants
obtained by E. G. Holt on an expedition to the boundary region be-
tween Venezuela and Brazil was presented by the National Geo-
graphic Society.

Thirty-two species of minerals new to the collection were received
by the department of geology, chiefly by purchase through the
Roebling fund. Other interesting accessions included a large mass
of native silver and calcite estimated to contain 220 pounds of pure
silver; a vertebra of an extinct reptile, which has fossilized into opal;
and a green tourmaline weighing 17.9 carats, purchased through the
Chamberlain fund. Many valuable fossil specimens were added dur-
ing the year, particularly through the explorations of C. W. Gilmore
and Dr. J. W. Gidley.

In the arts and industries department one of the most interesting
accessions was the airplane Bremen, the first heavier-than-air craft
to make the east-west nonstop flight across the North Atlantic. This
was deposited by the New York Museum of Science and Industry.
Of especial interest also was a model showing a section of the Cono-
wingo hydroelectric generating station, presented by the Philadelphia
Electric Co. The division of graphic arts received a miniature book,
The Gospel of St. Matthew, printed in 214-point type, the smallest
type ever cast. Among the especially interesting accessions in the
division of history were a chair owned by Benjamin Franklin, a
chair belonging to President James Madison, and a mahogany screen
owned by George Washington.

In search of specimens and information needed in the progress of
the scientific investigations carried on by the Museum many expedi-
tions were in the field during the year, financed either by the Smith-
sonian Institution or by contributions from interested friends. The
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

results of the researches of the staff were published by the Museum
in 7 volumes and 41 separate papers. The distribution of its publica-
tions totaled 86,680 copies. The number of visitors during the year
was 1,669,140.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Three exhibitions were held in the galiery during the year: A
collection of 78 water colors by William Spencer Bagdatopoulos, a
memorial exhibition of water colors by Henry Bacon, and the fortieth
annual exhibition of the Society of Washington Artists.

Art works received by the Institution, subject to transfer to the
national gallery upon approval of the National Gallery of Art Com-
mission, included several portraits, among them a portrait of Com-
modore Stephen Decatur by Gilbert Stuart, bequeathed by the late
Stephen Decatur Parsons. Among the loans accepted by the gallery
were 15 paintings by British and Dutch masters lent by the execu-
tors of the estate of the late Henry Cleveland Perkins, and five
paintings by old masters lent by Mrs. Marshall Langhorne.

Four paintings were purchased during the year from the Henry
Ward Ranger fund by the Council of the National Academy of
Design. Under the conditions of Mr. Ranger’s will, the National
Gallery may claim any of the pictures thus purchased during the
5-year period beginning 10 years after the artist’s death and ending
15 years after his death.

The director, Professor Holmes, calls attention to the fact that just
60 years have passed since he first entered the doors of the Smith-
sonian Institution, where he was almost immediately employed as an
artist. It may be added that since that time, except for short periods
of connection with other organizations, he has remained with the
Smithsonian and has served it with marked success in the fields of
geology and anthropology as well as of art. To few men is it given
to achieve distinction in three major fields of activity and to con-
tinue at the age of 85 in the able direction of such an important
enterprise as the National Gallery of Art.

FREER GALLERY OF ART’

Additions to the collections by purchase include a Chinese bronze
vessel of the fifth century B. C.; two Chinese jade ornaments of
the third century B. C.; Nepalese, Persian, and Arabic manuscripts;
and Chinese, Indian, Nepalese, and Persian paintings.

1The Government’s expense in connection with the Freer Gallery of Art consists mainly
in the care of the building and certain other custodial matters. Other expenses are paid
from the Freer endowmennt funds.
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1951

The year’s curatorial work embraced the studying and recording
of inscriptions and seals on recently acquired Chinese paintings and
of Buddhist inscriptions on stone sculptures and votive bronze
images. The cataloguing of the near eastern section of manuscripts
and paintings was completed. Transiation of the Persian texts has
identified more than 60 Persian miniatures taken from various early
manuscripts. Translations have also been made of inscriptions on
objects submitted by outside persons and by other institutions for
expert opinion. A total of 2,312 objects and 107 photographs of
objects were sent in for such opinion.

Important changes in exhibition were made during the year.
Galleries I and II are now devoted to the display of works of art
from the Near East and India; gallery XIV now contains ancient
bronzes, silver, and silver gilt; gallery XVIII exhibits scroll paint-
ings; and gallery XIX displays pottery, porcelain, and panel
paintings.

The total attendance for the year was 125,789; of these 1,510 came
to the office in connection with studies or for other special purposes.
Fifty-two groups were given docent service in the galleries and
10 classes were given instruction in the study room.

In spite of existing difficult conditions, the gallery’s expedition
in China under direction of C. W. Bishop carried out important
excavations in southwestern Shansi. The principal aim of the
gallery in this work is to help establish an atmosphere of greater
mutual regard and confidence between native and foreign scientists.

BUREAU OF AMBRICAN ETHNOLOGY

The bureau continued its diversified researches among the Indians
in various parts of the United States and at one locality in Canada.
The chief of the bureau, M. W. Stirling, visited several sites of
archeological interest in Florida and chose for excavation a large
sand burial mound on Blue Hill Island in the Ten Thousand Islands
group off the west coast. He then investigated several sites on the
island of Haiti in company with H. W. Krieger, of the National
Museum. Returning to Florida, work was continued in the eastern
part of the State, in the course of which two series of large geometric
earthworks were discovered on the eastern side of the Everglades.

Dr. John R. Swanton was engaged in field work among various
tribes in Louisiana during the first part of the fiscal year, and later
devoted considerable time in Washington to the editing of Gatschet’s
material on the Atakapa language. Dr. Truman Michelson worked
among the Kickapoo and Cheyenne of Oklahoma and the Fox of
Iowa. John P. Harrington prepared his report on the San Juan
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY LZ

Indians of California, and later in the year returned to that State
to continue his studies, this year on the Esselen and Antoniano
Indians in the southern part of Monterey County.

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., concluded his excavations begun the pre-
vious year at a site on the Zuni Reservation, N. Mex., and later in the
year began work on the ruins of a large pit-house village near
Allantown, Ariz. J. N. B. Hewitt again visited the Grant of the
Six Nations of the Iroquois on the Grand River in Ontario, Canada,
and briefly the Tuscarora reservation in western New York State,
in connection with the Iroquois texts which he is preparing for
publication. Winslow M. Walker was added to the bureau staff as
associate anthropologist in March, 1931. Toward the end of the
year he left Washington to investigate a number of caves near
Gilbert, Ark., and on June 30 the work was still in progress. Miss
Frances Densmore continued her study of Indian music for the
bureau, working particularly with the Chippewa on Lake Superior
and the Seminole of Florida.

The bureau issued two annual reports and three bulletins during
the year and distributed 20,475 copies of its publications.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

The exchange service handles for the United States the official
exchange with all other countries of parliamentary documents,
departmental documents, and miscellaneous scientific and literary
publications.

The number of packages of such publications handled during the
year was 641,338, a decrease of 53,327 from the previous year; the
weight of this material was 642,190 pounds, a decrease of 65,904
pounds.

As usual, aid was given the Library of Congress in procuring
needed foreign publications, as well as a number of other establish-
ments here and abroad in obtaining specially desired publications.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The year has been marked at the Zoo by an unusually large
number of accessions and by the opening of the new reptile house,
enabling the park for the first time to exhibit these interesting
creatures. The year’s accessions totaled 1,266 animals, while 761
were lost through death, exchange, or return of animals on deposit,
leaving a total of 2,501 in the collection at the close of the year.
The outstanding accession of the year was the bequest of the Victor
J. Evans collection of 244 animals, representing 133 species, which
composed Mr. Evans’s private zoo and which contained a number
18 ANNUAL, REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

of rarities. To illustrate the unusual importance of the year’s
additions, it may be said that 63 species were shown for the first
time in the National Zoological Park.

Visitors to the park totaled 2,171,515, a slight decrease from the
previous year’s total. The fact that there was not a greater decline
in number of visitors, as there was in other similar institutions owing
to the present economic depression, was due to the great public in-
terest shown in the new reptile exhibits. Attendance of school
groups numbered 649 from 21 States, comprising 84,026 individuals.

The new reptile house was opened on February 27, 1931, with a
reception attended by 3,000 people. The building contains special
lighting and ventilating systems and all the modern features known
for the best exhibition of animals. Since its opening it has become
the most popular building in the entire park. The most urgently
needed additional building is one for small mammals and the great
apes; plans for this building are now being prepared under an
appropriation by Congress for the purpose.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

A large part of the year’s work was devoted to the preparation
of text, tables, and illustrations for Volume V of the Annals of
the Astrophysical Observatory, which will cover the results of
observations made at the several stations since August, 1920. The
entire manuscript was sent to the printer toward the end of June.

The three stations at Montezuma, Chile, Table Mountain, Calif.,
and Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa, have continued observa-
tions of the radiation of the sun on all possible days. The results
from the last two stations have not proved as satisfactory as those
from Montezuma, and considerable effort has been expended on im-
proving them. During the year new varieties of the short method
of determining the solar constant of radiation, applicable to condi-
tions at Table Mountain and Mount Brukkaros, have been worked
out, with resulting great improvement in the values from these two
stations.

Upon the completion of the reduction of all the solar constant
observations from the three field stations interesting results have
been derived from their comparison. Whereas the probable error
of the monthly mean values since 1920 is less than 0.1 per cent,
the extreme range of the solar-constant values is 2.8 per cent. The
march of solar variation since 1920 may be expressed very faith-
fully as the sum of five regular periodicities of 68, 45, 25, 11, and
8 month intervals. The curve of temperatures at Washington, D. C.,
and Williston, N. Dak., may also be represented by the sum of
these same periodicities with the addition of an 18-month period.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

These results are so striking as to offer great hope that the rela-
tionship between solar variation and the weather may enable the
skilled meteorologist to forecast principal changes of weather far in
advance.

In the hope of finding a site as satisfactory as Montezuma, Chile,
for solar observations, an expedition supported by John A. Roebling
and headed by A. I’. Moore is now in the field testing various locali-
ties in Africa and outlying regions.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS

During the second year of the existence of the Division of Radia-
tion and Organisms, under direction of Dr. F. S. Brackett, a num-
ber of researches in physics and chemistry in connection with bio-
physics were begun. The phototropic experiments upon oat coleop-
tiles initiated during the previous year were continued with refine-
ment of technique by Doctors Johnston and McAlister. The purpose
of this investigation was to determine the phototropic response of
the oat coleoptile toward light of different colors, or of different
spectral regions, by means of light filters, and this year’s more elab-
orate experiments showed results in striking agreement with the
rougher results of the previous year.

Preliminary experiments on the carbon dioxide assimilation of
wheat plants were conducted by Doctor Johnson and Mr. Hoover,
using special all-vitreous growth chambers. Entire plants are used
instead of individual leaves as in earlier work, and a typical day’s
run of the recording apparatus shows the carbon dioxide assimilated
for different light intensities. Equipment is being developed for
more elaborate experiments using approximately monochromatic
light.

Through the cooperation of the Department of Agriculture, Doc-
tor Meier has carried out preliminary experiments on the growth
of alge under controlled illumination and temperature conditions, a
part of her work as National Research Council Fellow in the division.
By the use of a large quartz spectrograph, the modifications in
growth rate or resulting death point may be observed comparatively
for different wave lengths of light.

With the further cooperation of the Department of Agriculture,
in connection with the crop physiology and breeding investigations
of Doctor Swingle, of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Doctor Meier
and members of the division have carried on researches on the effects
of controlled radiation, humidity, and temperature on certain tropi-
cal and xerophytic plants. It was found possible to maintain con-
ditions that yielded for date palms ten times greater growth rate

102992—32——_3
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

than that of control plants in the greenhouse. Other interesting
results were also obtained, which, if applicable to palms, as seems
likely, would be of considerable practical importance.

In the field of pure physics and physical chemistry, the intensity
distribution in the mercury spectrum has been determined directly,
and in cooperation with the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory the
spectra of HCl, HCN, and the halogen substitution products of
benzene have been investigated in the region between the visible
and 2u. This work has been done by Doctors McAlister and Wulf
and Mr. Liddel.

Several additional rooms have been prepared and equipped for the
use of the division. The research field of the division is so wide
and interesting both to pure science and agriculture that a con-
siderable expansion of its resources and personnel is greatly to be
desired. :

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

In compliance with the resolution passed at the last international
convention held in Brussels in July, 1922, the United States bureau
of the catalogue has been kept in existence pending resumption of
publication, and the compiling of necessary records of current Ameri-
can scientific publications has been continued so that they may be
indexed when publication is resumed.

Every effort is being made by the United States bureau, through
the chairman of the executive committee of the catalogue, to hasten
the necessary reorganization, but the financial depression and other
unfavorable conditions have so far prevented the development of a
definite plan. Besides the necessary cooperation of the regional bu-
reaus, all that is needed to put the enterprise on its feet is a capital
fund of $75,000, to refinance the central editing and publishing
bureau.

NECROLOGY
FRANK WIGGLESWORTH CLARKE

Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, honorary curator in the Division of
Mineralogy, United States National Museum, since 1883, died at his
home in Washington on May 23, 1931, in his eighty-fifth year. Doc-
tor Clarke was chief chemist at the United States Geological Survey
from 1883 to 1925, when he retired from active service.

The mineral collection in the National Museum had been recognized
as a distinct entity for but a short time prior to Doctor Clarke’s ap-
pointment as honorary curator. He laid the foundation for these
now justly celebrated mineral and gem collections. In addition to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY PAL

his duties at the survey, he devoted much time and effort to the up-
building and care of these collections, the early reports of the divi-
sion testifying to his personal activities. His official retirement from
the Government service did not affect his interest, which never
flagged. He visited the department frequently, giving freely of the
store of knowledge acquired by his long years of service.

Doctor Clarke was also greatly interested in the collection of
meteorites, was instrumental in adding to it a number of specimens,
and prepared a catalogue which was published as a part of the
Smithsonian Report for 1886.

Doctor Clarke was a graduate of Harvard, had many honorary
degrees, and was affiliated with several of the prominent scientific
societies. He was the author of numerous papers, his Data of Geo-
chemistry being a standard reference work.

Respectfully submitted.

C. G. Assor, Secretary.
APPENDIX?
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the con-
dition and operations of the United States National Museum for
the fiscal year ended June 380, 1981:

The total appropriations for the maintenance of the National
Museum for this period amounted to $830,394, an increase of $67,880
over the appropriations for the year 1930. Of this amount $12,909,
together with a small additional sum secured by readjustment in
our salary rolls, provided salaries for four additional employees,
namely, an executive officer to be associate director of the United
States National Museum, a clerk in the library, and two guards.
The new positions provided mark a further advance in the building
up of our staff, far too few in number at present for the needs of the
Museum.

The second deficiency act for the fiscal year 1931 included $3,596
to cover increases in salaries occasioned by the Brookhart bill, which
made adjustment in annual pay in certain minor grades. Congress
further provided $11,875 for salary step-ups in connection with effi-
ciency ratings, and $2,420 was received to cover reallocations made
by the Personnel Classification Board.

The sum of $1,000 was added for the purchase of additional books
for the Museum library, making $3,000 available annually for that
purpose. There was further allotted an increase of $1,000 for print-
ing and binding for the National Museum.

As noted in the report for last year, the second deficiency act for
the fiscal year 1930 provided $3,500 toward the remodeling of the
women’s comfort room in the Arts and Industries Building, the
expenditure of which came within the operations of the present fiscal
year. Other additions under the heading of building repairs included
$25,000 for the construction of overhead galleries for the study collec-
tion of mammals and $7,000 for fire-protective measures in the
aircraft building.

In the appropriation for heating and lighting there was provided
an additional $2,000 for the purchase of an electrically driven fire
pump for fire protection in the Natural History Building.

The second deficiency bill for 1931 carried provision for $1,620 for
an additional clerk and $10,000 for the preparation of preliminary
plans for additions to the Natural History Building. These expendi.

22
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23

tures will figure in the allotment of funds for 1932 and will be consid-
ered in the annual report for that year.

Requirements for additional funds for the National Museum follow
lines indicated in previous annual reports. The question of further
personnel continues to be one of paramount importance, as pressure
for additional workers in the scientific, clerical, and custodial forces
is constant and continued. Additions made to the staff in recent
years have filled in at vital points, but many further positions remain
to be provided before our organization can function with maximum
efficiency. There are several large collections for which the Museum
now has no curators. In some divisions assistants in professional
grades are needed as understudies for older men who should be in a
position to train successors in their particular fields. Clerical assist-
ance is at a minimum everywhere and in several divisions no service of
this kind is at present available. Further subprofessional workers also
are needed and the work of the custodial services in our woodworking
shops is behind. Temporary clerical and other assistance is provided
as funds permit, but this is unsatisfactory, as there is much lost
motion in giving necessary training to assistants who under civil
service rules remain at most only six months. The gradual increase
in staff that has come in recent years has been of great assistance,
but additional employees in numerous places are still urgently
needed.

Additions to funds allotted for the purchase of books have been
useful, but the appropriation available for this purpose should be
increased to at least $5,000 a year. Scientific books appear in steadily
increasing numbers and at a cost considerably in advance of that of a
few years ago, so that the money available for books is below our
actual needs. Stimulus to the scientific work in the National Museum
in the past few years is beginning to show in steadily increasing
amounts of manuscript for publication as the result of researches on
the part of the staff. There should be an increase in the funds for
printing and binding to allow this material to be published promptly,
in order that it may be made available for use by the many persons
interested.

As in previous years our existing appropriations are taken up so
largely with necessary routine expenditures that there is little money
available that may be used in exploration and field work in connec-
tion with the National Museum. Many friends and correspondents
now make large additions to our collections annually, and the Smith-
sonian Institution, from its private income, provides funds that are
used in an exploration program of considerable importance. The
Museum, however, should have in its appropriation adequate funds
that would enable it to develop various field researches along logical
and continuing lines.
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931
ADDITIONS TO THE NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING

In the report for last year there was a discussion of the Smoot-
Elliott bill authorizing the extension of the Natural History Build-
ing by adding wings at the east and west ends at a cost of $6,500,000,
which was approved by the President on June 19, 1930. As men-
tioned above, the second deficiency bill for 1931 carried $10,000 for
the preparation of preliminary plans for these additions. The Allied
Architects Incorporated, of Washington, D. C., have been selected by
the executive committee of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare
preliminary plans which will be ready for consideration at the time
this report is published. Briefly it is planned to add to the present
building so that it will extend through the available space from
Ninth Street to Twelfth Street, the additional construction to dupli-
cate in general arrangement the present building, with the ground
floor and third floor devoted to offices and laboratories and the two
intermediate floors given over to exhibits. In so far as modern
advances in museum design are found applicable to our needs, they
will be incorporated in the plans, and various facilities not at present
available will be arranged. It is desired to so schedule the appro-
priations covering this important matter that funds for the com-
mencement of this work will be provided in the bill for the coming
fiscal year. Delay will be highly embarrassing, since our collections
in natural history have increased to a point where exhibition and
laboratory space is now badly crowded, and under present conditions
we must at times make refusal of valuable material that should be in
the national collections. In recent years various expedients to pro-
vide more space have been adopted, until now we have reached our
limit of resources without additional construction. It will be
observed in further paragraphs of this report that additions to the
exhibition and study collections contained in the Natural History
Building in the present fiscal year have reached the vast number of
nearly 1,000,000 specimens.

If the building program indicated can be carried out at this time
there will be provided adequate quarters for the natural history col-
lections. It must not be overlooked, however, that consideration
must soon be given to further construction to house our highly
valuable materials in arts and industries and in history.

COLLECTIONS

Additions to the collections of the National Museum during the
fiscal year reached the total of 1,022,850 individual specimens, the
major part of these coming, as in previous years, to the department of
biology. The additions are far in excess of those of any previous
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

year in the history of the Museum and include individual specimens
and collections of high value and great importance. Materials of
various kinds received for examination and report during the year
amounted to 1,297 lots, including many thousands of separate speci-
mens. Gifts of duplicate materials to schools and other educational
organizations included 7,884 specimens, while exchanges of dupli-
cate materials with other institutions and individuals amounted to
33,471 specimens, for which there was received in return material
needed for our collections. Loans to scientific workers outside of
Washington amounted to 31,516 specimens.

Following is a digest of the more important accessions for the
year in the various departments and divisions of the Museum.

Anthropology—Alaska again has yielded most important acces-
sions to the department of anthropology, the material coming
through explorations financed by the Smithsonian Institution.
Doctor Hrdlitka this year visited the Kuskokwim Valley, the
Alaska Peninsula, and adjacent islands, obtaining valuable materials
from a region that so far has not been represented in our collections.
Work was continued on St. Lawrence Island by Henry B. Collins, jr.,
who secured additional collections of value in connection with his
previous materials from this area. Through our continuing pro-
gram of exploration the Museum now possesses the most complete
and valuable collection in existence of the ancient ivory culture of
the Bering Sea region.

Of equal importance in this department has been the bequest of
the American Indian collection of the late Victor J. Evans, of Wash-
ington. This collection, deposited by the executors of the Evans
estate, Mrs. Victor J. Evans and Arthur L. Evans, numbers approx-
imately 5,000 specimens, comprising costumes, weapons of war and
the chase, pottery, basketry, domestic implements, oil paintings, and
other valuable materials illustrative of the life of the American
Indian, many of the objects being now impossible of duplication.

A further collection from west Africa was received as a gift from
C. C. Roberts, this material representing the native tribes of Ashanti,
Benin, and the Gold and Ivory Coasts. The Carnegie Institution of
Washington presented a miniature plaster model of the stucco-
covered Pyramid E-VITI sud at Uaxactun in Guatemala, the oldest
known -example of Mayan architecture. Under the Bruce Hughes
fund of the Smithsonian Institution there were obtained various
antiquities from Mesopotamia and Persia for exhibition. As a gift
from His Majesty George V of England there has come a chenille
Axminster carpet made in 1851.

Textiles, and bone, wood, and stone implements from caves in
northeastern Arizona occupied by prehistoric Basket Maker and
2°26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

Pueblo peoples were presented by Charles L. Bernheimer, of New
York City. The Archeological Society of Washington deposited a
collection of flint and bone implements from caves near Sergeac, Dor-
dogne, France, collected in 1930 during work of the American
School of Prehistoric Research. A series of stone artifacts recovered
at Monasukapanough, a prehistoric Indian village in Albemarle
County, Va., was presented by D. I. Bushnell, jr.

Biology—The most important accession in the department of
biology, and one of the most important from a scientific standpoint
that has come to the Museum in recent years, was the Barnes col-
lection of Lepidoptera, purchased by a special appropriation of
$50,000 to the Department of Agriculture and transferred by that
department to the National Museum. This collection, consisting
principally of moths and butterflies from North America, was
assembled by Dr. William Barnes, of Decatur, Ill., during a lifetime
of endeavor at an expense of several hundred thousand dollars, and
is rich in material of value to the specialist.

Dr. Paul Bartsch, curator of mollusks, traveling under the Walter
Rathbone Bacon scholarship of the Smithsonian Institution, ob-
tained extensive collections of mollusks from the West Indies. Ad-
ditional important specimens in several groups have come from the
field activities of Dr. David C. Graham in China and of Dr. Hugh
M. Smith in Siam. Large and interesting series of specimens of
various kinds were obtained by Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States
Navy, while a surgeon on the United States Naval Observatory eclipse
expedition to the island of Niuafoou in the Pacific, being the first
material to be received by the Museum from that area. The
National Geographic Society presented a large collection of birds,
mammals, reptiles, and plants obtained by E. G. Holt, as leader of
an expedition to the boundary region between Venezuela and Brazil.
Much of this collection represents species not found hitherto in the
national collections.

Doctor Wetmore, assisted by F. C. Lincoln, of the Biological Sur-
vey, obtained interesting collections, chiefly of birds and reptiles, in
Haiti and the Dominican Republic. A collection of 3,800 eggs and
12 nests of North American birds was presented by Gov. C. D. Buck,
of Delaware. A further collection of birds was obtained by Doctor
Wetmore in Spain during field work in the summer of 1930. The
division of birds received 16 genera new to its collections, as well as
330 species and subspecies not previously represented, a notable addi-
tion to these large collections. Two eggs of the California condor,
a species near extinction in the wild state, were received from the
National Zoological Park.

A large sailfish caught by Hon. William R. Wood near the island
of Sonora, Pear] Island group, Panama, was presented by Mr. Wood
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 27

to the Museum and has been mounted and placed on exhibition. It
is of maximum size and is far larger than any other in our collec-
tions. The Bureau of Fisheries, United States Department of Com-
merce, transferred a large collection of fishes, principally from
Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.

Type specimens of annelids, sponges, sipunculid worms, and
crustacea were presented to the division of marine invertebrates,
while 114 types of helminths from Prof. Edward Linton, and the
entire collection of Dr. W. G. MacCallum, of Johns Hopkins Hos-
pital, with various other type specimens from collaborators, were
added to the section of helminths.

Large collections of grasses from Japan, Madagascar, and else-
where were transferred by the Department of Agriculture. A large
series of specimens of cultivated plants came from the Brooklyn
Botanic Garden.

Geology.—Thirty-two mineral species new to the collections were
obtained during the year, mainly through purchase under the
Roebling fund. There were obtained also under this fund a large
mass of native silver and calcite estimated to contain 220 pounds of
pure silver, and a section of a vein of similar material carrying 190
pounds of silver from the Keely mine in the cobalt district of
Ontario, a large cut black diamond weighing 8.97 carats for the
exhibition series, and the fossilized vertebra of an extinct reptile of
large size that has been changed in fossilization to a fine quality of
precious opal, a most unusual specimen. There was included also a
flawless crystal of scapolite, said to be the largest crystal of this
mineral yet found, two bowlders of precious jade, and a tourmaline
weighing 4014 carats. The Chamberlain fund contributed to the
Isaac Lea collection three Mexican opals of unusual color, a green
tourmaline weighing 17.9 carats, five rubies from Siam, carved
articles of jade, coral, rose quartz, and carnelian, and other interest-
ing and valuable articles.

Specimens of nine meteorites, added to the collection through
exchange or purchase, include one complete iron weighing 23 pounds
from near Santa Fe, N. Mex., and other valuable examples. A com-
plete set of the potash minerals of the Carlsbad (N. Mex.) deposits
was secured with the assistance of Dr. W. T. Schaller through the
courtesy of the United States Potash Co. Silver, nickel, and cobalt
minerals and ores from various localities in Ontario were collected
during field work by the assistant curator of mineralogy. A set
of platinum ores from South Africa was obtained through the
cooperation of the Geological Survey of the Union of South Africa.

Dr. A. F. Foerste contributed a series of 1,000 invertebrate fossils
from the Silurian deposits of the Ohio Valley. Type material in
Foraminifera was presented by Dr. J. A. Cushman, Mr. John W.
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

Skinner, Mrs. F. B. Plummer, and Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan. Many
valuable specimens, particularly of fossil mammals, were obtained
from collections by C. W. Gilmore in the Eocene deposits of Wyo-
ming, among them being several nearly complete skeletons that will
eventually be mounted and placed on exhibition. There may be
mentioned especially a nearly complete skeleton of Hyrachyus, a
thinoceroslike animal about the size of a tapir, a nearly complete
skeleton of Orohippus, a small primitive horse, and two more or less
complete crocodile skeletons; 38 turtles were obtained belonging to
eight genera. Additional fossil horse material resulted from field
explorations near Hagerman, Idaho, under Dr. J. W. Gidley.

The collection of fossilized tracks of animals was augmented by
an unusually distinct dinosaur footprint from the Triassic of
Virginia, presented by F. C. Littleton, of Aldie, Va. Fossil bird
bones, types of new species described by Doctor Wetmore, were pre-
sented by Dr. E. L. Troxell, of Trinity College, Hartford, Conn.
To the exhibitions in the section of paleobotany there came a fine
example of a fossilized tree from near Natchitoches, La., presented
by George Williamson through the interest of Prof. E. W. Berry.

Arts and industries —An important accession in the aircraft sec-
tion was a series of objects illustrating the first use of aircraft for
military purposes in the United States, relating to captive balloons
used during the Civil War, the collection having come from Prof.
Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, organizer of the first military balloon section
of the Federal Army. The airplane Bremen, the first heavier-than-
air craft to make a nonstop flight westward across the north Atlantic,
was deposited by the New York Museum of Science and Industry.
For the section of land transportation there was secured a coachee,
or light family carriage, made in Philadelphia about 1783 that there
is reason to believe was owned at one time by General Washington
at Mount Vernon. An original Concord stage coach was deposited
by Will Rogers and Fred Stone. The Philadelphia Electric Co.,
through its president, William H. Taylor, presented a model of a
section of the Conowingo hydroelectric generating station on the
Susquehanna River near Conowingo, Md. Another valuable acces-
sion was an original horizontal stationary steam engine built in 1864
in the shops of the United States Military Railroad Department at
Alexandria, Va., presented to the Museum by the Southern Railway
system. This engine was in operation for 58 years.

The Pepperell Manufacturing Co. presented a model exhibit cover-
ing the growth and manufacture of cotton. A number of interesting
examples of hand-woven textiles from several individuals included a
linen damask tablecloth woven in Vermont about 1780, the design
being an illustration of Independence Hall, Philadelphia. This was
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

presented by Mrs. Jennie Bancroft Alband. Dr. J. T. Lloyd pre-
sented a hand prescription balance used many years ago by
pharmacists.

In the section of wood technology there were added important col-
lections of woods from Jamaica collected by Gerrit S. Miller, jr.,
a set of woods from various localities obtained from the Field
Museum of Natural History in exchange, and a series of 182 kinds
of native woods presented by the Philippine Bureau of Forestry
through A. F. Fischer.

For the division of graphic arts there was obtained a miniature
book, The Gospel of St. Matthew, printed from 214-point type, the
smallest type that has ever been cast. The printed surface of the
page measures 15g by 11% inches and has approximately 540 words
to a page.

The trustees of the Stephen H. Tyng Foundation of England have
made the section of photography in the Smithsonian Institution
the depository for duplicate pictorial prints procured by the founda-
tion. The first installment of photographs from this source came
during the year and will be followed by others. The works chosen
are selected by the trustees of the foundation as representative
works of outstanding pictorial merit produced by the photographers
of any nation.

History.—tIn the antiquarian section a watch and a sword carried
during the French and Indian War by Capt. Jeremiah Marston, of
the British Army, were presented by Charles F. Clark. There came
also a chair owned by Benjamin Franklin, a chair of President
James Madison, a mahogany screen belonging to General Washing-
ton, and a cane made from a piece of one of the timbers of the
U.S. S. Constitution by bequest from James C. McGuire.

The aluminum transit used by Admiral Peary during his north
polar expedition in 1898 was received as a gift from Mrs. William
Porter Allen. A uniform worn during the Spanish-American war by
Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood was added to the collections as a gift by
Mrs. Leonard Wood. An exceptionally interesting series of military
uniforms and equipment was presented by the Rumanian Government
through Dr. Andrei Popovici, secretary of the Rumanian Legation.
A similar series of ‘Turkish military arms and uniforms came as a
eift from the Turkish Government through the Turkish ambassador,
Ahmet Muhtar.

For the numismatic collection there were obtained examples of
current coins from the Governments of Estonia, Italy, Poland, and
the Cameroons. A set of coins from Palestine was presented by
P. Knabenshue, American consul general at Jerusalem. Numerous
other coins from a large number of countries were transferred by
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

the Department of State. The United States Treasury Department
transferred to the national collections bronze copies of the gold
medal awarded by Congress to Col. Charles A. Lindbergh in recog-
nition of his services to the science of aeronautics and of the gold
medal awarded by the Congress to Lincoln Ellsworth for his trans-
polar flight in the dirigible Vorge in May, 1926. The philatelic
collections received 7,855 specimens during the year, the majority
having come by transfer from the Post Office Department.

CHANGES IN EXHIBITIONS

In the paleontological series of the Museum exhibition the most
important addition has been the installation of the large dinosaur
Diplodocus longus, collected at the Dinosaur National Monument,
Utah. This specimen as mounted in our halls measures more than
70 feet in length and stands 12 feet 5 inches high, with the head and
neck rising to a still greater height. The base has been so arranged
that at the shoulders and at the hips visitors may walk through
beneath the skeleton. This specimen, found embedded in a very
hard and difficult rock, has required nearly six years for preparation.

An important change in the historical series has been the transfer
of the costumes collection to a larger hall, where the cases containing
the series of dresses of wives of the Presidents are now installed in
a double row facing one another. This collection is one of the most
popular in the Museum and shows to excellent advantage in the large
space now available for it.

The numismatic collections have been transferred to the smaller
room formerly occupied by the costumes, where the light is much
better, allowing the coin and medal series to be viewed more readily,
especially on days when artificial ight is necessary. The philatelic
collection also has been moved to a location where it is much more
easily available.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Field investigations carried on as usual throughout the year have
been concerned with a wide variety of interests, and though mainly
in the biological field, have included those researches concerned with
man and with fossil animals of various kinds, as well as with various
groups in botany and zoology. ‘The work has been financed princi-
pally through grants from the general income of the Smithsonian
Institution, assisted by contributions from interested individuals,
while certain projects were financed from special funds of the Insti-
tution. Limited assistance has been given from the annual govern-
mental appropriations of the National Museum, but aid from this
source has been relatively small and has concerned only a few of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ol

various projects. Additional money that may be used for researches
in the field is one of the principal needs of our organization.

A brief account of field work for the present year follows: During
the months of July, August, and September, the assistant curator
of ethnology, Henry B. Collins, jr., assisted by J. A. Ford, was
engaged in field work on St. Lawrence Island in Bering Sea,
in continuation of work begun earlier in the season. In 1928 and
1929 Mr. Collins’s excavations on Punuk and St. Lawrence Islands
revealed the existence of a prehistoric phase of Eskimo culture ances-
tral to the modern type of that region and derived apparently from
a still earlier phase, known to students as the old Bering Sea culture.
Stratigraphic excavations were made this year at Gambell and a long
succession of cultural changes was revealed in detail as one village
midden after another was trenched. Through this an excellent
chronology was established on the basis of stratigraphy, the evidence
of the old beach lines, and the demonstrable succession of art styles
on implements, principaliy harpoon heads of walrus ivory. Inci-
dental to this work Mr. Collins took occasion to secure an excellent
collection of birds from this island, the bird life of which has been
comparatively little known. The active interest of the Revenue Cut-
ter Service in this work continued and was of invaluable assistance,
particularly the transportation furnished on the cutter Vorthland to
areas otherwise inaccessible. Cooperation from this source has been
highly appreciated.

The curator of ethnology, Herbert W. Krieger, engaged in a recon-
naissance of an archeological nature in the Republic of Haiti, this
work being carried on from January to May, 1931, when the approach
of the rainy season brought it to a close. The present population
of Haiti has no history or tradition regarding the early Indian occu-
pants of the island, and is therefore of no assistance in locating
former Arawak or Ciboney village sites and kitchen middens, so that
one has to rely on Spanish and French narratives for the ethnologi-
cal and historical introduction useful in this work. The reconnais-
sance was highly successful in determining the distribution of former
Arawak and Ciboney village sites, and it was found that scattered
groups of each type occupied at different times much of the habitable
portions of the island. A check was made also on data from Spanisn
writers who gave differing accounts with regard to the former pres-
ence of a troglodytic population in the isolated mountains of the
southwestern peninsula.

As a further important result, this season’s investigations estab-
lished the identity of the Samana cave culture, investigated by a
Smithsonian expedition in 1928, with the large shell middens on Ile
4 Vache, on the Caribbean coast of Haiti. The same primitive, non-
agricultural, non-Arawak Ciboney apparently are also responsible
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

for the large middens consisting primarily of conch shells (Strombus
gigas) recently discovered by Doctor Wetmore on Beata Island off
the southern coast of Barahona Province, Dominican Republic.
Cumulative evidence obtained during the current year and from
previous Smithsonian expeditions links the culture of the West
Indies with the Arawakan tribes of Venezuela and of the Guianas.
There is also data to show that there was no direct tribal contact of
these island Arawak with the tribes of southern Florida, although
culturally in many ways they were closely associated. There seems
to have been a vast overlapping of culture traits of the southeastern
United States from the south, these trait complexes centering about
the cultivation of maize and the production of pottery. In so far as
cassava (yucca) formed a staple food, the former aboriginal culture
traits are associated with those of the South American forested
tropical lowlands.

As in former years, the expedition headed by Mr. Collins was made
possible by a Smithsonian grant, while that of Mr. Krieger was
financed by Dr. W. L. Abbott.

From April 21 to June 6, 1931, the assistant curator of archeology,
I’. M. Setzler, was engaged in archeological investigations in Texas,
arranged in cooperation with the Bureau of American Ethnology
of the Smithsonian Institution. After briefly examining several
sites along the Gulf coast, he excavated four caves and one rock
shelter in Presidio County and visited several other caves in that
vicinity. From one large cave examples of aboriginal basketry,
matting, cradles, sandals, and other materials were recovered.
Although this site is only 150 miles east of a marginal Basket Maker
culture, no trace was found of these early Southwestern people. The
material exhumed by Mr. Setzler differs in some respects from any
other in the Museum, and more research will be required before it
can be identified definitely. He has prepared a preliminary report
on this field work.

Except for two weeks in October, 1930, J. Townsend Russell, jr.,
collaborator in Old World archeology, spent the year in Europe,
where he continued archeological studies and participated in the
excavations of the American School of Prehistoric Research at Castel
Merle, in the Dordogne, France, and in Czechoslovakia. Toward
the close of the fiscal year Mr. Russell was active in details looking
toward a cooperative undertaking with the University of Toulouse
for excavation of prehistoric sites in France, which will add de-
cidedly to the collections of the National Museum in a field from
which our Institution previously has had very little. These investi-
gations are financed by a special fund for work in Old World
archeology.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 33

Dr. Ales Hrdlitka, curator of physical anthropology, left in May
on a fourth expedition to Alaska, for the purpose of obtaining
measurements and, if possible, casts of the few remaining full-blood
Aleutians. He expected to work in the region of supposed contact
_ between the Eskimo, the Aleut, and the Indian, and to examine the
various mountain passes between Bering Sea and Cook Inlet and
the Gulf of Alaska, through which migrations of early man from
the Bering Sea area southward may have been possible.

Dr. Paul Bartsch, through the Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling
Scholarship under the Smithsonian Institution, continued field work
in the West Indian islands in a study of the terrestrial molluscan
fauna of this area, completing a program of travel initiated two
years ago. This year efforts were focused on the southern Bahamas,
the islands off the south coast of Cuba, and the Cayman group. Doc-
tor Bartsch was accompanied by three assistants, Harold Cluttick, a
student of George Washington University; Ray Greenfield, who had
been with him two years ago in Cuba; and Alva G. Nye, jr., of Wash-
ington. Harold Peters of the Bureau of Entomology, also accom-
panied the party to collect specimens of avian parasites. The party
left Miami, Fla., on June 9, 1930, in the Zsland Home, a 33-ton, shal-
low-draft vessel. Work was carried through the islands and cays of
the southern Bahamas until August 6, and then the party explored
the wonderful molluscan fauna of Great Inagua Island, which
proved by far the richest of all the Bahamas. On reaching Guanta-
namo, Cuba, the /sland Home was pronounced unseaworthy, and an-
other boat the José Enrique, a 35-ton sloop with an auxiliary 22
horsepower gasoline engine, was chartered at Santiago. On August
28 the party continued through the keys along the south coast of
Cuba, and from September 10 to September 17 was occupied on Cay-
man Brac, Little Cayman, and Great Cayman islands. Sails were
then set for Cuba, and until September 24 the keys along the coast
from Cayo Largo to the Isle of Pines were searched. On Septem-
ber 29 the port of Batabano, Cuba, was reached and the collections
were shipped by rail to Habana. The expedition returned to Wash-
ington on October 3. This cruise yielded a larger amount of mollus-
can materia] than any of the previous trips, no less than 250,000
specimens of mollusks being secured, together with many observa-
tions on molluscan faunistic relations. Large collections in other
groups were also obtained, among them 925 bird skins and 596 rep-
tiles and amphibians, besides a number of live animals, principally
reptiles, for the National Zoological Park.

The Rev. David C. Graham, whose explorations in western
Szechwan, China, and the neighboring regions of T ibet, have
been a feature of these reports for many years, continued work near
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

Suifu, and forwarded to the National Museum large and important
collections numbering in all 62,000 specimens, the greater part con-
sisting of insects. His main trip during 1930 was an excursion into
the unknown and difficult country south of Tatsienlu.

Dr. J. M. Aldrich, in continuation of work which has extended
over a period of many years, spent part of June and July, 1930, in
making collections of Diptera in Idaho, Washington, California, and
Colorado. He visited many type localities, and his collections for
this season include a larger number of interesting forms than he has
obtained before in a like period in the United States.

Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt continued his investigations of the marine
fauna at the Carnegie Marine Biological Station, Tortugas, Fla.,
from July 9 to August 8, 1930, through the cooperation of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, undertaking this year a pre-
liminary investigation of the deeper water readily accessible to the
laboratory. Among the prizes brought back were three specimens
of the giant isopod Bathynomus, the largest specimen being 101%
inches long, and a new portunid crab of the genus Benthocascon, a
group heretofore known only from a single specimen taken in the
Andaman Sea, Indian Ocean.

Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, through the courtesy of
the Naval Observatory and the friendly cooperation of the Navy
Department, was again detailed to act as representative of the
Smithsonian Institution for the purpose of making biological collec-
tions during the United States Naval Observatory eclipse expedition
to Niuafoou, nicknamed “ 'Tin-can Island,” a partly submerged vol-
canic crater situated between Samoa and Fiji. His collections in-
clude 100 bird skins and over 7,000 alcoholic specimens of various
kinds.

Ernest G. Holt, under the auspices of the National Geographic
Society, continued explorations along the Venezuelan-Brazilian
boundary and returned with valuable collections, principally of birds,
reptiles, amphibians, and plants which have been presented to the
National Museum by the society. In the preliminary examination
of this material many forms not before represented in our collections
have been found. The material is particularly welcome, as the
Museum has previously had but little from this region.

Because of association in the work of the National Herbarium
it is proper to mention field investigations by Mrs. Agnes Chase, of
the Department of Agriculture, who collected in the Eastern Shore
region of Maryland for the purpose of studying the distribution of
certain coastal plain species of grasses, and by Jason R. Swallen,
who spent about three months in the region from Tennessee to Texas
and northeastern Mexico studying the ranges of grasses.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

Gerrit S. Miller, jr., visited Jamaica from February to April with
the special object of determining whether or not bones of rodents or
other mammals that are now extinct might be found in the village
middens of the pre-Columbian Arawaks. Several kitchen middens
were investigated and much material bearing on the food habits of
the aboriginal inhabitants was obtained. Miscellaneous collections
of various kinds also were made, particularly of plants, reptiles, and
Arawak artifacts.

Dr. A. Wetmore, accompanied by Frederick C. Lincoln, of the
Bureau of Biological Survey, collected from the middle of March
until the end of May in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, continu-
ing the biological survey of Hispaniola that has been under way
for several years. The first work was done in the region of Fort
Liberte in the north, where they were accompanied by S. W. Parish
and by M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
who were traveling with Mr. Krieger to examine archeological sites
that the latter had under investigation in that area. Returning to
Port-au-Prince, Doctor Wetmore, through the courtesy of the United
States Marine Corps, made a reconnaissance by airplane of the La
Hotte Mountains of southwest Haiti, securing information that gov-
erned later travel by pack train in this area and the ascent of Pic de
Macaya, the highest mountain in this complex. On arrival again
at the coast a visit was made to Ile a Vache to supplement collections
made there last year by the Parish expedition.

Returning to Port-au-Prince, Doctor Wetmore and Mr. Lincoln
traveled by auto through the mountains to Barahona, in the Domini-
can Republic, where they secured a small sloop and continued to
Beata Island, a little-known island where new forms of birds, rep-
tiles, and land shells were obtained and an extensive series of Indian
shell mounds was examined. Work in the Dominican Republic
was made possible through letters given by General Rafael Trujillo,
President of the Republic, to whom all thanks are due for this
invaluable assistance.

Edward P. Henderson, assistant curator of mineralogy, under the
auspices of the Roebling fund, spent a month in the well-known
silver and nickel camps of Ontario, Canada. Starting from Toronto,
he first visited the cobalt district, 300 miles to the north, where rich
silver masses and their associations were acquired. Sudbury, the
most important nickel district in the world, was next visited. Here
a quantity of nickel ore and its minerals was obtained. The pegma-
tite dikes of the Province at Bancroft yielded recently described
materials lacking in our collections. The hearty cooperation of the
mining companies, quarry owners, and the staff of the Royal Ontario
Museum of Mineralogy was largely responsible for the success of

102992—32——_4
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

the trip. Later in the year Mr. Henderson made a brief trip to some
of the noted mineral localities in North Carolina to obtain material
needed for the study of particular problems.

Dr. C. E. Resser spent about four months in the field, working
first in the Grand Canyon, in Arizona, under the auspices of the Car-
negie Institution. The second phase of his work led diagonally
across the State of Arizona on a rapid reconnaissance, followed by a
return to the Grand Canyon for further studies. In this he was
accompanied by Dr. A. A. Stoyanow, of the University of Arizona,
and by members of the Park Service, who aided in his investigations.
Early in July, starting from Salt Lake City, where Dr. R. Endo
became a member of the party, work began on the local geology
about Delta, Utah, where the party was accompanied by Frank
Beckwith, with a profitable visit to Zion Canyon. Thence the course
lay north to the Tetons and other places in the vicinity of Yellow-
stone National Park. During investigations at those places, Dr.
and Mrs. Curt Teichert joined the party. Rain interfered mate-
rially with travel and work; and since matters of moment requiring
attention arose at the Museum, work was closed for the season.
Travel from Salt Lake City was by truck, the entire trip home being
made by this means. The season as a whole was most profitable
in the knowledge gained of the various geologic strata, although not
many fossils were secured, as the strata studied are for the most part
nonfossiliferous.

Since the field exploration in charge of C. W. Gilmore extended
into the present year, but brief mention was made of it in last year’s
report. This exploration in the Bridger (Kocene), in the Bridger
Basin, southwestern Wyoming, met with unusual success in the
acquisition of large and representative collections. Some of the
outstanding specimens have been mentioned elsewhere in this report.
The collection as a whole gives the division a good representation of
the Bridger fauna and in all probability contains many undescribed
forms, being particularly rich in mammals. Its value was further
enhanced by the cooperation of Dr. W. H. Bradley, of the United
States Geological Survey, who secured the necessary data for a
large-scale map, which, with his geological sections, insures the ac-
curate placing of the specimens both geographically and geologically.
George F. Sternberg, as in previous seasons, rendered efficient serv-
ice, and George B. Pierce ably assisted as field assistant. At the
close of the fiscal year Mr. Gilmore, again accompanied by Mr.
Sternberg, was in the field in Montana and Wyoming.

Although work at the fossil locality near Hagerman, Idaho, was
very successful in the season of 1929, the results of the 1930 expedi-
tion under Dr. J. W. Gidley exceeded it in both quantity and quality,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37

as some of the best material found in the deposit was obtained near
the close of operations. Camp was established early in May and
work was begun where operations had closed the previous season.
Two months’ additional work fully confirmed the opinion that this
fossil bone deposit is one of the most important discoveries in the
field of vertebrate paleontology in recent years. Associated with
the abundant horse remains were found bones of beaver, otter,
mastodon, peccary, and others. The collecting for the season was
brought to a close early in July, but the field was still so promising
that a third expedition was undertaken in the spring of 1931, under
N. H. Boss, chief preparator in the division of vertebrate paleon-
tology. This party was still in the field at the close of the fiscal year
so that its results will come properly in the report for next year.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Usual routine repairs have been necessary in connection with the
buildings of the National Museum to keep them in proper condition.
In the Natural History Building the auditorium was painted, as
were also the corridors surrounding it. A considerable amount of
painting was done in ranges in halls on the first and second floors,
many of which had not been painted since the completion of the
building nearly 20 years ago. Metal and wooden window frames
were painted, as were also the walls and floors of the engine room.
A revolving door was installed at the north entrance, a needed
improvement particularly in the winter season.

Steel galleries were erected in two ranges on the ground floor and
in certain adjacent rooms that provide housing for the study collec-
tions of mammals which have been stored temporarily in two exhibi-
tion halls on the second floor. Necessary plans and specifications for
this work were prepared by the engineering division of the Office
of Public Buildings and Public Parks. The work of erection of the
galleries began on April 15, 1931, and was well along toward comple-
tion at the close of the fiscal year.

In the Arts and Industries Building various exhibition halls were
reconditioned during rearrangement of some of the exhibits, and the
women’s comfort room was enlarged and remodeled. In the Aircraft
Building a sprinkler system and other fire safeguards were installed.
The building was repainted within and without and a concrete base
was built at the bottom of the sloping sides around the entire
exterior.

In the rooms occupied by the National Museum in the Smithsonian
Building walls and ceilings in 12 rooms in the division of plants were
repainted, and insulating material to control excess summer heat and
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

excess heat ra(liation in winter was installed in the ceiling in the
main herbarium hall.

The power plant was in operation from September 29, 1930, until
May 27, 1931. The consumption of coal during the year was 3,329
tons, at an average cost per ton of $5.65. The amount required was
somewhat less than that of last year, due primarily to the mild winter,
and secondarily to the fact that some of our electric current was
purchased from the Potomac Electric Power Co., thus relieving the
load on the boilers at such times as all of the exhaust steam was not
needed for heating the Natural History Building. The Steamboat
Inspection Service has examined the boilers and tb> elevators have
been regularly inspected by the District of Columbia inspector. The
total electric current produced amounted to 613,000 kilowatt-hours,
manufactured at a cost of 1.78 cents per kilowatt-hour, including
interest on the plant, depreciation, repairs, and material. In addi-
tion electric current to the amount of 73,250 kilowatt-hours was pur-
chased and used in the exhibition halls of the Arts and Industries
Building. Needs for electrical current are steadily increasing, par-
ticularly to provide favorable lighting in our exhibition halls during
dark days in winter, and increased purchases will be required in the
future.

The ice plant manufactured 406.8 tons of ice, at an average cost
of $).67 per ton, a reduction from the expense for the previous year.
With the plant operating at full capacity it is not practicable at the
present time to manufacture the entire amount of ice required during
the hottest weather of summer, so that it is necessary to purchase a
certain amount at that time.

During the year 20 exhibition cases and bases, 489 pieces of storage,
laboratory, and other furniture, and 1,667 drawers of various kinds
were added, the greater part of these being manufactured in our
shops.

MEETINGS AND RECEPTIONS

The lecture rooms and auditorium were used during the present
year for 103 meetings, covering the usual wide range of activities.
Government agencies that utilized these facilities for hearings, meet-
ings, lectures, and other special occasions included the Bureau of

MISCELLANEOUS

The exhibition halls of the National Museum were open during
the year on week days from 9 a. m. to 4.30 p. m., except that the Air-
craft Building, as has been noted, was closed for repairs for eight
months during the year. Our Museum halls were also open on Sun-
day afternoons from 1.80 p. m. to 4.30 p. m., with the exception of
the Aircraft Building. All buildings remained closed during the
day on Christmas and on New Year’s.

The flags on the Smithsonian and Museum Buildings were placed
at half mast from 1.15 p. m. April 9 through April 11, out of respect
for the late Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Nicho-
las Longworth. During the forenoon of Memorial Day the flags
also were held at half-mast. Visitors for the year totaled 1,669,140,
a decrease of a little more than 230,000 from the record of the pre-
ceding year, this difference being due partly to the fact that the Air-
craft. Building was closed for a considerable part of this period.
Attendance in the several buildings in the National Museum was
recorded as follows: Smithsonian Institution, 258,616; Arts and In-
dustries Building, 731,186; Natural History Building, 631,498; Air-
craft Building, 47,840. The average daily attendance for week days
was 4,452, and for Sundays 5,472.

During the year the Museum published 7 volumes and 41 separate
papers, while the distribution of literature amounted to 86,680 copies
of its various books and pamphlets. Additions to the Museum
library, obtained partly by exchange, partly by donation, and partly
by purchase, included 2,528 volumes and 832 pamphlets, an increase
over those of the previous year. The library of the National Museum,
as separate from that of the Smithsonian Institution proper, now
contains 79,407 volumes and 109,129 pamphlets. Much progress was
mede during the year in the arrangement and cataloguing of these
collections, not only in the main libraries but also in the 86 sectional
libraries of the organization. Duplicate volumes in our series have
been assembied and many have been distributed to other organiza-
tions, either as gifts or as exchanges.

On March 5, 1931, John E. Graf was appointed associate director
of the National Museum under the assistant secretary. Mr. Graf
came to the Museum by transfer from the Department of Agricul-
ture, where he had long been connected with the administration of
the Bureau of Entomology, in recent years as assistant chief.

In the department of anthropology the former divisions of Ameri-
can archeology and of Old World archeology were consolidated on
February 1, 1930, as a division of archeology, under Neil M. Judd
as curator.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith my report on the opera-
tions of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1981:

PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF 'THE ART COLLECTIONS

In 1920 the art collections of the Institution, so far as they had
been assigned to the care of the recently established National Gallery
of Art, were installed in the central skylighted hall of the new
Natural History Building of the National Museum. This hall
extends from the rotunda on the south to the north front of the
building, the windows of which look down on Constitution Avenue.
Permanent screens were introduced in this hall affording excellent
hanging space for the paintings. The disposition then made of the
numerous groups of art works has been changed from time to time
and important groups have been added. During the 10 years that
have passed slight record of the placement of these collections has
been kept, and it may be advisable to indicate here briefly the present
distribution.

The Harriet Lane Johnston collection, an early bequest of great
value, comprising paintings and historical documents, is installed in
the northwest long room of this hall. Across the hallway from
this collection, occupying the northeast long room, is the Ralph Cross
Johnson gift of rare European old masters, presented in 1919.

Distributed through a number of rooms, including the large cen-
tral gallery, are numerous groups of works by our American masters.
Prominent among these is the great gift of 152 paintings, represent-
ing 106 artists, by William T. Evans, of New York. The Alfred
Duane Pell collection of art objects of varied types and much inter-
est is accommodated in the north extension and hallway at the north
end of the hall. A number of the larger works of both paintings and
sculptures are installed in available spaces in the rotunda.

On the ground and first floors are several groups of historical
paintings. First among these is the group of World War portraits.
Shortly after the close of the World War a number of Americans
organized a national art committee, the purpose of which was to ob-
tain portraits for the National Gallery of Art of a number of dis-
tinguished leaders of the allied forces. Entering this hall from the

43
44. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

north the visitor finds himself face to face with many of the out-
standing personages of the great war—hlings, queens, presidents, sol-
diers, statesmen, and others—whose faces and achievements are fa-
milar to the peoples of every civilized. nation.

Occupying the walls of a large room on the second floor is the
collection of portraits of survivors of the Civil War painted from
life by Walter Beck 50 years after the close of the war. Associated
with this group are two other World War groups, the John Elliott
collection of portraits of young Americans who entered the air service
of France before the United States had decided to take part in the
war, many of these losing their lives in the struggle; and a very
interesting collection of sketches of prominent World War person-
ages made by John C. Johansen for use in executing his great work,
the “Signing of the Peace Treaty, June 28, 1919,” now occupying
the west wall of the lobby. In the lobby are assembled also numer-
ous busts and other works of sculpture, while a number of paintings
embellish available spaces on the walls of the stairway. The Freer
collection, the most important single unit of the gallery’s possessions,
occupies a commodious building immediately west of the Smith-
sonian provided by the donor. The recently acquired Gellatly col-
lection of art works of wide scope and great value is retained, as
originally installed by the donor, in the Heckscher Building, New
York City, due to lack of gallery space in Washington; while the
large collection of drawings by John S. Sargent (1856-1925), a gift
from his sisters Miss Emily Sargent and Mrs. Violet Ormond, re-
main in storage at the Corcoran Gallery of Art for the same reason.

THE GALLERY COMMISSION

The tenth annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Commis-
sion was held in the Regents’ room of the Smithsonian Institution
at 10.30 o’clock, December 9, 1930. The members present were: Gari
Melchers, chairman; Frank J. Mather, jr., vice chairman; W. H.
Holmes, secretary; Herbert Adams, James E. Fraser, J. H. Gest,
John EK. Lodge, Charles Moore, E. W. Redfield, and Dr. Charles G.
Abbot, ex officio.

The minutes of the last annual meeting, held December 10, 1929,
were read and approved. The annual report of the secretary of the
commission reviewing the activities of the gallery for the calendar
year 1930 was read and accepted.

After careful inspection, a portrait of Commodore Stephen De-
catur, by Gilbert Stuart, bequeathed to the National Gallery by the
late William Decatur Parsons, and an enamel watch by Loulinie &
Legandroy, Geneva, Savitzorlend| bequeathed to the Institution by
Miss Charlotte Arnold H. Bryson were accepted by the commission.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 45
THE ABNEY BEQUEST

Doctor Abbot made the following statement: Under the will of
Mrs. Mary Lloyd Pendleton Abney, of New York, dated May 16,
1928, the following bequest is made:

Clause—

Seventh. To the National Gallery, at Washington, D. C., heretofore known
as the Corcoran Galery, I give and bequeath the four Key family portraits
said to have been painted by Peter Lilly and Godfrey Kneller, to wit, portraits
of Mrs. John Zouch (Lady Zouch); Michael Arnold; Ann Arnold, wife of
Michael Arnold and daughter of Thomas Knipe; and Susan Gardner, the
mother of John Ross; and I give and bequeath also the portrait of Mary
Tayloe Lloyd, wife of my grandfather, Francis Scott Key, painted by Godfrey
Kneller, and her miniature, painted by Robert Field; the Key table, and two
chairs which were used by Francis Seott Key; the Lloyd mahogany table and
four old chairs and old knocker from the Francis Scott Key house, which was
at Georgetown, by the Arlington Bridge, now known as the Key Bridge. * * *

(Note by the executrix: Mrs. Abney, while living donated and delivered to
others the furniture mentioned in clause 7, and the “old knocker” was not
found among her effects.)

[Doctor Abbot, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, has been
informed by Mrs. Jane F. Brice, the sister and executrix of Mrs.
Abney, that the Corcoran Gallery has executed waiver to any right
it might have to the bequest, and the matter was presented by her
to the director of the National Gallery, with the oral request, by
her husband, to have the National Gallery also execute a waiver of
its rights.

The matter was laid before the permanent committee of the Board
of Regents. Having in mind the probable value and interest of the
objects, both from the artistic and historical standpoints, and in
view of the national character of the gallery, the committee did not
feel that on the ex parte statements of the executrix, who is also
the residuary legatee under the will, they could waive any rights
that the gallery might have, without a proper adjudication of the
matter, and so informed Mrs. Brice. The matter is now before the
court. |

THE RANGER COLLECTION

At the request of the chairman, James E. Fraser read a report
that had been made to the council of the National Academy regard-
ing the selection of the Ranger pictures to be retained by the
National Gallery.

After full discussion in which it developed that the commission
was not to be asked to take any official action, Mr. Gest submitted
the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the thanks of the commission be tendered Mr. Fraser for his

comprehensive statement and that the paper be included in the records of this
meeting as a matter of information.
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

THE WASHINGTON BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION

Herbert Adams brought up the matter of the Washington bicenten-
nial celebration planned for 1932, saying that the Sculpture Society
had suggested a comprehensive scheme for the exhibition of paintings
and sculptures pertaining to Washington. The matter was discussed
at some length, and Mr. Moore stated that the Bicentennial Commis-
sion had this matter in hand and that the commission would probably
address a letter to the secretary of the Institution on the subject.

ELECTIONS

The secretary was directed to cast a ballot for the reelection of
Gari Melchers, chairman; Prof. F. J. Mather, jr., vice chairman; and
William H. Holmes, secretary.

The secretary called attention to the fact that the terms of three
members of the commission would expire on December 14. Mr.
Fraser submitted the following resolution which was adopted:

Resolved, That the commission recommend to the Board of Regents the
reelection for the succeeding term of four years of the following members:
Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, and Charles Moore.

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the
commission adjourned at 12 o’clock.

EXHIBITIONS HELD IN THE GALLERY

1. A collection of 78 masterly water colors of Asiatic, European,
and American Indian subjects, by William Spencer Bagdatopoulos,
the Greek-English artist, was shown in the two northern small rooms
of the gallery October 30 to December 22, 1930. A catalogue was
supplied by the gallery.

2. A memorial exhibition of water colors of Egyptian, Greek,
French, Italian, and English subjects, by Henry Bacon, was installed
in the large middle room of the gallery March 14 to April 30, 1981.
The collection proved of exceptional interest. A catalogue was sup-
plied by the gallery.

3. The fortieth annual exhibition of the Society of Washington
Artists, the second held in the gallery, occupied the walls in the
central group of rooms, main floor of the gallery, February 1 to
March 1, 1931. The exhibition included 162 paintings and 21 works
of sculpture and received flattering public attention. An illustrated
catalogue was supplied by the society.

THE GALLERY CATALOGUE

Two catalogues of the art collections of the Institution have been
published as Bulletin 70 of the United States National Museum, the
first edition in 1906 and the second in 1916, by Richard Rathbun,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47

assistant secretary of the Institution, and two catalogues of the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, the first edition in 1922 and the second in 1926,
by the director.

During the year the director has devoted his energies largely to
the preparation of a comprehensive catalogue of the art works of
the Institution, giving especial attention to works of painting and
sculpture. This catalogue does not include the wide range of minor
art works usually included in museums of art; and since no definite
line has yet been drawn between assignments to the gallery and those
that properly pertain to the Museum, the limits of the catalogue
must remain indefinite.

The form of the catalogue has received very especial attention.
The cards used measure 8 by 10% inches, corresponding thus to the
standard manuscript sheets of the Institution. Each unit or card of
the catalogue comprises two somewhat rigid sheets, one devoted to a
record of the source of the work and to the biography of the artist
and the other to a picture of the work itself. Some 600 cards are
now completed. The portrait group comprises about one-third of
this number. These are separately assembled owing to the anticipa-
tion that the Institution may find it possible, in the near future, to
organize a national portrait gallery, and possibly at least to print
separately this portion of the catalogue of the art works of the
Institution.

Portraits of several types are included in the catalogue approxi-
mately as follows:

1. Oil paintings.

2. Water colors.

3. Pastel and related technique.
4, Engravings.

5. Sculpture.

PROFESSOR HOLMES AND THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

It may not seem out of place, since the director’s official life is
nearing its close, to record here briefly his connection with the Smith-
sonian Institution. Just 60 years ago he entered the north door of
the Institution an entire stranger and proceeded to sketch a bril-
liantly colored bird installed in one of the Museum cases. He was
observed at this work, and as a result was soon engaged in drawing
natural history specimens for the resident professors. In 1872 he
was appointed artist to the survey of the Territories and took part
in the survey of the Yellowstone region. In 1874 he was appointed
assistant geologist on the survey then working in Colorado and has
found his services continuously called for in the fields of both science
and art. Advancing step by step and from yea to year in both
branches, he finds himself to-day a member of the National Academy
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

of Sciences and Director of the National Gallery of Art. His varied
activities in these fields are recorded in upward of 50 annual reports
made to the departments with which he served.

56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

Curatorial work within the collection has embraced specifically
the study and recording of inscriptions and seals on recently acquired
Chinese paintings and of Buddhist inscriptions on stone sculptures
and votive bronze images. The work of cataloguing the near eastern
section of manuscripts and paintings, mentioned as being under
way in the last report, has been completed. Translation of the
Persian texts has fixed the identity of upwards of 60 Persian minia-
tures taken from various early manuscripts of the Shdhndmah, the
Gulistdn of Sa‘adi, and other works. In addition to translations of
inscriptions on objects in the Freer collection others have been
made of inscriptions on objects submitted to the curator by other
institutions and by private persons for expert opinion as to their
esthetic or historical value. In all, 2,312 objects and 107 photo-
graphs of objects were submitted for examination.

The most important changes in exhibition that have been made
since 1923 were accomplished during the week of March 15, amount-
ing to the opening of four new galleries and changed exhibitions in
two others. Galleries I and II, at the right of the entrance, are
now devoted to the display of works of art from the Near East
and India. Included in these are early Arabic manuscripts and
paintings, Arabic tooled leather bindings, Persian manuscripts,
paintings and painted pottery, Indian painting and sculpture. This
change has not only given increased space to the near eastern section
but also has left the eastern end of the building to the exclusive
exhibition of the arts of China. Ancient bronzes, silver, and silver-
gilt are now displayed in Gallery XIV, ceremonial and ornamental
jades of the Chou and Han periods in the adjoining corridor. Gal-
lery XVIII exhibits scroll paintings and Gallery XIX pottery, por-
celain, and panel paintings.

The care and preservation of objects in the collection has in-
cluded work that can be itemized as follows:

(1) Remounted:
2. Chinese scroll paintings.
1 Chinese panel painting.
2 Japanese screen paintings.
6 Indian miniature paintings.
(2) Repaired (i. e., relined, remounted, or resurfaced) :
22 paintings by Whistler.
2 paintings by A. H. Thayer.
2 paintings by T. W. Dewing.
2 paintings by D. W. Tryon.
2 paintings by G. Melchers.
1 painting by J. S. Sargent.
1 painting by A. Ryder.

THE LIBRARY

During the year there have been added to the main library 61
volumes, 20 unbound periodicals, and 150 pamphlets. Twenty vol-
umes were sent to the bindery, 10 volumes to be bound, 4 volumes
to be repaired, 48 numbers of Aokka to be bound in 4 volumes, and
6 numbers of Z’oung Pao to be bound in 2 volumes. A list of the
new accessions to the library accompanies this report as Appendix
A (not printed).

The library is in process of being catalogued under the direction
of the librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, W. L. Corbin. This
work was begun in November, 1929, and is not yet completed.

REPRODUCTIONS AND PAMPHLETS

Seven hundred and sixty-four new negatives of objects have been
made. Of these, 329 were made for registration photographs, 435
for special orders and 67 for study purposes. The total number of
reproductions available either as carbon photographs or as negatives
from whieh prints can be made upon request is now 38,858. Twenty-
four additional post cards have been published, making a total num-
ber of 96 subjects now on sale. One hundred and nineteen lantern
slides have also been added to the collection, making a total of 1,030
available for study and for sale.

The total number of sales of reproductions, at cost price, is as
follows: Photographs, 1821; post cards, 15,489; lantern slides, 12.

BUILDING

The workshop has been constantly occupied with the making of
necessary equipment, as well as with the work necessary to the upkeep
of the building. Under the latter the most important item was the
renewal of the attic shade system with new and better operating
parts and a complete set of new curtains. A new device for holding
the smaller paintings to be photographed, four new exhibition cases,
two bookcases, and additional frames for the card display are among
the items of new equipment. The report of the superintendent,
which gives a detailed account of shopwork and of the planting in
the court, accompanies this report as Appendix C (not printed).

ATTENDANCE

The gallery has been open every day from 9 until 4.30 o’clock with
the exceptions of Mondays, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day.

The total attendance for the year was 125,789; the total attendance
for week days was 82,574; the total Sunday attendance 43,215. As
before, the average Sunday attendance is much more than twice that
of week days, 831 being the average for Sunday and 318 that for a
week day. Attendance reached its height in April and August with
totals of 23,401 and 14,950, respectively.

The total number of visitors to the offices was 1,510. Of these,
91 came for general information, 295 to call upon members of the
staff, 119 to see objects in storage, 100 to submit objects for examina-
tion, 74 to study the building and installation methods, 11 to visit
the galleries on Mondays, 216 to study in the library, 203 to see the
reproductions of the Washington Manuscripts, 19 to make photo-
graphs and sketches, and 16 to make tracings, while 229 came to pur-
chase photographs, and 137 to examine photographs of objects in the
collection.

Fifty-two groups, ranging from 2 to 47 persons, were given docent
service in the exhibition galleries, and 10 classes in groups ranging
from three to nine persons were given instruction in the study room.

On Thursday, March 12, 1931, Dr. Rudolf Meyer Riefstahl gave an
illustrated lecture on Islamic Painting before an audience of 163
persons.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY o9

FIELD WORK

A general survey of the gallery’s activities in the Far East will
be found in Mr. Bishop’s confidential letters, copies of which are
transmitted herewith (Appendix B not printed).

As in past years, we have steadfastly adhered to our fundamental
practice of conducting our expedition with due respect both for the
dignity of the Institution and for the sensibilities of the Chinese,
since it is our purpose, as long as we stay in the field, to serve our
own immediate ends only to the extent that in so doing we serve
also the ends of future archeological research in China and help to
establish an atmosphere of greater mutual regard and confidence
between native and foreign scientists. The fact that under existing
conditions, difficult at times to the point of discouragement, we should
have been able to carry out important excavations in southwestern
Shansi during the autumn and spring seasons of last year, speaks
well, I think for our policy, our field staff, and our Chinese collab-
orators. Mr. Bishop’s detailed illustrated report on these excava-
tions is expected shortly.

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1931, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress approved April 19, 1980.
The act referred to contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the Amer-
ican Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation of
archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, includ-
ing necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and illus-
trations, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses, $70,280.

M. W. Stirling, chief, left Washington during the latter part of
January to continue his archeological researches in Florida. On the
way south he took the opportunity to investigate a number of archeo-
logical sites in several of the Southern States, notably a group of
mounds which had been reported in the vicinity of High Point, N. C.,
and two mound sites on Pine Island in the Tennessee River in
northern Alabama.

A few days were spent in the vicinity of Montgomery, Ala., exam-
ining the early historic sites being investigated there by the Alabama
Anthropological Society. A large mound had been reported in the
vicinity of Flomaton, Ala.; this was visited and found to be a natural
formation.

Continuing down the west coast of Florida, Mr. Stirling visited
briefly the archeological sites at Crystal River, Safety Harbor, and
Alligator Creek. 'The principal work for the season was commenced
on February 5 on Blue Hill Island south of Key Marco, one of the
northernmost of the Ten Thousand Island Group. A large sand
burial mound was excavated and found to be of early post-Columbian
Calusa origin. Excavation of the mound disclosed a number of inter-
esting structural features quite unusual in Florida sand mounds.
Six feet above the base of the mound a clay floor was encountered
which gave evidence of having been the base of a temple structure,
as it was surrounded by post holes and in some instances by the
decayed remains of the wooden uprights still in place. This struc-
ture had evidently been destroyed and the mound subsequently
enlarged by adding 6 feet more of sand above the original substruc-
ture. Numerous burials were encountered both above and below the

60
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

clay floor. A few articles of European manufacture were recovered
from the upper level of the mound. As none were recovered from
beneath the temple floor, it is possible that the older section of the
mound is of pre-Columbian age. Cultural material recovered was
interesting though not abundant. This included characteristic pot-
tery specimens, pendants and ornaments made from fossil shark
teeth, shell dishes, cups, celts, and a few stone knives and arrowheads.
Articles of European manufacture consisted of glass beads and iron
axes of Spanish type. More than 250 burials were removed.

Following the completion of this work, Mr. Stirling went to the
island of Haiti where, in the company of H. W. Krieger, of the
United States National Museum, he investigated pecnet ioe cal sites
previously worked by Mr. Krieger in various parts of the island.
Returning from Haiti to Florida, work was continued in the eastern
part of the State, where a number of mounds were investigated be-
tween Miami and Cape Canaveral.

The most interesting discovery of the entire season consisted in
locating two series of large geometric earthworks on the eastern
side of the Everglades, not far from Indiantown. One of these
groups is one of the largest and best preserved works of this type
now existing on the North American continent. It is hoped that at
an early date the bureau will be able to begin excavations on this
most interesting site. At the completion of this reconnaissance, Mr.
Stirling returned to Washington, leaving almost immediately for
Chicago in order to attend a meeting of the National Research Coun-
cil, the purpose of which was to organize research on the subject of
early man in America.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, was engaged in field work in
Louisiana from July 1 to August 14, 1930. It was found that Rosa
Pierrette, the sole Indian acquainted with the Ofo language and
the one from whom, in 1908, he obtained the only specimens of that
language in existence, was dead, and the language therefore is dead
also. A search was made for speakers of Atakapa, but all appeared
to be gone except one old woman who could barely recall a few
words. The Chitimacha Indians of Charenton were visited and a
small amount of linguistic material was obtained from them. Of the
Tunica at Marksville, only two or three are still able to use the old
tongue, but one of these proved to be an ideal informant and Doctor
Swanton obtained from him a number of short stories and one long
story in native text. The rest of the time was spent at Kinder, where
a considerable body of material in Koasati was obtained.

In view of the extinction of Atakapa as a spoken language, Doctor
Swanton considered that the words, phrases, and texts collected by
Dr. A. S. Gatschet in 1886, which comprise by far the greater portion
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

of the material in that tongue still preserved, should be published
without delay and the greater part of the winter of 1930-31 was
spent in editing it. To Gatschet’s material have been added the
Eastern Atakapa words collected by Murray and the Akokisa vocab-
ulary obtained by the French captain, Bérenger, and published by
Du Terrage and Rivet. A bulletin containing all this is now in the
hands of the printer.

Work has progressed on the tribal map of North America which
is being copied by Mrs. E. C. M. Payne, and additions have been
made to the text to accompany it.

Doctor Swanton is preparing the first draft of a Handbook of the
Indians of the Southeast.

The closing weeks of the year were devoted to reading the proof of
Bulletin 103, entitled “Source Material for the Social and Cere-
monial Life of the Choctaw Indians.”

Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was at work among the Kicka-
poo of Oklahoma at the beginning of the fiscal year. A really
representative body of Kickapoo mythology is now available, and
it is quite certain that it is more northern than Fox mythology.
The ritualistic origin myths are still terra incognita. A good begin-
ning has been made on Kickapoo social organization. In the middle
of July Doctor Michelson went among the Foxes of Iowa. The
object of the trip was to restore one I’ox test phonetically and to
obtain some new texts, in the current syllabic script, on Fox cere-
monials, in both of which projects he was successful. Doctor
Michelson returned to Washington August 4. He completed his
memoir on the Fox Wapanowiweni and transmitted it for publica-
tion February 7. His paper, Contributions to Fox Ethnology, II,
Bulletin 95 of the bureau, appeared in the course of the fiscal year.

The remainder of the time was largely taken up studying materials
gathered previously and also in extracting from Petter’s Cheyenne
Dictionary such stems and words as can be rigorously proved to be
Algonquian. The material on the physical anthropology of the
Cheyenne showed clearly the great variation that occurs among liv-
ing races. A proper technique was worked out for determining the
Cheyenne words of Algonquian origin. Though Petter’s alphabet
is Inadequate, it was possible to partially control this material by
comparing it with that of Doctor Michelson. Approximately 700
of such words and stems were extracted. Though the technique
mentioned above is very slow, Doctor Michelson is convinced that it
is the correct procedure. It was entirely feasible to establish about
70 phonetic shifts which have transformed Cheyenne from normal
Algonquian into divergent Algonquian.

Toward the close of May Doctor Michelson left for Oklahoma and
renewed his work with the Cheyenne of that State. He restored
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

phonetically the material extracted from Petter, with the result that
it is now possible to formulate the transforming phonetic shifts with
greater nicety. He also measured a number of Cheyenne. Though
the number is not yet large enough to be absolutely decisive in a
statistical sense, there is good reason to believe that the vault of
their skulls is low, thus resembling the Dakota Sioux rather than
most Algonquian tribes. Some new data on Cheyenne social life
and mythology were obtained. It was his privilege to consult with
some other anthropologists in Oklahoma and to visit one museum.

John P. Harrington, ethnologist, was engaged during the summer
of 1930 in the preparation of his report on the Indians who were
brought together at San Juan Bautista Mission in the first half of
the nineteenth century by the Spanish-speaking padres from various
parts of San Benito County, Calif., and the adjacent region. A vaiu-
able vocabulary of the language, recorded by Father Felipe Arroyo
de la Cuesta, had already been published by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution in the sixties of the last century, but aside from this vocabu-
lary there was little or nothing in print on these Indians. Elaborat-
ing a wealth of material obtained from Mrs. Ascencidén Soldrsano,
the last San Juan Indian who spoke the language, who died in
January, 1930, Mr. Harrington prepared a report on al] phases of
the life of these Indians, as far as reconstructable. This report tells
of the remarkable way in which the language and partial ethnog-
raphy were rescued from this sole survivor, and then proceeds to
the history, geography, and customs of the tribe, including all that
could be learned of former religion, ceremony, and mythology.

Mrs. Solérsano was an Indian herb doctor, and a feature of the
work during the summer of 1929 had been to obtain specimens and
information to cover the ethnobotany of the tribe. Further speci-
mens were obtained in the summer of 1930 by Mrs. Dionisia Mon-
dragon and Miss Marta J. Herrera, daughter and granddaughter of
Mrs. Solérsano, and these were all identified by C. V. Morton, of the
National Herbarium. ‘This section gives the treatment for curing
some 60 different ailments with these herbs and by other curious
means. It forms a nucleus for making comparative studies in
Indian medicine.

At the end of January, 1931, Mr. Harrington left for California
for the purpose of continuing his studies in this region, this time
specializing on the Esselen and Antoniano Indians in the southern
part of Monterey County. Taking the specimens of San Juan
Bautista plants with him and arriving in wild-flower season, a thor-
ough collecting of plants was rewarded with a great mass of in-
formation which further elucidated much of the San Juan plant
material. This collecting was done in several places in southern
Monterey County and simultaneously in San Benito County. Seeds
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

used for food were actually made up into the food product to get
the primitive process, and the same method was followed in the
study of medicines.

Along with the plants the field of ethnozoology was thoroughly
covered and practically all the animals known to these Indians were
identified. Specimens were obtained, especially of birds, which
proved to be the most difficult field for identification in the collect-
ing of animal names, and the skins were identified by the division of
birds of the National Museum. Eight different kinds of snakes were:
known by name and identified.

One of the rarest features of the work was the obtaining of a
number of old Indian place names in the old Esselen country, the
western tributary of the Salinas River known as the Arroyo Seco.
A study of the place names resulted in the discovery that the Esselen
were not a coastal but an inland people, inhabiting the Arroyo Seco
and a section of the Salinas River and centered about Soledad Mis-
sion. They were one of the smallest tribes in California, and the
name properly begins with an h; they were known inthe San Juan
Bautista from all that section of California. The expedition went
from Monterey to the Aguage de Martin and from there climbed the
mountain. Some 40 exposures were made of the various rocks con-
nected with the ceremonies and the springs and camps, and several
hundred pages of notes were taken down in California Spanish
from Don Angel and others dealing with the history of these cere-
monies and the life of Mariana and Joaquin Murrieta. On the way
back to the coast the Cruz Cervantes ranch was visited, where Mur-
rietta and Mariana were equipped by Don Cruz for starting their
war against the Americans.

An examination of place names and village sites and linguistic
studies occupied Mr. Harrington up to the end of June. Not only
were vocabularies of early recording utilized but the invaluable rec-
ords contained in the old mission books were, through the courtesy of
Bishop McGinley, of Fresno, placed at the disposal of the Smith-
sonian Institution for copying, and a considerable part of these
books has already been copied and revised with the aid of the oldest
Indians.

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., archeologist, devoted the fiscal year to a
number of activities. During the months of July, August, and Sep-
tember, excavations at a site on the Zufii reservation, 16 miles north-
east of the Indian village of Zufi, were brought to a conclusion.
The work had been started the latter part of May, 1930. At the
end of the season’s field work the ruins of two houses, one containing
64 rooms, the other 20 rooms, and a number of ceremonial chambers
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

had been cleared of the débris which had accumulated in them in
the centuries which have passed since their abandonment.

Evidence showed that the largest of the houses had not been
erected as a complete unit and that it was not occupied in its en-
tirety at any time. The central block, together with a supercere-
monial chamber placed at its southern side, constituted the original
block of the structure. Subsequent additions consisted of an east-
and-west wing and a series of chambers south of the original portion
and east of the great ceremonial chamber. Masonry in the walls of
the latter portions was inferior to that in the original section. The
outlines of the rooms in these same portions of the building were so
irregular that they appeared to have been built by a different group
of people. The walls in the original section were constructed in a
style characteristic of the ruins in the Chaco Canyon, 85 miles north-
east from the Zuni region. The stonework in the latter portions of
the building was suggestive of the type found in the ruins of the
Upper Gila area to the south.

The small house did not give evidence of growth stages as distinct
as those observed in the large building; it did show, however, that a
fairly small structure had been added to on various oceasions. The
walls in this building were of the same nature as those in the later
portions of the larger dwelling, except that the stones were more
carefully dressed. This suggested that the small house may have
been built by the same group which erected the later portions of the
large one.

In addition to the two houses and seven small ceremonial chambers
two great kivas were found. Only one of these was excavated. In
the case of the other it was possible merely to trace the outer walls
in order to obtain the size and position of the structure. The find-
ing of these two great kivas was significant because investigations in
the Southwest have shown that such structures are always associated
with some form of the Chaco culture. The great kiva connected
with the larger of the two dwellings revealed one of the essential
characteristics of such structures when the débris which filled it was
removed. It had an average diameter of 55 feet. The second of
these large circular houses was completely detached from the other
buildings in the village and had been placed in a court formed by
the other structures. It averaged 78 feet in diameter, which makes
it the largest yet discovered.

The excavations yielded 400 specimens of the people’s handicraft
in addition to the information on house types. Included in the
collection are pottery vessels, tools or implements of stone and bone,
ornaments, and a number of stone images. The pottery is character-
ized by examples typical of the Chaco Canyon wares and also speci-
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

mens characteristic of the Upper Gila region to the south. The
summer’s investigations demonstrate that the village on the Zufi
Reservation belongs to the great period of the prehistoric pueblos,
that designated as Pueblo III in southwestern chronology. The
evidence obtained also indicates that there was a fusion of two groups
of people at this location: One, the first to arrive, came from the
Chaco area in the north, and the other from the Upper Gila villages
in the south. Charred timbers obtained from the ruins enabled Dr.
A. E. Douglass, of the University of Arizona, to give the dates
1000 to 1030 A. D. for the life of the community.

Upon the completion of the above work one week was spent in
making an archeological survey on the Zui reservation and in the
region west and northwest from that district. As a result of the
reconnaissance, a promising site for further investigations was
found. Following this, a trip was made to Cortez, Colo., for the
purpose of inspecting ruins being excavated by Lee Dawson near
the opening into McElmo Canyon, 4 miles southwest from Cortez.
It was found that Mr. Dawson had an unusually interesting group
of unit-type houses on his property. Of particular interest were the
kivas or ceremonial chambers associated with these structures. In
many of them the walls had been ornamented with a series of paint-
ings placed in bands encircling the walls. From Cortez the writer
went to Denver and from there returned to Washington the middle
of October.

During the winter months, galley, page, and final proofs were read
on Bulletin 100, a report on work conducted during the summer of
1929, entitled “'The Ruins of Kiatuthlanna, Eastern Arizona.” In
addition, the specimens brought in from the summer field work were
studied. Drawings and photographs were made of them for use in
a report on the work. Six hundred pages of manuscript, entitled
“The Village of the Great Kivas on the Zuni Reservation, New
Mexico,” was prepared. Thirty text figures were drawn to accom-
pany this manuscript.

Doctor Roberts left Washington May 14, 1931, for Denver, Colo.,
for the purpose of inspecting and studying the specimens obtained
by the Smithsonian Institution-University of Denver Cooperative
Expedition in the summer of 1930 and also for the purpose of
examining collections in the Colorado State Museum. He left Denver
on May 25 for Santa Fe, N. Mex. At the latter place two days were
spent in studying the collections at the Laboratory of Anthropology
and at the Museum of New Mexico. From Santa Fe he proceeded
to Gallup, N. Mex., where supplies were obtained for a field camp.
From Gallup this material was taken to a site 314 miles south of
Allantown, Ariz., where a camp was established and excavations
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

started on the remains of a large pit-house village. One refuse
mound containing 12 burials with accompanying mortuary offer-
ings and two pit houses had been investigated at the close of the
fiscal year.

The pit houses were found to be characteristic of that type and
quite comparable to those excavated in the Chaco Canyon in 1927,
reported in Bulletin 92 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and
to those excavated in eastern Arizona in the summer of 1929,
described in Bulletin 100 of the bureau.

From July 1, 1930, to May 10, 1931, J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist,
was engaged in routine office work, and from the latter date to the
end of the fiscal year he was engaged in field service on the Grant
of the Six Nations on the Grand River in Ontario, Canada, and,
briefly, on the Tuscarora reservation in western New York State.

Mr. Hewitt devoted much time and study to rearranging and
retyping some of his native Iroquoian texts which critical revisions
and additional data had made necessary to facilitate interlinear
translations and to render such texts as legible as possible for the
printer.

The texts so treated are the Cayuga version of the founding of the
League of the Iroquois as dictated by the late Chief Abram Charles;
the version of the Eulogy of the Founders as dictated by Chief Jacob
Hess in Cayuga, and also his versions of the addresses introducing
the several chants; also, four of the myths of the Wind and Vege-
table Gods which are usually represented by wooden faces and husk
faces (which are customarily misnamed masks, although their chief
purpose is to represent, not to mask). The Onondaga texts of these
myths were in great need of careful revision, for their relator was
extremely careless in his use of the persons and the tenses of the
verbs, frequently changing from the third to the second person and
from past to future time by unconsciously employing the language
of the rites peculiar to the faces; and also the decipherment of a set
of pictographs or mnemonic figures, designed and employed by the
late Chief Abram Charles, of the Grand River Reservation in
Canada, to recall to his mind the official names and their order of
the 49 federal chiefs of the Council of the League of the Iroquois,
in chanting the Eulogy of the Founders of the League; and also to
recall the 15 sections or burdens of the great Requickening Address
of the Council of Condolence and Installation; this paper with illus-
trations is nearly ready for the printer; and also a critical study of
the matter of the Onondaga and the Cayuga texts, giving the several
variant versions of the events attending the birth and childhood and
work of Deganawida. He was born of a virgin mother, which indi-
cated that underlying them there appeared to be an ideal figure,

102992—32——_6
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

although of course unexpressed. ‘This discovery showed the need for
thorough search in the field for a living tradition in which this ideal
is fully expressed. Further search was deferred to field work. It
was clear that such an ideal enhanced the beauty of the birth story
of Deganawida and made more interesting the historicity of such a
person. Mr. Hewitt had the great satisfaction of recovering such a
tradition in his subsequent field researches. He found that the in-
feriority complex had precluded his present informants from ex-
pressing themselves during the lifetime of other informants, whose
recent deaths opened their mouths without the fear of contradic-
tion. The death of Abram Charles within the year made these shy
informants vocal.

In January Matthew W. Stirling, chief of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, requested Mr. Hewitt to undertake the editing of the
Manuscript Journal of Rudolph Friederich Kurz, of Berne, Switzer-
land, in the manner in which he had prepared the Edwin Thompson
Denig Report on the Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri River,
published in the Forty-sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology. The Kurz manuscript was written in German dur-
ing the years 1846 to 1852. The typed German text consists of 454
pages of large legal cap size, while the English translation of it by
Myrtis Jarrell occupies 780 pages. The journal is a narrative of
Mr. Kurz’s experiences in a trip up the Mississippi River from New
Orleans to St. Louis, thence up the Missouri to Fort Union at the
Mouth of the Yellowstone River, and of his difficulties with the
Indians while endeavoring to make drawings or pictures of them.
There are 125 pen sketches of Indians and others accompanying the
manuscript.

Mr. Hewitt represents the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smith-
sonian Institution, on the United States Geographic Board, and
is a member of its executive committee. In connection with the
forthcoming issue of the sixth report of this board much extra work
had to be done by members of the executive committee. Mr. Hewitt
prepared a memorandum for a portion of the introduction. Mr.
Hewitt also devoted much time and study to the collection and
preparation of data for official replies to correspondents of the
bureau, some demanding long research. Miss Mae W. Tucker has
assisted Mr. Hewitt in the care of the manuscript and phonograph
and photograph records of the archives.

On May 10, 1931, Mr. Hewitt left Washington, D. C., on field
duty and returned to the bureau July 2, 1931. During this trip he
visited the Grand River grant of the Six Nations of Iroquois Indians
dwelling near Brantford, Canada, and also the Tuscarora Reserva-
tion near Niagara Falls, N. Y.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

Winslow M. Walker was appointed to the staff of the Bureau of
American Ethnology as associate anthropologist in March, 1931. He
resumed his research in Hawaiian archeology, begun during a year’s
stay in the Hawauan Islands in 1929, in preparation for a paper on
Hawaiian sculpture.

In preparation for work in the field Mr. Walker undertook re-
search in the early narratives of exploration in Louisiana and Arkan-
sas. He left Washington May 29 to investigate some caves in the
vicinity of Gilbert, Ark., in the Ozark Mountains, with the hope of
being able to throw new light on the Ozark bluff dwellers and other
early inhabitants of the caves. Sixteen caves were explored and
excavations were made in several of the most promising. A large
cave at Cedar Grove yielded several skeletons and a considerable
number of stone, flint, and bone artifacts. As the fiscal year closed
Mr. Walker was still engaged in excavating this cavern. He intends
to make a brief survey of certain mounds and village sites along the
Red River Valley in the northern part of Louisiana on the com-
pletion of his work in Arkansas.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

The study of Indian music for the Bureau of American Ethnology
has been carried forward during the past year by Miss Frances Dens-
more. The three phases of this research are (1) the recording of
songs and collecting of other material in the field, including the pur-
chase of specimens; (2) the transcription and analysis of songs, with
the development of information; and (3) the preparation of material
for publication. All these phases have received attention during
the year, and the songs of three hitherto unstudied localities have
been recorded.

Early in July, 1930, Miss Densmore went to Grand Portage, an
isolated Chippewa village on Lake Superior, near the Canadian
boundary. This village was visited in 1905, a ceremony was wit-
nessed, and one of its songs written down; therefore a return to
Grand Portage was particularly interesting. The purpose of the
trip was to witness the Chippewa dances on the Fourth of July, but
she remained more than three weeks, continuing her study of native
customs. Several songs of the wabunowin were heard and translated,
these resembling the songs of the Grand Medicine, which formed a
subject of intensive study during 1907-1911. She also witnessed the
tipi-shaking of an Indian medicine man and listened to his songs
for almost an hour. This performance is very rare at the present
time. Although the evening was quiet, the tipi was seen to sway as
though buffeted by a tempest, then remain motionless a few seconds
and again shake convulsively. This was continuous while Miss
Densmore watched the performance and was said to have continued
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

several hours afterwards. Inside the tipi sat the medicine man,
believed to be talking with spirits whom he had summoned, the
spirits making known their presence by the shaking of the conical
structure. The next day the medicine man said that he had sum-
moned the spirits in order to ascertain whether his treatment of a
certain sick man would be successful. He said that if the spirits
“spoke loud and clear” the man would recover, but if their voices
were faint the man would die. The response was said to have been
satisfactory, and accordingly he instituted a “beneficial dance,”
which was attended by Miss Densmore, and the songs heard for a
considerable time. These, like the songs in the tipi, resembled the
songs of the Chippewa Grand Medicine Society.

The study of Indian music was continued by a trip to Kilbourn,
Wis., during August and September. Two pageants are given simul-
taneously at The Dalles of the Wisconsin River, near Kilbourn, each
employing about 100 Indians. In the pageants the swan and hoop
dance, as well as war and social dances of the Winnebago, were seen.
The dances of other tribes presented in the pageants included the
eagle dance and other pueblo dances. Songs of the swan, hoop, and
frog dances were later recorded by leading pageant singers.

At Kilbourn Miss Densmore recorded numerous songs of Pueblo
Indians from Isleta and Cochiti, these consisting chiefly of corn-
grinding and war songs. The words of these songs are highly poetic
and many of the melodies resemble Acoma songs in structure.

As John Bearskin and his family were traveling from Kilbourn to
their home in Nebraska they passed through Red Wing, Minn., and
songs were recorded at Miss Densmore’s home. Bearskin recorded
three complete sets of the Winnebago medicine lodge songs and a set
of Buffalo feast songs.

In January, 1931, Miss Densmore went to Washington, where she
worked on the preparation of material for publication, and proceeded
thence to Miami, Fla., where she began a study of Seminole music,
recording songs of the corn dance from the man who leads the
singing in that ceremony; also the songs that precede a hunting
expedition. The customs of the Seminole were studied and a collec-
tion of specimens was obtained. This collection includes two com-
plete costumes and is now the property of the United States National
Museum.

The second phase of the research is represented by eight manu-
scripts which include the transcriptions and analyses of 77 songs and
two flute melodies recorded by Winnebago, Isleta, Cochiti, and Sem-
inole Indians. The cumulative analyses of Indian songs has been
continued and now comprises 1,553 songs. The 14 tables submitted
during this year constitute a comparison between a large series of
Nootka and Quileute songs and the songs previously analyzed by
the same method,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Fi |

The third phase of work comprised the preparation for publica-
tion of “* Menominee Music” and “Acoma Music.”

Frank M. Setzler, assistant curator, division of archeology, United
States National Museum, was detailed to the bureau for the purpose
of conducting an archeological investigation in Texas. After briefly
examining several sites at Victoria and Brownsville along the Gulf
coast, he excavated four caves and one rock shelter on the Mollie B.
Knight ranch, in Presidio County, and visited several other caverns
in the vicinity.

From one large cave a total of 70 specimens, including baskets,
matting, cradles, sandals, beads, corn, gourd shards, and one skele-
ton, were recovered. No pottery or evidence of European influence
was found. Although the site is only 150 miles east of a marginal
Basket Maker culture, no local trace was found of these early south-
western people. The material differs in some respects from any other
in the Museum and more research will be required before it can be
definitely identified.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editing of the publications of the bureau was continued
through the year by Stanley Searles, editor, assisted by Mrs. Frances
S. Nichols, editorial assistant. The status of the publications is
presented in the following summary:

DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLICATIONS

The distribution of the publications of the bureau has been con-
tinued under the charge of Miss Helen Munroe, assisted by Miss
Emma B. Powers. Publications distributed were as follows:

As compared with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1980, there was
a decrease of 4,398. This decrease is mainly in the distribution of
bulletins and separates, and possibly is largely explained by the very
large number of separates from the handbook which were sent in the
previous year to the many groups of Camp Fire Girls. No great
demand from any one group was received in this past fiscal year.

Twenty-eight addresses were added to the mailing list during the
year and 20 were taken off. The mailing list now stands at 1,635, in
addition to the members of the staff of the bureau and other branches
of the Institution who receive the publications regularly as issued.

During the early part of the calendar year Miss Mae W. Tucker
was detailed to this branch to assist in listing and cataloguing the
great collection of Indian negatives already classified by Mr. Gill
in previous years. Of the purely ethnologic subjects, including por-
traits, arts, and industries, the lst will embrace more than 7,000
units. This work, so long delayed, has progressed most satisfactorily.

LIBRARY

The reference library has continued under the care of Miss Ella
Leary, librarian, assisted by Thomas Blackwell.

During the year 600 volumes were accessioned, of which 97 were
acquired by purchase, 100 by binding of periodicals, and 4023 by gift
and exchange; also 190 pamphlets and 3,500 serials, chiefly the pub-
lications of learned societies, were received and recorded, of which
28 were obtained by purchase, the remainder being received through
exchange, giving us at the close of the year a working library of
26,671 volumes, 16,717 pamphlets, and several thousand unbound
periodicals. Books loaned during the year numbered 975 volumes.
During the year 473 volumes were bound. In addition to the use of
its own library, which is becoming more valuable through exchange
and by limited purchase, it was found necessary to draw on the
Library of Congress for the loan of about 250 volumes, and in turn
the bureau hbrary was frequently consulted by officers of other
Government establishments, as well as by students not connected
with the Smithsonian Institution. The purchase of books and peri-
odicals has been restricted to such as relate to the bureau’s researches.
During the year the cataloguing has been carried on as new acces-
sions were acquired and good progress was made in cataloguing
ethnologic and related articles in the earlier serials. The catalogue
was increased by the addition of 3,500 cards. A considerable amount
of reference work was done in the usual course of the library’s
service to investigators and students, both in the Smithsonian
Institution and outside.

MISCELLANEOUS

The correspondence and other clerical work of the office has been
conducted by Miss May S. Clark, clerk to the chief, assisted by
Anthony W. Wilding, clerk. Miss Mae W. Tucker, stenographer,
was engaged in copying manuscript material for Doctor Swanton
and in assisting Mr. Hewitt in his work as custodian of manuscripts
and phonograph records. The manuscript Dictionary of * * *
Indian Languages of North, Central, and South America and the
West Indies, compiled by W. R. Gerard, which was in danger of
becoming illegible due to the frayed condition of the paper on which
it was written and the faded writing, has been copied by Miss Tucker.
Work was begun on the catalogue of the photographic negatives
belonging to the bureau. To date approximately 7,000 negatives
have been listed.

During the course of the year information was furnished by
members of the staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the
North American Indians, both past and present, and the Mexican
peoples of the prehistoric and early historic periods to the south.
Various specimens sent to the bureau were identified and data on
them furnished for their owners.

Personnel—Winslow M. Walker was appointed: as associate
anthropologist on the staff of the bureau on March 6, 1931, and Dr.
William D. Strong as ethnologist on July 1, 1931.

APPENDIX 5

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ending June 380, 1931:

The appropriation granted by Congress for the support of the
system of international exchanges during the year was $52,810, an
increase of $1,513 over the amount allowed for the preceding year.
Of this increase, $1,000 was for freight, $160 to cover the additional
sum required to meet the provisions of the Brookhart Act amending
section 13 of the classification act of 1928, and $353 to advance to
the next step in their respective grades those of the employees of
the exchange office eligible for promotion. ‘The repayments from
departmental and other establishments aggregated $5,000.57, making
the total available resources for conducting the service during 1931
$57,810.57.

The total number of packages handled was 641,838, a decrease
from the previous year of 53,327 (7.7 per cent). The weight of
these packages was 642,190 pounds, a falling off of 65,904 pounds
(9.3 per cent). These decreases no doubt were due to the world-wide
depression. However, the economic condition affected the output of
literature more abroad than in the United States, as will be noted
when it is stated that the number of packages sent through the Inter-
national Exchange Service decreased only 6 per cent, while those
received from abroad decreased nearly 22 per cent.

The publications passing through the service are classified as par-
liamentary documents, departmental documents, and miscellaneous
scientific and literary publications. The number and weight of the
packages containing the publications coming under these different
headings are as follows:

During the year 3,002 boxes were shipped abroad, a decrease from
the number for the preceding 12 months of 233, a little over 7 per
cent. Of the total number of boxes, 692 contained full sets of United
States official documents for authorized depositories abroad, and the
remainder (2,310) were filled with publications for miscellaneous

As explained in previous reports, in addition to the packages for-
warded abroad in boxes for distribution by foreign exchange bureaus,
many are transmitted direct to their destinations by mail—some be-
cause it is more economical to send by mail than by freight; some,
like the daily issue of the Congressional Record, fpaasihce treaty
stipulations provide that they shall be so fOr parted and some for
the reason that they are for places remote from existing exchange
agencies. The total number of packages transmitted by mail during
the year was 76,609, an increase over last year of 8,664.

Last year mention was made that nine boxes of exchanges from
Germany were destroyed at the steamship pier in New York through
the burning and sinking of the vessel on board of which the boxes
were being transmitted to this country. I regret to report that during
the current fiscal year eight boxes for China met a similar fate at
the pier in New York, the steamship President Harrison, on board
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Li

of which the consignment had been placed for transmission to China,
having been destroyed by fire and water.

As usual, assistance was rendered during the year to the Library
of Congress in procuring for its division of documents copies of
various foreign governmental publications missing in its collections.
Aid also was given to a number of establishments, both here and
abroad, in obtaining specialty desired publications. For this service,
as well as for the help in the distribution of exchanges, letters of
appreciation are often received by the Institution from its corre-
spondents.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

There are now forwarded to foreign depositories of United States
official documents 112 sets—62 full and 50 partial—an increase of
three over the number transmitted last year. Afghanistan, Bengal,
and the Vatican Library were added to the list of those countries
receiving partial sets. Greece, to which the shipment of a full set
was temporarily suspended, has been listed to receive a partial set.
The partial set sent to Alsace-Lorraine has been discontinued.

The address to which the partial set for Guatemala was forwarded
has been changed from the Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores to the
Bibhoteca Nacional. The depository in Poland to which a full set
of Government documents is forwarded has been changed by the
Polish Government from the Library of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to the National Library in Warsaw.

A complete list of the depositories is given below:

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending
June 380, 1931:

The regular appropriation made by Congress for the maintenance
of the park was $220,520, an increase of $17,520 over 1930. In order
that plans and specifications might be prepared for a small mammal
house before the convening of the next Congress, $4,500 was appro-
priated and made immediately available for this purpose. In addition
an appropriation of $16,000 was provided in the second deficiency act
for new boilers and conduits. The regular appropriation act also
reappropriated $9,703 remaining unexpended under the bird-house
appropriation of 1928 for grading and the construction of cages
adjacent to the bird house. In the 1932 appropriation act $4,500 was
also made available immediately upon approval of that act to provide
for care of the Evans collection. Thus a total of $255,223 was avail-
able during the fiscal year. The regular appropriation, together with
the additions, has made it possible to carry out some greatly needed
repairs and improvements, and the work of the park has progressed
in a very satisfactory manner.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts——The outstanding gift of the year was the Victor J. Evans
collection of 133 species and 244 individuals, which was bequeathed to
the United States Government for the National Zoological Park by
the late Victor J. Evans.

Mr. Evans for years had been deeply interested in animal life and
had formed an unusually fine collection of rarities in his private zoo.
These are listed among the donations and include two specimens of
the white-crowned guenon (Cercopithecus petronellac), an exceed-
ingly rare little monkey, regarding which practically nothing is
known.

Mr. Evans had previously donated many rare species to the Zoo,
among them the glacier bear, almost unique in captivity.

The reptile house created a great deal of interest throughout
America, and a steady stream of gifts for the exhibition has been
coming in ever since the house has been open.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 87

Foster H. Benjamin, engaged in field work in Florida for the
United States Department of Agriculture, has sent in many fine
specimens; and we have profited very much through the field trips
of Dr. Charles E. Burt, of Waxahachie, Tex., who has sent us the
specimens picked up that he thought would be interesting to the
Park. Dewey Moore, of Indio, Calif., has been on the alert and has
sent a number of valuable specimens that we could not otherwise have
obtained.

William K. Ryan, of Washington, D. C., a fancier of rare birds,
has presented several especially desirable species.

The San Diego Zoo, of San Diego, Calif., contributed a collection
of some of the California species of reptiles that are difficult to
obtain.

In the late fall the director, on his vacation, visited Central
America, and while at Tela, Honduras, he was presented such
species as seemed desirable from the famous Tela Serpentarium.
R. E. Stadelman, in charge of the laboratory, accompanied him on
field collecting trips. The United Fruit Co. greatly facilitated the
work, and thanks are due to R. K. Thomas and Dr. R. P. MacPhail
for kindly hospitality and much aid. Incidentally the director col-
lected various small species and through the aid of the honorable
Secretary of Agriculture of Cuba and the chief of the Oficina Sani-
dad Vegetal, Ernesto Sanchez Estrada, was enabled to bring home
a flock of 20 Cuban flamingoes. The entire collection obtained on this
trip was transported by the United Fruit Co. free of charge to New
York, and every possible facility for the proper care of the specimens
was afforded. This was most valuable assistance, which enabled
the successful landing of specimens that might not otherwise have
been procurable.

The United States Biological Survey of the Department of Agri-
culture and numerous members of its staff have contributed speci-
mens to the Zoo and have assisted in making arrangements for other
parties to supply us with specimens.

Dr. Alexander Wetmore and Frederick C. Lincoln on a trip to
Haiti obtained and presented several specimens of two species of
lizards not seen before in captivity.

An outstanding gift was that of three beautiful specimens of
Kodiak bear cubs collected and presented by Senator Frederick
Hale, of Maine. He caught these and brought them personally to
Washington, where they are now thriving. As the National Zoologi-
cal Park endeavors to maintain an especially good collection of
Alaskan bears these cubs are a highly appreciated addition.

Practically all the plants placed in the reptile house as setting for
animals were gifts from various branches of the United States Gov-
ernment and private individuals. ‘The larger contributors were:

Bureau of Plant Industry of the Department of Agriculture, the
Office of Public Buildings and Public Parks, the United States
Botanic Garden, Walter Reed Hospital, and San Diego Zoo.

ENDOWMENTS

The first endowments ever received by the Zoo were two given
during the fiscal year 1931. The Frances Brincklé Zerbee Memorial
Fund of $1,000 was given to the Smithsonian Institution by Maj.
Leigh Zerbee, her husband, for the use of the National Zoological
Park to maintain stock in aquariums. Mrs. Zerbee was particularly
interested in fishes and other small aquatic forms and it was in recog-
nition of her keen interest in such matters that Major Zerbee estab-
lished this memorial fund. A bronze tablet has been placed in the
reptile house over the aquaria in which this stock is to be maintained.

William S. Barstow of Great Neck, Long Island, presented $1,000
as an endowment in the name of his son, Frederic D. Barstow.
This money has been invested and the income from it will be
used to keep a cage in the zoo stocked with some interesting small
mammal. Frederic D. Barstow, who died soon after this fund
was established, was a keen enthusiast regarding birds and mammals
and had made several trips to the Tropics for the purpose of
collecting them.

The only previous contribution to the Zoo at all similar in charac-
ter was the construction of the Beatrice Henderson cage for birds.
This cage was built during the summer of 1912 by the late John B.
Henderson, jr. It is about 24 by 40 by 26 feet, situated near the
great flight cage, and now houses cockatoos of various kinds.

Many species of reptiles deposited eggs since being moved into
their new quarters in the reptile house, and a few hatched after
June 80, but there were no natural increases in the stock during the
year.

Early Easter morning an African python laid about two dozen
eggs and incubated them for a period of two months. Unfortunately,
however, they proved to be infertile. This was of considerable
scientific as well as popular interest.

Purchases and exchanges.—The principal purchases this year have
been a male black African rhinoceros, a specimen of the rare babi-
russa, a pair of raccoon dogs, a Bornean gray gibbon, a Siamang
gibbon, and a white-handed gibbon. The last three were purchased
under the Walter P. Chrysler fund. At the time these animals were
acquired the Zoo had a pair of white-cheeked gibbons and their
young, which gave us a total of 4 species of gibbons on exhibition at
one time,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 95

The rhinoceros has apparently adapted himself to our conditions
and has made a splendid growth.

A quantity of reptiles were purchased for the opening of the new
building. Chief among these is a magnificent king cobra, measuring
14 feet 6 inches in length. This was secured six months before we
had quarters for it, but Dr. Raymond L. Ditmars, of the New York
Zoological Park, very kindly took care of it during this time and
then brought it down personally.

A number of small exchanges have been made, but the most inter-
esting was that of a polar bear which was received from the Zoologi-
cal Park of Edinburgh. This is a male which has been placed with
Marian, a young female of the same species.

REMOVALS

Causes of death—When it has been thought that determination of
the cause of death of certain animals might be useful, the specimens
have been submitted to the pathological division of the Bureau of
Animal Industry for examination. The following list shows the
results of the autopsies:

MAMMALS

Artiodactyla: Obstruction in the oesophagus, 1; odema of the heart and peri-
eardium, 1; chronic pneumonia, 1; liver spotted with tubercules, indications
of tuberculosis, 1.

Carnivora: Gastro-enteritis, 1; multiple body abscesses, 1; enteritis, 1.

Primates: Gastritis and ulcerated pyloric knob, 1.

BIRDS
Ciconiiformes: Enteritis, 1.
Pelecaniformes: Internal hemorrhage, 1.
Psittaciformes: Tuberculosis, 1.

VISITORS

The great number of visitors who have been coming to the park
since the opening of the reptile house has prevented such a decline
in the year’s attendance as exists in other institutions of public
interest because of the economic depression which has so reduced
travel. The estimated attendance as recorded in the daily reports
of the park is as follows:

Observations of the numbers of automobiles from distant States
and countries has led to the taking of a census each day of the cars
actually parked in the park at one time, from which the following

IMPROVEMENTS

The most interesting event of recent years has been the opening of
the public exhibition building for reptiles, amphibians, insects, and
miscellaneous invertebrates. The construction of this building was
started in March, 1930, and the exhibition was formally opened the
evening of February 27, 1931. Some 3,000 people attended the re-
ception, and the following day the building was crowded from morn-
ing to night. The formal opening was attended by a large number
of officials of the United States Government and officials of other
zoos who were particularly interested in the building. Among the
latter were Dr. W. Reid Blair, director of the New York Zoological
Park; C. Emerson Brown, director of the Philadelphia Zoological
Garden; George P. Vierheller, director of the St. Louis Zoological
Garden; Dan Harkins, director of Franklin Park Zoo, Boston; and
Dr. Raymond L. Ditmars, curator of reptiles, New York Zoological
Park.

Since its opening it has been by far the most popular and crowded
building in the entire Zoo. Natural habitat for the reptiles has
been provided as far as possible. There is a special ventilating sys-

tem for the public and a special heating system for the reptiles.
Light is all from above so that the visibility is far superior to any-
thing we have ever had before. This building, containing over a
hundred cages, fills a long felt need in the Zoo.

With a view to helping house the Victor J. Evans collection, Con-
gress added $4,500 to the appropriation, and with this money we
have built a series of large mammal paddocks with sheds, runs for
cranes, and large outdoor cages for pheasants.

Out of money unexpended from a previous year and reappropri-
ated for this fiscal year is being built a flight cage for the eagles, to
replace the one that had to be torn down to clear the site for the
reptile house. Other cages will be constructed near by, so that all
of the birds will be grouped in the general vicinity of the bird house.

Contracts have been let for new boilers at the central heating
plant, to replace two secondhand ones that had been installed 29
years ago. The main steam line from the central heating plant to the
buildings began to give way during the early fall, and certain of the
steam lines supplying individual buildings began to develop leaks,
which indicated that they could no longer be successfully repaired.
This matter was presented to Congress, with the result that sufficient
money was provided to renew the lines that showed most imminent
danger of giving out. The new pipes are planned to be a portion of
an extensive central conduit system when finally completed.

A quantity of earth from near-by excavations was made available
to the park without cost, and, by carefully planning the dumping
of this, three considerable level areas were developed on which we
are now able to place outside paddocks, runs, and cages.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

Since completion of the reptile house, the next building on our
program, the small mammal and great ape house, becomes the one
most urgently needed at the present time. We have no suitable quar-
ters at all for these groups of animals, both of which are represented
in the collection by continually increasing numbers of interesting
species. Plans and specifications for this building are now being
prepared under the appropriation of $4,500 made available by the
last Congress for this purpose.

Following this, the next exhibition building needed is one for
the pachyderms. A room to complete the bird house is also needed.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1931:

PLANT AND OBJECTS

This observatory operates regularly the central station at Wash-
ington and two field stations for observing solar radiation on Table
Mountain, Calif., and Mount Montezuma, Chile. The station at
Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa, which was established by the
National Geographic Society, is being continued for the present in
cooperation with the Astrophysical Observatory with funds donated
by a friend of the Institution. In addition the cbservatory controls
a station on Mount Wilson, Calif., where occasicnal expeditions are
sent for special investigations.

The principal aim of the observatory is the exact measurement of
the intensity of the radiation of the sun as it is at mean solar clistance
outside the earth’s atmosphere. This is ordinarily called the solar
constant of radiation, but the observations of past years by this ob-
servatory have proved it variable. As all life, as well as the weather,
depends on solar radiation, the observatory has undertaken the con-
tinued measurement of solar variation on all available days. These
measurements have now continued all the year round for 12 years.
As will appear in this report, recent studies indicate that the perma-
nent continuation of these daily solar-radiation measurements may
have great value for weather forecasting. In addition to this prin-
cipal object the observatory undertakes spectroscopic researches on
radiation and absorption of atmospheric constituents, radiation of
special substances, such as water vapor, ozone, carbonic-acid gas,
liquid water, and others, and the radiation of the other stars as well
as of the sun.

WORK AT WASHINGTON

Funds having been appropriated by the Congress to print Volume
V of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, the year was spent
principally in preparing text, tables, and illustrations expressing the
results of observations made since August, 1920, at the several

stations.
ily,
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

As stated in previous reports, much effort had already been ex-
pended in reducing the observations made at Table Mountain, Calif.,
but without satisfactory results. The atmosphere above Table Moun-
tain, though to the eye appearing very fine and clear, contains va-
riable amounts of ozone, water vapor, and dust, which produce
embarrassing difficulties in computing the solar constant of radiation.
Daily measurements of the amount of atmospheric ozone by the
method of Dobson had been in progress at Table Mountain, since
August, 1928, but they require fully as much time for reduction as
does the solar constant itself. Fortunately, as described in last year’s
report, we were able to devise a simple method based on our bolo-
graphic work whereby corrections can be made easily for the absorp-
tion of ozone on all days when solar-constant measures are made at
Table Mountain. All the Table Mountain solar-constant values from
the beginning there in 1925 have now been corrected for ozone
absorption.

The changes of haziness and of absorption associated with varia-
tions of atmospheric water vapor make a difficulty of a more serious
nature. After several unsuccessful attempts to vary the Montezuma
procedure to suit Table Mountain conditions, the process of reduction
of the short-method solar-constant determinations at Table Moun-
tain was radically changed. It will be recalled that the essence of
the short method consists in employing pyranometer measurements
of the brightness of the sky near the sun as an index of the prevailing
atmospheric transparency.

If the brightness of the sky were unaffected by varying quantities
of smoke or dust, we should expect the normal change of its bright-
ness from day to day to be exactly determined by the quantity of
atmospheric water vapor prevailing. In other words, there would be
a normal relation between pyranometry, precipitable atmospheric
water vapor, and atmospheric transparency, for the different wave
lengths. But if unusual degrees of dustiness or smokiness prevail,
then the pyranometer will record a positive or negative excess from
the normal value proper to the prevailing quantity of precipitable
water. This “ excess” will be associated with changes in the atmos-
pheric transmission coefficients for all wave lengths.

On these lines we have worked out new varieties of the short
method of determining the solar constant of radiation applicable to
conditions at Table Mountain and Mount Brukkaros. We have re-
reduced all the observations made at these stations according to these
new methods. Great improvement in their solar-constant deter-
minations resulted, although it must be confessed that neither of
these two stations yields results as generally satisfactory as does
Montezuma.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119

COMPARISON OF RESULTS

With the completion of the reduction of all the solar-constant
observations from the three field stations results of much interest are
found by comparing them. Figure 1 shows the monthly mean solar-
constant values derived from ‘Table Mountain, Montezuma, anc
Mount Brukkaros since 1926. The probable error of the weighted
mean curve shown as a heavy line in Figure 1 is less than 0.1 per cent.
In short, it is adequately accurate to show all that needs be known
of the general march of solar variation.

Figure 2 shows the preferred monthly mean solar-constant values
from 1920 to 1930, inclusive. The extreme range of it is 2.8 per cent.
Although apparently so irregular, Figure 3 shows that the march of
solar variation may be expressed with surprising fidelity as the sum
of five regular periodicities, of 68, 45, 25, 11, and 8 months’ intervals.
It is interesting to note that, though derived with no regard to it,
all of these intervals turn out to be nearly related to the 1114-year
sun-spot period. ‘Thus 68 months is its half, 45 months its third,
and so on. Other periods are found which are not so long-lived as
these. Thus, curve H in Figure 3 shows periods of 45 and 5.6 days,
respectively, which lasted throughout the year 1924. The excellent
representation of the original curve A by the sum of the five peri-
odicities, as shown at B, encourages me to give in curve I the
expected march of solar variation in 1931 and 1982.

Vigure 4 gives the results of an attempt to represent the tempera-
tures of Washington, D. C., and Williston, N. Dak., as made up of
periodicities having these same five intervals, 68, 45, 25, 11, and 8
months. It proved necessary to add a period of 18 months in each
case. The original temperature curves A and C are found by taking
consecutive means of 5-month departures from normal. Thus, 1/5
(Jan.t+Feb.+Mar.+Apr.+May): 1/5 (Feb.+Mar.t+Apr.+May+
June), and so on. This eliminates the shorter irregularities and
brings out prominently the principal departures from normal tem-
perature that have occurred since 1918.

Curves B and D are 5-month consecutive means of curves repre-
senting the observed march of temperature as the sum of the six
periodicities above described. I do not insist that this method of
treatment gives certainty as yet, but I look forward for five more
years to 1986, when it can be subjected to a more rigorous test. ‘Time
will show whether or not it is the germ of the method of forecasting
weather for future years, to which Langley looked forward when he
founded the Astrophysical Observatory.

The comparison of stations shows that the daily solar-constant
values are not as accurate as are needed. Montezuma results are by
far the best. Yet they lack many days of completeness and many

days represented are unsatisfactory. It is indeed almost beyond the
limit of possible accuracy to observe the solar constant day after day
with such exactness that the differences between the absolute values
shall always evaluate changes correctly if reaching one-third of 1 per
cent or more. This is what is needed. We have in mind a few
improvements which may bring us to this degree of accuracy at
Montezuma, but unless other stations superior to Table Mountain
and Brukkaros are found it seems doubtful if fully satisfactory
daily values are obtainable to supplement the Montezuma record.

Further studies made during the year tend to confirm the impres-
sion stated in last year’s report that temperatures and barometric
pressures in the United States respond by opposite trends to positive
and negative sequences of change in daily solar-radiation values. As
yet, however, the evidence is not fully satisfactory owing to the
imperfection of the daily record of solar changes, as just explained.

To promote statistical studies along these lines, a new instrument
designed to discover and evaluate periodicities in solar and weather
records has been designed. Its construction was aided by a grant of

ai
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 123

$1,000 from the Research Corporation of New York. At the close of
the fiscal year the instrument was almost ready for use, having been
constructed by A. Kramer at the instrument shop of the Observatory.

FIELD STATIONS

In cooperation with Doctor Wulf, of the Fixed Nitrogen Research
Laboratory, of the Department of Agriculture, an investigation has
been carried through at Table Mountain, Calif., on the absorption of
well-determined quantities of ozone in the visible spectrum. In this
research, ozone-laden air contained in special absorption cells was
interposed before the slit of the spectrobolometer which records the
energy of the solar spectrum. A new, independent method of de-
termining the atmospheric ozone content was worked out and ap-
plied. Its results agree nearly with those determined by the method
of Dobson.

The daily observation of the solar constant of radiation has been
carried on regularly at the three field stations: Table Mountain,
Calif.; Montezuma, Chile; and Mount Brukkaros, Southwest Africa.
The latter station has been supported by grants from John A.
Roebling. Impressed by the probability of useful weather applica-
tions, Mr. Roebling has made a further grant to finance an expedi-
tion of a year’s duration in Africa and outlying regions to endeavor
to find a site equal to Montezuma, Chile, for solar-radiation work.
Accompanied by Mrs. Moore, A. F. Moore, who has had long experi-
ence at our mountain observatories, occupied Fogo Island peak in
the Cape Verde Islands for several weeks, and is now in Southwest
Africa testing various high mountain sites in comparison with Mount
Brukkaros,

A fire caused by a kerosene heater destroyed the computing room
at Montezuma station, with mathematical tables and instruments used
in the reductions. The observations suffered a few days of delay
before new tables could be sent, but no days were lost to the perma-
nent record of the station.

PERSON NEL

At Washington the personnel is unchanged since the last report,
except that Oliver Grant served as additional computer throughout
the year in the preparation of Volume V of the Annals. Also George
Cox served from November, 1930, on the reduction of ozone observa-
tions and other computing. Both young men were compensated from
the Roebling funds.

C. P. Butler, formerly assistant at Montezuma, was placed in
charge of that station on January 11, 1931, vice H. H. Zodtner, trans-
ferred to Table Mountain to carry on there during the absence of
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

A. F. Moore. Walter Watson, jr., reported for duty as assistant at
Montezuma February 1, 1931.

SUMMARY

The principal work accomplished has been the development of
new methods and the complete reduction of all solar-constant obser-
vations made at the field stations since 1920. The results with
accompanying text and illustrations have been collected and sent to
press as Volume V of the Annals of the Observatory. Comparison
of values shows that the variation of the sun indicated by monthly
mean values since 1920 is determined with sufficient accuracy for
all purposes. The probable error of monthly means is less than 0.1
per cent. Solar changes found since 1920 range to 2.8 per cent.
Daily observations are less satisfactory than monthly means, but
improvements are proposed. An expedition is in Southwest Africa
endeavoring to discover a site for a solar radiation observatory equal
to Montezuma, Chile. A new instrument for the periodic analysis
of solar and weather data is nearly completed.

On the whole the outcome of 10 years of intensive study of solar
radiation, as brought together in the text of Volume V of the Annals
of the Observatory now in press, is very interesting. It encourages
great hope that the causes of weather may be traced in solar variation
to such a degree as to enable the skilled meteorologist to forecast
principal changes of weather far in advance.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 8

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND
ORGANISMS

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during its second
year ending June 30, 1931.

RESEARCH IN PROGRESS

Building around the central idea of a laboratory combining experi-
mental work in biophysics with fundamental experimentation in
physics and chemistry, researches have been carried forward in both
these fields. The phototropic experiments upon oat coleoptiles
previously reported have been carried further with considerable
refinement of technique. The carbon dioxide assimilation of wheat
has been studied as a function of intensity in artificial light. Pre-
liminary experiments with algae have been initiated with a view to
determining carbon dioxide assimilation as a function of wave length
and intensity, growth rate as a function of wave length and inten-
sity, and death point as a function of wave length, and time-intensity
dosage. The propagating chamber which was developed by the
division has been used in cooperation with the Department of Agri-
culture for the purpose of investigating the effects of artificial light,
humidity, and temperature upon the growth of certain desert and
tropical plants.

In the field of pure physics and physical chemistry the major
part of the time has been devoted to the development of the necessary
equipment for the general intensity and infra-red work contemplated.
The intensity distribution in the mercury spectrum has been deter-
mined directly. In cooperation with the Fixed Nitrogen Research
Laboratory the spectra of HCl, HCN, and the halogen substitution
products of benzene have been investigated in the region between the
visible and Qu.

PHOTOTROPISM

In a preliminary experiment the phototropic response of the oat
coleoptile toward light was determined comparatively for different
colors or spectral regions by means of light filters. The results of
this experiment may be conveniently summed up in the accompuny-

125
126 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

ing graph, Figure 1. The spectral regions used are indicated by the
transmission curves. The wave lengths are plotted as abscissae and
the percentages of light transmitted by the filters as ordinates. The
continuous curves indicate the regions of transmission for each of
the filters; the blue filter (B) transmitting the region between 4,000
and 5,000 A units, the green filter (G) transmitting between 4,800
and 5,900A units, the yellow filter (Y) transmitting all visible
wave lengths longer than 5,800 A, and the red filter (R) transmit-
ting all wave lengths longer than 5,900 A. For the sake of convenience
the observable response curves have been plotted upon the same dia-
gram in dotted lines. The response in the red was found to be zero.
The response to yellow light has been arbitrarily assigned the value
“unity.” Using a logarithmic scale (inside the frame) the relative
responses in green and blue have been indicated. In the right-hand

curve each point is plotted at the wave-length center of gravity of
the region for each filter, in the case of yellow, only counting those
wave lengths not included by the red filter.

This curve plotted through these three points may be regarded as
a first approximation. On the basis of this curve the centers of
gravity were redetermined where each wave length was weighted
according to responses as indicated by the first approximation curve.
The middle curve was thus obtained by simply shifting the points
to the weighed center of gravity wave lengths. Using this second
approximation curve as the basis for again reweighting, the third
or left-hand curve was obtained. Reweighting was, of course, im-
possible for the blue region, as data are not available on the shorter
wave-length side.

These results are presented for the sake of comparison with the
results obtained in the more elaborate experiment carried out with
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY We

the use of a monochromator for obtaining narrower spectral regions
or purer colors. In this way more points could be secured in deter-
mining the response curve, and the amount of correction required for
shift of center of gravity minimized. The results of this second
experiment are shown in Figure 2. Points determined showing the
relative response as a function of wave length are indicated by solid
dots plotted on an arithmetic scale (inside frame). These points
have again been plotted as crosses on a logarithmic scale as indicated
cutside the frame. The results of the earler experiment are shown
as circles.

Agreement between the two experiments is quite striking consider-
ing the rough nature of the earlier experiment.

In the phototropic experiments the biological technique has been
developed by Doctor Johnston and the intensity relations determined
by Doctor McAlister. The demands upon physical technique were
so extreme that special vacuum thermocouples had to be developed
and the galvonometer deflection measured by means of a thermal
relay.

It is interesting to note in this connection that Blaauw had secured
similar curves for phototropic response, measuring instead of relative
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

intensity, the time required for the first observable response. ‘That
these curves determined by time of initial response should be almost
identical to those determined by quantitative intensity ratios strongly
points to a possible time-intensity product as the effective factor in
controlling the phototropic response. This is particularly interest-
ing, as such a relation is found to hold to a first approximation in the
case of photographic plates on the one hand and the erythema
dosage for the human skin on the other, as well as in most simple
systems.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS

Special all-vitreous growth chambers have been developed wherein
the carbon dioxide assimilated by wheat plants can readily be de-
termined. The accompanying illustration (pl. 1, fig. 1) indicates the
type of chamber developed; the plants are inserted through holes in
the cork stopper and held in place by cotton, the roots being
immersed in a nutrient solution contained in the Erlenmeyer flask:
the leaves extend upward in a special tubular compartment. This
tubular compartment is double walled, permitting the circulation
of water for the maintenance of temperature. Illumination is
secured through these lateral walls. For experimentation with the
blue and ultra-violet similar containers have been made of corex.
Air is conditioned by a humidifier and introduced through an air-
flow regulator into the base of the leaf chamber. It is expelled at the
top and a portion passed through a conductivity cell. The variation
in carbon-dioxide content is thus determined by changes caused in
the conductivity of a potassium hydroxide solution. The record is
made continuously by a Leeds and Northrup automatic bridge.

In later experiments eight 300-watt lights mounted upon adjustable
arms were substituted for those shown. Thus 2,400 watts could be
placed at any distance from 20 centimeters to a meter, the illumina-
tion being lateral and strictly symmetrical. A thermocouple with a
cylindrical receiver is introduced through the top in order to deter-
mine accurately the relative intensities for different adjustments.
The accompanying diagram (fig. 3) shows a typical run carried out
during a single day, showing the carbon dioxide assimilated for each
different light intensity.

To a first approximation the curve is apparently made up of two
straight-line segments. While this appears to support the classical
theory of Blackman concerning limiting factors, no such conclusion
should be drawn until more rigid control can be maintained. The
small changes in values which may result may be sufficient to obliter-
ate the apparent linearity.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 129

This work differs from earlier work in that it is carried out with
entire plants instead of individual leaves cut from plants as pre-
viously used. The results presented must be regarded as simply
preliminary, since certain difficulties are yet to be overcome. These
experiments are preparatory for those contemplated wherein approxi-
mately monochromatic light will be used. The development of
equipment for this more elaborate experiment is nearing completion.

In this work Doctor Johnston has carried out the physiological
phases of the experiment and Mr. Hoover has perfected the carbon
dioxide recording apparatus loaned to the division by the Fixed
Nitrogen Research Laboratory and has carried out the observations
with this instrument.

ALGAE INVESTIGATIONS

As a result of the cooperation of the Department of Agriculture
Doctor Meier has been able to initiate a program of algae investi-
gations which will be extended through the following year as a
part of her work as National Research Council Fellow in the divi-
sion. Preliminary experiments have been carried out in which the
many special types of algae which she has collected have been sub-
jected to different nutrient solutions, and to different temperature
and illumination conditions, with a view to determining the condi-
tions required for the experiments contemplated.

She has found that certain varieties may be grown in a colorless
condition in the dark and subsequently gain their normal coloration
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

upon exposure to light. ‘These will be used for experiments in which
coloration is determined as a function of wave length and intensity.

Provision has been made for growing a large number of algae
cultures under comparable conditions. For this purpose two tables
have been constructed, each with four glass-bottomed reservoirs.
Small Erlenmeyer flasks containing solution cultures of algae are
immersed in these large water baths and illuminated by artificial
light from below. A circulating system maintains each set of four
reservoirs at the same temperature. The small Erlenmeyer flasks
containing the algae are maintained in agitation by a common driv-
ing mechanism. Only the illumination is different in one reservoir
from that in another. Thus the effect of modifying wave length or
intensity may be determined for 18 different samples at once. The
flasks may be supplied with small manometers in order to make a
rough check on the photosynthetic processes as they are affected by
growth and modification of conditions of illumination. All this
work, however, is simply an auxiliary to the more careful experiment
to be carried out intensively in a modified Warburg apparatus
wherein differential nephelometric measurements are made as well as
the usual manometric measurements upon oxygen concentration. The
apparatus for these more refined measurements is in process of
construction.

A large quartz spectrograph has been constructed, using two quartz
prisms some 15 cm on a side with quartz lenses of a 60 cm focal
length. By means of the spectrograph unicellular organisms distrib-
uted uniformly on a slide or in a culture dish may be exposed simul-
taneously to different regions of the spectrum. Modifications in
growth rate or resulting death point may be observed comparatively
for different wave lengths. In Plate 1, Figure 2, the results of a pre-
liminary exposure of algae are readily observed. For all wave
lengths shorter than 3,000 A the typical mercury lines appear just
as they would be seen on a photographic plate. Here, however, they
are recorded by the absence of the organisms after a week’s growth
subsequent to exposure. It should be noted that although the lines
on the long-wave length side of 3,000 A are stronger by actual ther-
mocouple determination they have not affected the algae colony.

For convenience, Figure 5 may be referred to in this connection,
which shows the relative intensities of the different lines of the mer-
cury arc as determined in an experiment to be discussed later in
another connection.

By a succession of such experiments, wherein the first noticeable
killing can be determined for different exposure times, the relative
dosage of different wave lengths can be determined.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Tat

COOPERATIVE WORK WITH THE BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY, DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE

A first experiment has been carried out in the general plan of co-
operation between the United States Department of Agriculture and
the division, in the crop physiology and breeding investigations of
Dr. Walter T. Swingle. In this experiment the effects of controlled
radiation, humidity, and temperature on certain tropical and xero-
phytic plants were investigated in a preliminary way. ‘The results
may be summed up as follows:

First, it was found possible to maintain conditions which yielded
in the case of date palms, ten times greater growth rate than that
exhibited by the control plants in the greenhouse (pl. 2). Second,
humidity was shown to be a controlling factor in the growth of date
palms. Third, the ephedra under these conditions yielded two crops,
both larger than the single crop grown in the greenhouse. Fourth,
conditions maintained, perhaps due to the red-rich, blue-poor radia-
tion, yielded exceptional root development in both palms and pan-
dani. Fifth, pandani have shown exceptional offshoot development,
a matter of great significance in propagation of identical individuals.
If the same proves true of palms, as seems likely, this result is of
considerable practical importance.

In this experiment the plant conditions and developments were
in the hands of Dr. Florence E. Meier, associate physiologist in the
Bureau of Plant Industry. Members of the division assisted during
the experiment by the development of control apparatus in connec-
tion with a propagating chamber for maintenance of constant
humidity and temperature.

In further preparation for the cooperative program the Depart-
ment of Agriculture has constructed four additional individual
growth chambers of a larger and slightly modified design but in
general similar to the four already constructed by the division. A
humidifier to serve all the individual growth chambers has been
constructed by their shops and is in progress of installation. It
should be possible to begin experimentation with these individual

intensity distribution of radiation from the visible to 15 in the deep
infra-red, is nearly completed. A preliminary grating set-up shows

remarkable possibilities of an old grating ruled for the Smithsonian
by Rowland for infra-red work shorter than 6s. Two echelette
gratings have been ruled for the division by the Johns Hopkins
University and have been given preliminary tests in the near infra-
red. While these tests have so far been discouraging, they may
still prove satisfactory in the deeper infra-red beyond 6y, for which
they were more particularly designed.

The near infra-red work has been continued in cooperation with
the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory. Investigations of the

halogen derivatives of benzene have been extended; the near infra-
red spectrum of HCN has been investigated in both liquid and vapor,
the results being presented at the Pacific coast meetings of the Physi-
cal Society during the summer. Investigations of HCl in vapor and
dissolved in carbon tetrachloride have been carried out with a view
to determining the rotational freedom existing in such solutions.
This work has been carried out by Doctor Brackett, in association
with Urner Liddel and Dr. Oliver Wulf, of the Fixed Nitrogen
Research Laboratory.

ULTRA-VIOLET

The energy distribution in the mercury arc has been measured by
Doctor McAlister at a resolution 10 times greater than the previous
work. These results were presented at meetings of the Physical
Society. This work has been made possible through the loan of two
quartz monochromators by the Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. Figure
4 shows by the solid line the spectrum plotted with a single mono-
chromator; it is replotted with dotted lines where two monochrom-
ators are used, arranged so that the light passed first through one

and then through the other. It will be seen that not only is the
background of energy observed between lines greatly reduced, but
also the lines are much narrowed, or, in other words, the resolution
is greatly increased. The intensities of the lines are only reduced
by a factor of two where the resolution and freedom from scattering
is increased by a larger factor. Figure 5 shows the spectrum plotted
with the double monochromator arrangement but a still narrower
slit.
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

As a result of these measurements of spectral distribution in the
visible and ultra-violet, an invitation has been extended to the divi-
sion to be represented on the committee on ultra-violet measurement
standards of the Illuminating Engineers Society. Doctor McAlister
represented the division in the first of these meetings during the
summer, where plans were made for cooperation in the development
of suitable standard sources and technique for intensity measurement.

THERMOCOUPLE TECHNIQUE

As a result of the development of the specially sensitive vacuum
thermocouples by members of the division many requests have come
in for the construction of couples for other institutions. This has
been possible only in exceptional cases. Couples have been con-
structed for the University of California, for the Department of
Agriculture, and for the General Electric Co.

As an adjunct of these highly sensitive couples a special thermo-
couple multiplier has been developed which is capable of magnify-
ing galvonometer deflections by any desired ratio up to 1,000 times.
It has the special advantages of making this magnification linearly
for any amplitude and of introducing no appreciable added instabil-
ity into the measurements. This technique is applicable not only to
the infra-red investigations but’ also to the phototropic experiment
where the measurement of extremely small intensities is required.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF INDIVIDUALS

Dr. Earl S. Johnston, plant physiologist, became a full-time mem-
ber of the staff in February, 1931. Doctor Johnston began his work
with the division as a consultant while still a professor at the Univer-
sity of Maryland. He has taken an active part in the plans and de-
velopments along the lines of plant physiology almost from the
beginning. His addition to the staff has made possible much more
rapid progress in the biological phases of the work. He has agegres-
sively pushed the phototropic experiments and the wheat experiment,
and has assisted in the preliminary growth chamber experiment. His
assistance in matters of publication has been very valuable.

Dr. E. D. McAlister became a member of the staff in September,
1930, devoting half of his time to the work of the division and the
other half to the work of the Research Corporation. During the
latter part of the year all his time was assigned to the work of the
division. Doctor McAlister’s long experience in thermocouple tech-
nique and infra-red measurements makes him unusually well qualified
for the work of the division. He has carried out the most exacting
phases of thermocouple observations on intensity and wave-length
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 135

distribution in the phototropic experiment. He has materially con-
tributed to the development of the preliminary growth chamber and
controls. He has carried out an investigation on the distribution of
the mercury are in the blue and ultra-violet. He has furthermore
handled a large part of the technical developments of thermocouples.
This is in addition to his work with the Research Corporation, for
which he has carried out exhaustive investigations of the possibilities
of the thermopile for use as a source of electromotive force in ap-
plied fields. He has carried out preliminary developments of the
nephylometer for general experimental use.

Leland B. Clark, in addition to carrying on all the regular glass-
blowing, has handled the vacuum technique development in connec-
tion with the thermocouples. He has constructed a practical butylph-
thalate pump of original design. His assistance in many phases of
special laboratory technique is of great value to the division.

William H. Hoover has carried out a large part of the equipment
and operation of the preliminary growth chamber; he has adjusted
and increased the sensitivity of the carbon dioxide detecting device
loaned to the division by the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory
and he has installed and put in operation temperature-control equip-
ment for the individual wheat experiment. He has designed and in-
stalled a new thermostat which greatly increases the stability of the
carbon dioxide recording mechanism. This is in addition to his
work with the Astrophysical Observatory, for whom during the year
he has spent a month in the development of photometric equipment
and two months on a trip to Table Mountain, as well as some com-
putational work on the annual report.

Miss Stanley, in addition to the regular stenographic work, now
a considerable load, has ably handled all our bookkeeping in con-
nection with purchases.

L. A. Fillmen, a mechanic of wide experience in apparatus and
equipment construction, became a half-time member of the staff in
August, 1980. His experience and ability have contributed largely
in the development of equipment for the laboratory. Through the
courtesy of the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, Mr. Fillmen
worked for several months in their shop while our shop was being
equipped.

EXTENSION OF HOUSING

The large room No, 14 of the basement was added to the laboratory
in order to provide for the intensity measurements in the visible
and ultra-violet and development of the algae and wheat experiments.
Partitions have been built in order to provide sufficient dark-room
space. A room has also been constructed in order to make possible
the accommodation of a glass-blowing course, which Mr. Clark has
undertaken for the Department of Agriculture. Room No. 12 has
been equipped as a thoroughly up-to-date machine shop by the
Research Corporation, with whom the division shares Mr. Fillmen’s
time. Room No. 13 has been equipped for the shopwork of the
members of the division.

COOPERATION

The division has been especially fortunate in the cordial coopera-
tion of other institutions. This includes near infra-red work with
the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, experiments in higher
plants with the Bureau of Plant Industry, sharing of equipment and
personnel with the Research Corporation, personal assistance from
the Astrophysical Observatory, assistance in the form of apparatus
and equipment from the Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. and the General
Electric Co.

GENERAL

In undertaking experimental work along those biological lines
wherein radiation plays an important part it is inevitable that men
are required with special training and experience not only in biology
but also in the fields of physics and chemistry. To bring about the
cooperation in these border-line problems of men with specialized
training in each of these fields has been the essential dominating
idea in the development of the division. The lack of men with
specialized chemical training in the organic and photochemical fields
is more and more keenly felt. Furthermore although the division is
well provided with people of highly specialized training in the field
of plant physiology and physics it is handicapped by the lack of
sufficient laboratory assistance in order to carry out their ideas and
make their time effective. Without increasing its program or widen-
ing the scope of its activities the division urgently needs sufficient
funds to round out its personnel in this way.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 137
SUMMARY

The end of the second year finds the research work of the division
well under way with preliminary results on phototropism, and on
carbon dioxide assimilation of wheat; algae experiments on light
adaptation have been initiated; promising experimental work has
been begun in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture; and
spectroscopic measurements have been completed in both the ultra-
violet and infra-red. The laboratory space has been extended and
equipped for the expansion of the work. Shop facilities have been
added to care for the apparatus development. Essential additions
have been made to the division personnel in both the physiological]
and physical sides of the project.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Regional Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1931.

The routine work of the bureau, consisting mainly of compiling
necessary records of current American scientific publications to be
indexed for the catalogue when publication is resumed, has been
continued.

In compliance with the resolution passed at the last international
convention held in Brussels in July, 1922, this bureau has been kept
in existence. This resolution, unanimously adopted, was “ That the
convention is of opinion that the international organization should
be kept in being through mutual agreement to continue as far as
possible the work of the regional bureaus until such time as it may be
economically possible to resume publication.” Complying with the
intent of the resolution, this bureau has been continued, though with
a force of only two employees, in order to keep the enterprise alive
with the lowest possible expenditure of money. Each year part of
the regular annual congressional appropriation has reverted to the
Treasury; this year, out of the appropriation of $8,145, only $5,624
was spent, and thus $2,521 will revert.

This bureau is making every effort through the chairman of the
executive committee, in whom authority to reorganize is vested, to
influence the other bureaus to take the steps necessary to resume
publication, but on account of depressed financial conditions still ex-
isting and the disorganized political situation in some countries no
definite plan has yet been advanced. This is a situation to be de-
plored, for nothing has ever taken the place of the catalogue, and its
need in the world of science becomes ever more obvious. Aside from
the necessary cooperation by the regional bureaus in furnishing clas-
sified references for the Catalogue, a capital fund estimated at $75,-
000 is needed to refinance the central bureau, the editing and pub-
lishing center of the enterprise, and it seems provable that when a
definite plan is presented some of the great endowed foundations
interested in this and similar fields will provide this comparatively
small sum.

138
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 139

Dr. Ernest Cushing Richardson, one of the great international
authorities on bibliography, stated in a paper on the International
Catalogue published in Science, June 20, 1930:

* * * The research endowments are bombarded with bibliographical
projects of varying method and degrees of merit. They aid or support a good
many projects. They are deeply concerned as trust organizations to put their
money where it will do the most good. Other things being equal, they prefer
to put it where one dollar will do the work of four. * * * It is here they
can give the most bibliographical service with the least money. The proposi-
tion touches the libraries in a very similar way. If and when the matter is
revived it will depend for financing, if not on the endowments, than on library
subscriptions. If this machine is scrapped, when a new one is started either
a $3,000,000 endowment must be had from promoters of research or a quad-
ruple price charged to libraries.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1931:

THE LIBRARY

The library, or library system, of the Smithsonian Institution is
made up of 46 separate libraries, each related in some special way to
the work of the Institution and of the seven Government bureaus
under its administrative charge. The chief of these is the Smith-
sonian deposit in the Library of Congress. The others are the hbrary
of the United States National Museum, the Smithsonian office
library, the Langley aeronautical hbrary, and the libraries of the
Astrophysical Observatory, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the
Division of Radiation and Organisms, the Freer Gallery of Art,
the National Gallery of Art, and the National Zoological Park, to-
gether with the 86 sectional libraries in the National Museum. These
collections, which number in all about 800,000 volumes, pamphlets,
and charts, not to mention the thousands still uncatalogued, while
they contain many publications on art, history, literature, philos-
ophy, music, and education, pertain largely to science and tech-
nology. This important group of libraries has made available to
Smithsonian employees and to American research workers in gen-
eral, especially those connected with the various departments of
the Government, most of the leading scientific publications of the
world during one of its outstanding eras. Thus it has had a note-
worthy part in carrying out since 1846—the year in which the Smith-
sonian began its activities—the will of James Smithson, the founder
of the Institution.

CHANGES IN STAFF

During the last year there were several changes in the library
staff. Miss Marian W. Seville was made head of the order depart-
ment and promoted from the rank of library assistant to that of
senior library assistant. Mrs. M. Landon Reed, who had served in
the exchange department for some time on temporary appointment,
was given a permanent position as clerk. Miss Margaret Moreland

140
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 141

was advanced from the grade of under library assistant to that of
senior stenographer, to fill a new position established in the lbra-
rian’s office at the beginning of the year. Miss Anna M. Link was
promoted from the rank of minor library assjstant to the place
formerly occupied by Miss Moreland. Miss Virginia C. Whitney, a
graduate in library science of George Washington University, was
appointed minor lbrary assistant to succeed Miss Link. The tempo-
rary employees were Mr. Alan Blanchard, Mrs. Daisy Cadle, Mrs.
Lewis Deschler, Miss Katherine Everhart, Mrs. Grace A. Parler,
Miss Jennette Seiler, Miss Eleanor Spielman, and Mr. Clyde Wil-
hams.
EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

The collections in the library system have been built up partly by
the early provisions of the copyright law, partly by purchase and
gift, but to a very large extent by exchange, for from the first the
Institution and its branches have exchanged their publications for
those of other learned institutions and societies and for scientific and
technical journals and monographs. These have come to the Smith-
sonian library by mail or through the International Exchange Serv-
ice, which is administered by the Institution.

In the course of the fiscal year just closed there came to the library
by mail 24,594 packages and by the Exchange 1,688, each containing
one or more publications. These were stamped, entered, and for-
warded to the appropriate libraries of the system. Among the
notable sendings, of which there were many, was one of 331 volumes
and parts of Neerlandia from the Allgemeen Nederlandsch Verbond,
at The Hague. This was assigned to the Smithsonian deposit.

The publications received included 4,565 dissertations from the uni-
versities of Basel, Berlin, Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Cornell, Erlangen,
Gand, Giessen, Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Helsingfors, Jena,
Johns Hopkins, Kiel, K6nigsberg, Leiden, Leipzig, Lund, Marburg,
Neuchatel, Pennsylvania, Rostock, Strasbourg, Tiibingen, Utrecht,
Warsaw, and Ziirich, the Academy of Freiberg, and technical schools
at Aachen, Berlin, Braunschweig, Dresden, Karlsruhe, and Ziirich.

Of the 1,808 letters written by the library staff during the year—
an increase of 97 over 1930—nearly all had to do with the exchange
of publications. At the close of the year this correspondence was up
to date. The number of publications obtained in exchange in re-
sponse to special requests from the various libraries of the Institution
was much larger than usual, or 3,590. Exchange relations for several
hundred new publications were entered into, particularly on behalf
of the Smithsonian deposit, the Langley aeronautical library, and the
libraries of the National Museum and Astrophysical Observatory.
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931
GIFTS

During the year the library received many gifts. Chief among
these was one of several thousand volumes and pamphlets, together
with a collection of important letters and photographs, from the
library of the late Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology.
These were presented by Mrs. Merrill and the other heirs of the
estate and are to be kept in the office formerly occupied by Doctor
Merrill, both as a permanent memorial to him and as an outstanding
addition to the library in the division of geology. Other valuable
collections received were as follows: 600 publications of a general
scientific nature from Mrs. Dora W. Boettcher, given in memory of
her husband, F. L. J. Boettcher, who was once connected with the
Smithsonian Institution; 886 volumes and pamphlets from the
heirs of the estate of the late Dr. O. P. Hay, of the Carnegie
Institution, who for some years before his death used the library
in the National Museum almost daily and gave it many valuable
publications; 34 volumes, especially on atomic weights, together
with a package of letters from the first four Secretaries of the
Smithsonian, from the late Dr. Frank Wigglesworth Clarke; 30
publications by or about Prof. Henry Carvill Lewis, from his
sister, Mrs. Edward §S. Sayres; and 50 or more early numbers of
periodicals on art, from Mrs. Marietta Comly. Among other gifts
were 8 volumes on the history of Japan, from the Historiographical
Institute, Tokyo; 4 volumes, namely, A Handbook of Mohammedan
Decorative Arts, by M. 8S. Dimand, and Catalogue of European Dag-
gers, Catalogue of European Court Swords and Hunting Swords,
and Handbook of Arms and Armor, European and Oriental, by
Bashford Dean, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and The
Permian of Mongolia, by Amadeus W. Grabau, from the American
Museum of Natural History. About 600 publications came from the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, 267 from the
International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, 255 from the Geo-
physical Laboratory, 55 from the American Association of Museums,
and many from the Library of Congress.

Preeminent among the books presented to the library was a copy
of Nippon, by Phillip Franz von Siebold, as reissued recently in five
volumes by the Japaninstitut of Berlin. The narrative of the
author’s experiences in Japan during the years 1823 to 1830 is illus-
trated with pictures of the Japanese people and life during that
period. ‘This handsome and costly work, highly significant for its
worth both as art and as history, was given to the Smithsonian by
G. A. Pfeiffer, of New York, and was deposited in the library
of the Freer Gallery of Art. Other unusual gifts included Machu
Picchu, a Citadel of the Incas, by Senator Hiram Bingham, from
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 143

the National Geographic Society; Lo-Lang, a Report on the Excava-
tion of Wang-Hsii’s Tomb in the Lo-Lang Province, an Ancient
Chinese Colony in Korea, by Yoshito Harada, with the Collabora-
tion of Kingo Tazawa, from the Tokyo Imperial University; The
Ellsworth Family, Volume I1—Lincoln Elsworth, by Howard EI-
dred Kershner, from the National Americana Society; Impressions
of Japanese Architecture, by Ralph Adams Cram, from the Japan
Society of New York; Volumes IV and V of her well-known work,
North American Wild Flowers, from Mrs. Charles D. Walcott;
Volumes VII and VIII of the Smithsonian Scientific Series—Man
from the Farthest Past, by Carl Whiting Bishop, and Cold-Blooded
Vertebrates (Pt. I, Fishes; Pts. Il and III, Amphibians and
Reptiles), by Samuel F. Hildebrand, Dr. Charles W. Gilmore, and
Doris M. Cochran—from the Smithsonian Institution; Clouds, by
Alexander McAdie, from the Blue Hill Observatory; The Travels of
Captain Robert Coverte, edited and presented by Boies Penrose;
Wild Flowers of the Alleghanies, by Joseph E. Harned, from the
author; William Henry Welch at Eighty, edited by Victor O. Free-
burg, from the Milbank Memorial Fund; The Indians of Pecos
Pueblo, by Earnest A. Hooton, from Phillips Academy; Handbook
of Aeronautics, by the Royal Aeronautical Society of London, from
the publishers, Gale & Polden (Ltd.); African Republic of
Liberia and the Belgian Congo (Harvard African Expedition, 1926—
27), in two volumes, edited by Richard P. Strong, from Harvey W.
Firestone; Natural History of Birds, ia two volumes, by George
Edwards, from James Norris Woodward; and Tratado Elemental
de Botanica, with typed index, by Carlos Cuervo Margues, from W.
A. Archer.

Gifts were also received from many members and associates of the
Smithsonian staff, including Secretary Abbot, Assistant Secretary
Wetmore, Dr. William H. Holmes, director of the National Gallery
of Art, Dr. J. M. Aldrich, H. G. Barber, Dr. Marcus Benjamin, FE. J.
Brown, Dr. E. A. Chapin, A. H. Clark, Dr. Herbert Friedmann,
Dr. O. P. Hay, Dr. Walter Hough, A. B. Howell, Dr. AleS Hrdlicka,
Neil M. Judd, Dr. Remington Kellogg, Dr. W. R. Maxon, G. S.

W. deC. Ravenel, Dr. C. W. Richmond, J. H. Riley, J. Townsend
Russell, jr., Dr. Waldo Schmitt, Miss Marian Seville, and E. H.
Walker.

SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT

The Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress is, as has
been said, the chief unit in the library system, numbering at present
more than 500,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts. It is peculiarly
rich in scientific monographs, the reports, proceedings, and trans-
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

actions of learned institutions and societies, and scientific and
technical journals. To the scholar, therefore, particularly in the
fields of natural history, physical science, and technology, the deposit
offers a wealth of material.

During the last fiscal year the Institution sent to the. deposit
20,879 publications—an increase of 1,735 over the year before—or
2,626 volumes, 12,775 parts of volumes, 4,393 pamphlets, and 1,085
charts. Of these, 4,565 were dissertations. Of the charts, 883 were
maps and atlases which the Smithsonian, in the course of the reor-
ganization of its library system, had selected as worthy of preserva-
tion in its main library. Some of these were important manu-
script maps; many of the others were also new to the division of
maps in the Library of Congress.

The number of publications obtained by the Smithsonian library
in exchange to meet special needs in the deposit was 2,364, or 159
more even than in 1930, when the records showed more than a two
and a half fold increase over 1929 and almost a fivefold increase
over 1928. This steady growth in the exchange service of the
library on behalf of the deposit is worthy of note.

In addition to the publications sent to the deposit, several thousand
documents of foreign governments, which were received by the
Smithsonian library, were forwarded, without being stamped and
entered, to the division of documents in the Library of Congress.

It might be added that toward the close of the year the Smith-
sonian library, with the aid of the National Museum, especially the
section of photography, took steps, at the happy suggestion of the
chief of the Smithsonian division in the Library of Congress, to
have portraits made of the founder and five Secretaries of the
Smithsonian Institution to be hung in that division with those of
other prominent scientists already there. When they are finished,
they will be presented for this purpose.

NATIONAL MUSEUM LIBRARY

In the library system of the Smithsonian Institution the library
of the United States National Museum ranks next in size and in-
fluence to the Smithsonian deposit. Its 2 major and 36 minor col-
lections are largely on natural history and technology. The cata-
logued items of the library total 79,407 volumes and 109,129 pam-
phlets. During the fiscal year 1931 the accessions to it were 2,528
volumes and 832 pamphlets, an increase of 375 over 19380. Many of
these came by gift, more by purchase, but most by exchange.

The year was one of much progress, in which the staff went far
toward making the library a more complete and available instrument
in the research work of the museum. This was the result partly of
the appointment to the Museum and other permanent library rolls
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 145

of the Smithsonian of several new trained assistants and partly of
the increase in funds for the acquisition of material needed by the
scientists which could not be obtained by exchange. The staff entered
8,799 periodicals, substituting for the old system of entry a new sys-
tem that is being employed extensively by libraries using Library of
Congress cards. They catalogued 1,639 volumes, 785 pamphlets,
and 17 charts, or 427 more than the previous year. They also, as in
former years, did the cataloguing and entering for the library of the
National Gallery of Art, the total number of publications thus
treated being 311 and 533 respectively—twice the number of 1930.
They contributed 11,193 cards to the Museum catalogue and revised
672 catalogue headings. They also added 8,036 cards to the shelf
lists, and prepared almost as many duplicate cards for the union shelf
list in the Smithsonian Building. They sent to the sectional libraries
6,522 volumes and parts and to the members of the scientific staff
for their personal use 1,419 reprints, many of which had come to hight
in the process of sorting the few remaining collections of miscel-
laneous materialinthe hbrary. They filed the Wistar Institute cards
as they came in, and brought up to date the filing of the large accu-
mulation of Concilium Bibliographicum cards of the author set,
17,000 cards being added to this file. The current cards of the sys-
tematic set were forwarded to the sections that have files on their
special subjects. The number of volumes bound was 1,402, or 151
more than in 1980. In this connection it may be added that more
volumes than usual were completed by special exchange letters, the
number of publications received in response to them being 1,090, an
increase of 402 over the year before.

The number of publications loaned to the staff of the Smithsonian
and its branches totaled 7,221, more than one-third of which were
charged in the reading room of the Arts and Industries Building.
Of these the library borrowed 2,049 from the Library of Congress
and 271 elsewhere. Loans of 142 publications were made to lbraries
not in the Smithsonian system. The number of volumes returned to
the Library of Congress was 2,519 and to other hbraries 407—in each
instance many more than usual.

The main shelf list—that of the collection in the Natural History
Building—was completed early in the year, and the work of taking
an inventory was begun. This had to be discontinued, however, in
the fall, owing to lack of help.

Finally, attention should be called to the fact that even with the
400 feet of new shelving that the Museum installed for the collection
in 1930 the natural history hbrary is still in a very crowded condi-
tion. Sufficient space and equipment both to relieve its present con-
gestion and to permit of growth for a period of years should be
provided as soon as possible,
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

During the year the Museum library staff was able to assist only
a few of the sectional libraries with their special problems, including
those in the divisions of plants, mammals, and geology.

These libraries number 36, and are as follows:

Administration. Marine invertebrates.
Administrative assistant’s office. Mechanical technology.
American archeology. Medicine.

Anthropology. Minerals.

Biology. Mineral technology.
Birds. Mollusks.

Botany. Old World archeology.
Echinoderms. Organic chemistry.
Editor’s office. Paleobotany.

Ethnology. Photography.

Fishes. Physical anthropology.
Foods. Property clerk’s office.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphic arts. Superintendent’s office.
History. Taxidermy.

Insects. Textiles.

Invertebrate paleontology. Vertebrate paleontology.
Mammals. Wood technology.

OFFICE LIBRARY

The office library consists of works of general reference, sets of
the publications of the Smithsonian and its branches, and of various
foreign societies and institutions, as well as numerous publications of
a less learned and more cultural and even recreational character for
use during the leisure hours of the Smithsonian employees. The
additions to the library in the course of the last 12 months were 686

volumes and 82 pamphlets. The number of periodicals entered
was 229.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The library of the Bureau of American Ethnology contains 26,671
volumes and 16,717 pamphlets, chiefly on the archeology, history.
myths, religion, arts, sociology, language, and general culture of the
early peoples of the Western Hemisphere, especially of the North
American Indian. The collection was increased during the past year
by 600 volumes and 190 pamphlets. The number of periodicals
entered was 3,500, and of cards added to the catalogue 3,500. The
number of volumes bound was 473. The loans were 875.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

The library of the Astrophysical Observatory is closely related in
content to the researches in astrophysics and meteorology that are
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 147

being conducted by the Institution. It has 4,188 volumes and 3,192
pamphlets. The additions during the year were 180 volumes and 92
pamphlets. The number of volumes bound was 127.

RADIATION AND ORGANISMS LIBRARY

The library of radiation and organisms is a small, highly special-
ized collection pertaining to one of the newer interests of the
Institution, for the furthering of which it recently organized a
division. During 1930 publications bearing mainly on this interest
to the number of 20 volumes, 1 pamphlet, and several periodicals
were added, bringing the collection to 94 volumes, 9 pamphlets, and
6 charts. Space and equipment, adequate for some years to come,
were provided for the library in the north tower of the Smithsonian
Building.

LANGLEY AERONAUTICAL LIBRARY

The Smithsonian’s well-known collection of aeronautical publica-
tions is now deposited in the Library of Congress, where, under its
own stamp and bookplate, it occupies a unique place in the division
of aeronautics and is even more available as an aid in research than
it was before 1930, when it was transferred from the Institution. It
will continue to bear the name of the Langley Aeronautical Library,
in memory of Samuel Pierpont Langley, who while Secretary of the
Smithsonian made a notable contribution to the science of aero-
nautics. Most of the collection once belonged to Doctor Langley, and
to other experimenters associated with him, including Alexander
Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, and James Means. The rest of it has
been received from time to time by the Institution chiefly in exchange
for its publications. The library contains 1,856 volumes and 1,056
pamphlets. Among its items are sets, including most of the early
numbers, of the aeronautical magazines, both American and foreign,
and many other important publications, some of which are very rare,
together with files of photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings.

During the fiscal year just closed the Smithsonian brary was in-
strumental in increasing the Langley collection by 45 per cent more
than in 1930, or by 122 volumes, 445 parts of volumes, and 133
pamphlets. Most of these were obtained by exchange. In this con-
nection it may be added that the library, cooperating with the divi-
sion of aeronautics in the Library of Congress, entered into exchange
relations, on behalf of the Langley collection, with 50 or more new
aeronautical societies and institutions, and received in response to its
special requests many publications. It is hoped that this service on
the part of the Smithsonian library can be considerably enlarged in
the near future.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the National Gallery of Art contains many valuable
works on art, both American and foreign, including sets of the lead-
ing magazines. The collection numbers 1,243 volumes and 1,332
pamphlets. During the last year its accessions were 145 volumes,
166 pamphlets, and 533 periodicals. Most of these came by purchase
and exchange. Numerous gifts were received, however, especially
from Dr. William H. Holmes, director of the gallery, and James
Townsend Russell, jr., honorary collaborator in Old World archeology
in the National Museum. The number of volumes bound was 51.

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art is a prominent member of
the Smithsonian library system. As the collection has to do largely
with the arts and cultures of the Far East, India, Persia, and the
nearer east, it is not only a unique and valuable aid to those imme-
diately connected with the gallery, as well as to visitors who come
there for research, but in many of its items—notably those in Chinese
and Japanese, not a few of which are extremely rare—it supple-
ments to an unusual degree the collection in the oriental division of
the Library of Congress. In the library, too, are works on the lives
and art of various American painters, especially James McNeill
Whistler, a large number of whose pictures are owned by the gallery.
It also has numerous publications on the Washington manuscripts,
the well-known fourth and fifth century manuscripts of the Bible,
which are among the treasures of the gallery.

The main library, which is kept permanently in the gallery, con-
sists of 4,423 volumes and 3,148 pamphlets. Its accessions during the
year just closed were 61 volumes and 150 pamphlets. The number
of volumes bound was 20. In addition to its main library, the gallery
has a special collection, numbering 814 volumes and 500 pamphlets,
chiefly of archeological interest, which is for the use of its staff in
the field. Among the significant publications deposited in the library
during the year by the Smithsonian Institution were a copy of Nip-
pon, by Phillip Franz von Siebold, and of Lo-Lang, by Yoshito
Harada and Kingo Tazawa—two of the gifts described in more
detail earlier in this report. The work of reclassifying and recata-
loguing the collections, which was begun the year before, was carried
almost to completion, 6,083 cards being added to the dictionary cata-
logue of the library and a like number being prepared for filing in
the union catalogue in the Smithsonian Building. This notable prog-
ress was made possible by the further generous cooperation of the
gallery with the Smithsonian library. Of the 435 visitors, 216 came
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 149

to study, 16 to make sketches from plates, and 203 to see the reproduc-
tions of the Washington manuscripts.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

Among the 1,217 volumes and 407 pamphlets in the library of the
National Zoological Park are many of great value to those interested
in the care and habits of animals. Its additions for the year were
four volumes and four pamphlets.

SUMMARY OF ACCESSIONS

The accessions for the year may be summarized as follows:

It is estimated that on June 30, 1931, the number of volumes,
pamphlets, and charts in the Smithsonian hbrary system was as
follows:

In addition to this total, there were, of course, many thousands of
volumes still uncatalogued or awaiting completion.

UNION CATALOGUE

Besides keeping up the current cataloguing work, the staff com-
pleted the shelf list of the National Museum library and prepared
a copy of part of it for filing with the union shelf list in the
Smithsonian Building; catalogued and arranged the publications of
the Carnegie Institution of Washington; finished cataloguing the
John Donnell Smith collection, including a large set of miscellaneous
publications, for which they prepared about 1,100 analytical and
subject entries; began the recataloguing of the general botanical
collection in the National Museum; and, finally, made notable prog-
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

ress in the work, begun the year before, of reclassifying and
recataloguing the library of the Freer Gallery of Art.

The work on the union catalogue and shelf list may be summed up

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

A number of special tasks were undertaken by the staff during
the year. These were chiefly connected with the reorganization of
the library system that has been going on for some time.

Further progress was made in sorting the miscellaneous material
in the west stacks of the Smithsonian Building, and hundreds of
publications were found that were lacking in the libraries of the
Institution. The art-room collection was checked and a list pre-
pared for the National Gallery of Art. The regents’ and archives’
sets of Smithsonian publications were also checked and, so far as
possible, the missing numbers supplied. The natural history col-
lection in the National Museum was shifted and rearranged, to
make it less crowded and more accessible, and a similar treatment
of the technology collection was begun.

Many publications—in some cases, whole files—not needed by the
Institution or its branches, were transferred to other Government
libraries. These included 1,935 publications of the United States
Geological Survey, 904 of the Canadian Geological Survey, and
100 of a miscellaneous character. They likewise included the rolls
of 883 maps and atlases that had been stored for many years in
the old Museum.

Four hundred and fifty of the duplicates among the publications
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington were sent back to that
institution. In return the Carnegie give the Smithsonian many of
the volumes that were lacking in its sets. The duplicate publica-
tions of the University of California received similar treatment,
476 items being returned to the university and a large number sent
to the Institution toward completing its files.

The librarian gave several lectures, on Shakespeare, Virgil, the
Nature of Poetry, and the Smithsonian Institution, before various
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY boil

groups in Washington, including the Cosmos Club, the Shakespeare
Society, the Classical Club, and American University.

CONCLUSION

Despite the fact that the year was one of the most successful
since the beginning of the reorganization of the library system in
1924, much more could have been accomplished both for the libra-
ries in the system and for the scientists and other employees of
the Smithsonian if sufficient funds had been at hand for the purchase
of all the books and periodicals not obtainable by exchange that
were needed in the current work of the Institution; if the binding
allotment had been large enough to permit the binding of all the
volumes prepared during the year—as it was, 600 had to be held
for months as they could not be sent to the bindery until after
June 30; and, most of all, if it had been possible to employ more
permanent trained assistants. Among the additional personnel
needed on the library staff are several cataloguers and general library
assistants, a typist, and a messenger.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 11
REPORT ON PUBLICATIONS

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
publications of the Smithsonian Institution and the Government
bureaus under its administrative charge during the year ending
June 30, 1931:

A consolidation of all the editorial work of the Institution and
its branches, put in effect by the secretary on March 1, 1931, brought
all of the 18 series of publications issued by the Smithsonian under
the general direction of the editor. This step was taken in the
interests of greater unity of editorial policy, more efficiency, and
less duplication in the keeping of the many records, financial and
otherwise, necessary in an editorial office, and, most important of all,
greater accuracy and more prompt appearance of Smithsonian
publications.

On January 31, 1931, Dr. Marcus Benjamin, editor of the National
Museum, retired after a service of 35 years. He was succeeded by
Paul H. Oehser, formerly on the editorial staff of the Bureau of
Biological Survey. Mr. Oehser and Mr. Stanley Searles, editor of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, will continue in charge of the
editorial work of their respective bureaus, but by centralizing the
general direction of the work in the office of the editor of the Smith-
sonian Institution, the advantage is gained of establishing a definite
point of contact between heads of bureaus, authors, and the Govern-
ment Printing Office. Furthermore, the same general style can now
be adopted for all the series published under the Institution, so that
authors, many of whom publish in several of the series, will know
beforehand what style is expected. To aid toward this end, it is
proposed to issue a condensed style sheet based on the Style Manual
of the Government Printing Office, covering those matters that occur
constantly in every manuscript and concerning which authors and
typists are often in doubt.

PUBLICATIONS ISSUED DURING THE YEAR

The Institution proper published during the year 16 papers in the
series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 1 annual report and
pamphlet copies of the 24 articles contained in the report appendix,
and 3 special publications. The United States National Museum

included 29 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Contributions
to Knowledge, 27,425 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Mis-
cellaneous Collections, 25,984 volumes and separates of the Smith-
sonian annual reports, 4,627 Smithsonian special publications, 37,967

SMITHSONIAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PRINTING AND PUBLICATION

The editor continued to serve as secretary to the Smithsonian ad-
visory committee on printing and publication until March 1, 1931,
when the committee was dissolved by the reorganization of the edi-
torial department of the Institution mentioned earlier in this report.
Four meetings were held and 88 manuscripts were acted upon. The
membership at the last meeting was as follows: Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger, head curator of biology, National Museum, chairman; Dr.
William M. Mann, director, National Zoological Park; M. W.
Stirling, chief, Bureau of American Ethnology; Dr. R. S. Bassler,
head curator of geology, National Museum; W. P. True, editor of
the Institution, secretary; and Stanley Searles, editor of the Bureau
of American Ethnology.

Since the editorial reorganization, manuscripts come directly to
the editor of the Smithsonian Institution with the recommendation
of the head of the publishing bureau, who has taken expert advice as
to their merit and suitability for printing.

Respectfully submitted.

W. P. Troe, Editor.

Dr. Cuartes G. ABBOT,

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, Mich.,
gave to the Institution his collection of Chinese and other oriental
objects of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art
by Whistler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also
gave funds for the construction of a building to house the collection,
and finally, in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock
and securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endow-
ment fund for the operation of the gallery. In view of the importance
and special nature of the gift and the requirements of the testator in
respect to it, all Freer funds are kept separate from the other funds of
the Institution, and the accounting in respect to them is stated
separately.

166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

During the year, the Institution received as gifts a total of approxi-
mately $145,000, which included donations for specific uses not to
be invested, for increase of endowments for specific purposes, and a
small sum for the increase of the general endowment fund.

All payments are made by check, signed by the Secretary of the
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account. In many instances
deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collection and later
are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven satisfactory. During the year the interest derived from
this source has resulted in a total of $5,026.75.

The foregoing report relates only to the private funds of the
Smithsonian Institution. The following is a statement of the
congressional appropriations for the past 10 years for the support
of the several governmental branches under the administrative
control of the Institution and of appropriations for other special
purposes during that period.

ENDED JUNE 30, 1931

ANNUAL MEETING, DECEMBER 11, 1930

Present: Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, chancellor, in the
chair, Vice President Charles Curtis, Senator Joseph T. Robinson,
Representative Albert Johnson, Representative R. Walton Moore,
Representative Robert Luce, Frederic A. Delano, Dr. John C.
Merriam, and the secretary, Dr. C. G. Abbot. Dr. Alexander Wet-
more, assistant secretary was also present.

At the previous annual meeting of the board, the Langley gold
medal for aerodromics was awarded to Charles Matthews Manly
(posthumously) and to Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd. At the pres-
ent meeting the actual presentation of the medal was made to Mr.
Manly through his son Charles W. Manly. The chancellor made the
address of presentation, and Mr. Manly accepted the medal on behalf
of his family. Extracts from the remarks of the chancellor and Mr.
Manly will be found in the Report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution for 1931.

Mr. Delano, chairman of the executive committee, offered the
following customary resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1932, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the
secretary, with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on
the part of the secretary as to items.

The secretary presented his printed report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1930. He stated that the publications of the Institution
during the fiscal year 1930 totaled 95 volumes and pamphlets, of
which 38 were issued by the Institution proper, 51 by the National
Museum, and 6 by the Bureau of American Ethnology. Under the
Institution’s policy of world-wide distribution, 168,163 copies of its
publications were sent out to organizations and individuals, for the
most part free.

Mr. Delano submitted the printed report showing the financial
affairs of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1930.

The annual report of the National Gallery of Art Commission was
presented and accepted, and the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby

of the commission for the ensuing term of four years, their present terms having
expired.

The matter of the purchase and erection of the Bush-Brown statue,
The Indian Buffalo Hunt, was brought up, and on motion it was
resolved to refer it to the executive committee with power to act.

The secretary then presented a supplementary report, mentioning
a number of special events and activities during the year. He spoke
particularly of the support by the Research Corporation of the work
of the Division of Radiation and Organisms; of continued generous
gifts by John A. Roebling to aid the Institution’s solar-radiation
researches; of additions by Mr. Gellatly to the very valuable art
collection previously given to the Institution; of the considerable
sum already received in royalties from the sale of the Smithsonian
Scientific Series; of the completion of the series North American Wild
Flowers, by Mary Vaux Walcott; and of the important discoveries
in European archives of early manuscripts relating to the Americas
by Dr. C. U. Clark, working under a grant from Ambassador Charles
G. Dawes.

At the request of the Secretary, Doctor Wetmore described certain
of the year’s explorations under the Institution. Doctor Wetmore
also spoke of the status of the proposed additional wings on each

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1931

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genera, AppENprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of -scientific
discovery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous cor-
respondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool-
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though, not
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report for

1931.

TWENTY-FIVE YEARS’ STUDY OF SOLAR RADIATION

By C. G. ABBor

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

[With 3 plates]

INFRA-RED SOLAR SPECTRUM MAP AND THE DISPERSION OF ROCK
SALT

Thirty years ago at Washington, under Dr. 8. P. Langley’s direc-
tion, F. E. Fowle and I completed a map of the sun’s invisible infra-
red spectrum. Our map extended from Fraunhofer’s “A,” at wave
length 0.76 micron, to a point far down in the infra-red of wave
length 5.8 microns. We felt out and recorded the invisible spectrum
lines with the photographic registering spectrobolometer. Langley
used to say that in his use of the spectrobolometer on Mount Whitney
in 1881 the indicator often raced across the scale 1 meter long in a
minute. We had so far tamed this wild creature by the year 1900
that the indicator seldom wandered a centimeter in an hour. Never-
theless, that delicate electrical thermometer, the bolometer, was then
so sensitive that a deflection of a millimeter on the photographic
recording scale corresponded to a temperature change of only
0.000004° Centigrade.

The infra-red solar spectrum map which we made between 1895
and 1900 contained 740 lines. Their positions were recognized as
cooled bits of the spectrum by the fine metallic sensitive thread of the
bolometer. No doubt a considerable number of those 740 lines were
spurious, for every tremor of the earth and every accidental temper-
ature change added its unwelcome deflections to the record. We
eliminated the false and preserved the true, as well as we were able,
by comparing many independent records. To fix the wave lengths
we made a special investigation of the dispersion of rock salt prisms.
Paschem repeated it later. His results agreed generally with ours
in the fifth decimal place of the refractive index of rock salt.

In 1928 H. B. Freeman and I went over a part of this infra-red
spectrum again on Mount Wilson. We used three times as great
dispersion as in the old work at Washington. In the region from
0.76 to 1.8 microns we obtained about 1,300 lines where formerly we
found about 550. Dr. H. D. Babcock, of the Mount Wilson Observa-
tory, has done much photographic work covering a part of this upper

175
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

infra-red solar spectrum region. He finds that our old bolometric
work of 1900 deserved a good word as to the accuracy of the wave
lengths and as to the general reality of the lines found and that our
new work added to it some really useful detail.

Ficurn 2.—Simultaneous lowering of the sun’s radiation and of the temperature of
the earth’s northern hemisphere as observed in March, 1903

SOLAR-CONSTANT WORK BEGUN IN 1902

Doctor Langley was deeply interested in the value of the solar
constant of radiation, which is the measure of the intensity of the
sun’s rays as they are in free space at the earth’s mean solar distance.
178 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1931

Hence, in the year 1902, we began a solar-constant research destined
to be a very long one. At that time solar-constant values ranging
from 1.76 to 4.0 calories were given in standard textbooks.

Our earliest Washington work raised a question which has en-
grossed us for over 25 years. Our results of 1902, 1908, and 1904
seemed to indicate that the sun’s output of radiation decreased rather
suddenly in March, 1903, by about 10 per cent, and continued low
thereafter. We should certainly have attributed this to obscure
error if the temperature of the entire north temperate land area of
the world had not shown a decrease at the same time. We think now
that we were misled by an atmospheric turbidity caused by a vol-
canic eruption in southern Mexico. At all events, we began then to
suspect that the sun is a variable star and that its fluctuations pro-
duce important weather changes. I hope now, after more than 25
years of investigation, to present evidence to convince you that such
is really the case.

The determination of the solar constant of radiation involves two
principal parts. First, the exact measurement of the intensity of
solar radiation as received at the observing station; second, the exact
estimation of the loss which the rays suffer in traversing the atmos-
phere. The first requirement involves an accurate pyrheliometer.
The second requirement involves exact measurements of the atmos-
pheric transmission coefficients for all important solar spectrum rays.
Besides this, there must be estimates of the relative transmissibility
of the spectral rays in the optical apparatus, and of the atmospheric
transmission of those feeble parts of the solar spectrum lying in the
ultra-violet and the infra-red beyond the limits of the spectrum
region usually observed.

THE SILVER-DISK PYRHELIOMETER

When we began solar-constant work in 1902, the beautiful electrical
compensation pyrheliometer of Knut Angstrém was already avail-
able, though not fully perfected. Following, however, in Langley’s
path, we developed for our use the older form of pyrheliometer of
Pouillet and Tyndall. With us it became in 1910 the well-known
silver-disk pyrheliometer, of which the Smithsonian Institution has
since furnished more than 60 standardized copies at cost to solar-
radiation observers in all parts of the world.

The silver-disk pyrheliometer, though simple, effective, and ac-
curate, and capable of maintaining a constant scale of readings for
many years, is not an independent standard. Means are required
to reduce its scale to true calories per square centimeter per minute.
For this purpose we developed the standard water-flow and water-
SOLAR RADIATION—ABBOT 179

stir pyrheliometers. Our findings with these instruments are ex-
pressed as the so-called “Smithsonian Pyrheliometry of 1913,”
which has been accepted quite generally as the standard pyrhelio-
metric scale of the world. It differs by about 3 per cent from the
Angstrém scale. Experiments by independent methods are now in
progress in Germany to further establish the true pyrheliometric
scale.

THE STANDARD WATER-FLOW PYRHELIOMETER

In the standard water-flow pyrheliometer, the solar rays admitted
by a measured aperture are chiefly absorbed on a hollow blackened
metallic cone at the rear of a test-tube-shaped blackened metallic
chamber. A measured current of water continually removes the
heat produced on the cone and on the inner walls of the chamber.

A A, ray absorber; B B, vestibule; C, measured aperture; D, Ds, electrical thermometer ;
E F, entering and emerging water flow; G H, electrical test coils; K K, Dewar
vacuum flask

An electrical thermometer measures the rise of temperature thus
produced in the water current. For test purposes, known quantities
of heat may be introduced at the cone by measured electrical cur-
rents. The accuracy of the instrument, which is very satisfactory,
is measured by the equivalence of heat introduced and heat found.
The instrument is represented in Figure 3.

THE FUNDAMENTAL SOLAR-CONSTANT METHOD

The fundamental solar-constant method as worked out by Langley
involves determining the intensity of all parts of the solar spectrum
repeatedly on a day of unchanging clearness, so as to disclose the
increase of intensity of each spectral ray which occurs as the sun
mounts higher and higher. For a ray of homogeneous wave length,
the intensity is connected with the length of path in the atmosphere
by the exponential formula of Lambert and Bouguer :

e=e,a™; or log e=m log a+log e,

Here e is the observed intensity; e, that which would be observed outside
the atmosphere; a@ is the fraction transmitted with vertical sun; and m is the

many days at our excellent high-altitude stations in California, Chile, and

formula is the equation of the straight line. We find it satisfactorily exact on
South West Africa.
SOLAR RADIATION—ABBOT 181

Since the formula holds strictly only for rays of homogeneous
wave length, we require spectrum measurements. If from a series
of bolographs of the solar spectrum, in which the partial transmissi-
bility of the optical instruments has been allowed for, we determine
atmospheric transmission coefficients for about 40 selected wave
lengths between 0.34 and 2.5 microns, we can compute the intensity
which each of these rays would represent if observed outside the
atmosphere. This determines the sun’s spectrum energy curve as it
would be observed in free space. If we compute the area included
under the curve thus determined, and divide it by the area included
by the curve observed by the spectrobolometer, the quotient is the
factor by which we must multiply the total intensity of the solar
beam as measured by the pyrheliometer to give the intensity which
the pyrheliometer would have read if in free space. Correcting the
result to mean solar distance, we have the solar constant of radiation.

TRANSMISSIBILITY OF OPTICAL APPARATUS

As required for solar-constant determinations, we have made many
measurements of the relative transmissibility of our optical instru-
ments for the different spectral rays. Our procedure involves two
spectroscopes, of which the auxiliary one delivers its spectrum upon
the slit of the main one used for the bolographic work. Under these
circumstances, we measure with the bolometer the intensity of many
spectral rays both before and after they traverse the main spec-
troscope. Their relative transmissibility appears in the ratios of
these measurements.

WAVE-LENGTH DISTRIBUTION OF SOLAR RADIATION, AND THE SUN’S
EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE

Such determinations of transmission in the optical train, together
with the determinations of transmission in the atmosphere, enabled
us to represent and tabulate the distribution of energy in the solar
spectrum as it is outside our atmosphere. Our best results in this
line were published in 1923 in a paper entitled “ The distribution of
energy in the spectra of the sun and stars.”+ They have been of use
to other investigators for various purposes.

If we assume that the sun is approximately a perfect radiator, our
work on the solar constant yields three methods of estimating his
effective temperatures: First, from the spectral position of maximum
intensity. Second, from the general form of the curve of distribu-
tion of energy in the spectrum. Third, from the sun’s distance and
diameter combined with the value of the solar constant of radiation.
