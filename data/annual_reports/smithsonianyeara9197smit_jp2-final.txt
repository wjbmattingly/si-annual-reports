Smithsonian
Institution

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of
Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of
the will of James Smithson of England, who in
1826 bequeathed his property to the United
States of America ‘“‘to found at Washington, un-
der the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an
establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.”’ After receiving the
property and accepting the trust, Congress incor-
porated the Institution in an ‘‘establishment,”’
whose statutory members are the president, the
vice president, the chief justice, and the heads of
the executive departments, and vested responsi-
bility for administering the trust in the Smith-
sonian Board of Regents.

Statement by the
Secretary

Robert McC. Adams

The past year has been a challenging and reward-
ing one at the Smithsonian. Challenging, be-
cause the Smithsonian has not been immune
from the economic recession in the United States
and the uncertainty and political chaos around
the world. Rewarding, because, as our annual re-
port reveals, 1991 was a year of stunning pro-
grams—in particular, an array of Quincentenary
exhibitions, symposia, and public programs that
have fully addressed the responsibility of seeing
ourselves within the significance and grandeur of
a half-millennium and an entire hemisphere. No
less memorable have been other outstanding ex-
hibitions, publications, and research accomplish-
ments, highlighted herein. We can take pride in
these accomplishments and look forward with
confidence to many more such achievements in
the year to come.

This has also been a year in which the Smith-
sonian has continued to examine its role as one of
the country’s great unifying institutions. In my
travels in the United States and abroad, it is grati-
fying to discover in encounters with individuals in
cultural and scientific fields at many levels that
the Smithsonian is almost universally recognized
as a unique and marvelous example of an institu-
tion whose strength comes from the breadth and
depth of its active engagement in the “‘increase
and diffusion of knowledge,” the mission estab-
lished at the time of the Institution’s founding in
1846.

At the same time, we have been examining the
role of the Smithsonian as an educational organi-
zation, seeking to delineate the unique and man-
ifold ways in which the Institution’s many
components can help this nation achieve its edu-
cational goals. In this report, you will find nu-
merous examples of successful projects that may
serve as models for museums and research organi-
zations elsewhere in the country.

The activism of the role envisioned for us re-
minds us that we cannot isolate ourselves within
our monumental buildings along the National
Mall, content with the audiences, constituencies,
and disciplinary approaches that we already serve
and waiting for the storm of change around the
world to subside. Given the severity of the chal-
lenges this country faces, it would be irrespons-
ible for a public institution like the Smithsonian
to allow itself to become a bastion of exclusivity.

To meet our responsibilities to diverse audi-
ences, we must shift our thinking of museums as
establishments whose timeless, unquestioned au-
thority can be likened to that of a temple, toward
a status much closer to that of a forum—a place,
as Canadian museum director Duncan Cameron
has written, for ‘confrontation, experimenta-
tion, and debate.’’ This is not a transition that
has been warmly welcomed in all quarters. One
well-known dragon-slayer of populism in mu-
seums argues that a concern for reaching broader
audiences is virtually to be equated with
philistinism.

However, museums have a special relationship
with society, unlike most other institutions that
are also broadly devoted to the “increase and dif-
fusion of knowledge,” such as colleges and uni-
versities. Museum doors are open to all, without
concern for age or educational credentials. Exhi-
bitions are not the mere functional equivalents of
monographs or articles in scholarly journals. They
reach a much more diverse audience, parts of
which may strongly object to having subsidized
them. Usually, such exhibitions represent a pro-
portionately much larger investment of the par-
ent institution’s—in most cases also the |
public’s—resources. In any case, their contents
and location make a close identification with the
institution inescapable. Accordingly, while mu- |
seums must be no less zealous than universities in
protecting the right of free expression of their
staffs, the contents of at least major exhibitions
need to be recognized not merely as the private
statements of their designers but also as institu-
tional statements.

The main challenge before the Smithsonian
and all museums today is to find ways to address
themselves to the increasing diversity, and, at the
same time, the growing interdependence and
yulnerability, of social life everywhere. Museums
need to see themselves, and to be publicly recog-
nized, as important institutional means by which
every group, but especially underserved minor-
ities, can define and maintain their place within
complex, dynamic circumstances that seem to
hold all of the risks as well as the promises of our
American heritage.

The annual total of museum visitors in this
country is impressively large; reportedly, it even
exceeds the total number of those who attend all
professional sporting events. But it is also a
highly skewed sample of our population—in a
word, preponderantly white, middle class, and
college educated. Minority participation is dis-
couragingly limited. We are unlikely to be more
successful in attracting underserved groups until
we recognize our own limitations in conceptualiz-
ing, as well as implementing, programming on
their behalf.

Museums will fail to meet their responsibility
to pioneer in presenting new and diverse visions
and challenges if they are unprepared to risk oc-
casional criticism and controversy. We can and
must continue to seek wider audiences, taking a
frankly tolerant and experimental approach to
traditional standards and canons as we do so in
some exhibitions, while at the same time respect-
ing and embodying those traditions in much of
what is presented to the public in other exhibi-
tions. I would, without hesitation, count on our
public quickly to recognize and respect the need
for a balance of these two approaches.

As a further step, museums can and should
move beyond their prevailing stance in exhibi-
tions of authoritative anonymity. Where conten-
tious views are important to an exhibition, they
should be put forward. Our public is entitled,
however, to have their controversial nature made
plain, and to have them attributed to the particu-
lar scholar or curator responsible for them. The
place to search for balance, in a word, is not in
the blandness of a particular exhibition but in the
full range of a museum’s public offerings.

Museums can—and the Smithsonian must—
play a unique and increasingly vital part in learn-

ing about and finding ways to communicate and
represent the pluralism that has always deeply
characterized this country, as well as the increas-
ingly multifaceted and problematical character of
cultural knowledge itself. Yet in both efforts,
ours is also a responsibility to hold high the corre-
sponding vision of e pluribus unum. These are
indeed central challenges concerning our rela-
tionship to the public that we must meet as we
seek to prepare this great institution for the 21st
century.

I believe the Smithsonian will meet these chal-
lenges, because its highly dedicated staff will be

working together toward a common goal—that of

serving all of our public. For some time, we have
had an informal slogan, ‘‘The Smithsonian is for
everyone.’’ I believe we are indeed making the
Smithsonian a place where everyone can and does
feel welcome.

As you read through this annual review of the
Smithsonian’s achievements, I invite you to pon-
der these challenges and join with us in reaching
these goals.

Report
of the Board
of Regents

This brief annual report of the Board of Regents
reviews its governance of the Smithsonian
through three meetings in 1991 (February 4, May
6, and September 16) and through a host of other
activities. The report covers key issues addressed
during the year, significant issues discussed at
specific meetings, and actions that the regents
took with respect to the Institution’s boards and
commissions. These achievements would not
have been possible without the contributions of
its standing committees—the Executive Commit-
tee, the Audit and Review Committee, the Nom-
inating Committee, the Investment Policy
Committee, and the Personnel Committee—
whose membership includes a dedicated cadre of
regents, regents emeritus, and others who gave
unstintingly of their time and expertise through-
out the year.

In 1991, the Board of Regents resolved to move
forward with the proposed establishment of a
national African American museum within the
Smithsonian, to be housed in the Arts and Indus-
tries Building. Assured by a study into the matter
that ample collections are available to and seem
promising for such a museum, the regents agreed
to seek the appropriate legislation in the coming
year. The regents also reached a new understand-
ing of the needs for the proposed extension of the
National Air and Space Museum and asked con-
gressional members of the board to support legis-
lation for planning such a facility at Washington
Dulles International Airport. Responding to the
increasing demand for more light-industrial,
warehouse, and special-purpose space for the
Smithsonian, the board encouraged Secretary
Robert McC. Adams to seek authorization and fi-
nancing arrangements for the construction of a

new administrative service center near the Na-
tional Mall.

The regents undertook several important ini-
tiatives with respect to programs in the sciences.
They held extensive discussions about the Smith-
sonian’s role in global change research and asked
the secretary to continue planning toward the es-
tablishment of an appropriate National Center
for Biological Diversity within the Institution in
the coming year. The regents authorized the sec-
retary to conclude an agreement with Princeton
University, the National Museums of Kenya, the
Kenya Wildlife Services, and other parties for the
establishment of an interdisciplinary research and
training program in ecology, evolution, geology,
and natural resource management at George
Small’s Mpala Ranch in Kenya. And as the re-
gents grappled with the difficult questions posed
by the Institution’s indemnification of a re-
searcher whose activities overseas became the sub-
ject of a potential indictment, the staff
promulgated a number of procedural improve-
ments intended to minimize the Smithsonian’s
risks in carrying out its multifaceted international
scholarly activities.

The regents discussed at length questions
posed hypothetically about the possibility of the
Institution establishing bases for its public activ-
ities throughout the nation at some point in the
next century. They expressed particular interest in
knowing what the implications of those questions
might be for the integrity of the national collec-
tions and in exploring information technologies
that could provide true intellectual accessibility
without requiring physical dispersion of collec-
tions material, programs, and administration.
The staff agreed to complete an inventory of its
geographically dispersed activities and to under-
take related studies.

At their meeting on February 4, 1991, the re-
gents welcomed I. Michael Heyman as a new
member of the board. The board also named fa-
cilities at Cooper-Hewitt, National Museum of
Design, and at the Freer Gallery of Art for the
generous contributions of Arthur Ross and Agnes
and Eugene Meyer, respectively, and adopted a
policy for the protection of the watershed envi-
rons of the Smithsonian Environmental Research
Center in Edgewater, Maryland. As voted by the
board, the chancellor presented Henry Medals to
John F. Jameson and Joseph J. Bonsignore at the
regents’ dinner on February 3 in recognition of
their outstanding services to the Institution.

On May 6, 1991, the regents held the Silvio O.
Conte Memorial Meeting in honor of the late re-
gent and member of Congress, to whom they

|
made a formal tribute. Among a variety of other
actions, the regents authorized the secretary and
the director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory to negotiate with the University of
Hawaii for sites for the proposed array of sub-
millimeter telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawai.

At their final meeting of the year on Septem-
ber 16, the regents designated Barnabas McHenry
as a regent emeritus, nominated Hanna H. Gray
for membership on the board, thanked Gay F.
Wray for her service as chairman of the Smith-
sonian Associates National Board, welcomed
Lloyd G. Schermer as her successor, and voted to
award the Henry Medal to Neil Harris in recogni-
tion of his achievements as chairman of the
Smithsonian Council. The board held an exten-
sive discussion of the financial condition of the
Institution, approved the expenditure of funds
for fiscal 1992, and endorsed the Institution’s re-
quest to the Office of Management and Budget
for 1993 appropriations. The regents also held a
preliminary discussion about the Smithsonian’s
role in presenting balanced perspectives in con-
temporary society and decided to hold a more
lengthy dialogue on such matters at their first
meeting in 1992.

Throughout the year, the regents made key ap-
pointments to several Smithsonian boards and
commissions. They appointed Xuan-Chi Diep,
John S. Hendricks, Donald Simmons, David
Hicks, Jean Lane, and John C. Meeker to the Na-
tional Council of the National Museum of Natu-
ral History; Charles B. Benenson, John Conyers,
Jr., Helen Kuhn, Robert Farris Thompson, and
Walter E. Washington to the National Museum of
African Art Commission; Wanda M. Corn, Nan
Tucker McEvoy, Edwin I. Colodny, Ann Cousins,
and Frank Ribelin to the National Museum of
American Art Commission; and Allen V. Pink-
ham, Harold Dean Salway, and Tom L.
Freudenheim to the National Museum of the
American Indian Board of Trustees. In addition,
the Board of Regents renamed the Cooper-Hewitt
Advisory Council the Cooper-Hewitt Board of
Trustees to reflect the group’s full responsibilities
and obligations.

Staff Changes

Fiscal 1991 brought considerable turnover in man-
agement staff. Toward the beginning of the year,
the Institution was pleased to bring on as under
secretary Carmen E. Turner, the highly respected
former general manager of the Washington Met-
ropolitan Area Transit Authority. At the same

time, Nancy D. Suttenfield, who had served so
successfully as director of the Office of Planning
and Budget and acting under secretary, was ap-
pointed to the new position of assistant secretary
for finance and administration. John F. Jameson,
the Institution’s first assistant secretary for ad-
ministration, was appointed senior adviser to the
secretary. James C. Early, formerly deputy assis-
tant secretary for public service and then acting
assistant secretary, was named assistant secretary
for public service.

In the fall, Ann R. Leven, treasurer since 1984,
resigned to accept a related position with the Na-
tional Gallery of Art. Tom McCance left his posi-
tion as director of membership and development
for a similar position at the Folger Shakespeare
Library. After some study and reorganization,
Marie Mattson, who had served as special assistant
to the secretary, was appointed director of devel-
opment. Kathy A. Boi was promoted from within
the secretary’s office to the position of special
assistant.

This winter, one of Smithsonian’s most be-
loved colleagues, Joseph J. Bonsignore, publisher
of Smithsonian magazine, tetired after 21 years of
service. The very able Ronald C. Walker, formerly
with Lane Publishing, was named his successor.
Claudine K. Brown, project manager for the Afri-
can American Institutional Study, was appointed
deputy assistant secretary for museums. Rick R.
Johnson, formerly of the Treasurer’s Office, was
appointed deputy assistant secretary for finance,
and D. J. (Jack) Hall from the Department of the
Army was appointed deputy assistant secretary for
administration. Steven C. Newsome of the Office
of Cultural and Education Services, Maryland De-
partment of Housing and Community Develop-
ment, joined the Smithsonian staff as director of
the Anacostia Museum in the early spring, fol-
lowing a long search and the outstanding contri-
butions of James E. Mayo and Sharon A.
Reinckens as acting codirectors.

The year’s greatest tragedy for Smithsonian
management came with the sudden passing of
Colonel Robert B. Burke, director of the Office of
Protection Services since 1973. Bob Burke’s exper-
tise in museum security was internationally ac-
claimed, but nowhere will he be missed more
than at the Smithsonian, where he was a trusted
friend to all staff.

As mentioned in this column year after year,
the Smithsonian’s greatest strength lies in the
dedication of its staff. The Institution and its
constituencies owe them a great debt for their all
too often unheralded contributions.

year for a variety of outdoor events that at-
tracted thousands of participants from the

The museum will continue to offer varied
programs like these as part of its mission to

Archives of
American Art

Painter Sam Gilliam, shown hete in his stu-
dio in 1972, donated a substantial collection
of papers to the Archives of American Art
this year. They document Gilliam’s commit-
ment to abstract art and his swift rise to
prominence in the art world. Born in Tupelo,
Mississippi, in 1933, Gilliam grew up in
Louisville, Kentucky, and studied art at the
University of Louisville. He settled in Wash-
ington, D.C., in 1962. In the mid-1960s he
developed a distinct style of pouring and ma-
nipulating paint. These early experiments
with color led to his exploration of large-scale
work, suspended canvases, and outdoor
paintings.

Gilliam’s papers include letters from col-
lectors, curators, dealers, and artists, as well
as photographs, scrapbooks, sketchbooks,
and business files from 1966 to 1989. To com-
plement the papers, Washington art critic
Benjamin Forgey interviewed the artist for
the Archives oral history program. The three-
hour interview covers his early years, exhibi-
tions, grants, stylistic development, and
teaching and working methods.
Arthur M. Sackler
Gallery

4

As part of the summer-long exhibition
“Court Arts of Indonesia” at the Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery, the public was treated to free
performances of wayang ku/it, the traditional
shadow puppet theater of Java, Indonesia’s
most populous island. The presence of a liv-
ing performing arts tradition within the exhi-
bition reflected the central position of
puppet drama, music, and dance in Indone-
sian court culture. Directing the perfor-
mances was da/ang (puppeteer) Widiyanto S.
Putro, an 1th-generation puppet master who
currently lectures in the Department of Mu-
sic at the University of California, Berkeley.
Widiyanto, shown above, was backed by a

1o-member game/an orchestra from the town
of Wonogiri in Central Java.

In Indonesia, the da/ang is revered because
he has the power of the word. During a per-
formance, he must impersonate dozens of
characters and be intimately familiar with
every detail of his story. He must speak flu-
ently in high, middle, and low Javanese, as
well as in Kawi, the language of poetry, for
the da/ang sets a standard for correct pronun-
ciation and proper language use.

The da/ang’s traditional repertoire in-
cludes several hundred shadow plays, based
chiefly on two ancient Indian epics, the Ma-
habharata and the Ramayana, and on Indo-
nesian tales such as the Panji stories. In
Indonesia, the plays go on all night, but at
the Sackler Gallery, they were shortened to
two hours. (Photograph by Jeffrey Crespi and

Cooper-Hewitt,
National Museum of
Design

This past summer at Cooper-Hewitt, Na-

tional Museum of Design, a group of New
York City junior high school students trans-
formed plastic piping, garden hose, and
polyester rope into a colorful 36-foot model
of a suspension bridge. In the process of
building and landscaping the bridge, these
young people learned to understand and use

design, construction, and engineering princi-

ples—knowledge that can change the way
they interact with the world around them.
Dianne H. Pilgrim, director of Cooper-
Hewitt, says of the project: ‘‘Presenting
young people with opportunities to evaluate
how things work, the way they look, and the

effect they have on the quality of our lives is
central to the museum’s commitment to de-
sign education and the future. The bridge in

Susan Rothenberg’s painting [X7, which was
included in the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden’s roth anniversary exhibi-
tion, ‘‘Content: A Contemporary Focus
1974-1984,’’ is the first painting by the artist
to enter the permanent collection. During
the mid-1970s, Rothenberg developed a
series of monumental paintings based on
simple equine imagery juxtaposed with se-
vere geometric elements. This series, of
which IX is a fine example, marked a shift
from an austere to a more expressive figura-
tive imagery that characterized the art of the
1980s.

National Air and
Space Museum

As far as we know, the Earth is unique in the
Solar System as an abode of life. Vast and
sometimes violent natural forces shape the
environment, and with long experience hu-
mans have learned to cope with their effects.
The life-sustaining air and waters of our
planet once seemed virtually limitless and
impervious to the effects of human activity,
but that perception is changing. Human
forces are altering the Earth in unprece-
dented, unintended, and unpredictable
ways, and we have little experience to guide
s we try to comprehend their impact.
The natural and human forces that alter
our environment are the theme of B/ue
Planet, a \arge-format IMAX motion picture
introduced this year at the National Air and
Space Museum. The film looks at the Earth
from the ground and from orbit; this view
from 330 miles in sp nows the planet’s
surface to be largely covered by water; islands

of the Caribbean appear near the top of the
photograph. B/we Planet was produced by
the museum and the IMAX Systems Corpo-
ration with support from the Lockheed Cor-
poration and with the cooperation of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion. It features breathtaking footage taken
by U.S. space shuttle astronauts during five
ons, including orbital views of tropical
rainforests, deserts, tectonic fault zones, elec-
trical storms, hurricanes, and volcanoes. It
also examines the “‘greenhouse”’ effect, air
and water pollution, soil erosion, the burn-
ing of tropical forests, and the concomitant
mass extinction of species. B/ue Planet con-
cludes on a hopeful note: that it is in our
power to repair some of the damage we have
done to the environment. (Photograph by

National Museum of
African Art

The acquisition of an extraordinary Baga fig-
ure of a kneeling woman supporting a drum
on her head was a highlight of the past year
at the National Museum of African Art. The
drum is on view in the museum’s Permanent
Collection.

The polychromed sculpture is from the Re-
public of Guinea in West Africa. The Baga
peoples of Guinea are famous for their mon-
umental caryatid drums. This figure was pur-
chased with funds provided by the
Smithsonian Collections Acquisition Pro-
gram and gifts of the Annie Laurie Aitken
Charitable Trust, the Frances and Benjamin
Benenson Foundation, David C. Driskell,
Evelyn A. J. Hall Charitable Trust, Mr. and
Mrs. Robert H. Nooter, Barry and Beverly
Pierce, Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Silver, and Mr.
and Mrs. Michael R. Sonnenreich.

The National Museum of African Art’s
Permanent Collection includes works of art
from numerous visual traditions from the
Western Sudan, the Guinea Coast, and Cen-
tral, Eastern, and Southern Africa. Since
1979, when the Museum of African Art be-
came part of the Smithsonian Institution, the
museum has engaged in an intensive effort to
acquire works of outstanding aesthetic qual-
ity. The Permanent Collection is the founda-
uion for exhibitions and programs, research,
and publications.

National Museum of
American Art

The National Museum of American Art’s
landmark exhibition and catalogue, ‘‘The
West as America: Reinterpreting Images of
the Frontier,”’ included 160 images showing
how artists frequently revised an often ques-
tionable record of frontier conquest to corre-
spond to a national optimism favoring

westward expansion. The exhibition drew

unprecedented national media and public at-
tention, and visitors filled four gallery com-
ment books with personal views and reactions
to the issue of national identity. To amplify
all the exhibition’s themes, the museum held
20 public programs.

Among the artists’ subjects were Native
Americans, who were depicted in ways that
portrayed changing white attitudes toward
these people as conflicts over land became in-
creasingly intense. In his painting Pzgeon’s
Egg Head (The Light) Going to and Retur-
ning from Washington (1837-39), George

Catlin showed how an Indian negotiating for
his tribe became ‘‘corrupted”’ by civilization,
suggesting that native cultures could never
coexist with Euro-American societies.

In its inaugural season of free concerts at the
National Museum of American History, the
Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra
helped bring to the public the rich heritage
of yazz— America’s own classical music. Re-
nowned jazz composers, scholars, and educa-
tors David N. Baker (pictured here) and
Gunther Schuller conducted the season

finale

The orchestra—the only jazz orchestra resi-

dent in an American museum—is made pos-
sible by a congressional appropriation for the
study and performance of jazz at the mu-
seum that began in 1987, when Congress de-
clared jazz ‘‘a rare and valuable national
American treasure’ and called upon the na-

tion and the government to ‘‘make certain it

is preserved, understood, and promulgated.”

Congressional funds first enabled the mu-
seum to acquire the Duke Ellington Collec-

tion of more than 2 pages of music,

photographs, scrapbook clippings, record-
ings, and artifacts. Congress also helped sup-
port Jazz Masterworks Editions, a series of
performance and study editions of works re-
corded by well-known composers and ar-
rangers that has been launched by the
Smithsonian Institution and Oberlin
College

The 1991 season of the Smithsonian Jazz
Masterworks Orchestra included 19 perfor-
mances of historically authentic music by
Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford,
Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Sy
Oliver, and others, conducted by Schuller
and Baker. All the concerts were taped for
later radio broadcast. (Photograph by Eric

National Museum of
the American Indian

In preparation for the 1994 opening of the
George Gustav Heye Center in New York
City, the National Museum of the American
Indian (NMAI) is engaged in an innovative
process that is testing and extending tradi-
tional notions of what museums are and how
they function. The museum is committed to
involving the Native American community as
a partner in every aspect of its development
and operations while creating and experi-
menting with new ways of carrying out the
fundamental responsibilities of a museum.
This commitment has been evident in the
development of the museum’s important
premier exhibition, ‘‘Points of View.”’ This

year, 30 Native American people from North

and South America who represent diverse
disciplines, geographic regions, and view-
points spent a week reviewing NMAI hold-
ings and selecting objects that will form the
centerpiece of the exhibition. Unlike tradi-
tional exhibitions, this one has had no tre-
strictions imposed on the content or the
interpretive material. The museum's curators
and collections specialists worked closely with
the selectors to document their comments
about the artifacts they chose for presenta-
tion in the exhibition.

This dialogue between Native American
people and the museum will continue as
“Points of View’’ enters the design phase.
Through Native American involvement in
NMAI programs and projects, the Smith-
sonian expects to provide the nation with a
more accurate and relevant experience of Na-
tive American culture. (Photograph by Karen

Don Tenoso (Hunkpapa Lakota), an enrolled
member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Nation
in South Dakota and a graduate of the Insti-
tute of American Indian Arts, Santa Fe, New
Mexico, is the award-winning doll maker and
storyteller who inaugurated the National Mu-
seum of Natural History’s Native American
Artist-in-Residence Program in March 1991
During his residency, Tenoso created several
dolls in a special area in the museum that was
set up exactly like his home studio. On week-
days, he visited schools in the Washington,
D.C., area, seeking out classes with Native
American students in particular. This popu-
lar program, organized and conducted by Al-
eta Ringlero (Salt River Pima) of the
museum's Office of Education, is an out-
growth of ongoing weekend programming
that features live demonstrators selected in
consultation with Native American commu-
nities from throughout the country

This 24-inch faceless doll, which Tenoso
affectionately calls ‘‘Bubba One-Wing,”’ rep-
resents a contemporary ‘‘old style’’ Lakota
fancy dancer. It was commissioned especially
by the museum and created in the traditional
Lakota style by Tenoso while in residence
Every part of the carefully handcrafted doll
has significance for its maker, from the ‘‘avia-
tor’ sunglasses, to the tiny beaded moc-
casins, to the tattoos from Indian boarding
school on its hand and from the U.S. Cavalry
on its arm. The feathers of the endangered
golden eagle used to create the bustle worn
by the doll were obtained from the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service and come from illegally
killed birds that had been seized. (Photo-

The dignity and quiet courage of the woman
who is often called the ‘Mother of the Civil
Rights Movement”’ are embodied in a bronze
bust of Rosa L. Parks that was unveiled Feb-
ruary 28, rg9gr, in ceremonies at the National
Portrait Gallery. In commemoration of the
event, Washington, D.C., Mayor Sharon
Pratt Kelly presented the renowned civil
rights leader with a key to the city.

Rosa Parks’s refusal to give up her seat on a
Montgomery, Alabama, bus to a white pas-
senger in 1955 led to a year-long boycott that
sparked a national movement for racial jus-
tice. The sculpture, by Artis Lane, was a gift
to the gallery from Anheuser-Busch Com-
panies and was presented by Wayman F.
Smith, III, vice-president of corporate affairs

Others who joined in the tribute at the cer-
emony were actress Cicely Tyson, civil rights

leader Coretta Scott King, Smithsonian Un-
der Secretary Carmen Turner, Dorothy
Height, president of the National Council of
Negro Women, and Joseph Lowery, president
of the Southern Christian Leadership Confer-

National Science
Resources Center

Science is a gateway to understanding the
natural world. Children learn science best
when they are engaged in their own hands-
on investigations of scientific phenomena
Hands-on experiences also are the best way to
spark the enthusiasm of young learners

To give children access to an effective,
hands-on elementary science program, the
National Science Resources Center has initi-
ated Science and Technology for Children
(STC), a project that is developing 24 in-
quiry-centered teaching units for grades one
through six that will teach children impor-
tant science concepts and problem-solving
skills.

This year marked the completion and pub-
lication of the first three STC units: Plant
Growth and Development (grade three),
Electric Circuits (grade four), and Micro-
worlds (grades five and six). Each unit con-
sists of a teacher’s guide, a set of student

activity books, and a complete kit of science

24

equipment and materials for a class of 30 stu-

dents. Three more units were to be available
in the fall. Each unit is trial-taught in Wash-
ington, D.C., public schools, field-tested in
schools across the nation, and reviewed by a

panel of prominent scientists and educators

before publication.

Park

This male gorilla, born at the National Zoo
on May 10, 1991, represents the success of the
Zoo's strategy to ensure the survival of this
endangered species. He is the fifth gorilla
born at the Zoo, the first since 1972. Zoos
have had gorillas for about 100 years, but the
first birth occurred only in 1956, and births
did not begin to exceed deaths until the
1960s. Then National Zoo primatologists
showed that most of the reproductively suc-
cessful gorillas had been raised by their
mothers in social groups, while most of those
that did not breed had been raised by well-
meaning humans in zoo nurseries.

Five years ago, a gorilla family was estab-
lished at NZP in an effort to create a social
structure similar to that of a gorilla group in
the wild. Eventually, two of the gorillas—the
baby’s mother, Mandara, born at the Mil-
waukee Zoo, and Gus, a maturing male from
Boston—began to mate. Zoo endocrinolo-
gists traced Manadara’s sexual maturity, her
monthly cycles, and finally her pregnancy.
Mandara is an excellent mother who breaks
the cycle of nursery-induced incompetence.

The baby is helping zoo visitors under-
stand the importance of preserving biodiver-
sity. Moreover, zoo research and management
skills are flowing back to Africa in a coopera-
tive effort to benefit wild gorillas. Gorillas
caught in hunters’ snares can now be safely
immobilized with drugs that were pioneered
by zoo veterinarians to move gorillas like
Mandara and Gus between zoos to foster re-
production. (Photograph by Jessie Cohen)

Observatory

During the July 11, 1991, total solar eclipse,
two Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
(SAO) experiments made unique and com-
plementary images of the Sun’s hot outer at-
AO-

ands

mosphere, or corona. In the first, an S
IBM telescope launched from White S
Missile Range, New Mexico, captured the
broiling corona over the Sun’s unobscured
surface in this extremely high-resolution
X-ray photograph. (Because the eclipse had
not yet begun over New Mexico, the dark sil-
houette of the approaching Moon can be
seen at the right of the photograph. ) Simul-
taneously, but thousands of miles away on
Mauna Kea, Hawaii, where totality was al-
ready under way and the Sun was fully oc-
culted, a second Smithsonian team made

images of its corona, among the first

ever obtained in this wavelength (inset)

Data fr he two images, combined with
information gathered in other wavelengths,
will be used to create a detailed three-dimen-
sional model of the solar corona linking den-
sity and temperature variations seen over the
Sun’s surface with structural features ob-
served in its extended atmosphere. (X-ray

[he blue crab is perhaps the most celebrated
inhabitant of the Chesapeake Bay, but its
free-ranging behavior is difficult to observe
in the bay’s murky waters. Using a pioneer-
ing technology, scientists at the Smithsonian
Environmental Research Center in Edgewa-
ter, Maryland, can listen to the crabs around
the clock to learn about blue crab ecology
Dr. Anson Hines and his research associates
strap small, battery-powered ultrasonic trans-
mutters to the hard backs of the crabs. The
transmitters are programmed to emit various
frequencies of ‘‘beeps’’ that can be heard
with underwater hydrophones by scientists
patrolling in small boats

From the sounds they hear, Dr. Hines and
his associates are investigating the blue crab’s
feeding habits. During the past three years,
they have recorded the daily movements of
blue crabs in the tidal waters, the time of day
that feeding most often occurs, and the
crabs’ ability to select areas that contain high
numbers of clams and other bottom-dwelling
organisms, which crabs prefer to eat. Crabs
sometimes travel thousands of yards in one
day. The transmitters tell scientists which
crab is beeping and where it is located. Then,
using a transmitter wired to a crab’s jaw mus-
cles in order to detect movement, feeding ep-
isodes or ‘‘bouts’’ can be monitored because
crabs only use their jaw muscles when feed-
ing. Studies often continue day and night to
determine whether movement and feeding
are correlated with time of day. (Photograph

A belt of unparalleled but threatened natural
diversity extends across the center of North
America from the Gulf Coast to the Pacific
Slope. The area that bridges the United
States and Mexico, linking the temperate
world and the tropics, contains a rich selec-
tion of flora and fauna living in a range of
habitats—from grasslands to deserts to
mountain islands.

One hundred years after the last scientific
surveys of the region, award-winning wildlife
photographer Tupper Ansel Blake has em-
barked on a three-year survey of the 1,936-
mile border between the United States and
Mexico. Blake’s stunning color photographs
serve as the centerpiece and departure point
of “Borderlands: A Natural History of the
Mexican-American Boundary,” an exhibition

that examines the wondrous and complex
natural environment of the region and ex-
plores the social, historical, and cultural
changes that have shaped both its land and
its people. In this photograph, Blake cap-
tures a summer rain storm in Sierra del Car-
men, Coahuila, Mexico.

Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute

The upper canopy of the tropical forest repre-

sents one of the great gaps in our under-
standing of life on Earth. This habitat,
although it may be the most biologically di-
verse of all, has remained almost unknown
because it has been so difficult and dan-
gerous to reach. The Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute (STRI) is developing a new
Canopy Access System that will allow re-
searchers to study the canopy environment
with unprecedented ease and safety. This
tower construction crane, 100 feet tall and
with a 115-foot boom, has been deployed in
Metropolitan Park near Panama City. The re-
search gondola carries scientists and their

equipment, offering reliable access in three
dimensions to almost an acte of dry tropical

forest. STRI plans eventually to install a
much larger version of this prototype system,
with a range of 5 acres, at a permanent site at
its Barro Colorado Island field station.

During the past year, STRI scientists, col-
leagues, and students have carried out a wide
range of studies that will provide a better un-
derstanding of how tropical forests work. In
one study, researchers found that canopy tree
species differ sharply in their physiological re-
sponses to light, temperature, and humidity,
giving insight into how so many apparently
similar tree species manage to coexist in trop-
ical forests. Planned research on the physi-
ological effects of elevated levels of carbon
dioxide on trees will help predict how pro-
cesses of global change will affect tropical for-
ests. (Photographs by Carl C. Hansen)

Since its inception, the Smithsonian Institution
has nourished a commitment to scholarly research
through programs characterized by breadth,
depth, and outreach. The Institution is well
known for studies that benefit the entire scholarly
community, from long-term baseline monitoring
of ultraviolet radiation on the Earth to invento-
ries of American painting and sculpture. Research
is carried out worldwide by scholars at the Smith-
sonian’s specialized institutes and museums.

@ The Institution again devoted attention to
global environmental research and to under-
standing the structure and composition of natural

@ Fundamental research continues by the Institu-
tion’s systematic biologists, on whose shoulders
rests the responsibility for inventorying and de-
scribing the species richness of the biosphere, as
well as monitoring the effects of deforestation on
species diversity.

@ Smithsonian researchers also examined the na-

(SAO) is dedicated to discovering and under-
standing the physical processes governing the na-
ture and evolution of the universe. As a member
of the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) based in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, SAO, in collabora-
tion with the Harvard College Observatory, pur-
sues a diverse program of research in the
following disciplines: atomic and molecular
physics, high-energy astrophysics, optical and in-
frared astronomy, planetary sciences, radio and
geoastronomy, solar and stellar physics, and theo-
retical astrophysics. Facilities include the Fred
Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Ari-
zona, the Oak Ridge Observatory in Massa-
chusetts, and a millimeter-wave radio astronomy

installation at CfA headquarters, as well as in-
struments aboard satellites, rockets, and bal-
loons. Research results are disseminated through
professional journals and presentations and
through publications and lectures for the public.
Educational efforts include an innovative curricu-
lum program for secondary school science.

g Recognizing SAO’s leadership in astronomy,
astrophysics, and geophysics, the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration selected the
observatory to plan, develop, and operate the in-
ternational science center, which will receive, an-
alyze, and store data from the Advanced X-Ray
Astrophysics Facility (AX AF).

g An independent review committee approved
the design and program of research planned for
SAO’s unique array of submillimeter telescopes
and recommended that negotiations begin to
place the instrument on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

g The extremely powerful signal of an interstellar
maser, representing the second strongest emission
line ever seen at microwave frequencies, was de-
tected from methanol molecules by an SAO sci-
entist using the 140-foot radio antenna at Green
Bank, West Virginia. The discovery has important
implications for radio astronomy studies of newly
formed stars.

w A rocket-borne X-ray telescope developed by
SAO and IBM obtained remarkably detailed im-
ages of the Sun on July 11, 1991, the day of the to-
tal solar eclipse. These images will be used to
produce the first three-dimensional model of the
solar corona linking density and temperature vari-
ations with structure in the extended atmosphere.
A second, ground-based SAO experiment yielded

the first such infrared images of the corona.

g A high-resolution imaging instrument built by ,
SAO for the ROSAT satellite made detailed ob-
servations of X-ray objects selected after the satel-
lite’s initial six-month all-sky survey. Striking
images of the Andromeda Galaxy suggest that
X-ray sources may be highly variable, since many
seen a decade earlier have disappeared and other
new sources now glow brightly.

w@ SAO continued development of a submillime-
ter wavelength telescope array and the conversion
of the Multiple Mirror Telescope to a single-mir-
ror instrument 6.5 meters in diameter. A new 48-
inch telescope, designed for stellar and extra-
galactic astronomy, was put into operation at the
Whipple Observatory. A second, 11-meter-diame-
ter, gamma-ray detector at FLWO saw its ‘‘first
light’’ on September 13, 1991.

Smithsonian Environmental
Research Center

Scientists at the Smithsonian Environmental Re-
search Center (SERC) in Edgewater, Maryland,
conduct long-term interdisciplinary studies on
how human use of the air, land, and water affect
the Chesapeake Bay region. The center comple-
ments research activities with educational pro-
grams for students—from undergraduates to
postdoctoral fellows—and for the public. SERC’s
research is the primary contribution on the Ches-
apeake region to the United States Interagency
Global Change Program and an important com-
ponent of the International Geosphere/ Biosphere
Program.

mw AU‘S. Department of Energy—funded project
studied the effects on tidal marshes of atmo-
spheric carbon dioxide concentrations elevated to
the level expected in the next century. The effects
included increased methane emissions, reduced
respiration rates, and reduced insect grazing.

@ With National Science Foundation suppott, re-
searchers at SERC are testing the hypothesis that
forests adjacent to bodies of water can convert a
large proportion of the nitrogen they receive in
agricultural runoff to gaseous forms, thereby pro-
tecting downstream ecosystems from nitrogen
pollution. The release of gases—including ni-
trous oxide, which contributes to the global
greenhouse effect and the destruction of strato-
spheric ozone—from the forest soil is measured
using an infrared laser system.

g The SERC Solar Radiation Laboratory ran a se-
ries of experiments designed to measure sepa-
rately the amount of ultraviolet-B radiation that
reaches the surface of the Earth directly in the
beam of the Sun and the amount that reaches the
surface after it has been dispersed by the
atmosphere.

w SERC is developing improved methods of mea-
suring how forests exchange heat and moisture
with the atmosphere. Researchers successfully
tested a new system employing temperature- and
humidity-sensing devices coupled with a high-
speed computer to take measurements 10 times a
second and operate a micrometeorological model
in real time.

w A mathematical model of sunlight penetration
in estuarine waters is being used to predict the
water conditions necessary for the survival of sea-
grasses in Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Results
from the Rhode River indicate that the reduction
of suspended sediment concentrations is a critical
factor in achieving the necessary water clarity.

@ Dr. Shoichi Kawano, an internationally known
plant ecologist who is professor of botany and di-
rector of the herbarium at Kyoto University, Ja-
pan, was named the first Regents Fellow at SERC.

Smithsonian Institution Archives

The Smithsonian Institution Archives (SIA) pre-
serves and provides access to records of the Insti-
tution’s proceedings and its accomplishments.
SIA ensures systematic and comprehensive histor-
ical accountability for the Institution’s national
trust by accommodating and managing a con-
stantly increasing volume and an ever-changing
technological variety of records and historical doc-
umentation. The Archives not only supports re-
- search, management, planning, exhibitions, and
other Smithsonian activities, but also responds to
public inquiries and advises archival programs
within and outside the Institution.

Smithsonian Institution Libraries

The Smithsonian Institution Libraries (SIL) sup-
ports the Institution’s curatorial, research, pub-
lishing, education, and public service activities by
providing reference and information services and
by building, organizing, managing, preserving,
and restoring its collections. SIL collections, ac-
cessible through an on-line catalogue and avail-
able to Smithsonian staff and outside scholars
through a system of 16 branch libraries and
through interlibrary loan, number some 1.1 mil-
lion books, 15,000 current journals, 40,000 rare
books, and 1,800 manuscript groups.

@ Two educational efforts initiated by the Li-
braries were awarded funding. The first program,
the SIL/ Dibner Library Resident Scholar Pro-
gram, provides short-term study grants for re-
search in the history of science and technology
and will award stipends funded by the Dibner

Fund to two scholars in late 1991. The second pro-

gram, a symposium and an exhibition about

world’s fairs from 1850 to 1940 based on SIL’s pre-

eminent collection of world’s fairs materials, re-
ceived support from the Smithsonian Special
Exhibition Fund.

@ SIL opened its first public exhibition gallery
adjacent to the Dibner Library in the National
Museum ef American History. The gallery’s first
two exhibitions were ‘“Turning Over Old Leaves:
A Sampler of Writings in the Smithsonian Insti-
tution Libraries’’ and ‘‘Nusantara: Lands and
People of Indonesia.”’

@ Director Barbara J. Smith began a develop-
ment program for the Libraries by inaugurating
an honorary and memorial gifts program that is
publicized in the brochure ‘‘Gift Information for
Donors.”’

g A magnificent set of Auduboniana on long-
term loan from the National Audubon Society,
appraised at some $3 million, is now housed in
SIL’s Dibner Library. The set consists of John

James Audubon’s four-volume Birds of America,

Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America, and
manuscript materials that include correspon-
dence, species descriptions from the ‘‘Or-
nithological Biography,” and an early text of
Ouadrupeds.

Smithsonian Institution Man and
the Biosphere Biological Diversity
Program

The Smithsonian Institution Man and the Bio-
sphere Biological Diversity Program (SI/MAB)
addresses the challenge of protecting the biolog-
ical diversity of developing countries. The pro-
gram focuses on two objectives: (1) to provide
biodiversity sampling protocols for protected
areas and other highly diverse ecosystems of the
world in a way that will allow data from diverse
sites to be compared in time and space and (2) to
strengthen short-term professional training capa-
bilities in host countries and thereby increase the
number of managers and scientists in developing
nations who can address their countries’ conserva-
tion priorities.

m During the past year, the SI/MAB Program
conducted successful regional training courses on
conservation and management of protected areas
and wildlands in Guatemala, Ecuador, Bolivia,
Panama, and Peru.

mw Among SI/MAB tesearch activities conducted
this year were the second post-hurricane census of
the biodiversity plot in the Luquillo Biosphere
Reserve, Puerto Rico; the four-year census of the
four biodiversity plots in the Beni Biosphere Re-
serve, Bolivia; and the establishment of the first
biodiversity plot in the unique dry forest ecosys-
tem of the Virgin Islands National Park, St. John,
U.S. Virgin Islands.

w An evaluation of the last five regional training
courses conducted by SI/ MAB was completed this
year. Three forthcoming publications are ex-
pected to improve and modify the training
courses to meet the national conservation objec-
tives in the countries where courses are held.

@ Publications produced this year included the
program’s first newsletter, four user’s guides and
three field guides to the biodiversity plots, and
two related papers.
Smithsonian Tropical Research
Institute

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
(STRI), with headquarters in Panama, is the na-
tion’s leading center for basic research on the
ecology, behavior, and evolution of tropical or-
ganisms. STRI’s mission includes research on ter-
restrial and marine organisms and ecosystems,
molecular evolution, paleoecology, and human
interactions with the biosphere; promotion of
conservation and sustainable use of tropical re-
sources; and education and training in tropical
biology. STRI’s resident scientific staff of 29
works throughout the New and Old World
tropics, and the institute provides essential logis-
tical support for the international scientific com-
munity to conduct state-of-the-art investigations
on natural tropical systems.

w STRI established the Center for Tropical Forest
Science in collaboration with Princeton and Har-
vard universities, with major support from the
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Founda-
tion. The center will promote and coordinate
long-term research on tropical forest ecology and
management in a growing network of sites
around the world, which at present include Pan-
ama, Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and
Sri Lanka.

@ The innovative Canopy Access System, a tower
construction crane bearing a gondola for scientists
and equipment, demonstrated its practicality and
versatility as a tool for investigating the virtually
unknown tropical forest canopy. This year’s
studies, at a forested site near Panama City, fo-
cused on the physiology of canopy trees, canopy
microclimate, the growth and dynamics of lianas
in tree crowns, and canopy invertebrates.

g Empirical and theoretical evolutionary studies
by STRI researchers and associates—including
Mary Jane West-Eberhard, William G. Eberhard,
A. Stanley Rand, John H. Christy, and Michael J.
Ryan—have shown that elaborate male courtship
displays may not originate because of greater re-
productive success by females that choose showy
males, as has been commonly thought. Instead,
male displays often exploit preexisting biases in
the sensory and behavioral responses of females,
which originally evolved for escape from preda-
tors or other reasons unrelated to mating.

@ Studies of the reproductive biology and mo-

lecular evolution of marine organisms by STRI re-
searchers and colleagues, including D. Ross
Robertson, Eldredge Bermingham, Haris A. Les-
sios, G. M. Wellington, M. J. Shulman, and J. R.
Weinberg, have provided new insight into the re-
lationships among larval dispersal, genetic struc-
ture of populations, and population regulation
and adaptation to local conditions. For example,
fish species with pelagic larvae (larvae living in
the open ocean) have been found to be genet-
ically uniform over vast areas of the eastern Pa-
cific Ocean and the Caribbean, while populations
of a live-bearing isopod show extraordinary ge-
netic divergence on beaches only a kilometer
apart.

m The publication of Long-Term Assessment of
the Oil Spill at Bahia Las Minas, Panama: Interim
Report by Brian D. Keller, Jeremy B. C. Jackson,
and the staff of STRI’s Oil Spill Project summa-
rized the first three years of a five-year study on
the effects of a major oil spill near STRI’s Galeta
field station in the San Blas Islands off the coast
of Panama. In addition to documenting the ini-
tial severe effects, the study has found that organ-
isms and communities differ greatly in their
recovery rates, from no recovery by reef-building
corals after several years to very rapid recoloniza-
tion by mangrove seedlings that may require
three decades to mature.

Museums

Office of the Assistant Secretary

for Museums

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Mu-
seums advises the secretary and the under secre-
tary on matters concerning museum operations,
policies, and advocacy issues. Current priorities of
the office include collections management, intel-

38

lectual and physical accessibility, exhibitions, mu-
seum education, and public service.

w An accessibility coordinator was appointed in
1991 to address physical accessibility in exhibi-
tions, public programs, facilities, and grounds.
g The new Experimental Gallery opened in the
Arts and Industries Building, providing exhibit
makers with space to explore and experiment
with the exhibition development process, audi-
ence and access, exhibition context, and tech-
nique and style. Exhibitions created for the
gallery have multicultural and multidisciplinary
themes.

w A 21-member advisory committee recom-
mended the establishment of a National African
American Museum on the National Mall, to be
administered by the Smithsonian. The proposed
museum, approved by the Institution’s Board of
Regents at its May and September meetings, will
be dedicated to the collection, preservation, re-
search, and exhibition of African American mate-
rial reflecting the breadth of the experience of
black Americans.

@ Acquisitions supported by the Collections Ac-
quisition Program included the remainder of the
Duke Ellington archives (National Museum of
American History), a Baga figure (National Mu-
seum of African Art), and a collection of Chinese
portraits (Arthur M. Sackler Gallery). Special Ex-
hibition Fund awards, for projects in all disci-
plines, included “‘The Art of Romare Bearden”’
(National Museum of American Art), ‘Principles
of Flight’ (National Air and Space Museum),
and ‘‘Land of Promise: America in the 19th Cen-
tury’’ (National Museum of American History).
@ Following a study of funding levels for the In-
stitution’s internship programs, the Smithsonian
Internship Council began to seek corporate and
foundation support to establish an Institution-
wide stipend fund for students who need finan-
cial assistance to pafticipate in current programs.

Anacostia Museum

The Anacostia Museum is a national resource de-
voted to identifying, documenting, protecting,
and interpreting the African American experi-
ence in Washington, D.C., and the upper South
(Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Car-
olina, and Georgia). The museum also examines
contemporary social issues such as housing, trans-
portation, and health care and their impact on
African American communities in the region. In
addition, the museum is committed to the collec-
tion, protection, and interpretation of popular
culture in the African American population.

g Steven Newsome, who became the museum's
second director in March 1991, began to articulate
a new vision for the museum that includes re-
gional service and the collection of contemporary
material culture.

g The museum acquired more than 300 objects
reflecting the life of the noted African American
journalist Ethel Payne. Payne, who lived in Wash-
ington for a number of years before her death,
wrote for the Chicago Defender and the Wash-
ington Afro-American newspapets and was active
in local and national politics.

w New equipment for artifact storage was in-
stalled this year. The completion of the storage
facility allows the museum to seek additions to its
collection more aggressively.

g The George Washington Carver Nature Trail
on the museum grounds opened informally. The
trail will give visitors an opportunity to learn
about natural resources in an urban environment.
A simulated Underground Railroad route will en-
able visitors to learn how escaping slaves used the
natural environment in their flights to freedom.
The project received partial funding from the
Smithsonian Educational Outreach Program and
the Smithsonian Women’s Committee.

w The museum mounted ‘‘Kaleidoscope: African
American Photography in Washington, D.C.”
The exhibition was organized by Marcia Battle,
assistant curator of photography, National Mu-
seum of American Art, and marked a new trend
of greater collaboration between the Anacostia
Museum and other Smithsonian bureaus.

g The annual Juneteenth celebration, a day-long
outdoor festival of music, dance, and crafts dem-
onstrations, attracted more than 2,000 visitors.
Washington, D.C., Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly and
D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton helped to
mark the day that slaves in Texas heard about the
Emancipation Proclamation.

g A Third World Music Series was developed as
part of the Black Mosaic project, which examines
community life and cultural exchange among
people of African descent living in the metropoli-

tan Washington, D.C., area. In cooperation with
the various communities, the museum sponsored
a series of performances, including reggae, Afro-
Cuban, African Pop, and traditional West Afri-
can music and dance.

Archives of American Art

The Archives of American Art, a national re-
search repository with centers in Washington,
D.C., New York, Boston, Detroit, and San Mar-
ino, California, has the largest collection in the
world of original source materials relating to the
history of the visual arts in the United States, in-
cluding documents, photographs, works of art on
paper, and tape-recorded and video interviews.
The Archives is dedicated to encouraging research
in American art and cultural history by making
its collections easily accessible to researchers.
Original materials are housed in Washington,
with microfilm copies of many items in the col-
lections available in each of the Archives centers
and around the world through interlibrary loan.

@ A notable advance for the Archives was the en-
try in June 1991 of its catalogue data base in the
Research Library Information Network (RLIN)
system. This made the Archives catalogue of
some 5,600 records instantly accessible to re-
searchers in thousands of colleges, universities,

Materials in the Chicago Area,”’ which includes
collections held by the Archives.

Arthur M. Sackler Gallery

The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, which opened to
the public in 1987, was established with a gift of
almost 1,000 works of Asian art from Dr. Arthur
M. Sackler (1913-87). Its permanent collection
consists of this important group of objects, as well
as more recent acquisitions by gift, purchase, and
transfer. Dedicated to expanding public knowl-
edge of the arts and cultures of Asia through ex-
hibition, research, and publication, the gallery
also organizes and presents traveling exhibitions
and displays objects loaned from appropriate in-
stitutions and collections. A varied schedule of

free public programs and special events enhances
these activities.

m This year, the director established a member-
ship group, Friends of Asian Arts at the Freer and _
Sackler Galleries, to encourage new interest in the
galleries and to support their collections acquisi-
tion programs. Forty-two friends joined the
group in its charter year, and their benefactions
totaled $65,500.

m Under the auspices of the Smithsonian Office
of Wider Audience Development, some 75 par-
ticipants from the Smithsonian and local Asian
American and Pacific American communities
gathered at the Sackler Gallery for a follow-up
meeting on the study, Knowledge and Access: A
Study of Asian and Pacific American Commu-
nities in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan
Area, commissioned by the Sackler Gallery and
conducted by Juanita Tamayo Lott. The Smith-
sonian has used the study as a guide for its out-
reach to Asian American communities, and Lott
has been named to the Institution’s Cultural Ed-
ucation Committee.

w The gallery acquired 90 Chinese ancestor por-
traits of the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries
from the collection of Richard Pritzlaff. Some of
these paintings, which show brilliant color and
intricate design, were the gift of Pritzlaff, and
others were gallery purchases with funding from
the Smithsonian Collections Acquisition
Program.

@ The fifth symposium of the American Com-
mittee for South Asian Art, ‘‘Current Research in
South and Southeast Asian Art and Archaeol-
ogy,’ was sponsored by the Sackler and Freer gal-
leries. The public symposium included papers by
66 scholars, as well as museum visits and
receptions.

w The gallery participated in the nationwide, 18-
month Festival of Indonesia with its summer-long _
presentation of ‘“‘Court Arts of Indonesia,”’ a
traveling exhibition organized by the Asia Soci-
ety, New York City, in association with the Sackler
Gallery. As a part of the exhibition, the Educa-
tion Department organized free daily performing
arts events. The highlight of these programs was
Indonesian shadow puppet plays accompanied by
a gamelan orchestra from Central Java, which de-
lighted audiences with its traditional
performances.

g The exhibition ‘‘Paper and Clay from Modern
Japan’’ offered the first public presentation of
the Sackler Gallery’s growing collection of mod-
ern Japanese graphic arts and ceramics. Four pot-
ters designated as Living National Treasures were
among the artists whose works were featured.
Kitaoka Fumio, whose set of six large woodblock
prints was a highlight of the exhibition, visited
the gallery and held an informal discussion with
staff about his work on those prints.

Conservation Analytical
Laboratory

The Conservation Analytical Laboratory (CAL)
engages in research and training in the conserva-
tion and technical study of museum objects and
other materials of historic importance. CAL ad-
dresses questions of archaeological and art histori-
cal interest, as well as problems facing the
Smithsonian and other museums in the preserva-
tion and conservation of their collections. A mul-
tifaceted training program provides unique
educational opportunities for students in conser-
vation, materials science, archaeology, and art
history.

= Biogeochemist Noreen Tuross successfully de-
veloped a technique for identifying diseases in
the skeletal remains of ancient populations of
North American Plains Indians hunter-gatherers.
By tagging the antibodies extracted from the
bones, she identified trepanomal disease in a
1,500-year-old skeleton.

@ In cooperation with the National Gallery of
Art, the Canadian Conservation Institute, and
the Tate Gallery, London, CAL studied the effects
of the transit environment on paintings. This
study culminated in ‘‘Art in Transit,’’ an interna-
tional conference held in London. Through com-
puter modeling at CAL and direct experi-
mentation by staff at the Canadian Conservation
Institute, CAL Assistant Director for Conserva-
tion Research Marion Mecklenburg showed that
vibration in transit presents no particular hazard
for sufficiently sound, well-treated paintings.

@ Senior Research Archaeologist Ronald Bishop
and his colleagues continued activities of the
Greater Nicoya (Nicaragua and Costa Rica) Ar-
chaeological Research and Training Project, which

this year included the training of Central Ameri-
can participants at CAL. The two-month program
combined formal instruction (in Spanish) with
hands-on data generation. The Greater Nicoya
project addresses specific problem areas of Cen-
tral American prehistory with emphasis on the
development of appropriate research designs and
on training in interpreting scientific-archaeologi-
cal data.

w Twenty individuals served internships at CAL
at various levels and in various specialties during
the year; there were also three volunteers. CAL
offered 13, courses in various topics, 6 of them in
new subjects, ranging from Mechanics of Mate-
rials and Structure of Cultural Objects to Exhibi-
tion Materials and Drying and Flattening of
Paper: Science and Techniques.

Cooper-Hewitt, National Museum of Design is
one of the largest repositories of design in the
world and the only museum in the United States
devoted exclusively to the historical development
and contemporary expression of design. The mu-
seum is an important resource for architects, de-
signers, artists, and scholars. Cooper-Hewitt’s
mission is to improve the understanding of de-
sign and the design process through diverse pro-
grams, which include making the collections

available for study, research, and display; provid-
ing educational programs for professionals and
the public; mounting exhibitions; and sponsor-

ing publications and conferences keyed to signifi-
cant design issues. Four curatorial departments—
Drawings and Prints, Decorative Arts, Textiles,
and Wallcoverings—add to, care for, and inter-
pret the museum’s collection of nearly a quarter
of a million objects.

w ‘The Cooper-Hewitt Collections: A Design
Resource,’ an exhibition presented this year,
chronicled the formation of the museum’s collec-
tions from 1897 to the present. Although the ob-
jects on display were only a small sampling of
those in the collection, they represent the enthu-
siastic collectors and enlightened donors, the
shifts in taste and thinking, and the significant
forces and events that have shaped this national
repository and given it its unique identity.

@ For the first time since its founding as the Na-
tional Museum of Design, Cooper-Hewitt re-
ceived a federal appropriation designated for ed-
ucational purposes. This funding enables the
museum to offer free regular programs for chil-
dren and adults.

@ The highlights of the museum’s 1991 programs
included a summer lecture-concert series, ‘‘Ritual
and Celebration: African Cultures in the New
World” and Design Career Day Programs initi-
ated by Cooper-Hewitt’s Education Department
with Homes for the Homeless. These specialized
workshops offered high school students the op-

portunity to work with professional designers as
they explored social issues and participated in de-
sign activities.

@ Major capital construction projects begun this
year included an accessibility improvement plan;
a new copper roof for the Carnegie mansion; fire
protection and electrical upgrade for the man-
sion; and the joining of the Miller and Fox town-
houses to create a single office and collection
storage facility. These improvements will take sev-
eral years to complete.

w A benefit was held on June 3, 1991, to honor
Arthur Ross’s contribution to restore and reno-
vate Cooper-Hewitt’s garden and to dedicate it as
the Arthur Ross Terrace and Garden. Over 300
people attended the gala, which raised more than
$75,000 for the museum’s general operating

funds.

of Art is based on its preeminent collections of
Asian art dating from Neolithic times to the early
twentieth century and on its major holdings of
works by James McNeill Whistler. Additions to
the collection through gift and purchase have ex-
panded the character of the original collection,
which was presented to the United States by
Charles Lang Freer in 1906. The Freer Gallery is
closed until May 1993 for extensive renovation
and expansion that will broaden its research, ex-
hibition, and educational programs.

@ Staff completed the four-month relocation and
subsequent inventory of the entire Freer collec-
tion of approximately 27,000 objects, which they
moved to a 13, 300-square-foot research and stor-
age facility on the gallery’s newly excavated lower
level. During construction of the storage area, the
collections had been stored in the exhibition gal-
leries, which were closed to the public.

m Secretary Robert McC. Adams presided at a re-
ception in the renovated Freer courtyard in honor
of Freer benefactor Ikuo Hirayama of Tokyo.
Hirayama arranged a gift of $1.5 million toward
the reinstallation of the Freer collection following
the gallery’s renovation. The celebrated Japanese
artist, who is also president of the National Uni-

versity of Fine Arts and Music, Tokyo, was the
principal donor in a consortium he organized.
The group also consisted of the Nomura Securt-
ties Co., Ltd., and the Nomura Cultural
Foundation.

w The Smithsonian Board of Regents approved
the naming of the Freer auditorium as the Eu-
gene and Agnes E. Meyer Auditorium in recogni-
tion of a gift of more than $1 million to renovate
and equip the 300-seat auditorium and to pro-
vide for public programming. The donation came
from Katharine Graham, chairman of the board
of the Washington Post Company; the Philip L.
Graham Fund; the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer
Foundation; and the Island Fund in the New
York Community Trust.

@ The cleaning of ‘‘Harmony in Blue and Gold:
The Peacock Room,” the Freer’s celebrated, per-
manently installed dining room by James McNeill
Whistler, was completed along with much of the
inpainting. In preparation for the room’s public
display at the time of the gallery’s reopening, the
director launched a campaign to acquire appro-
priate pieces of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain
of the Kangxi period, similar to the wares that
were displayed in the room when it was a part of
the London townhouse of Whistler’s patron, Fre-
derick R. Leyland.

= With the completion of the expansion and
construction on the lower levels of the gallery, the
Department of Conservation and Scientific Re-

search moved from its temporary quarters in the
Sackler Gallery to a new 10,000-square-foot lab at
the Freer. The lab offers expanded and modern-
ized facilities for art conservation and research on
ancient materials and technology.

w The Freer enriched its collection of ancient
Chinese bronzes with a thirteenth-century B.C.
Shang dynasty wine container. The vessel was ac-
quired through a gift in honor of the Freer re-
opening from T. T. Tsui of Hong Kong and
matching funds from the Smithsonian Collec-
tions Acquisition Program.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden ts
the Smithsonian Institution’s gallery for modern
and contemporary art. The museum, which
opened in 1974, is committed to increasing the
awareness and understanding of art through exhi-
bitions and publications, acquisitions, research,
public programs, and the presentation of its col-
lection in the galleries, plaza, and Sculpture Gar-
den. Continuing a progressive tradition of
patronage established by founding donor Joseph
H. Hirshhorn (1899-1981), the museum provides
a public facility for the study, exhibition, and
preservation of nineteenth- and twentieth-cen-
tury art while presenting a spectrum of contem-
porary work.

nent collection. Visitors showed their enthusiasm
by returning more than 6,000 response cards, 80
percent of them positive. The show was widely
covered in the press, and the museum received
many requests for information from other institu-
tions wishing to take similar approaches.

w Exhibition space continued to improve with
the reopening of the special exhibition galleries
on the lower level—long closed for repair and
renovation—and the launching of a major reno-
vation and redesign for the museum’s sculpture
plaza, to take place during fiscal year 1992.

w With the help of various acquisitions funds, as
well as gifts from generous donors, the museum
continued to acquire significant works by modern
and contemporary artists. Among the highlights
were Theodore Roszak’s metal and painted wood
sculpture Ascension (1945); Susan Rothenberg’s
acrylic painting LX/ (1976-77); David Ham-
mons’s found-object sculpture Untitled (1989);
and Bruce Nauman’s mixed-media construction
South American Triangle (1981).

w Two well-attended symposia highlighted the
museum’s education programs. ‘‘The African-
American Aesthetic in the Visual Arts and Post-
modernism,’’ featuring 10 prominent scholars
and artists, was cosponsored by Howard Univer-
sity’s College of Fine Arts in conjunction with the
National Conference of Artists. The March 30
program was made possible in part by a grant
from the Smithsonian Educational Outreach Pro-
gram. A forum on June 12 featured 8 of the to re-
cipients of Awards in the Visual Arts, a
prestigious national program that launched its
annual exhibition of works by award winners at
the museum. The forum was made possible by
BMW of North America, Inc., which, together
with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Na-
tional Endowment for the Arts, also supported
the awards program.

w Through a grant from the James Smithson So-
ciety, the museum’s Conservation Laboratory pur-
chased an infrared reflectography video system to
trace and record the many nuances of underdraw-
ing beneath the surface of a painting. The first
project will be a complete examination of ap-
proximately 30 of Willem de Kooning’s paintings
from the permanent collection, with results to be
published in 1993 in the catalogue for an exhibi-
tion honoring the artist’s goth birthday.

w Asa barometer of contemporary art, the

Hirshhorn’s exhibition program continued to en-
compass retrospectives by artists acknowledged
for their broad influence, such as John Baldessari
and Sigmar Polke, as well as smaller shows high-
lighting a theme, a group of works, or a site-gen-
erated project by such artists as the team of Ann
Hamilton and Kathryn Clark, Mike Kelley,
Adrian Piper, Boyd Webb, and Lawrence Weiner.

Institutional Studies Office

The Institutional Studies Office is a pan-Institu-
tional resource dedicated to the scientific study of
the characteristics, attitudes, opinions, and expe-
riences of Smithsonian constituencies. The office
serves senior management, museums, programs
or research efforts within the museums, and
Smithsonian offices and operations that have a
pan-Institutional focus. Among its study topics
are audience and membership profiles, assess-
ments of the educational value of the museum
experience, and self-study of Smithsonian opera-
tions, including ongoing analysis of staff
composition.

@ The office completed a major study, Re-
searchers’ Perspectives: Research Support
Resources at the Smithsonian.

w Analyses of the racial, ethnic, and gender com-
position of the Smithsonian staff helped manage-
ment monitor employment initiatives.

@ Studies conducted for Smithsonian bureaus in-
cluded systematic assessments of visitors’ experi-
ences at the National Museum of American Art,
the National Portrait Gallery, and the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden and background
studies for forthcoming exhibitions at the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History/ National Mu-
seum of Man and the National Zoological Park.
International Gallery

The International Gallery presents exhibitions

that deal with significant global topics from var-
ious disciplinary points of view or cultural per-
spectives. Public and scholarly programs are
planned in conjunction with each exhibition that
appears in the gallery, which is located in the

S. Dillon Ripley Center.

mg “Moscow: Treasures and Traditions,”’ a survey
of cultural artifacts and the arts of the Russian

capital, organized by the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service, was featured this
year in the International Gallery.

g Performing arts programs for the exhibition

“Court Arts of Indonesia,’’ which was on view in

the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, were presented in
the International Gallery.

National Air and Space Museum

The National Air and Space Museum has the

largest collection of historic air and spacecraft in
the world. It is also a vital center for scholarship
in the history of aviation and spaceflight and in
the science and technology of related disciplines.
The museum’s two historical research depart-
ments conduct studies on the origin and develop-
ment of flight through the atmosphere and in
space, while its two scientific laboratories carry
out programs of basic research in satellite remote
sensing of the environment, planetary surfaces
and atmospheres, observational and theoretical
astrophysics, and the development of infrared as-
tronomical instruments for spacecraft.

w The museum completed a 15-month program
of public lectures, films, and scholarly symposia
titled ‘‘The Legacy of Strategic Bombing.” Par-
ticipants in the public programs included
McGeorge Bundy, Freeman Dyson, John Kenneth
Galbraith, Curtis LeMay, Philip Morrison, Solly
Zuckerman, Robert McNamara, and Kurt
Vonnegut.

@ To accompany its German V-2 rocket, the mu-
seum produced an exhibit treating this World
War II artifact in full historical context. New ma-
terial assembled by curator David DeVorkin ex-

amines the creation of the V-2 as the world’s first
ballistic missile under the direction of Wehrner

von Braun; its mass production by forced labor of
concentration camp inmates; its deadly effect as a

weapon of terror in Britain, Belgium, and Hol-

land; and its key role after the war in the develop-

ment of intercontinental ballistic missiles by the
United States.

w Geologists Thomas Watters and Patricia Jacob-
berger of the museum’s Center for Earth and
Planetary Studies began work with colleagues in
Czechoslovakia and at the University of New
Hampshire on research to determine the extent
and rate of deforestation in Czechoslovakia frin
air pollution. The study will analyze satellite re-
mote sensing images in conjunction with field-
work to gather spectral data on spruce needles
and soils in three parts of the country.

g The museum received an SR-71 Blackbird re-
connaissance airplane, which will be stored
outdoors at Washington Dulles International Air-
port pending the eventual construction of a mu-
seum extension where such large artifacts can be
exhibited. In the absence of ‘‘standard’’ guide-
lines for the outdoor storage of such an exotic ar-
tifact, museum preservation specialists devised a
novel solution. They made a protective cover
from 450 yards of three-layer polyester-cotton
Gore-Shield fabric and installed a dehumidifier
to pump air with constant 45 percent humidity
through the airplane, monitored by a remote
chart recorder. Results from the first year’s data
on the storage of the aircraft are encouraging and
may be useful for other artifacts that cannot be
housed immediately.

National Museum of African Art

The National Museum of African Art is the only
museum in the United States dedicated exclu-
sively to the collection, exhibition, and study of
the traditional arts of Africa south of the Sahara.
The museum offers visitors the opportunity to
gain a better understanding of the extraordinarily
diverse cultures and visual traditions of this vast
region through its wide range of educational pro-
grams and its permanent and temporary exhibi-
tions. In addition, the museum serves as a
research and reference center, housing the Eliot
Elisofon Photographic Archives and the Warren
M. Robbins Library.

w A new permanent exhibition, ‘The Art of the
Personal Object,’’ features more than 100 inge-
niously conceived utilitarian objects principally
from eastern and southern Africa.

w A new gallery opened this year devoted to
small, innovative exhibitions on unique topics,
generally focusing on a single object or theme.
The first exhibition was ‘‘A Cloth of Honor,’ a
large, vibrantly colored cloth made by Okon Ak-
pan Abuje of southeastern Nigeria.

m The museum presented a series of free public
programs on the Gullah people, a distinctive
group of African Americans whose artistic tradi-
tions, customs, language, and folklore can be
traced to West Africa. The series was held in con-
junction with the exhibition ‘‘Paramount Chiefs

of Sierra Leone: Photographic Portraits by Vera
Viditz-Ward.”’

w Olowe of Ise, a Nigerian court artist of the late
nineteenth to early twentieth century whose work
for Yoruba kings established him as one of the
most famous African sculptors, continued to be
the focus of archival research being conducted at
the museum. This research will result in the first
monograph devoted to a traditional African
artist.

w A 50-minute film, Nagayati (Be in Peace), pro-
duced for the museum by Peter Oud of Film and
Photography for Development Work, explores
the arts and architecture of the Gabra nomads in
northern Kenya, East Africa.

National Museum of American
Art

The National Museum of American Art (NMAA)
is committed to the acquisition, preservation,
study, and exhibition of American painting,
sculpture, graphic arts, photography, and craft
and folk art. As the largest collection of American
art in the world, NMAA houses more than
35,000 objects. The Renwick Gallery, a curatorial
department of the museum, collects and exhibits
American crafts and decorative arts. Through its
many programs and publications, the museum
seeks to expand the understanding of American
art and its relationship to history and to the pre-
sent, ensuring the inclusion of diverse artistic
achievements that were once unrecognized.

w American Art, a quarterly publication on the
arts in America begun in 1987, was renamed and
expanded in 1991 to include a variety of new fea-
tures and articles. The journal’s scope encom-
passes all aspects of the nation’s visual heritage,
including the traditional fine arts, decorative arts
and crafts, architecture and landscape design,
photography, film and video, and commercial
and graphic design.

@ Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!), a massive
project of inventorying all public sculpture in
America through on-site visits by volunteers, be-

)

gan in fall 1991. Illinois, Tennessee, and West Vir- |

ginia are the first states to be surveyed in the
nationwide campaign to locate and document all
outdoor sculpture for adding to the Inventory of
American Sculpture maintained by the museum.
This computer data base records the location,
physical characteristics, and subject matter of out-
door monuments as well as of sculpture in private
and public collections. SOS! is cosponsored by
the National Institute for the Conservation of
Cultural Property.

@ More than 50 paintings on a variety of unor-
thodox materials, including plywood, burlap,
and paperboard, were conserved by the museum
in preparation for the exhibition ‘‘Homecoming:
William H. Johnson and Afro-America, 1938—
1946,”’ which opened on September 13, 1991. One
of America’s most important but neglected black
painters, the academically trained Johnson
worked in a vibrant, folk-inspired style to capture
everyday life in the rural South and Harlem fol-
lowing the Depression.

gw The museum was named the major beneficiary
of the estate of Florence Davis, whose husband
Gene Davis was a leading figure in twentieth-cen-
tury art and a widely acclaimed innovator in the
field of abstraction. Included in the important
bequest were a substantial number of paintings,
drawings, and prints representing Gene Davis’s
entire career.

m ‘Made with Passion: The Hemphill Folk Art
Collection of the National Museum of American
Art’’ provided a showcase for 199 objects (nearly
half the collection acquired by NMAA) created
by people of diverse backgrounds from all parts
of the nation. Programs held in conjunction with
the exhibition included a Folk Art Family Day
that attracted more than 2,000 visitors and special
demonstrations presented by artists represented
in the show.

w The Renwick Gallery expanded its widely ac-
claimed collection of contemporary crafts through
gifts and with the assistance of the Smithsonian
Collections Acquisition Program and the James
Renwick Alliance (the gallery’s support group).
New acquisitions include work in many media by
George Nakashima, Larry Fuente, William Har-
per, Sidney R. Hutter, Albert Paley, Earl Pardon,
Don Reitz, and Judith Schaecter.

National Museum of American
History

The National Museum of American History
(NMAH) preserves and honors the nation’s heri-
tage through exhibitions, books, symposia, con-
certs, drama, oral history projects and story-
telling, films, recordings, and innovative school
outreach programs. As an educational institu-
tion, the museum is dedicated to using its collec-
tions to promote public understanding of the
experiences and aspirations of all the American
people. NMAH makes a special effort to recog-
nize the diverse aspects of American culture and
to present that magnificent variety and vitality to
audiences on the National Mall and beyond. Its
holdings of more than 17 million objects—from
George Washington's Revolutionary War field
tent to the world’s largest collection of musical
manuscripts and memorabilia of Duke
Ellington—and its extensive archives constitute
one of the most comprehensive American history
collections in existence. Research by scholars and
specialists from within and outside the museum
lays the foundation for all the museum’s work,
and educational activities are directed to visitors
of all ages and interests.

in the former Washington, D.C., main post of-
fice next to Union Station.

w With a grant from the Smithsonian Collections
Acquisition Program, the Archives Center and
the Division of Musical History at NMAH ac-
quired from Ruth Ellington Boatwright impor-
tant musical manuscripts, recordings,
photographs, and business records of her brother,
Edward Kennedy ‘“‘Duke’’ Ellington. With these
materials, the museum’s Ellington holdings form
the world’s largest collection devoted to this dis-
tinguished American composer and conductor.

w The museum’s Program in African American
Culture introduced Washington, D.C., public
school students and their teachers to the Duke
Ellington Collection through its Duke Ellington
Youth Festival. While studying the life and music
of Ellington, more than 100 young people per-
formed his music, wrote poetry and essays, and
created their own works of art in celebration of
Ellington’s genius. These works were presented to
the public in an evening of performances and in
an art exhibition.

@ Occidental Chemical Corporation presented a
gift of $1 million to the museum to develop a na-
tional prototype model for science education at
the middle school or junior high school level.
Museum educators working with teachers in
schools and colleges nationwide are designing
revolutionary approaches to science education,

creating curriculum guides for teachers, and iden-
tifying interdisciplinary approaches that will at-
tract and hold the interest of students in science.
This educational outreach program is part of the

new exhibition ‘‘Science in American Life,”’
scheduled to open in November 1993, which is
supported by a grant from the American Chemi-
cal Society.

m Despite a general decline in tourism at many
popular Washington sites during 1990-91, mu-
seum attendance rose by a noteworthy 5 percent,
which translates into some 274,000 new visitors to
exhibitions, concerts, and programs.

@ A new installation of the exhibition ‘‘After the
Revolution: Everyday Life in America 1780-1800”
opened, reflecting extensive new research and de-
sign and the benefits of a continuing process of
exhibition evaluation.

@ The museum acquired uniforms worn by three
women during the Persian Gulf war: Barbara
Bush’s battle dress utility uniform shirt in desert
camouflage, worn during the First Lady’s Thanks-

~ giving 1990 trip to Saudi Arabia; the Iraqi pris-

oner-of-war uniform issued to Army Major
Rhonda Cornum; and the uniform shirt and
trousers worn by Army Specialist Melissa Rath-
burn Nealy Coleman, prisoner of war.

@ Marking the centennial of the great American
composer Cole Porter, the museum’s Division of
Museum Programs presented 15 free public per-
formances of Porter songs and a special tribute of
two additional programs produced with the
Mabel Mercer Foundation of New York City.

National Museum of the
Amencan Indian

The National Museum of the American Indian
(NMAI), in consultation and collaboration with
Native Americans, will interpret and represent all
aspects of Native culture of the Western Hemi-
sphere as living, dynamic cultural phenomena
with intrinsic validity and equality with other cul-
tural experiences. Through innovative public pro-
gramming, research, and collections, the
museum will recognize its special responsibility to
protect, support, and enhance the development,
maintenance, and perpetuation of Native cul-
tures and communities.

m The museum held 11 consultations in fiscal
1991, each involving approximately 40 partici-
pants drawn primarily from the Native American

community. The purpose of these meetings was
to obtain programmatic information that will
help the museum and its architectural consultant
to determine the nature, number, and configura-
tion of spaces needed for NMAI’s new facilities
on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and
in Suitland, Maryland.

gw The NMAI Board of Trustees adopted a re-
patriation policy that commits the museum to the
disposition of five categories of materials in
accordance with the wishes of culturally based
Native Americans where cultural affiliation with
the materials has been demonstrated: human re-
mains, funerary objects, communally owned
property, ceremonial and religious materials, and
materials acquired illegally.

= Complex negotiations with the General Ser-
vices Administration and the governments of
New York City and New York state were com-
pleted this year. As a result of these negotiations,
construction funds were released for the renova-
tion of the Old U.S. Custom House, which will
house the George Gustav Heye Center of the Na-
tional Museum of the American Indian in New
York City.

gw The exhibitions for the 1994 opening of the
George Gustav Heye Center were conceived and
the initial research was accomplished with the
participation of Native Americans from through-
out the hemisphere.

m The museum’s national fund-raising campaign
was launched in January 1991 with a full-page ad-
vertisement in four major newspapers and a series
of test mailings to initiate an NMAI membership
program. Public response has far exceeded even
the most optimistic projection; by the end of the
fiscal year, the museum had more than 16 ,o00
members.

@ Staff development was a primary focus during
the year. Of 17 new staff members, 8 are Native
Americans.

National Museum of Natural
History/ National Museum of Man

The National Museum of Natural History /Na-
tional Museum of Man (NMNBH), the nation’s
largest research museum, is dedicated to under-
standing the natural world and the place of hu-
mans in it. With a staff of more than 600,
including 130 staff scientists, and the world’s
largest and most extensive collection of docu-
mented artifacts and specimens of plants, ani-
mals, fossils, rocks, and minerals, now
numbering more than 120 million items, the mu-
seum supports scholarly investigations in anthro-
pology and the full range of the natural sciences.
This extensive research in the field and the labo-
ratory is shared with the scholarly community and
the public through publications, symposia and
forums, educational programs, and a public mu-
seum of popular exhibitions that attracts about 6
million visitors a year, more than any other natu-
ral history museum in the world.

a The museum’s National Council held its first
field meeting October 18-21, 1990, in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming. In addition to attending busi-
ness sessions, the council visited two research
sites: an outcrop of fossil flowering plants east of
Togwotee Pass and recent and older burned areas
of Yellowstone National Park to study fire
ecology.

magazine Nature suggesting that oxygen respira-
tion evolved and was being used by organisms
worldwide at least a billion years earlier than sci-
entists previously believed. His calculations,
based on chemical evidence from the Earth’s
most ancient rocks, also show that the atmo-
sphere during this time period (3.8 to 2.5 billion
years ago) contained dramatically higher amounts
of oxygen than thought possible.

w In ‘Focus on Biodiversity,’’ six staff scientists,
led by Director of Biodiversity Programs Don E.
Wilson, presented a timely public briefing on the
museum's important ongoing research in this
area.

@ Critical basic research included publication
during the year of numerous new species of
plants and animals discovered by museum scien-
tusts. Two notable findings were a new beaked
whale, the first new cetacean species recognized
since 1963, and 32 species of extinct birds that
lived in Hawaii until the arrival of humans.

@ Moving as quickly as possible to carry out the
congressional mandate to repatriate the remains
and associated funerary objects of Native Ameri-
cans, the museum established and began to staff
the Repatriation Office. In 1991, the museum re-
turned these remains: to Hui Malama for reburial
in Kauai, Hawaii, the remains of 132 individuals
as well as other materials from Hawaii; to the
Larsen Bay Tribal Council of Kodiak Island,
Alaska, 756 human remains from the Uyak site,
Larsen Bay; and to the Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux

of Sisseton, South Dakota, the remains of 31 indi-
viduals. The museum also adopted a policy on
the treatment of Native American sacred objects
and cultural patrimony that follows the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act.

@ The Harry Winston Research Foundation gave
$1 million toward the renovation of the mu-
seum’s Geology, Gems, and Minerals Hall. Dur-
ing 1990-91, private contributions to the new
hall, expected to open in 1995, passed the $2 mil-
lion mark.

m Major special exhibitions in the Thomas Evans
Gallery were ‘‘Sharks: Fact and Fantasy’’ and
“Beyond the Java Sea: Art of Indonesia’s Outer
Islands.’ The latter exhibition, organized by mu-
seum ethnologist Paul M. Taylor, was the first sig-
nificant exhibition of the masterworks created by
the peoples of the outer islands.

mw A new souvenir guide for visitors to the ex-
hibits, A Picture Tour of the National Museum of
Natural History, was published this year, with
text by Associate Director for Public Programs
Robert D. Sullivan and writer/editor Sue Voss
and photographs by museum photographer Chip
Clark.

@ For the second summer, the museum’s second-
ary education specialist, Carmel Ervin, conducted
a three-week Natural Science Institute for
Teachers of Minority Students. This program for
teachers of grades 4 through 12 featured activities
aimed at learning how to “‘read”’ natural history
objects, and this year a companion institute was
established to increase the skill and interest of
teachers and students in geology.

National Portrait Gallery

The National Portrait Gallery is dedicated to the
collection, preservation, exhibition, and study of
portraits of people who have made significant
contributions to American history and to the
study of the artists who created such portraiture.
The gallery sponsors a variety of scholarly and
public activities for audiences interested in Amer-
ican aft.

@ Two of the exhibitions mounted during the
year—the photographic portraits of Annie
Leibovitz and the sculpture of Marisol—departed
from the gallery’s usual historical viewpoint.
These exhibitions proved exceedingly popular
with the public and attracted substantial critical
attention. Other exhibitions—including ‘‘Old
Hickory: A Portrait Sketch of Andrew Jackson,”’
“Group Portrait’’ (dealing with America’s ad-
vanced artists and writers of the early twentieth
century), ‘“Lincoln and His Contemporaries’’
(drawn from the Meserve Collection of Mathew
Brady photographs), and ‘‘Camera Portraits’’
(notable photographs from the National Portrait
Gallery in London)—dealt with portraiture in
past eras.

g The gallery emphasizes collaboration with
other cultural institutions in this nation and
abroad. The Annie Leibovitz exhibition was
jointly organized by the gallery and the Interna-
tional Center of Photography in New York City,
where it will be shown after its Washington instal-
lation. It will then continue on a national tour.
The Andrew Jackson exhibition was developed
with funds and cooperation from the State of
Tennessee and traveled to the Tennessee State
Museum in Nashville. ‘Camera Portraits’’ is the
latest in a series of exhibitions that bring the trea-
sures of overseas portrait collections to our public.
mw To encourage young people to think about the
art of portraiture, the gallery’s Education Depart-
ment has initiated an innovative series of week-
end workshops for students and their parents.
The Leibovitz and Marisol exhibitions gave
school-age young people the opportunity to try
their hands at photographic and constructed por-
traits and thus to enhance their appreciation for
the achievements of the two artists.

m Associated with the gallery’s Peale Papers proj-
ect (and the several notable Peale portraits in the
collection) was a symposium on the work of
Charles Willson Peale and his times, held April
13-14, 1991, in celebration of Peale’s 250th birth-
day. A book of essays on Peale by several scholars
from the gallery and elsewhere, edited by Lillian
Miller and David Ward of the Peale Papers staff,
was published on this occasion by the University
of Pittsburgh Press for the gallery.

@ Continuing the programs in which notable liv-
ing Americans present ‘‘self-portraits’’ in inter-
views were dancer, choreographer, and author
Agnes de Mille and Gordon Parks, whose career
encompasses photography, motion pictures, mu-
sical composition, and writing. These conversa-

for the future use of scholars and for possible tele- graphs at the opening of

her first museum exhtbt-
tion at the National Por-

vision broadcast.

lection, until this year available only in book trait Gallery in April :
form, was published in CD-ROM by Abt 1991. (Photograph by Jeff
Tinsley)

Books—the first time a museum collection has
been made available in this format. CD-ROM al-
lows computer users to have access to color images
of more than 3,000 painted, sculptured, and
drawn portraits using a variety of index terms.
This new technology has the potential for en-
hancing the gallery’s service to researchers and
general visitors and for providing a model for
other museums.

Office of Exhibits Central

The Office of Exhibits Central (OEC) provides ex-
hibition services for Smithsonian units that have
little or no exhibition capability. OEC’s specialists
offer expertise in all phases of exhibition design
and production using the office’s up-to-date
facilities.

w During this fiscal year, OEC worked with sev-
eral outside museums in adapting and designing
the installation of two major exhibitions in the
International Gallery in the S. Dillon Ripley Cen-

51
§2

ter: ‘‘Moscow: Treasures and Traditions’ and
“Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant Garde in
Nazi Germany.”

@ OEC provided significant support for the Col-
umbus Quincentenary exhibition ‘‘Seeds of
Change,” which opened at the National Museum
of Natural History in October r991. OEC staff ed-
ited the exhibition script, built exhibition cases,
silk-screened labels, and fabricated mannequins.
wm OEC designed, edited, and produced ‘‘The
Real McCoy: African American Invention and In-
novation.’’ This traveling exhibition for the
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Ser-
vice (SITES) was adapted from the exhibition of
the same name at the Anacostia Museum.

@ The office has participated in every phase of
the Experimental Gallery, from the initial space
plan to designing, producing, and installing
every exhibition to date. For ‘‘The Good, the
Bad, and the Cuddly: Human Attitudes toward
Animals,”’ a collaborative exhibition of the Na-
tional Zoological Park and SITES, OEC provided
full design and project coordination and pro-
duced full-size animal models and mechanical in-
teractive devices.

Office of Horticulture

The Office of Horticulture manages more than 80
acres of gardens and grounds at the Smithsonian,
places horticultural displays in interior public
spaces, and provides flowering and foliage plants
for special events and exhibitions. The office also
has collections of living plants, garden furniture,
and images of contemporary and historic
horticulture.

@ The office continues to focus on the health of
older trees and shrubs on the Smithsonian
grounds through spraying, cabling, pruning, and
replacement programs.

@ In keeping with the Institution’s emphasis on
environmental awareness, the office initiated an
integrated pest management program that re-
duces the use of environmentally harmful chemi-
cals. The office also continued installation of a
computerized irrigation network.

w The Enid A. Haupt Garden gravel walkways
were replaced with brick. This construction sub-

stantially improved accessibility and was enthusi-
astically received by public and staff.

w The Archives of American Gardens, estab-
lished with a gift collection of about 20,000 glass
and 35-millimeter slides from the Garden Club
of America, was awarded a grant by the James
Smithson Society to catalogue the collection to a
laser disk, to make access easier for researchers.

Office of Museum Programs

As a national and international museum training
center, the Office of Museum Programs provides
instruction and professional development in skills
unique to museum professions. Working to help
museums better serve their lay and scholarly audi-
ences, the office’s staff designs innovative train-
ing programs that focus on pressing concerns
facing museums and cultural institutions.

@ Representatives of more than 50 tribal groups
in the United States and Canada participated in
the American Indian Museum Studies Program, a
new training initiative that features courses on
planning for tribal cultural facilities, exhibition
production techniques, and archives
management.

@ The office continued its leadership role in in-
ternational museum training with the conference
“Building Partnerships/ Preserving Patrimony,”’
held in San José, Costa Rica. The program ad-
dressed the special challenges Central American
museums face in preserving their collections.

@ The ethical, political, and philosophical issues
surrounding income-generating activities were
the theme of ‘‘Purse Strings: Museums, Mission,
and Money in the ’9os,”’ a national conference
for leaders in the arts and museum fields.

w Again this year, the office provided services for
the more than 600 interns at the Smithsonian, in-
cluding application referral, registration, and ori-
entation, as well as educational and enrichment
programs.

Office of the Registrar

The Office of the Registrar (OR) supervises the
management of the Institution’s vast collection of
139 million objects and specimens. By monitoring
Institution-wide collections management policies
and procedures, the office works to ensure in-
creased access to and continued accountability for
the national collection.

g Frequent international requests prompted the
office to translate its principal guiding document,
Office Memorandum 808: Collections Manage-
ment Policy, into French and Spanish.

@ This year marked the fifth annual compilation
of collections statistics, which offers data on ac-
quisitions, deaccessioning, and loan activity
throughout the Institution.

@ The office presented ‘Project Success through
Problem Solving,’’ a workshop designed to clarify
and solve project management problems specifi-
cally associated with museum collections.

@ The Registrar’s Council, which offers oppor-
tunities for professional exchange among collec-
tions management staff, debated such critical is-
sues as repatriation, tax legislation, and the
capitalization of museum collections.

Smithsonian Institution Traveling
Exhibition Service

The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition
Service (SITES) expands the Smithsonian’s pres-
ence beyond Washington, D.C., to 8 million
people each year by circulating exhibitions to mu-
seums, libraries, science centers, historical soci-
eties, Zoos, aquariums, community centers, and
schools. SITES programs represent a broad range
of human perspectives—they pose questions,
communicate abstractions, and challenge visitors
to make connections among objects, people,
places, events, and ideas. By emphasizing diverse
viewpoints and by using inquiry as a means for
interpreting exhibition themes and images,
SITES encourages visitors to explore the full
breadth of possibilities inherent in themselves,
others, and the world around them.

w SITES received a major grant of $465,000 from
the Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund for “‘Be-
yond Category: The Musical Genius of Duke
Ellington,”’ a joint exhibition project with the
National Museum of American History. This ret-
rospective of one of the nation’s greatest cultural

heroes will combine photographs, computerized
audio programs, archival documents, live perfor-
mances, and a school curriculum guide. It will in-

augurate a multiyear initiative to bring America’s
rich jazz heritage to communities across the
country.

@ For the first time, SITES was allocated signifi-
cant federal funding. No longer required to re-
cover its operating expenses from exhibition
rental fees, SITES will be able to offer its pro-
grams at substantially lower costs, enabling more
people than ever to experience the full range of
Smithsonian offerings.

w SITES celebrates cultural diversity through ex-
hibitions that address the needs and interests of
people of all backgrounds. Historically black col-
leges, Mexico’s rich artistic heritage, America’s
past and present relationship with Japan and its
people, and Kiowa storytelling traditions are the
themes of some of the exhibitions introduced this
year to reach a growing multicultural audience.

w Preparatory workshops play an integral role in
SITES outreach services. A workshop for ‘“The
Real McCoy: African American Invention and In-
novation,’’ an exhibition organized by the An-
acostia Museum, brought together curators,
educators, content advisers, and representatives
from host museums on the national tour to help
determine the scope and format of the traveling
version of the exhibition.

Public Service

James Early, Assistant Secretary for Public
Service

Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Public Service

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public
Service advises the secretary, the under secretary,
and senior management staff on policy matters
related to contemporary public education, cul-
tural pluralism and cultural equity, and wider au-
dience initiatives. The office and the units it
oversees disseminate information on the Smith-
sonian to national audiences, collaborate with
elementary and secondary schools and educa-
tional associations, and engage in applied re-
search and the documentation of living cultures.

@ The Smithsonian has the unique ability as a
nontraditional educational institution to attract
diverse audiences for learning beyond the struc-
tured classroom environment. This year, the of-
fice assisted an outside organization, Quality
Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, in fos-
tering educational science programs for minor-
ities and women. Numerous offices and
individuals at the Smithsonian helped QEM, and
several QEM interns were placed at the
Smithsonian.

@ In keeping with its mandate to facilitate and

advance issues of cultural pluralism and cultural
equity, the office—under the auspices of the Cul-
tural Education Committee—prepared a report
on cultural diversity at the Smithsonian for the
Smithsonian Council. The report explored the
status of staffing, exhibition policies, audience
development, and outreach efforts at the
Institution.

National Science Resources Center

The National Science Resources Center (NSRC),
jointly operated by the Smithsonian Institution
and the National Academy of Sciences, works
with educators and scientists across the country to
improve science education in the nation’s
schools. The NSRC develops and disseminates in-
novative science curriculum materials, dissemi-
nates information about effective science
teaching resources, and sponsors outreach activ-
ities to help school districts improve their science
programs. The past year was marked by achieve-
ments in all three areas.

w The NSRC published the first instructional
units in a new elementary science curriculum un-
der development by the NSRC’s Science and
Technology for Children project. School districts
across the country have now begun to introduce
these new hands-on units into their elementary
schools.

mw The NSRC began to collect and catalogue in-
formation on effective science teaching resources
for middle school teachers. Under way is the cre-
ation of a data base and the production of a guide
for middle school science similar to the NSRC’s
highly successful guide to elementary science
teaching resource, Sczence for Children: Re-
sources for Teachers.

w Teams of teachers, administrators, and scien-
tists from 16 school districts across the country at-
tended the NSRC’s third Elementary Science
Leadership Institute. Representatives of 42 school
districts in 29 states serving more than 1 million
elementary school children have now participated
in the leadership institutes, which are week-long
sessions of workshops and discussions on strate-
gies for implementing effective elementary sci-
ence programs.

m The NSRC launched a significant national out-
reach project, the National Elementary Science
Leadership Initiative, which will link school dis-
tricts and the scientific community in a massive
effort to improve science education in the na-
tion’s schools. The project will expand the NSRC
Elementary Science Leadership Institute program
and provide follow-up support and technical as-
sistance for school districts working to reform
their science programs. The initiative will also
stimulate public support for improved ele-
mentary science education through the produc-
tion and distribution of a multimedia
information packet.

Office of Conference Services

The Office of Conference Services (OCS) coordi-
nates conferences, symposia, and meetings hos-
ted at or sponsored by the Smithsonian, which
range from scholarly colloquia and teacher work-
shops to dialogues with public audiences on na-
tional and international concerns relevant to
Smithsonian programs.

w OCS managed arrangements for ‘‘Teaching
about Native Americans,”’ the Institution’s first
symposium on current approaches to teaching
about historic and contemporary Native Ameri-
can cultures, sponsored by the National Museum
of Natural History.

m OCS gave logistical assistance to the American
Committee for South Asian Art for its fifth sym-
posium, ‘‘Current Research in South and South-
east Asian Art and Archaeology,’’ sponsored at
the Smithsonian by the Arthur M. Sackler Gal-
lery and the Freer Gallery of Art.

Office of Elementary and
Secondary Education

The Office of Elementary and Secondary Educa-
tion (OESE) develops and disseminates program-
ming that applies resources from throughout the
Institution to the needs of schools at the pre-
college level, both locally and nationally. The of-
fice also serves as a clearinghouse and a focal
point for precollege education at the Smith-

sonian, promoting collaboration and communica-
tion among Smithsonian education departments
and between those departments and outside or-
ganizations. OESE carries out programming in
four categories: teacher preparation and enhance-
ment, internships for students, publications and
other media for schools and children, and part-
nerships with schools.

# A collaboration with two District of Columbia
public schools in affiliation with the Foxfire
Foundation brought teachers into Smithsonian
museums for internships to develop classroom
materials and lessons on African American history
and culture.

w The office’s work in teacher preparation and
enhancement included a day-long symposium,
“Word of Mouth: Learning and Teaching
through Stories,’’ and a series of 12 one-week
courses on a variety of subjects relating to school
curricula.

w A contract with Golden Owl Publishing pro-
vides for commercial distribution of educational
materials produced by the office. This year, the
office completed the first title, “Band Music in
American Life: A Social History, 1850-1990.”’

Office of Folklife Programs

Through scholarly research and public program-
ming, the Office of Folklife Programs seeks to
promote continuity, integrity, and equity for tra-
ditional ethnic, tribal, regional, minority, and
working-class cultures in the United States and
abroad. Staff folklorists, anthropologists, and
ethnomusicologists conduct research on grassroots
cultural traditions and make research findings
available to scholarly and general audiences
through the Festival of American Folklife, the
Smithsonian Folklife Studies Series, Smith-
sonian/ Folkways Recordings, and the Office of
Folklife Programs archives.

w The 25th annual Festival of American Folklife
featured programs titled ‘‘Family Farming in the
Heartland,” ‘‘Forest, Field, and Sea: Folklife in
Indonesia,’’ ‘‘Land in Native American Cul-
tures’’ for the Columbus Quincentenary, and
“The Roots of Rhythm and Blues: The Robert
Johnson Era.”’

@ The Folklife Festival continues to generate in-

terest in cultural conservation in home commu-
nities. The Smithsonian and the state of Hawaii
are working toward establishing a Smithsonian/
Hawaii project for the study and enhancement of
the living cultures of Hawaii and the Pacific. The
government of the U.S. Virgin Islands is re-
mounting the U.S. Virgin Islands portion of the
1990 Festival of American Folklife on St. Croix
and on St. Thomas and establishing a Virgin Is-
lands cultural institute.

@ Smithsonian/ Folkways Recordings continues to
make available every original Folkways recording
by mail order, to reissue many of the originals,
and to release entirely new projects. Approxi-
mately 20 recordings—reissues and new re-
leases—were produced in 1991.

Office of Public Affairs

Through publicity and publications, the Office of
Public Affairs helps bring the Smithsonian
story—its exhibitions, research, public programs,
and other activities—to diverse cultural commu-
nities in the United States and throughout the

world. Serving as an information clearinghouse
for print and broadcast journalists, the office pro-
cesses about 550 news releases a year from Smith-
sonian offices and bureaus and provides
background papers, press conferences, photo-
graphic support, videotapes, logistical support,
and television and radio public service announce-
ments. The office’s publications include a
monthly calendar of events in English and Span-
ish, the Torch (an employee newspaper), Re-
search Reports (a quarterly research bulletin),
Smithsonian Runner (a bimonthly newsletter for
Native Americans), the Smithsonian News Ser-
vice (a syndicated monthly feature story service
for newspapers), and a wide variety of visitor and
special resource publications. The office also coor-
dinates Institution-wide publicity and advertising
programs.

m With support from the Educational Outreach
Program and the Special Exhibition Fund, the of-
fice prepared four versions of a multicultural
portable exhibit that was displayed during the
year at annual meetings of the National Associa-
tion of Hispanic Journalists, the National Asso-
ciation of Black Journalists, and the Asian
American Journalists Association.

m The New York Times Syndicate began distrib-

uting the Smithsonian News Service overseas in
Spanish and English. The award-winning service,
which goes to 1,000 newspapers in the United
States and worldwide, garnered every honor in
the feature release category in the National Asso-

ciation of Government Communicators Blue Pen-

cil publications competition.

g A 30-second, close-captioned television public
service announcement about the Smithsonian for
visitors with physical disabilities was filmed with
Dianne H. Pilgrim, director of the Cooper-
Hewitt, National Museum of Design, as
spokesperson.

Smithsonian Office of Wider
Audience Development

The Smithsonian Office of Wider Audience De-
velopment was established in 1990 to assist in the
efforts to strengthen the Institution’s interaction
with culturally diverse communities. Examples of
the office’s work include coordinating pan-Insti-
tutional participation in federally designated ob-
servances of ethnic and women’s heritages;
establishing and maintaining relations with insti-
tutions and organizations concerned with cultural
diversity; and collecting and analyzing data on
nontraditional audiences.

@ This year, the office coordinated five heritage
commemorations with noted keynote speakers:
Black History Month (Niara Sudarkasa, presi-
dent, Lincoln University); Women’s History
Month (Carmen Turner, under secretary, Smith-
sonian Institution); Asian/Pacific American Heri-
tage Month (Ronald Takaki, professor of ethnic
studies, University of California, Berkeley); His-
panic Heritage Month (Luis Valdez, writer, direc-
tor, and producer); and American Indian
Heritage Month (Beatrice Medicine,
anthropologist).

Visitor Information and
Associates’ Reception Center

Established in 1970, the Visitor Information and
Associates’ Reception Center (VIARC) is a central
support unit responsible for a wide range of
Smithsonian information and assistance programs
for the public, Associate members, and staff and
volunteers. Several VIARC programs operate
seven days a week, and most involve the coor-
dination and direction of large numbers of volun-
teers, who are a primary source of support for the
Institution’s public information programs and for
project assistance behind the scenes.

g The Smithsonian Information Center has pro-
vided assistance to well over 2.5 million visitors
since it opened in late 1989, making it the fourth
busiest Smithsonian site. During the past year,
some 2,000 members a month were welcomed at
the Associate reception desks in the Castle and at
the National Air and Space Museum.

w The Public Inquiry Mail and Telephone Infor-
mation Services Unit received and processed more
than 40,000 pieces of mail and responded to
more than 325,000 telephone inquiries, which
included some 2,200 requests for information
about Smithsonian ethnic celebrations.

w VIARC’s corps of 570 volunteer information
specialists received training by Key Management,
Inc., to enhance information services for the pub-
lic. More than 550 volunteers, registered and
placed through the Behind-the-Scenes Volunteer
Program, provided Smithsonian staff with valu-
able project assistance.

@ The Information Resource Division updated
and maintained the automated information sys-
tems in the Smithsonian Information Center and
produced some 20 publications, including mu-
seum floor plans in French, German, Japanese,
and Spanish.

External Affairs

Thomas E. Lovejoy, Assistant Secretary for
External Affairs

Office of the Assistant Secretary
Jor External Affairs

The Smithsonian Institution’s response to the
needs and concerns of its many external constitu-
encies is the primary responsibility of the Office
of the Assistant Secretary for External Affairs.
The office frames the Institution’s goals and im-
pact beyond the National Mall through the su-
pervision of its component units, effective use of
publications and electronic media, the hosting of
special events, and attention to the role of the
Smithsonian in national and international affairs.

m To enhance discussions of debt-for-nature
swaps, the office held a conference, ‘‘Debt-for-
Nature Swaps: Progress and Prospects.’’ Capitol
Hill action included hearings at which Assistant
Secretary for External Affairs Thomas E. Lovejoy
testified and that resulted in the passage of a bill
authorizing the use of $1.7 billion of U.S. bilat-
eral debt in debt-for-nature swaps.

@ Assistant Secretary Lovejoy presided over the
Biodiversity Roundtable organized by the Presi-
dent’s Council on Environmental Quality to dis-
cuss U.S. participation at the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development,
to be held in 1992.

@ Following a meeting near Moscow initiated by
the Soviet Ministry of Culture to discuss the im-
pact of twentieth-century events on the arts of the
United States and the Soviet Union, the Smith-
sonian hosted a meeting in December of arts
scholars from both countries organized by Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary Marc Pachter with the Of-
fice of the Assistant Secretary for Museums.

w Represented by Deputy Assistant Secretary
Pachter, the Smithsonian participated actively in
the President’s Committee on the Arts and the
Humanities, with special attention to its interna-
tional cultural advisory group, organized to
broaden national support for international cul-
tural exchange.

National Demonstration
Laboratory for Interactive
Educational Technologies

The mission of the National Demonstration Lab-
oratory (NDL) ts to increase public awareness of
the power of interactive educational technologies
and ultimately help strengthen the nation’s edu-
cational system. Visitors to the NDL can learn
about interactive technologies in an environment
that permits hands-on access and encourages dis-
cussion and questions. Seventeen work stations
introduced visitors to a wide range of education
and training programs that combine computers
and multimedia materials. This year, the NDL
was transferred from the Smithsonian to the Li-
brary of Congress.

@ A networked computer-based training lab
known as an Integrated Learning System was
added to the collection this year.

m= The NDL hosted a number of events ranging
from teacher workshops to international
competitions.

Office of Development

The Office of Development seeks private finan-
cial support from corporations, foundations, and
individuals to enable the Smithsonian to further
its goals and objectives. The office is responsible
for fund-raising in support of Institutional priori-
ties and selected bureau projects and programs. It
also provides leadership for and coordination of
fund-raising initiatives, including related market-
ing activities, throughout the Institution.

m Private sector giving to the Smithsonian in-
creased significantly from fiscal 1990. Corporate
giving increased by 50 percent, individual giving
by 30 percent, and foundation giving by 20 per-
cent. Substantial gifts include a $465,000 plan-
ning grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest
Fund for the Jazz at the Smithsonian program, a
collaboration of the National Museum of Ameri-
can History and the Smithsonian Institution Trav-
eling Exhibition Service; $450,000 from the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for the Biological
Diversity of Forest Fragments project at the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History; a bequest of
$300,000 from the Estate of Pauline Edwards,
half for the National Air and Space Museum and
half for the National Museum of American Att;
and $150,000 from the American Psychological
Association for the Experimental Gallery.

g The office initiated the first every-member so-
licitation of the Smithsonian National Board for
contributions to the Secretary's Special Fund, an
unrestricted pool of funds designated each year
by the secretary for a high-priority project. The
recipient in 1991 was a selection of Columbus
Quincentenary education programs and inau-
gural events. Funds raised from the board as of
September 30, 1991, totaled $148,500; the fund
drive will continue through December 31, 1991.
@ Gifts and grants to the Smithsonian in fiscal
1991 totaled $16.3 million, with initiatives in the
Office of Development contributing $5.8 million
of that amount.

Office of Government Relations

The Office of Government Relations represents
the Institution on matters of legislation, policy,
operations, and governance to the Congress and
other government entities at the federal, state,
and local levels. It is the primary conduit of legis-
lative information, as well as the advocate of
Smithsonian interests in the legislative process.

@ Legislation establishing the National Museum
of the American Indian and providing for re-
patriation of Native American remains and grave
goods occupied the office throughout the 1orst
Congress.

@ Areas of ongoing legislative activity include the
extension of the Smithsonian’s National Air and
Space Museum, biological diversity research and
conservation, land acquisition for continued eco-
logical research at the Smithsonian Environmen-
tal Research Center, and acquisition of an
administrative building for various Smithsonian
offices.

Office of International Relations

The Office of International Relations (OIR) pro-
vides technical assistance and diplomatic support
for Smithsonian programs abroad. It serves as the
link between the Smithsonian and foreign insti-
tutions or individuals, as well as international or-
ganizations and government agencies. The office
assists with the technical details of international
exchanges of museum objects and staff and ad-
ministers three funding programs to encourage
international cooperation in scholarly research
and museum programs.

@ The office provided international coordination
for a hemispheric project to develop an exhibition
on the rainforests of the Americas, involving en-
vironmental organizations and museums from 11
Latin American countries.

@ The office negotiated and coordinated a new
series of Smithsonian-Japanese research ex-
changes, to be undertaken in cooperation with

Smithsonian Institution Press

A full-fledged publishing house with an active
list of more than 600 titles, the Smithsonian In-
stitution Press is committed to serving both pro-
fessional scholars and sophisticated readers
attracted to serious thought and learning. Three
divisions contribute to its multifaceted program.
Smithsonian Books creates books accessible to
general readers on topics related to the Institu-
tion’s broad interests. The Smithsonian Collec-
tion of Recordings produces original and archival
sound recordings. The University Press publishes
scholarly nonfiction books and works with mu-
seum staff to develop publications for museum
visitors, children’s books, and guidebooks to the
Institution. The University Press division also ac-
quires publications in video format that are wor-
thy of inclusion under the Smithsonian
Institution Press imprint, some of them produced
in cooperation with the Visual Press of the Uni-
versity of Maryland.

@ The Press attracted enormous interest and at-
tention with the publication of Benjamin O.
Davis, Jr., American: An Autobiography, the life
story of the first black man to graduate from West
Point in this century. In the wake of the book’s
telease, General Davis appeared on several na-
tional television programs to discuss his
experiences.

a A new edition of the Official Guide to the
Smithsonian is now available in English, French,
German, Japanese, and Spanish, the result of
more than a year of photo collection and infor-
mation gathering.

@ The Press contributed to the Institution’s
Quincentenary observances with the successful
publication from Smithsonian Books, After Co-
lumbus: The Smithsonian Chronicle of the North
American Indians. The volume covets 500 years
of encounters and exchange between the Eu-
topeans and the North American Indians, offer-
ing an intimate portrait of the Indians and their
life-styles.

@ Through the Smithsonian Collection of Re-
cordings, the Press released the long-awaited col-
lection Folksong America: A Twentieth-Century
Revival. With 99 recorded selections covering
some 70 years and an accompanying 106-page
booklet, the collection has proved to be a popular
success and received much critical acclaim.

Smithsonian Magazine

Smithsonian is a monthly magazine provided as a
benefit of membership in the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. With a circulation of 2.2 million, Swzzth-
sonian is among the 30 largest magazines
published today. It appeals to its diverse audience
with articles on history, the environment, conset-
vation, the sciences, and the arts. Monthly fea-
tures include ‘‘Phenomena, Comment, and
Notes,’’ a commentary on nature and the natural
world; ‘‘Smithsonian Horizons,” a column by
the Smithsonian Secretary; and reviews of re-
cently released nonfiction. Smithsonian activities

Smithsonian National Assoctate
Program

The Smithsonian National Associate Program,
the national membership and public outreach
arm of the Institution, provides educational op-
portunities and activities for Associate members
and the general public in order to develop loyal
national and international constituencies for the
Smithsonian. These educational activities—edu-
cational tours, research expedition programs, lec-
tures, performances, workshops, and in-depth
seminars—deal with topics of concern to the In-
stitution and are designed to appeal to the cur-
rent National Associate membership and to
develop new constituencies. An important source
of income for the Institution, the Smithsonian
National Associate Program raises unrestricted
funds through surpluses generated by its activities

and through corporate and individual giving pro-
grams, including the Contributing Membership,
the James Smithson Society, and the Young
Benefactors.

m The number of Associates participating in tour
and seminar programs increased by 28 percent
this year. Smithsonian Odyssey Tours, a new pro-
gram of moderately priced tours, served more
than 1,400 Associates, while Smithsonian Semi-
nats enjoyed an 8o percent increase in enroll-
ment, offering such programs as ‘‘Broadcast
Journalism” and “‘Decorative Arts and Design.’
@ The total number of Contributing Member-
ship households surpassed 68 ooo, a 10 percent
increase over fiscal year 1990.

’

w James Smithson Society grants totaling
$430,000 were awarded to 17 Smithsonian proj-
ects. For the first time, members of the Smith-
sonian Council and a Regents Fellow served on
the grants review panel.

m The U.S. and International Events Division
added a new program coordinator for program-
ming that appeals to culturally diverse audiences
and embarked on an in-depth analysis of its mis-
sion and means of financial support.

Smithsonian Resident Associate
Program

The Resident Associate Program (RAP), the
Smithsonian’s privately supported, cultural, con-
tinuing education, membership, and outreach
arm for metropolitan Washington, continues its
mission to bring a rich mix of cultural and educa-
tional programs to its more than 145,000 area
members and to the general public. Each year
more than 300,000 persons attend its events,
which emphasize cultural diversity and world-
wide environmental concerns. RAP membership
has grown by more than 2,000 households since
fiscal year 1990, and the high membership reten-
tion rate continues to hold.

mw RAP’s 25th anniversary celebration dominated
its fall season with more than 4o programs featur-
ing such luminaries as Helen Hayes, Robert Red-
ford, Gordon Parks, and Richard E. Leakey.
These events generated new funds to support
RAP’s vital outreach efforts and to begin build-
ing an endowment for the program’s future.

w RAP now reaches national audiences in a num-
ber of ways, including cosponsorship with the
Teaching Company of weekend seminars, which
are videotaped for national distribution; taping
of lectures by Smithsonian Radio’s “‘Speakers
Corner”’ for broadcast on National Public Radio;
airing of Close Up Foundation’s ‘‘RAP and Black
History Month”’ on Cable News Network; and
three-day seminars for university, corporate, and
governmental leaders from across the country.

w Registration for Campus on the Mall broke re-
cords for three of four quarters this year. More
than 5,000 students now are regularly enrolled in
a single term. The new Campus on the Mall quar-
terly brochure helped reach out to new learners.
g Through its African American Studies Center,
RAP expands its programming to the local Afri-
can American community. Public service activities
include the scholarship program for inner-city
young people and adults; Discover Graphics, the
free printmaking program for local public high
school students and teachers; and the annual Kite
Festival on the National Mall. RAP has extended
the Discovery Theater season to include perfor-
mances in the summer months.

“Smithsonian World”’

“Smithsonian World,”’ the prime-time public
television series coproduced by the Institution
and WETA-TV of Washington, D.C., launched
its sixth and final season in the winter of 1991.
The critically acclaimed series explores people,
ideas, and events that shape world culture,
blending art, science, history, and the humanities
to create an exciting harmony among disciplines.
Programs feature scholars, museums, art, and re-
search facilities both within and beyond the
Smithsonian Institution.

g The five programs of the sixth season—on gen-
der, advertising, the information age, aging, and
perception—were broadcast nationally on PBS
from January through June 1991. Southwestern
Bell Corporation, sole corporate underwriter of
the series, funded a major advertising and pro-
motion campaign, as well as a highly successful

educational effort serving secondary schools.

m In September, the episode ‘‘The Quantum
Universe’’ was nominated for the prestigious
Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding In-
formational Series category. Ten other awards
were announced for past season programs, bring-
ing the total number of awards for the series to
more than 60.

w The approximate number of viewers per origi-
nal broadcast of ‘‘Smithsonian World’’ (seasons
four and five) was estimated at 5 million—a total
of about 25 million viewers in a typical season.

@ The 1991 season marked the final continuous
running season for the series owing to the lack of
underwriting support for the immediate future.

In all, 32 one-hour prime-time specials under the
‘*Smithsonian World’’ banner aired between 1984

and 1991.

As the national performing arts center, the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts pre-
sents and creates programming of the highest
standards that reflects the diverse cultural life of
the United States and recognizes the nation’s in-
ternational heritage. The Kennedy Center en-
courages an audience for the performing arts
from the widest possible population and,
through its commissioning and education pro-
grams, nurtures the arts and artists of today while
developing the audiences of tomorrow.

g In June, the nation’s capital was transformed
into Texas on the Potomac with the multi-

66
cultural, multimedia Texas Festival at the Ken-
nedy Center, funded by Exxon and other
generous donors from Texas. The first of many
such state and regional festivals, the Texas Festi-
val highlighted the rich cultural diversity of the
Lone Star State with a dazzling selection of thea-
ter, dance, music, film, and visual arts programs.

tute that uses the Kennedy Centet’s education
programs as models to help arts centers and
school systems initiate or expand their education
programs. Fourteen arts centers and neighboring
school systems participated in the first session.

m The Kennedy Center initiated two new leader-
ship donor programs, the 100 Club and the

National Gallery of Art

The National Gallery of Art, although formally
established as a bureau of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, is an autonomous and separately adminis-
tered organization governed by its own board of
trustees. The mission of the gallery is to serve the
United States in a national role by preserving,
collecting, exhibiting, and fostering the under-
standing of works of art at the highest possible
museum and scholarly standards.

mw The premier event in this year of achievement
was the gallery’s 5oth anniversary. In honor of the
occasion, the permanent collection galleries in
the West Building were refurbished and rehung
for the first time since the building was opened to
the public in 1941. The anniversary inspired an
outpouring of generosity from many gallery
friends, whose contributions included both works
of art and funds for the purchase of art. It culmi-
nated in a celebratory exhibition, “Art for the
Nation: Gifts in Honor of the 50th Anniversary
of the National Gallery of Art,’’ which attracted
many visitors, overwhelming attention, and criti-
cal acclaim.

g Gifts of funds totaling more than $25 million

were received from individuals, foundations, and
corporations for purposes other than exhibition
support. In addition, in honor of the soth anni-
versary, more than 180 donors from 21 states, the
District of Columbia, and five foreign countries
gave close to 1,500 paintings, sculptures, and
works of graphic art to the gallery’s collections.

@ The soth Anniversary Gift Committee raised
funds for art purchases, the most outstanding of
which was The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew,
a moving work by the major seventeenth-century
baroque artist Jusepe de Ribera. The commit-
tee—along with the Collectors Committee and
the Circle and with additional support from the
Abrams family in memory of Harry N. Abrams—
also provided funds to purchase Cakes, a painting
by contemporary American artist Wayne
Thiebaud.

@ The gallery announced the receipt of seven
grants from private foundations to support three
new priorities for educational programming: art
and technology, new publications, and teacher
training. The first National Conference on
Teacher Programs, scheduled for 1992, will bring
together more than 100 museum and university
art education specialists to discuss the creation of
local teacher enrichment programs. Also funded
were scholarships for two outstanding educators
in each state to attend the third National
Teachers Institute, which focused on European
Renaissance art and history.

@ Iwo exhibitions celebrated commemorative
years for the Venetian master Titian, whose birth

date is thought to be 500 years ago, and the
Flemish-born Anthony Van Dyck, who died 3,50
years ago in 1641. An exhibition of approximately
150 paintings, drawings, sculptures, and photo-
graphs by the contemporary American master
Robert Rauschenberg, collectively known as the
“Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange,”
included 29 works given to the gallery.

@ The second volume of the Systematic Cata-
logue of the collections, Spanish Paintings of the
Fifteenth through Nineteenth Centuries, by Jon-
athan Brown and Richard Mann, was published.
A video, Introduction to Sculpture, was produced
by the gallery’s audiovisual department in collab-
oration with the curators of sculpture and the ed-
ucation department and is being shown
continuously in the ground-floor sculpture gal-
leries. The Extension Service reached an esti-
mated audience of 86 million in the United
States and abroad through educational and pub-
lic television broadcasts and through short-term
and extended loans of materials.

Reading Is Fundamental, Inc.

Twenty-five years ago, Mrs. Robert McNamara
started the first Reading Is Fundamental (RIF)
project in Washington, D.C., to get books into
the hands of young people, to encourage them to
read, and to involve parents in their children’s
education. Since then, the RIF program has dis-
tributed more than 109 million books to young-
sters in all 50 states and in U.S. offshore
territories. Last year, some 121,000 citizens volun-
teered their time to run community-based RIF
projects serving nearly 3 million youngsters at
more than 12,600 sites, including schools, li-
braries, Head Start and other preschool pro-
grams, homeless shelters, migrant worker camps,
Native American reservations, hospitals, facilities
for children with disabilities, and juvenile deten-
tion centers.

m Children across the country celebrated 25 years
of promoting literacy during RIF’s annual Read-
ing Is Fun Week in April. In Washington, D.C.,
the Swiss Embassy hosted a celebration at which
First Lady Barbara Bush bestowed awards on the
winners of RIF’s two annual programs for young
people: In Celebration of Reading and the Na-
tional Poster Contest.
w To celebrate its silver anniversary, RIF stepped
up its efforts to serve more children, especially
those considered at high risk. Partnerships with
the private sector enabled RIF to add to its pro-
gram some 300,000 children at 1,000 sites and to
undertake a variety of initiatives, including a
three-year Kiwanis International program for
Head Start and other preschool children; RIF’s
Open Book program for children in homeless fa-
cilities; RIF’s City of Readers™ in Louisville,
Kentucky, which held a number of citywide read-
ing events; Shared Beginnings*™, RIF’s literacy
program for teen parents and their children; and
collaboration with adult literacy groups, which
was manifested in a growing number of family
literacy projects.

w RIF is developing reading programs for differ-
ent age groups, such as a program in Arkansas
targeted to fourth graders and RIF’s Running
Start™ program for first graders.

w ARIF program for teenagers gained national
recognition when President George Bush named
Club RIF of Mesa, Arizona, the 432nd Point of
Light, citing the teenagers’ establishment of a
RIF program for Native American children.

Woodrow Wilson International
Center for Scholars

The Woodrow Wilson Center is an institute for
advanced study established by Congress in 1968 as
the official memorial to the nation’s 28th presi-
dent. To honor the career and character of Wood-
row Wilson the center brings together the world
of learning and the world of public affairs, ad-
dressing the spectrum of human knowledge and
creativity, from arts and humanities to the sct-
ences. The center welcomes fellows and guest
scholars from around the world, sponsors discus-
sion programs, and conducts publishing and ra-
dio programs that deliver the results of scholarly
research to a wide audience.

@ The year 1991 was one of achievement and pub-
lic accolade for many of the Woodrow Wilson
Center’s former fellows. Lee Hong Koo, a fellow
in the Asia Program from 1973 to 1974, was
named Korea’s ambassador to England. Dennis
McLean, a recent guest scholar, now serves as New
Zealand’s ambassador to the United States. Hun-

garian sociologist Elemer Hankiss, who was a cen-
ter fellow, is director of Hungarian Television.
Richard Breitman, Prasenjit Duara, and Richard
Stites were awarded prizes for books that were re-
searched and written at the center.

@ In May 1991, the Woodrow Wilson Center
sponsored a series of lectures on modernism and
modern literature by the distinguished Irish liter-
ary scholar Denis Donoghue, a former guest
scholar.

wg The Woodrow Wilson Center was awarded a
$987,000 grant from the John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation to support a project on
the international history of the Cold War.

@ In collaboration with the Close Up Founda-
tion’s Washington Program, the center sponsored
a monthly seminar series for high school students.
The series has covered issues ranging from the
emergence of television as an important force in
the political process to the historical dimensions
of the Persian Gulf crisis.

@ The crisis in the Persian Gulf and its aftermath
provided a focal point for many of the Woodrow
Wilson Center’s programs and events during the
past year. Fellows explored topics related to the
tensions in the Middle East, and meetings ad-
dressed the conduct and implications of events in
the Gulf crisis.

w The center published six books during the past
year. In March 1991, the Johns Hopkins University
Press joined Cambridge University Press as a part-
ner of the Woodrow Wilson Center Press. Under
this joint endeavor, Johns Hopkins will copublish
volumes annually with the center and distribute
Woodrow Wilson Center Press titles.

In Apnil, the Woodrow
Wilson International

Center for Scholars cele-
brated the completion of
The Papers of Woodrow
Wilson by sponsoring a
conference on ‘The Lega-
cies of Woodrow
Wilson.’’ Here, U.S. Sen-
ator Dantel Patrick
Moynthan, former vice-
chairman of the Wilson
Center board, congratu-
lates Arthur S. Link, dt-
rector and editor of The
Papers of Woodrow
Wilson and professor of
American history, Prince-
ton University, at an eve-
ning dialogue honoring
Link's work.
Benefactors

The Smithsonian gratefully acknowledges the support of the indi-
viduals, foundations, and corporations whose gifts, bequests, and
contributing memberships aided the work of the Institution during
the past fiscal year, October 1, 1990, through September 30, 1991.

The Smithsonian owes its founding to the generosity of one indi-
vidual. During most of its history since 1846, the Institution has re-
lied on a combination of both federal and private funding to carry
out the terms of James Smithson’s will. As a trust instrumentality of
the United States, the Smithsonian has received federal appropria-
tions to support its basic operations and selected initiatives.

Private support plays a vital role in providing the Institution with
the flexibility and independence essential to its creative growth. The
national and international reputation for excellence held by the
Smithsonian is in large part a result of the innovative, imaginative,
and special activities underwritten by public-spirited private citi-
zens. Of particular importance are gifts that have supported the
Smithsonian’s core functions—exhibitions, collections acquisition,
research, and public education—that are central to its
achievements.

Certain donors have requested anonymity. If the name of any
other donor has been omitted, it is unintentional and in no way
lessens the Smithsonian’s appreciation.

Donors of volunteer service further enable the Smithsonian to ac-

complish a variety of programs and to offer expanded services to the

public. The names of our docents and behind-the-scenes volunteers

are listed annually in the Torch (the employee newsletter). In fiscal

1991, 4,797 volunteers gave 478,419 hours of their time. This invalu-

able corps of volunteers brings expertise, experience, and enthusi-

asm to their work here, and we express to them collectively our great

appreciation for their dedication to the Smithsonian Institution.

Smithsonian Contributing Members

The Contributing Members of the Smithsonian National Associates

support the Institution’s work through generous annual

contributions.

The James Smithson Society was created in 1977 to encourage and

recognize major gifts to the Institution. The Society, which is the

highest level of Contributing Membership, is composed of Annual

Members ($2,000), Life Members (appointed before 1985 for con-
tributing significant gifts to the Institution), and Endowed Life
Members. Endowed Life Members are individuals who make a one-

ume gift of $40,000, or a pledge of $45,000 not to exceed a three-
year period, to become lifetime Society Members. Extraordinary

contributions to the Smithsonian are recognized through the Soci-
ety’s Founder Medal award and its accompanying Life Membership.

The Smithsonian gratefully acknowledges here the generous sup-

port of the James Smithson Society and the Patron Members
($1,200) of the Contributing Membership.

Financial Report

Nancy D. Suttenfield, Chief Financial Officer

The Smithsonian concluded the year with a balanced unrestricted
trust fund budget despite an increasingly weak national and local
economy, which took a toll on virtually all revenue-producing auxil-
iary activities. However, a balanced budget was only accomplished by
using previously established reserves and making significant cuts to
existing budgets. Further cuts to baseline expenditures are required in
fiscal 1992 to bring costs within reduced levels of income.

Despite continuing fiscal constraints facing federal budget policy
makers, the Institution’s appropriation support provided core fun-
ding for programs and operations and limited support for several new
initiatives, primarily in the areas of cultural pluralism, the environ-
ment, and education. Modest support was provided to address Smith-
sonian infrastructure needs. However, a large backlog of identified
needs in this category remains unfunded and will take most of the
current decade to eliminate at recent rates of funding increases.

Operations

Federal appropriations provided $272,880,000 to fund ongoing oper-
ations, approximately 14 percent more than fiscal 1990 after exclud-
ing the $15.0 million pass-through for the Kennedy Center. New
program support included $1.4 million to reduce Smithsonian Insti-
tution Traveling Exhibition Service participation fees, $1.0 million for
the National Museum of American Art’s Inventory of Outdoor Sculp-
ture, and $500,000 for Global Change research.

Government agencies provided project grants and contracts to fund
research at the Smithsonian. Funding provided by the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration, principally to the Smithsonian As-
trophysical Observatory, increased $8.0 million over the prior year.

Nonappropriated income from gifts, grants, endowments, current
investments, and revenue-producing activities supplemented funds
from federal sources. Unrestricted trust funds were allocated to cover
their proper share of administrative costs and other Institution-wide
program priorities. Allocations were made, as in the past but at re-

duced levels, to fund internal award programs for acquisitions, special
exhibitions, fellowships, scholarly studies, and educational outreach.
In addition, $2.3 million in revenue generated from auxiliary enter-
prises was transferred to endowment following past practice to build
this important asset for the future.

The Smithsonian is especially grateful to its many friends in the
private sector whose generosity contributed vitally to its work. Donors
are listed in the Benefactors section of this annual report.

Endowment

The Smithsonian endowment fund reached an all-time high of
$348.9 million during the fiscal year. However, the market value of
the endowment had dropped to $313.8 million by the close of the fis-
cal year, at which time the Institution had 33 percent of its portfolio

equities. The total return for the fiscal year was 24.7 percent.

The Institution continues to use its two balanced managers: Fiduct-
ary Trust Company of New York and Miller, Anderson and Sherrerd
for the majority of its holdings.

Regent Barnabas McHenry chaired the Investment Policy Commit-
tee of the Board of Regents. Having completed his term as regent,
Mr. McHenry leaves the committee after five years of dedicated ser-
vice. The Institution is very grateful for the counsel and leadership
that he provided to the committee. Regent William Bowen will re-
place Mr. McHenry as acting chair of the committee. The Institution
remains indebted to committee members Donald Moriarty, Charles
H. Mott, Jane Mack Gould, John W. English, Thomas J. Keresey, and
Regent Norman Mineta for their continuing service.

Construction and Plant Funds

In addition to its appropriation for salaries and other operating ex-
penses, the Institution receives federal support for the construction,
repair, and restoration of facilities. In fiscal 1991, $31,190,000 was
appropriated for work on fire detection and suppression systems, util-
ities, facade restoration and replacement, and routine repairs. Appro-
priations for other construction activities included $4,982,000 for
minor construction and construction planning.

Also, $1,542,000 was provided for new Smithsonian Tropical Re-
search Institute research facilities; $7,391,000 for the planned Na-
tional Museum of the American Indian; and $1,492,000 for the
National Museum of Natural History East Court project. A separate
appropriation of $6,636,000 allowed the National Zoological Park to
continue a repair program and other projects in its master plan.

Financial Management Activities

To improve financial management activities, the Smithsonian estab-
lished the position of Assistant Secretary for Finance and Administra-
tion and vested that position with responsibility as Chief Financial
Officer of the Institution. All financial offices report to the chief fi-
nancial officer. Additionally, current staff were redeployed to create
the Office of Financial and Management Analysis, a resource to im-
prove the delivery of financial services and to examine the cost effec-
tiveness of programs and operations.

Although progress was being made on the implementation of a
new accounting system, the new chief financial officer halted the
project temporarily to reaffirm the vision for the new system and to

revalidate system requirements and software. Changes in the comput-
ing environment have necessitated brief studies to reevaluate com-
puter capacity and operating system requirements. To ensure that the
eventual system meets the needs of its primary user and operator, the
responsibility for the project was assigned to the comptroller.

The Institution’s finance offices are taking part in an effort to im-
prove the quality of their products and services and the cost effective-
ness of their work by applying the principles of Total Quality
Management (TQM). All financial staff will receive training so that
planning for and implementation of TQM can begin in fiscal 1992.

Audit Activities

The Institution’s funds, federal and nonappropriated, are audited an-
nually by an independent public accounting firm, currently Coopers
& Lybrand. Coopers & Lybrand’s unqualified report for fiscal 1991 1s
reprinted on the following pages. The Smithsonian’s internal audit
staff, part of the Office of the Inspector General, regularly reviews the
Institution’s financial activities and fiscal systems, assists the outside
auditors, and undertakes special projects as required. The Defense
Contract Audit Agency audits grants and contracts received from fed-
eral agencies and monitors allocated administrative costs.

The Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Regents, chaired
by Regent David C. Acheson, met three times during the fiscal year
pursuant to its fiduciary responsibilities under legislation pertinent to
the Institution and the bylaws of the Board of Regents. The commit-
tee reviewed the 1990 audit performed by Coopers & Lybrand and the
1991 audit plan and received reports from the Office of the Inspector
General on a wide variety of Institutional programs and procedures.

Related Organizations

The National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Per-
forming Arts, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars were established by Congress within the Institution. Each or-
ganization is administered by its own board of trustees and reports in-
dependently on its financial status. The Smithsonian provides the
Wilson Center with certain fiscal, administrative, and support services
plus office space on a reimbursement basis.

Administrative services are provided by the Institution on a con-
tract basis for Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. The Friends of the Na-
tional Zoo (FONZ), an independent nonprofit organization, operates
under a concessions contract; proceeds accrue to the Zoo.

Note 1: The funds applied for FY 1990 were regrouped to be consistent with organizational changes that occurred in FY 1991.

Note 2: The fund balance for federal funds represents no-year unobligated funds for instrumentation, collections acquisitions, repatriation, and exhibitions.
Also, included in this amount are unobligated funds from FY 1991, FY 1990, and FY 1989 annual appropriation accounts.

Note 3: Excludes $1,961 thousand received in FY 1990 and $837 thousand received in FY 1991 from the Department of State for research projects in India.

Report of Independent Accountants
To the Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition
of the Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1991, and the
related statement of financial activity for the year then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Institution’s man-
agement. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit. We previously audited and
reported upon the financial statements of the Smithsonian Institution
for the year ended September 30, 1990, totals of which are included
in the accompanying financial statements for comparative purposes
only.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and dis-
closures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Smith-
sonian Institution as of September 30, 1991, and the results of its
operations for the year then ended, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. :

Smithsonian Institution
Notes to Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation

These financial statements do not include the accounts of the
National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Perform-
ing Arts, or the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars,
which were established by Congress within the Smithsonian Institu-
tion (the Institution) but are administered under separate boards of
trustees.

The financial statements of the Institution with respect to Federal
Appropriations have been prepared on the obligation basis of ac-
counting, which is in accordance with accounting principles pre-
scribed by the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth
in the Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agen-
cies. The obligation basis of accounting differs in some respects from
generally accepted accounting principles. Under this method of ac-
counting, approximately $44,458,000 of commitments of the oper-
ating fund, such as purchase orders and contracts, have been
recognized as expenditures, and the related obligations have been re-
ported on the Statement of Financial Condition at September 30,
1991, even though the goods and services have not been received.
Approximately $12,042,000 of these commitments are for grants un-
der the foreign currency program. Approximately $9,961,511 of these
commitments are for internal storage facilities and equipment at the
Museum Support Center. In addition, construction fund commit-
ments for other projects amounted to approximately $37,328,000 at
September 30, 1991.

The trust funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds ob-
tained from private sources, government grants and contracts, invest-
ment income, and certain business activities related to the operations
of the Institution.

Fund Accounting

To ensure observance of the limitations and restrictions placed on the
use of resources available to the Institution, accounts are maintained
in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. This procedure
classifies resources for control, accounting, and reporting purposes
into distinct funds established according to their appropriation, na-
ture, and purposes. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund;
however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have
similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accord-
ingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by
fund group.

The assets, liabilities, and fund balances of the Institution are self-
balancing as follows:

Federal operating funds represent the portion of appropriated
funds available for support of Institution operations.

Federal construction funds represent that portion of appropriated
funds available for building and facility construction, restoration,
renovation, and repair. Separate subfund groups are maintained for
each appropriation—Construction and Improvements, National Zoo-
logical Park, Restoration and Renovation of Buildings, Museum Sup-
port Center, and the Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian
Cultures (Quadrangle).

Federal capital funds represent the value of those assets of the Insti-
tution acquired with federal funds and nonexpendable property
transfers from government agencies.

Trust current funds, which include unrestricted and restricted re-

go

sources, represent the portion of nonappropriated funds available for
support of Institution operations. Amounts restricted by the donor
for specific purposes are segregated from other current funds.

Trust endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject
to restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the
principal be invested and that only income be utilized. Also classified
as endowment and similar funds are gifts that allow the expenditure
of principal only under certain specified conditions. Quasi-endow-
ment funds are funds established by the governing board for the same
purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion of such funds
may be expended with board approval. Restricted quasi-endowment
funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipula-
tion that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of
time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and
expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.

Trust plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant ac-
quisitions and funds expended for plant.

Investments

All investment income, except that of endowment and similar funds,
and gains and losses arising from the sale of investments and property
are accounted for in the fund in which the related assets are recorded.
Income of endowment and similar funds is accounted for in the fund
to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenue in unrestricted
current funds. Gains and losses on the sale of investments are recog-
nized on the trade date basis using the average cost method.

Inventory

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is deter-
mined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or retail cost
method (for those inventories held for resale). Merchandise inventory
approximated $17,355,000 and materials and supplies inventory ap-
proximated $1,766,000 at September 30, 1991.

Deferred Revenue and Expense

Revenue from subscriptions to Szzzthsoniam magazine and Air &
Space /Smithsonian magazine is recorded as income over the period of
the related subscription, which is generally one year. Costs related to
obtaining subscriptions to S7zzthsonian magazine and Air & Space/
Smithsonian magazine are charged against income over the period of
the subscription.

The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other
auxiliary activities during the period in which the activity is
conducted.

Works of Art, Living or Other Specimens

The Institution acquires its collections, which include works of art, li-
brary books, photographic archives, objects, and specimens, through
purchase by federal or private funds or by donation. In accordance
with policies generally followed by museums, no value is assigned to
the collections on the statement of financial condition. Purchases for
the collections are expensed currently. Proceeds from the deaccessions
are designated for future collection acquisitions.

Property and Equipment—Federal Funds

Property and equipment purchased with federal funds are recorded in
the capital funds at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives as follows:

Buildings 30 years
Major renovations 15 years
Nonexpendable equipment 10 years
Certain lands occupied by the Institution’s buildings were appro-
priated and reserved by Congress for the Institution and are not re-
flected in the accompanying financial statements. Property and
nonexpendable equipment acquired through transfer from govern-
ment agencies are capitalized at the transfer price or at estimated
amounts, taking into consideration usefulness, condition, and market
value.

Property and Equipment—Trust Funds

Property and equipment purchased with trust funds for use by non-
income-producing activities are recorded at cost, or appraised value at
date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in the Chesapeake Bay
and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal
values. Property and equipment are treated as a deduction of the cur-
rent fund and as a capitalized cost of the plant fund.

Property and equipment for use by nonincome-producing activities
are depreciated on the straight-line basis over their useful lives as
follows:

Buildings 30 years
Major renovations 15 years
Equipment 10 years

Depreciation is recorded in the plant fund as a deduction to the in-
vestment in plant.

Capital improvements and equipment purchased with trust funds
and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized at cost and
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 3 to 10 years.

Government Grants and Contracts

The Institution has a number of grants and contracts with the U.S.
Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the
Institution. Grant and contract revenue is recognized within trust
funds as expenditures are incurred.

Pledges

The Institution records significant pledges based upon letters signed
by donors. Pledges are recorded at net realizable value as a receivable
and as deferred revenue on the statement of financial condition. Rev-
enue from pledges is recognized in the year the pledged funds are
collected.

Gifts, Bequests, and Other Grants

The Institution recognizes revenue from gifts, bequests, and other
grants in the year the cash is received.

Contributed Services

A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made significant
contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s pro-
grams. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Annual Leave

The Institution’s civil service employees earn annual leave in
accordance with federal law and regulations. However, only the cost
of the leave taken as salaries is funded and recorded as an expense.
The cost of unused annual leave at year-end is reflected in the accom-
panying financial statements as an asset and an accrued liability in the
federal funds.

Annual leave is expensed for trust employees in the trust fund as
earned.

2. Related Activities

The Institution provides certain fiscal and administrative services to
several separately incorporated organizations in which certain officials
of the Institution serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to
the Institution by these organizations for the aforementioned services,
together with rent for Institution facilities occupied, totaled $275,000
($200,000 for the trust funds and $75,000 for the federal funds) for
the year ended September 30, 1991. Deposits held in custody for
these organizations were $4,476,000 as of September 30, 1991.

The following summarizes the unaudited expenditures of these or-
ganizations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1991, as reflected
in their individual financial statements, which are not included in the
accompanying financial statements of the Institution:

Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. $8,709,000
Woodrow Wilson International
Center for Scholars:
Federal appropriations $5,047,000
Trust funds $1,899,000

3. Investments

Investments are recorded at cost on a trade date basis, if purchased, or
estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition, if acquired by
gift. At September 30, 1991, investments were composed of the fol-
lowing:

Carrying Market

Current Funds:
Short-term investments $ 60,893 $ 61,173
Endowment and Similar funds:

Subtotal nonpooled investments 1,708 1,912
265,592 314,173
Plant funds:
Common stock 125 192
Total investments $375,538

$326,610

The deposit with the U.S. Treasury is invested in U.S Government
securities at a variable yield based on market rates.

Substantially all the investments of the endowment and similar
funds are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with
each individual fund subscribing to, or disposing of, units on the
basis of the per unit market value at the beginning of the month in
which the transaction takes place. Of the total units, each having a
market value of $378.07, 319,587 units were owned by endowment
funds, and 506,355 units were owned by quasi-endowment funds at
September 30, 1991.

The following tabulation summarizes changes in relationships be-
tween cost and market values of the pooled investments at September
30, 1991.

4. Endowment and Similar Funds

The Institution utilizes the ‘total return’’ approach to investment
management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Un-
der this approach, an amount equal to the difference between actual
interest and dividends earned during the year and the amount com-
puted under the total return formula is transferred to or from the cur-
rent funds.

In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide,
as being available for current expenditures, an amount taking into
consideration such factors as, but not limited to: (1) 4'/2% of the
five-year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts
and transfers during this period), (2) current dividend and interest
yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scientists, and (4) inflation-
ary factors as measured by the Consumer Price Index. However, where
the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less than
110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation),
the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends
received.

The total return factor for 1991 was $11.37 per unit, equivalent to
4% of the five-year average of the Market Value of each participating
fund. Actual dividends and interest earned exceeded the total return
for the year, and this excess was transferred from the current funds to
the endowment funds (see Note 12).

5. Receivables

Receivables at September 30, 1991, included the following:

($000s)

6. Advance Payments

Advance payments represent prepayments made to government agen-
cies, educational institutions, firms, and individuals for services to be
rendered, or property or materials to be furnished.

As of September 30, 1991, the Institution had advances outstand-
ing to the General Services Administration of $8,823,000, principally
for construction services, including the Museum Support Center and
other projects to be completed in future fiscal years. The Institution
at that date also had advances outstanding to educational institutions
amounting to approximately $1,837,000, principally under the Spe-
cial Foreign Currency Program.

7. Property and Equipment

At September 30, 1991, property and equipment comprised the
following:

Included in the accumulated depreciation of the federal capital
funds is $22,408,000 of depreciation expense for 1991.

Depreciation and amortization expense in the trust funds for fiscal
year 1991 for income-producing assets amounted to $2,668,000 and is
included in the current funds. Depreciation of nonincome-producing
equipment and buildings for 1991 amounted to $2,582,736 and is in-
cluded in the plant fund. The balance of the plant fund at September
30, 1991, included $6,405,064 of unexpected funds for future plant
acquisitions.

8. Commitments and Contingencies

Leases for various Smithsonian warehouse and office spaces provide
for escalation of rents to coincide with increases in property taxes, op-
erating expenses attributable to the leased property, and the Con-
sumer Price Index.

The Institution’s operating leases require future minimum lease
payments as follows:
Lease payments (000s)
1992 $ 5,672,323
1993 5,478,231
1994 5,042,549
1995 3,075,628
1996 442,320

Thereafter 222,083
$19,933,134

Rental expense for office facilities aggregated approximately
$4,701,100 in 1991.

The Institution receives funding or reimbursement from govern-
mental agencies for various activities, which are subject to audit.
Audits of sponsored program costs have been completed through Sep-
tember 30, 1988; however, final resolution from the cognizant agency
for audits of fiscal years 1983 through 1988 has not occurred. Any ad-
justments that may result from those audits and the audits for fiscal
years 1989 through 1991 are not expected to have a material effect on
the Institution’s financial statements.

9. Long-term Debt

Long-term debt as of September 30, 1991, consists of the following:

($000s)
9% note payable to The Riggs National Bank, interest only
payable quarterly commencing December 31, 1986; interest and
principal payable quarterly commencing September 30, 1991
and ending on June 30, 1998 $10,714
$10,714

The aggregate amount due for all borrowings for the years ending
September 30, are as follows: $1,211 in 1992, $1,324 in 1993, $1,447
in 1994, $1,582 in 1995, $1,729 in 1996, and $3,421 in years
thereafter.

The proceeds of the note with The Riggs National Bank were used
to fund construction of a restaurant addition to the National Air and
Space Museum. Approximately $990,000 was recorded as interest ex-
pense and was paid by Auxiliary Activities funds for fiscal year 1991.

On December 18, 1991, the Institution entered into a debt agree-
ment in the amount of $3,800,000 for the purpose of financing a
warehouse facility. The note bears interest at a rate equal to 1% in ex-
cess of the Federal Funds Rate, which was 4.56% on December 31,
1991. The unpaid principal balance of this note is payable in quar-
terly installments of $63,333 until December 31, 1996. The remain-
ing unpaid principal balance is due December 31, 1996.

10. Federal Operating Funds

The federal operating funds include appropriations for salaries and
expenses that are expended in the year received. Also included are
amounts approximating $18,136,000 received with the provision that
such amounts can be expended over a period greater than one year.

On November 5, 1990, the U.S. Congress enacted Public Law
101-510, the Defense Authorization Act, which prescribes the rules
determining the availability of appropriation balances and establishes
the procedures for closing appropriation accounts.

The major purpose of the act is to restructure annual appropriation
accounts. Beginning with the fiscal year 1989 appropriation accounts,
agencies are now required to maintain annual appropriations for a six-
year period. At the end of an appropriation’s six-year life, the appro-
Pfiation account is closed and any unobligated balances are then re-
turned to the U.S. Treasury. The act also provides for the phasing out

of unexpended previous year’s appropriations as of September 30,
1993.

Under the act, unobligated balances of annual appropriation ac-
counts from fiscal years 1989 and 1990, totaling $829,5 14, were re-
turned by the U.S. Treasury to the Smithsonian Institution and will
remain on the Institution’s records until the appropriation accounts
are closed.

The federal operating funds for the year ended September 30,
1991, included the following:

($000s)

$272,880 $996 $829 $8,089

The Institution has recorded an unrealized loss of $413,766 to reflect
exchange rate changes related to the U.S. India Fund.

On July 11, 1990, a settlement was awarded in the amount of
$3,022,350 arising out of a suit against the United States by a contrac-
tor who was defaulted by the General Services Administration for fail-
ure to complete a project for the Museum Support Center in a timely
fashion. This mandatory obligation falls outside the provisions of the
Antideficiency Act. According to accounting principles prescribed by
the Comptroller General of the United States, the Institution recog-
nized this expense, in fiscal year 1990, when settlement by the United
States resulted in an operating fund deficit. The Institution will re-
ceive appropriations in fiscal year 1992 of approximately $1,007,000
as a partial payment of the claim. The Institution will request appro-
priated funds in fiscal years 1993 and 1994 to pay the balance of the
claim.

11. Collections

In accordance with policies generally followed by museums, collec-
tions purchased and donated are not included in the statement of fi-
nancial condition. The Institution records the acquisition of
collections as an expense in the year of purchase and records the deac-
cession of collections as restricted revenue in the year of sale. For fiscal
year 1991, $4,924,997 was expensed to trust funds and $1,054,214 to
federal funds for the acquisition of collections and proceeds from
deaccessions in trust funds were $1,401,567. There were no deacces-
sions of collections purchased with federal funds in fiscal year 1991.

12. Transfer among Funds

The following transfers increased (decreased) respective fund balances
for the year ended September 30, 1991:

Total transfers among
funds $(1,253) — $(5,834) $8,840 $(1,753)

13. Retirement

The federal employees of the Institution are covered by either the
Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employee Re-
tirement System (FERS). The features of both of these systems are de-
fined in published government documents. Under both systems, the
Institution withholds from the salary of each federal employee the
percentage of salary required; the Institution also contributes spe-
cified percentages. The cost of the programs for the year ended Sep-
tember 30, 1991, was $11,716,833.

The Institution has a separate retirement plan for trust employees.
Under the plan, both the Institution and the employees contribute
stipulated percentages of salary, which are used to purchase individual
annuities, the rights to which are immediately vested with the em-
ployees. The Institution’s cost of the plan for the year ended Septem-
ber 30, 1991, was $6,482,000.

It is the policy of the Institution to fund the accrued costs of all
plans currently. There are no unfunded prior service costs under the
plans.

14. Income Taxes

The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions
of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations de-
scribed in that section are taxable only on their unrelated business in-
come. No provision for income taxes is required for the year ended
September 30, 1991, since the Institution had a net loss from unre-
lated business activity.

It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxa-
tion as an instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section
501(c)(1) of the Code. Organizations described in that section are ex-
empt from all income taxation. The Institution has not as yet formally
sought such dual status.

Statement by the
Secretary

Robert McC. Adams

The Smithsonian's collections, a treasure of incal-
culable scientific and cultural value held in trust
for the nation, are the Institution’s central focus.
This was not the case initially, although a mu-
seum and art gallery were mandated in the origi-
nal Smithsonian Bill of Incorporation, passed by
the Congress in 1846. The will of the Smithson-
ian’s founder, James Smithson, had identified its
purpose as “the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge,” and Joseph Henry, a noted physical scien-
tist and the first secretary, identified research as
the primary objective. At first there were, in any
case, neither funds nor facilities to pursue the goal
of amassing and exhibiting collections.

The gradual change of direction at the Smith-
sonian owes much to Spencer Baird, whom Henry
recruited as his assistant in 1850, and who later
succeeded him. Baird had begun his own formid-
able natural history collection while still a youth,
notably including some 750 species of American
and European birds. That collection, as well as a
larger concern for the importance of collections
and museums, accompanied him to Washington,
and this concern has remained with us ever since.

The search for new knowledge in a number of
fields remains a primary activity of the Institu-
tion, albeit one that today is seldom as visible to
the public as the exhibitions in our museums. But
while growing slowly, collections increase cumula-
tively in importance and spread unexpectedly into
new areas of relevance. In this way they have be-

come a magnet, helping to attract millions of visi-
tors to our nation’s capital every year. At the same
time, they pose a cascade of new questions, becom-
ing a magnet for scientists and scholars as well.
Much of our own staff's current research also is de-
voted to the puzzles and opportunities that our
own collections now are bringing to the fore. The
present total of some 140 million objects is un-
rivaled anywhere; that number staggers our imagi-
nations, as it surely would have Baird’s.

Welcome as this development is, we can never
lose sight of the accompanying challenges in man-
agement, conservation, and display. This annual
report is intended to provide readers with an over-
view of how we are meeting these challenges.
Most impressive is their almost overwhelming di-
versity, and the corresponding ingenuity and com-
plexity of the responses they call for.

Vast as our exhibition spaces are in what has
grown over the years to an aggregate of 16 muse-
ums and galleries and the National Zoo, it is obvi-
ous that only a small proportion of the immense
number of objects in our collections can ever be
found on exhibit at any one time. Yet it must be
emphasized that what remains out of sight 1s not
static and inert but living and changing. New ac-
quisitions continuously broaden and deepen the
value of the collections as a scholarly resource.
Fresh classifications and interpretive theories
emerge, based on the application to the collec-
tions of newly developed methodologies or the rec-
ognition of new problems awaiting study. In this
process, new features of objects may emerge as sig-
nificant, or objects formerly viewed as singular
may come to be better understood as having sev-
eral components that deserve separate status.

Conservation of collections, too, is a science in
continuous flux. It is being improved in many re-
spects by a host of new technologies, but at the
same time made more urgent by accelerating envi-
ronmental damage and the complex interactions
and unassured permanence of many artificial, hi-
tech materials that are flooding into popular use.
Limited, highly selective deaccessioning some-
times can strengthen our own holdings through
exchanges with other museums, or advance the
pace of research by making unneeded duplicates
available to specialists elsewhere. Since the flow is
seldom predictable or even, the burden of the ba-
sic paperwork needed to keep track of so many dif-
ferent kinds of transactions and moving parts can
be at times almost overwhelming.
Currently adding to this burden is the difficult
budgetary climate in which the Institution must
make its long-range plans as well as conduct its
daily operations. The Office of Management and
Budget and the Congress have been generous, at a
time when growing deficits have limited the in-
creases for most federally funded activities. But
mandated increases have for the most part been di-
rected toward the support of new programs and
facilities. When provision is made for the high
proportion of our costs represented by staff salaries
and benefits, funds to maintain previously ex-
isting programs have actually declined.

Exacerbating this problem has been the eco-
nomic recession, from which the country ts only
now emerging. Nonappropriated funds (net of the
expenses of our auxiliary activities) are used to
cover some 20 percent of the Institution's opera-
tions. Some of these funds are drawn from trust
and investment income reflecting earlier private
donations. But a larger proportion is more depen-
dent on the general state of economic well-being,
since it derives from the Smithsonian’s own busi-
ness activities—the Smzthsonian and Air & Spacel
Smithsonian magazines, the Smithsonian Press,
and our museum shops, restaurants, catalogue
sales, and product licensing. Funding from some
of these sources has not merely leveled off but
substantially declined, placing in jeopardy the
special uses to which nonappropriated funds are
devoted. This includes key categories like collec-
tions acquisition, special exhibitions, research, fel-
lowships, educational outreach, and new project
initiation.

We have clearly entered an era in which the
prospect of general growth, at a rate equivalent to
that characterizing several past decades, is no
longer realistic. Selective reductions may prove
necessary in some programs that are less effective
or central to our mission. Growth, where it does
occur, henceforth will require trade-offs of com-
pensating reductions in other activities. This 1s, in
fact, an era in which our first order of business 1s
to reassess carefully our ordering of priorities. To
do so is not a task for a single occasion, but rather
one that will need frequent repetition as we ap-
proach a new century. Considerable progress has
been made toward a reordering consistent with
the needs and opportunities that lie ahead of the
Smithsonian in the late 1990s. On that basis, we
have commenced with a modest downsizing of the
scale of operations so that it conforms more closely

with what can be foreseen as the resources avail-
able for it.

Concurrent with the careful and deliberate re-
duction in scale is an ongoing restructuring of the
Institution. This has several objectives. Greater
economies of operations are prominent among
them. Our primary goal, however, 1s to ensure
the Smithsonian reputation for excellence of re-
search and quality of public service even as a
leaner scale of operations is achieved.

Among other aspects of this restructuring are a
reduction in organizational complexity and a
clearer delineation of lines of authority. The objec-
tive is to speed and simplify decision-making,
both by bringing responsibility closer to those 1m-
mediately affected and by improving accountabil-
ity and eliminating redundancies. Consistent with
the principles of total quality management, em-
phasis has been placed on incentives for improved,
more responsive, and cost-effective service at every
level. These efforts were initiated by Under Secre-
tary Carmen Turner prior to her death in April
1992 and have been expanded and implemented
by her successor Constance Berry Newman.

It is compellingly evident that the receipt of
nonappropriated funds is more important to the
Smithsonian now than at any time in the past.
The generosity of private citizens throughout the
nation who, themselves, exemplify the spirit of
the Smithsonian presents me with an opportunity
to express my deep gratitude. Through their sup-
port, our volunteers, benefactors, and foundations
and corporations that have come to our assistance,
add a special dimension to the Smithsonian and
help to sustain some of the Institution’s core pro-
grams. Of particular note during fiscal 1992, the
Institution received four gifts in excess of one mil-
lion dollars each. The Benefactors section of Smzth-
sonian Year is dedicated to the many donors who
have helped to make the Smithsonian an exciting
and vibrant place. We are truly grateful.

Report of the
Board of Regents

This annual report briefly reviews the governing
activities of the Board of Regents conducted at
three meetings in 1992 (February 3, May 11, and
September 21) with the help of their supporting
committees and the secretary.

After receiving a comprehensive report on the
availability of collections, the regents endorsed
the establishment of the National African Ameri-
can Museum within the Smithsonian's Arts and
Industries Building. The proposed legislation
would also establish a 23-member board of trust-
ees for the museum.

In the context of having often discussed the dis-
persal of Smithsonian activities, the regents consid-
ered a proposal for a physical sciences museum as a
Smithsonian branch in Arlington, Texas. While
the board saw value in the establishment of a mu-
seum associated with the Super-Conducting Super
Collider Project and agreed to provide advice to-
ward this end, it rejected any formal affiliation
with the Smithsonian.

An organizational review presented to the
Board of Regents in February contained recom-
mendations on management responsibilities,
changes in organizational structure, and improved
delivery of certain administrative and program-re-
lated services. Changes to selected assistant secre-
taries’ titles clarified responsibilities and elimi-
nated dual reporting relationships. As a result of
other recommendations, the Office of Public Af-
fairs and the Office of Government Relations now
report directly to the under secretary, and the Res-
ident and National Associate Programs are being
merged.

The legal investigation and indictment of a re-
searcher for activities in Asia led the regents to re-

view their policy on the indemnification of Smith-
sonian officers, directors, and staff. The regents
also noted that the Institution is revising policies
and procedures for the administration of honorary
research associates and other researchers not on its
payroll. The secretary announced that a new pol-
icy regarding field collecting for research is to be
incorporated into the Institution’s revised policy
on collections management.

At their February meeting the regents recorded
their appreciation for Dr. William G. Bowen's
outstanding service as a member of the board and
designated him a regent emeritus. The regents
also approved the appointment of I. Michael Hey-
man as Chairman of their Nominating Commit-
tee; nominated Wesley S. Williams, Jr., from the
District of Columbia, and Barber B. Conable, Jr.,
of New York, for vacancies on the board; voted to
present the Samuel Pierpont Langley Medal to
Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., for his outstanding con-
tributions to aviation; designated the photo lab at
the National Zoo as the Barbara Watkins McEI-
hinny Lab in recognition of her contributions to
the Zoo and to photography; and voted to pur-
chase and improve property for a field research sta-
tion at Bocas del Toro, Panama. Secretary Robert
McC. Adams reported that he had awarded the
Secretary's Gold Medal for Exceptional Service to
Margaret C. Gaynor, the Institution’s director of
government relations.

Mr. Adams introduced a paper he wrote to
prompt discussion on one of the Smithsonian’s
perennial challenges: how best to represent and
communicate the present state of knowledge
within the contentious domain of American and
world culture. In a wide-ranging discussion, the
regents expressed appreciation for the secretary's
paper and encouraged him to publish it (see
“Smithsonian Horizons” in Swzthsonian magazine,
April 1992).

At the May meeting, Mr. Adams paid tribute
to the late Carmen Turner, who died in April
after serving as under secretary since December
1990. The board shared the secretary's apprecia-
tion for the permanent contributions she made to
the Smithsonian in her brief tenure.

The regents applauded the Smithsonian Na-
tional Board’s initiative and approved in principle
the proposed establishment of a special fund to
attract significant donations for enhanced support
of the Institution’s programs. Cognizant of the
strains on the Institution’s budget, the regents en-

|
couraged the secretary to explore the possibility of
soliciting voluntary contributions in museums on

an experimental basis. Mr. Adams indicated that

further study will be conducted on security, pub-

lic relations, and related considerations.

The secretary discussed the controversial issue
of quilts being reproduced under Smithsonian
license. He noted that new sources of production
are being sought and several educational programs
are being planned to promote the quilters’ craft.

The regents reviewed the applicability of the
Freedom of Information Act to the Smithsonian.
While the Institution has consistently used the
principles of the Freedom of Information Act as a
guide in responding to public requests for docu-
ments, the Smithsonian has not been legally re-
quired to do so. The U.S. Department of Justice
recently reaffirmed that view, notwithstanding a
ruling specific to a case brought in U.S. District
Court. The regents also discussed the relationship
of a variety of federal regulations to Smithsonian
operating procedures.

At their meeting on September 21, 1992, the
regents welcomed Constance B. Newman as the
Smithsonian's new under secretary, and the board
designated David Acheson and Senator Jake Garn
as regents emeritus upon the expiration of their
terms. The regents discussed the Institution's fed-
eral and trust budgets and plans to balance the
budget while preserving core programs during the
coming fiscal year. It was noted that permanent
programmatic and personnel reductions will cer-
tainly need to be made to meet substantial budget-
ary limitations. The regents approved the estab-
lishment of three named endowments, the Mary
Bohrn Abbott Fund, the Smithsonian Institution
Libraries Fund, and the National Museum of
Natural History Research Endowment Fund.

During the year the Board of Regents made the
following appointments and reappointments to
Smithsonian boards and commissions: David C.
Driskell, Frances Humphrey Howard, Robin B.
Martin, and Robert H. Nooter to the Commis-
sion of the National Museum of African Art; D.
Brainerd Holmes, Arthur Gray, Jr., and G. Rob-
ert Durham to the National Board of the National
Museum of Natural History; Ann Rockefeller
Roberts and Keith H. Basso to the Board of Trust-
ees of the National Museum of the American In-
dian; Ronald D. Abramson, Wendell K. Castle,
Barney A. Ebsworth, Patricia Frost, Melvin Len-
kin, David S. Purvis, and Linda Lichtenberg

Kaplan to the Commission of the National Mu-
seum of American Art; and Betty Evans, Richard
Hayden, and Sue Jane Smock to the Board of
Trustees of Cooper-Hewitt, National Museum of
Design.

Staff Changes

This year the Smithsonian family and its constitu-
ents were rocked by the death in April of Carmen
E. Turner, who had served as under secretary of
the Institution since December 1990. In her all-
too-short tenure, Mrs. Turner conducted a thor-
ough organizational review of the Institution and
effected a number of changes of long-standing sig-
nificance. Her contribution to the Smithsonian
was inestimable.

After a brief but extensive search, during which
time Alan Fern, director of the National Portrait
Gallery, served as acting under secretary, we were
delighted to attract Constance B. Newman, direc-
tor of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,
to the position of under secretary. In the waning
months of the fiscal year, as part of her transition
process, Mrs. Newman and a team she assembled
conducted an extensive series of briefings on
Smithsonian programs and activities. Her find-
ings and recommendations will be invaluable to
continuing efforts to strengthen the Institution’s
fundamental operations in times of increasingly
constrained finances.

A number of changes in the ranks of senior
management merit special mention, including the
appointment of L. Carole Wharton as director of
planning and budget, Sudeep Anand as treasurer,
and Charles A. Hines as director of protection
services. We had the regretful duty of announcing
this year that the very accomplished Janet Sol-
inger, director of the Resident Associate Program
for some 20 years, is moving to the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for External Affairs where she
will undertake special projects. Her splendid
achievements are very much appreciated.

Toward year’s end we also realized the need to
effect reductions in personnel to balance the bud-
get and maintain forward motion in activities of
highest priority. Although this is always difficult
and disruptive, we still hold the maxim that
our most critical resource remains our highly re-
spected staff. As always, we are deeply grateful to
them all for their extraordinary support and effort
throughout the year.
Highlights of
the Year

Anacostia Museum

In early 1939, the Daughters of the
American Revolution barred the re-
nowned operatic contralto Marian Ander-
son from singing in their Constitution
Hall in Washington, D.C., because she
was black. Instead, Anderson performed
on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial be-
fore an integrated audience of about
75,000 people. Her Easter Sunday con-
cert has become a moving symbol of the
civil rights movement.

A captivating likeness of Anderson as
she appeared that day was featured in “To
Achieve These Rights: The Struggle for
Equality and Self-Determination in the
District of Columbia, 1791-1978,” the
Anacostia Museum’s major exhibition of
1992. Visitors to the exhibition were
able to listen to a recording of a radio
broadcast of the historic performance.

Developed as the museum’s contribu-

American Art

Almost 100 sketches and studies of Afri-
can and Asian subjects by the American
expatriate painter and writer Edwin Lord
Weeks (1849-1903) were given by a de-
scendant to the Archives of American Art
this year. Weeks was known for his mon-
umental paintings based on historical ept-
sodes or daily life in North Africa, the
Middle East, and India

After studying in Paris, Weeks spent
most of his time living and traveling in
Spain, Morocco, Egypt, the Middle East,
Iran, and India, returning only occasion-
ally to France and rarely to his native
New England. In a fashion typical of ad
venturous Europeans and Americans of
his day, Weeks followed a romantic
quest for what were then considered to be
exotic peoples and places. Although he re
corded what he saw with great clarity, as
this oil sketch indicates, his copious
travel writings reveal that he maintained
his distance from native peoples. Objec-
tionable though it may be to us today,
his goal was neither intimate association
with other cultures nor anthropological
accuracy but the production for submis-
sion to the prestigious annual Paris salons
of elaborate historical and genre paint-

ings, based on direct studies like Arab on
Horseback

Arthur M. Sackler
Gallery

Nearly 500 people attended eight work-
shops at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery
that were designed to help young people
and their adult companions learn about
Asian art through the museum’s collec-
tions. The popular free, drop-in work-
shops—called “ImaginAsia”—prompted
one parent to remark, “What a wonder-
ful way to introduce a museum to chil-
dren and get them to think about what
they see.”

The workshops focused on two spe-
cial exhibitions—* When Kingship De-
scended from Heaven: Masterpieces of
Mesopotamian Art from the Louvre”
and “Ancient Japan’ —and on the per-
manent exhibition “Monsters, Myths,
and Minerals.” Guided by an activity
sheet developed by the museum’s Edu-
cation Department, the participants ex-
plored the galleries with certain ques-
tions in mind. Then the children were
invited to create their own works of art

inspired by their impressions. The en-
thusiasm of adults and children for
these workshops in which they can par-
ticipate together has prompted the Edu-
cation Department to schedule more
programs designed especially for
families.
Center for Folklife
Programs and
Cultural Studies

More than 100 tradition-bearers from
New Mexico came to the 1992 Festival
of American Folklife to represent the cul-
tural vitality, diversity, and dialogue
that is a central part of the state’s heri-
tage. In re-created settings—town plaza,
range, home, and sheep camp—partici-
pants demonstrated traditions of family,
community, and religious life.

Los Bernalillo Matachines, a Hispanic
dance group, enacted Los Matachines, a
dance-drama found in both Pueblo
Indian and Hispanic communities. The
dance portrays the spiritual drama of the
Spanish Conquest by combining indige-

nous and European symbols in a sacred

and sometimes burlesque discourse. Two
lines of dancers holding rattles and tri-
dents step, bow, and turn to the graceful
music of violin and guitar. They are led
by Monarca, a monarch figure referred to
in some communities as Montezuma. La
Malinche, played by a girl dressed in
First Communion clothing, represents
the first Christian convert. Other charac-
ters are a bull and a clown-bogeyman
figure. The dance usually is performed on
special holidays. In Hispanic communi-
ties it tends to be religious in nature,
whereas in Pueblo Indian communities it

is more of a secular celebration. (Photo-

Conservation Analytical
Laboratory

Modern polymeric materials are a fast-
growing presence in museum collections,
both in objects of historical and techno-
logical importance and in contemporary
art works. Although at first these materi-
als might seem to be quite stable, in real-
ity their long-term preservation poses
many problems.

At the Conservation Analytical Labora-
tory (CAL), scientific studies on objects
from Smithsonian collections help scien-
tists evaluate the ways in which materials

deteriorate with time and devise methods
to prolong the longevity of museum col-
lections worldwide. In one such project,
scientists are investigating the effects of
cold storage on the rubber materials in
the National Air and Space Museum’s col-
lection of space suits. Rubber crystallizes
at low temperatures, and long-term low-
temperature storage may make the suits
brittle, even after they are warmed to
room temperature. Here, CAL polymer
chemist Mary Baker and conservation fel-

low Eric Lange inspect a Project Mercury
spaceflight boot and astronaut Donald
“Deke” Slayton’s Mercury training suit.
They use a technology called differential
scanning calorimetry to study samples of
new rubber, as well as samples from deac-
cessioned suits such as this one, to deter-
mine the extent of crystallization in order
to establish proper storage and handling
procedures for the suits. (Photograph by

Cooper-Hewitt,
National Museum
of Design

For the past decade and a half, Cooper-
Hewitt, National Museum of Design has
concentrated on building its collections
by documenting the design process, from
the initial concept to the realized object.
Designers’ ideas and intentions and
their skill in selecting and success in ma-
nipulating materials with tools and tech-
nology are assessed, along with appear-
ance and function, to determine the
suitability of objects for the collections of
the National Museum of Design.
Through exhibitions and documenta-
tion of the permanent collection and ar-
chives, Cooper-Hewitt conveys the idea
that even the simplest of objects—such
as this chair—reflects a design, and that
design ts the result of a problem-solving
process. The 'vik-ter chair was created by
the New York furniture designer
Dakota Jackson (b. 1949). The entire
design process, including sketches and
notes for the initial concept, 67 working
drawings, and 2 models, is documented
in Jackson's gift to Cooper-Hewitt
Design is a process of shaping matter
to a purpose. It responds to an infinite
number of needs and desires. Jackson’s
aim was to create a chair that was beauti-
ful, comfortable, adaptable, and practi-
cal: the design becomes increasingly
graceful as the drawings progress, the
back and seat are curved, the back moves
in response to the sitter, and the chair is
made to stack. The archival documenta-
tion of the piece illustrates that the de-
signer drew and modeled for more than a
year until he was satisfied with the chair

design.

Freer Gallery of Art

The small but growing collection of
Southeast Asian ceramics at the Feer Gal-
lery of Art was enriched this year by a
15th-century stoneware jar from Viet-
nam’s Le dynasty (1428-1793). The jar
was purchased by the Friends of Asian
Arts and the Smithsonian Institution Col-
lections Acquisition Fund. The tall, slen-
der vessel, decorated with cobalt pig-
ment painted under a colorless glaze, was
made at a kiln in the Red River delta in
northern Vietnam.

Fieldwork by foreign scholars in Viet-
nam had been curtailed by war and politi-
cal turmoil since the 1930s but is slowly
resuming. Recent research in ceramics
has identified the locations of several kiln
complexes whose products, made with
the fine white local clay, were traded to
international markets ranging from Ja-
pan to West Asia during the 15th and
16th centuries. The dating of cobalt-dec-
orated Vietnamese wares is still approxi-
mate because few objects are available to
fill the span between the famous bottle in
the Topkapi Saray Museum, Istanbul,
dated by inscription to 1450 (made in
Nam Sach district in the delta), and in-
scribed temple vessels whose earliest
dates fall within the final quarter of the
16th century. Moreover, on jars similar
to the Freer’s, the motifs as well as the
proportions of the registers in which they
are arrayed appear to be modeled after
Chinese blue-and-white jars of the 14th
century. On this jar, three mythical lion-
like beasts circle the shoulder above a pe-
ony scroll related in execution to the one
on the 1450 bottle, and elongated lotus-
petal panels rise nearly halfway up the
side. The base is coated with an iron
wash.

An extraordinary field of rich gold, articu-
lated by jagged areas of red, brown, and
white and by a quivering yellow, 1948-C
is among the finest of Clyfford Still’s
paintings. Together with his peers Mark
Rothko, Barnett Newman, and Jackson

sion of Abstract Expressionist art in the
United States in the 1940s. Already the

National Air and Space
Museum

In a departure from traditional museum
displays on World War I aviation, the
National Air and Space Museum exhibi-
tion, “Legend, Memory, and the Great
War in the Air,” contrasts the romantic
myth of gallant combat in the sky with
the grim reality faced by the aviators who
fought and died during the war. The ex-
hibition uses photographs, posters, illus-
trations, models, implements of war, pe-
riod aircraft (all restored by museum
personnel), and other artifacts, along
with audiovisual presentations, to give
an accurate picture of aviation’s role in
the war and to examine the interplay be-
tween perception and reality in history.
A rare French Voisin VIII bomber dispels
the notion that all World War I military

aircraft were fighters. A re-created 1930s

movie theater presents clips from period
aviation films that introduced many to
the romantic view of the first air war.
“Legend, Memory, and the Great War
in the Air” explores the workings of his-
tory and asks viewers to evaluate rarely
challenged beliefs that guide aspects of
their lives and their society. The exhibi-
tion makes it clear that our judgment of
military aviation continues to be influ-
enced by the image of the fighter ace and
the bomber, legacies of the first air war.

National Museum
of African Art

The acquisition of a monumental bovine-
shaped slit gong, collected in Zaire in
the 1930s, was a highlight of the past
year at the National Museum of African
Art. The 98-inch-long wooden slit gong,
carved as a stylized bush cow, has a nar-
row tapered head with slender raised
nose, round ears, and short curved horns
ona long neck. The large ovoid body,
which functions as a resonance chamber,
is decorated with a carved border of zig-
zags. This instrument is similar to slit
gongs documented in the Ubangi region
of north central Zaire.

Large zoomorphic slit gongs such as
this one typically are played during ritu-
als, important ceremonial occasions, and
other events where musical accompani-

18

ment is desired. The gong is played by
striking a stick on either side of the slit.
Since the walls of the gong are of varied
thickness, the instrument produces both
high and low tones. The museum’s instal-
lation allows visitors to hear a recording
of the percussion produced by slit gongs.

The slit gong is part of the museum’s
permanent collection, which includes
works of art from numerous visual tradi-
tions from Western, Central, Eastern,
and Southern Africa. The museum is en-
gaged in an intensive effort to acquire
works of outstanding aesthetic quality.
The permanent collection is the founda-
tion for exhibitions and programs, re-
search, and publications.

National Museum
of American Art

The National Museum of American Art’s
exhibition, “Homecoming: William H.
Johnson and Afro-America, 1938—
1946,” offered a visual testament to one
of America’s most important but most ne-
glected artists. Eighty vibrant paintings,
drawn primarily from the museum's 1n-
ventory of more than 1,000 works by
Johnson, ranged from images of everyday
life in the rural South to street scenes in
Harlem. The exhibition focused exclu-
sively on the artist’s work

in his native land, capturing in a folk-
inspired style the artistic, political, and
cultural accomplishments of African
Americans in the 1940s.

After closing in Washington, the exhi-
bition and a smaller companion show sur-
veying Johnson’s entire career began trav-
eling under the museum’s auspices to 10
museums throughout the United States.

Since the mid-1960s, the National
Museum of American Art has been ac-
quiring the work of African American art-
ists, bringing their long-ignored achieve-
ments into the artistic mainstream. In

1967, the museum was fortunate to re-
ceive from the Johnson estate hundreds
of paintings, drawings, and prints—a
collection that thus was rescued from im-

National Museum
of American History

For the “American Encounters” exhibi-
tion, the National Museum of American
History collected contemporary objects
from Hispanic and Pueblo families in
New Mexico. One of those objects is E/
Gran Poder de Dios (The great power of
God), a painted wooden bu/to, or sculp-
ture, created by Marie Romero Cash and
enclosed in a tin 2icho made by her hus-
band, Don Cash. The sculpture is an im-
portant addition to the museum’s collec-
tion of Hispanic religious and tourist art.

Early in this century, Hispanic carvers
in New Mexico stopped making sacred
images and directed their production to-
ward tourist consumption. Marie Ro-
mero Cash, whose father made tourist tin-
ware to supplement his income as a
sheet-metal worker, is one of several con-
temporary New Mexican carvers who
have continued the secular and revived
the sacred traditions. She makes by/tos
like this one, derived from a r9th-cen-
tury piece, for collectors, but other exam-
ples of her work adorn Catholic churches
in New Mexico and Colorado.

Marie Romero Cash was born in Santa
Fe, but moved away as a young woman.
She took up carving when she returned
to New Mexico and studied the work of
1oth-century religious carvers like José
Rafael Aragon. “Many of us don’t know
where our roots are; we live in a cultural
gap,” Cash told “American Encounters”
co-curator Lonn Taylor. “I started cary-
ing when I moved back here. It made me
feel connected to New Mexico, and with
the r9th-century Hispanic artists here.”

National Museum of the
American Indian

As the summer of 1992 drew to a close,
the staff of the National Museum of the
American Indian was hard at work pre-
paring for the November 15, 1992, open-
ing of the museum’s first exhibition,
“Pathways of Tradition: Indian Insights
into Indian Worlds.” This temporary ex-
hibition of 100 objects represents a cross-
section of American Indian culture and
creativity. Objects from 28 tribes in loca-
tions ranging from the Arctic Circle to
South America were chosen for the exhibi-
tion by 17 Native American selectors and
Rick Hill (Tuscarora), curator and the
museum’s assistant director for public
programs. The symbol Hill chose for
graphic reproduction and representation
of the exhibition is this Northern Plains
shield of bison hide with a deerskin cover
with the green-painted image of a snap-
ping turtle, a symbol of the Earth.

Objects selected for the exhibition
from more than one million artifacts in
the museum collection span the period
from 800 A.D. to the 1930s, articulating
the indigenous peoples’ continuing rela-
tionship with their homeland. They in-
clude a ceramic bow! decorated with ani-
mal images by the Taino, the first people
to encounter Columbus in the Western
Hemisphere; two pre-Columbian gold
pieces; a wooden deer mask and an in-
cised conch shell from the Spiro Mounds
in Oklahoma; carved house panels from
the Tlingit people of Alaska; a Teton
Sioux buckskin parasol decorated with
quillwork and beadwork; Pomo baskets
decorated with feathers from California;
cradleboards from various tribes; blankets
from tribes ranging from the Haida of
British Columbia to the Aymara of Bo-
livia; Zuni and Mimbres pottery from
New Mexico; and a wide range of other
items remarkable both for the variety of
their uses and the diversity of the people
who made them.

“Seeds of Change,” the largest exhibition
ever undertaken by the National Mu-
seum of Natural History, traces the pro-
found cultural and biological changes

that have occurred in the 500 years since
Columbus’s voyages to the New World.

The exhibition has garnered unprece-
dented national and international public-
ity and attracted large crowds since it
opened in October 1991, helping to
bring museum attendance to just over 7
million in fiscal year 1992. This master-
fully constructed 42-by-24-foot Spanish-
style portal made from more than 14,000
ears of specially grown red, blue, black,
and yellow corn marks the entrance to
“Seeds of Change.”

Columbus's voyages brought about
the first of many biological exchanges be-
tween the Old World and the New.
Through five case studies—corn, potato,
sugar, the horse, and disease—the exhibi-
tion explores the “seeds” whose seem-
ingly simple transfer led to complex cul-
tural and political change and ultimately
shaped the course of history.

“Seeds of Change” is a tremendous edu-
cational resource. The demand for stu-
dent and public tours is the greatest in
the museum’s history. Educational insti-
tutions and teachers from all over the
country are requesting copies of the teach-
ing guide and curriculum materials. Pro-
grams have included planting a garden
with a local elementary school and using
gardening to teach science, math, his-
tory, Music, art, environmental studies,
and an appreciation for diverse cultures.

Audiences throughout the country and
abroad will be able to see “Seeds of
Change” as versions of the exhibition
travel under the auspices of the museum,
the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Ex-
hibition Service, the American Library
Association, and the U.S. Information
Agency.
National Portrait
Gallery

The National Portrait Gallery has ac-
quired an important portrait of an early
American printer and publisher—one of
the handful of colonial women who
gained distinction in the public sphere.
Charles Willson Peale, in depicting
Anne Catharine Hoof Green, editor of
the Maryland Gazette, has given us a por-
trait of uncommon interest. In her hand,
Mrs. Green holds a document inscribed,
“ANNAPOLIS Printer to. . . ,” sym-
bolic of the satisfaction she must have felt
after earning the appointment to carry on
her husband's task as printer to the Prov-
ince of Maryland.

Anne Catharine Hoof married Jonas
Green in Philadelphia in 1738 and
moved with him to Annapolis, where he
became printer to the province. In 1745,
he began publication of the Maryland Ga-
zette, the only newspaper in the colony un-
til 1773. Anne Green was a participant
in her husband’s business affairs, fully ca-
pable of assuming his responsibilities
should the need arise. After Jonas
Green’s death in 1767, she continued
publication of the Maryland Gazette with-
out a break. Mrs. Green also fulfilled her
husband’s contract as printer to the prov-
ince and published an almanac yearly.
Her career as printer and publisher ended
only with her death in March 1775.

Charles Willson Peale—who painted
Mrs. Green in 1769, shortly after he re-
turned from study in London with Benja-
min West—was the preeminent portrait-
ist of America’s revolutionary generation.

National
Zoological Park

At 9:30 on the morning of June 9,
1992, a 90-ton crane lowered a 15,000-
pound, 40-foot New World mahogany
tree through an opening in the roof of
the National Zoo’s new “Amazonia” ex-
hibit building. The mahogany, which
has an 8-foot-square root box, is the
largest plant among the 229 species of
tropical trees, shrubs, epiphytes (some-
times called air plants), and vines that
grow in the 12,000-square-foot Amazon
rainforest and river habitat building. The
building is the centerpiece of the “Ama-

zonia” exhibit, which is in two parts: the

Habitat and the Gallery. The Habitat
opened in November 1992, and the Gal-
lery should open in late 1993.

To locate and acquire the 1,740 trees
and shrubs necessary to create an authen-
tic living rainforest, Zoo horticulturists
searched botanical collections in south
Florida. For more than a year before these
larger plants were trucked to Washing-
ton, D.C., they were conditioned for
transplanting by root pruning, selective
shading, and special feedings. They are
planted in a noncompacting soil mixture
that was developed by Zoo horticulturists
and can be used indefinitely inside ant-
mal exhibits.

The rainforest and river ecosystem Is es-
tablished under a specially engineered in-
sulating transparent domed roof. Misters
and climate-control devices enable visi-
tors to experience the heat and humidity
of the rainforest. Neotropical animals in-
cluding camouflaged insects, brightly col-
ored frogs, toucans, parrots, monkeys,
and many species of Amazon River fish
have also been settled into the exhibit.

“Amazonia” incorporates into its de-
sign and operation the “Biopark” philoso-
phy of Zoo Director Michael Robinson.
This concept treats nature, including hu-
man culture, from a broad perspective
and includes elements commonly associ-

ated with zoos, aquariums, botanical gar-

dens, and natural history museums. The
second phase of “Amazonia” will include
an 8,000-square-foot gallery that ex-
plains how the rainforest functions and
features exhibits on research techniques
in tropical biology and the dynamics of
global ecology. Through exciting new

methods of museum interpretation, visi-

tors to the exhibit will experience the

Amazon rainforest directly and learn
about the complex interrelationships of
organisms living in tropical ecosystems.

A 6.5-meter-diameter mirror intended to
replace the six separate mirrors of the
Multiple Mirror Telescope was success-
fully cast at the University of Arizona,
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-
tory’s partner in this replacement project.
The mirror is the largest single glass
blank ever cast in the United States. In
late April 1992, some 10 tons of borosili-
cate glass chunks were melted over a ce-

ramic mold in a special rotating oven.
Formed with a roughly parabolic front
surface by the spinning process, the mir-
ror had to cool and congeal over a two-
month period before it was ready for re-
moval and cleaning. Final grinding and
polishing is expected to take at least an-

Traveling Exhibition
Service

In 1989, as the revolutions in Central Eu-
rope swelled to a climax, mass rallies,
workers’ strikes, and demonstrations be-
came daily events across Central and East-
ern Europe. Posters seen plastered on
walls and shop windows, hanging from
statues, and carried by the people pro-
claimed: “End Rule by One Party!”
“Marx Is Dead!” “40 Years of Lies!”

“Art as Activist: Revolutionary Posters
from Central and Eastern Europe,” an ex-
hibition of 82 revolutionary posters circu-
lated by the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), fol-
lows the democratic movement of Solidar-
ity in Poland, Gorbachev's perestroika of
the late 1980s, the fall of the Berlin Wall
in 1990, the collapse of the Communist
government in Czechoslovakia in 1989,
and the ongoing struggle for indepen-
dence in the Baltic republics.

Poster art serves many functions.
These posters are one way of studying
complex social and political change.
Poster art also is a critical means of self-
expression. Through art, activists try to
reach the people who need to hear the
message. Many of the posters included in
the exhibition were drawn for limited edi-
tions by highly acclaimed artists, silk-
screened by students, or hand-painted by
anonymous citizens united in their desire
for freedom.

In this 1988 gouache, Latvian artist
Vilnis Pikis expressed his wish for free-
dom from the Soviets by depicting the
morning star, a symbol of independent
Latvia, blazing through the Kremlin

wall.
Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute

Field observations and experimen-
tation have been used in most of the
studies carried out by scientists at the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Insti-
tute (STRI). In recent years, however,
spectacular advances in molecular biol-
Ogy have permitted new approaches to
problems that fieldwork alone cannot
solve. With an eye toward these devel-
opments, STRI established one of the
few tropically based molecular system-
atics laboratories in the world. The in-
teraction between field-based and mo-
lecular scientists and the proximity to

tropical forests and coral reefs are pro-

viding a vital new perspective to the
study of tropical species.

Molecular biological techniques are be-
ing used to study brightly colored dart-
poison frogs. This species, Dendrobates
pumilio, collected from the Bocas del
Toro Islands of Panama, shows a remark-
able degree of diversity in color and pat-
tern. Somewhat paradoxically, three
other species of dart-poison frogs found
on these islands do not exhibit much
color variation. One hypothesis was that
D. pumilio has simply been present in the

islands longer than the other species, and

thus its populations have had more time

to diverge in color pattern. DNA se-
quence data collected for these species,
however, did not support this view. An-
other hypothesis—that sexual selection
in the form of female choice for male col-
oration may have contributed to the di-
vergence among populations—is being
evaluated. D. pumilio is the only dart-
poison frog species in the Bocas del Toro
Islands in which females care for their
young. All other species exhibit male pa-
rental care, a parenting strategy that may
permit females to be less choosy in their
selection of mates. (Photograph by Carl

The Year in
Review

Sciences

Office of the Assistant Secretary
for the Sciences

Robert S. Hoffmann, Assistant Secretary

Since its inception, the Smithsonian Institution
has nourished a commitment to scientific re-
search. Scientific studies are carried on in several
arenas: specialized research institutes such as the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the
Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; muse-
ums such as the National Air and Space Museum
and the National Museum of Natural History/Na-
tional Museum of Man; the National Zoological
Park and its Conservation and Research Center;
the Conservation Analytical Laboratory; and cen-
tral support units such as the Smithsonian Institu-
tion Archives, the Office of Fellowships and
Grants, the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, and
the Scientific Diving Program. In all of these are-
nas, the Smithsonian’s scientific research is charac-
terized by breadth, depth, and outreach.

The Institution is well known for studies that
benefit the scientific community worldwide.
Smithsonian scientists are engaged in long-term
baseline monitoring of ultraviolet radiation reach-
ing the Earth. They are studying Caribbean coral
reef and mangrove ecosystems and investigating
the biological impact of deforestation. Using satel-
lite observation, they are examining pollution
damage to temperate forests.

Scientific research is by its very nature an indi-
vidual enterprise, but scientists often join forces to
carry out team projects. The Smithsonian ts com-
mitted to providing a working atmosphere that en-
hances creativity and leads to new insights about
the natural and human worlds. These insights
will enable us to deal more successfully with the
challenges we face now and in the future.

@ Environmental research continues to be the em-
phasis of the Institution’s scientific research pro-
grams. Projects include studies of the function of
natural and disturbed ecosystems and of the dy-
namic role of the Sun and atmosphere in the appar-
ent warming of the Earth’s temperature. It 1s
equally important to gain an adequate understand-
ing of the structure and composition of natural
communities and ecosystems so that their richness
and stability may be maintained or restored in the
face of increasing human pressures. An example of
such fundamental research is the work of the Insti-
tution’s systematic biologists, who have responsi-
bility for inventorying and describing the species
richness of the biosphere.

g Smithsonian anthropologists are exploring the
nature of changing cultures throughout the

world. Their research ranges from studies of con-
temporary West African art and culture to exami-
nation of the influence on the Caribbean of the im-
portation of peoples and their cultures during the
slave trade.

questions of concern to archaeology and art his-
tory, as well as problems facing the Smithsonian
and other institutions in the preservation and con-
servation of their collections. A multifaceted train-
ing program provides unique educational opportu-
nities for students in conservation, materials

science, archaeology, and art history.

@ CAL has developed computer modeling tech-
niques for studying the effects of temperature, rela-
tive humidity, shock, and vibration on paintings.
The results of their application have enhanced
chemical research in the preservation of collections
in the Smithsonian and other museums through-
out the world. The models also are used to exam-
ine changes in the mechanical stability of photo-
graphic image layers. These studies supply the
information necessary for CAL to develop and rec-
ommend appropriate guidelines for the long-term
storage and exhibition of photographic materials.
@ Technical studies by CAL research collaborator
Aslihan Yener and CAL scientists Pamela Van-
diver and Emile Joel have resulted in a revision of
the traditional understanding of Near and Middle
Eastern tin sources in the Bronze Age. The studies
were carried out on materials excavated under
Yener’s direction at the site of Goltepe in the Tau-
rus Mountains of southeastern Turkey.

@ During her studies of the preservation of pro-
teins and nucleic acids in hard tissue from paleon-
tological and archaeological specimens, CAL re-
search biochemist Noreen Tuross has extracted

indigenous proteins from 350 million-year-old fos-
sil Lingula shells. Until this breakthrough, it was
generally thought that biomolecules could not sur-
vive in the fossil record beyond about 100,000
years.

@ Twenty-eight fellows or interns served at vari-
ous levels and in various CAL specialties during
the year. Ten courses were offered on conservation
topics, including two new subjects: “Leather for
Conservators” and “The Suction Table for Textiles
and Paintings.” Members of the Furniture Conser-
vation Training Program’s third class began their
course work in August and are expected to gradu-
ate in 1996.

National Museum of
Natural History/National
Museum of Man

Frank H. Talbot, Director

The National Museum of Natural History/Na-
tional Museum of Man (NMNH), the nation’s
largest research museum, is dedicated to under-
standing the natural world and the place of hu-
mans in it. With a staff of more than 600, in-
cluding 120 staff scientists, and the world’s
largest and most extensive collection of docu-
mented artifacts and specimens of plants, animals,
fossils, rocks, and minerals, now numbering more
than 121 million items, the museum conducts
scholarly investigations in anthropology and the
full range of the natural sciences. This extensive re-
search in the field and the laboratory is shared
with the scholarly community and the larger pub-
lic through publications, symposia, educational
programs, and a museum of popular exhibitions
that annually attracts more visitors than any other
natural history museum in the world.

@ Ovest, a quarterly minimagazine that takes read-
ers on a tour of behind-the-scenes research at the
museum, was introduced in October r991. Now
reaching nearly 9,000 supporters, Qvest has high-
lighted museum projects as diverse as the excava-
tion of African American artifacts from Southern
plantations, the unique bird life of Hawaii, con-
servation efforts in South America, and Antarctic
meteorites.
@ Three months before the cataclysmic eruption
of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines on June 15,
1991, the museum’s Global Volcanism Program
(GVP) was reporting volcanic activity at this
long-dormant volcano through its monthly
Global Volcanism Network. GVP data show that
the eruption was the world’s largest since 1932.
GVP is now working with interagency groups to
study the possibility that Mt. Pinatubo’s strato-
spheric products are causing a cooler climate.

m A team of curators, designers, scientists, archi-
tects, artists, educators, writers, and researchers
are at work on plans to renovate the museum’s
Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals beginning
in early 1994. The new hall, which will open in
late 1995, will incorporate the most recent earth
science concepts and highlight dynamic earth pro-
cesses, including crystal and ore formation, vol-
cano and earthquake origins, the theory of plate
tectonics, and the formation of the solar system.
w Terrestrial Ecosystems through Time, a landmark
history of life on the land from the earliest traces
of terrestrial organisms more than 400 million
years ago to the beginnings of human agriculture,
was published in July r992. An undertaking of a
consortium of museum scientists, the book pro-
vides access to the wealth of unique, thought-
provoking ecological information contained in the
fossil record.

@ In 1992, the museum began a $1 million, 14-
month renovation of its Insect Zoo, made possible
by a grant from Orkin Pest Control. The exhibi-
tion will feature a giant termite mound for chil-
dren to explore, as well as insects from the exotic
to the familiar in habitats ranging from tropical
rainforests to our own backyards.

@ Twenty-five undergraduates, including 17
women and 8 minority students, participated in
the summer session of the museum’s 1992 Re-
search Training Program, supported by the Na-
tional Science Foundation, NMNH, and the
Gesneriad Society. The heart of the program is the
individual research project of each participant, di-
rected by a museum scientist. Also offered are lec-
tures, discussions, laboratory demonstrations, col-
lection tours, and field trips.

@ Sites in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, and
Missouri installed regional variations of the mu-
seum’s successful Columbus Quincentenary exhibi-
tion, “Seeds of Change,” in a unique collaboration
with the museum and the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES). SITES and

National Zoological Park

Michael H. Robinson, Director

Building on its historic mandate, the National
Zoological Park (NZP) has as its primary mission
the advancement of science, biological conserva-
tion, and education and recreation of the people.
To fulfill this mission, the Zoo has moved beyond
being a zoological park concerned only with ani-
mals to becoming a biological park with a scope
that extends to the entire living world and ex-
hibits that increasingly emphasize interaction and
holism. In pursuit of its mission, NZP exhibits a
range of living plants and animals on its 163-acre
facility in Rock Creek Park in Washington,
D.C., and maintains the Conservation and Re-

plans for endangered species.

m@ The Zoo's new “Amazonia” rainforest exhibit
opened in November. It features a vignette of the
Amazon River with numerous species of diverse,
colorful, and exciting fishes and a re-creation of a
moist tropical forest containing more than 229
species of plants. Within the exhibit, a simulated
research station allows visitors to explore the com-
plexities of tropical biology.

@ The Cheetah Conservation Station opened in
August. This state-of-the-art exhibit features a de-
vice that stimulates the cheetahs to chase a lure
around their enclosure at speeds of up to 35 miles
per hour. Interactive graphics provide information
on mating, social structure, hunting success, anat-
omy of high-speed running, and the massive ef-
fort now under way in zoos to preserve cheetahs
from extinction.

@ The Reptile Discovery Center opened in Sep-
tember. New interactive exhibits adjoining ani-
mal enclosures highlight features of the animals.
Special interpretive programs presented by keep-

ers and volunteers offer unique glimpses into the
world of reptiles and amphibians.

@ The staff of the Department of Zoological Re-
search (DZR) began a program in developmental
psychobiology and established a multimedia labo-
ratory. DZR conducted a varied slate of research
projects in Brazil (golden lion tamarins), Sri
Lanka (toque macaque), Chile (Juan Fernandez sea
lion), Panama (migratory birds), California (south-
ern sea otter and San Joaquin kit fox), Nevada (de-
sert tortoise), and Hawaii (amakihi, nene, and Ha-
wailan Crow).

@ The Zoo's New Opportunities in Animal
Health Sciences (NOAHS) Center initiated a new
outreach program to minority students with the
purpose of stimulating young people to take an in-
terest in science. NOAHS scientists regularly visit
inner-city junior high and high schools, where
they use hands-on items and interactive equip-
ment to give talks and demonstrations about the
Zoo's high-tech scientific programs.

Office of Environmental
Awareness
Judith Gradwohl, Director

The Office of Environmental Awareness (OEA)
works with bureaus, offices, and outside organiza-
tions to gather and disseminate timely and accu-
rate information on global environmental issues.
Publications, exhibitions, conferences, and work-
shops are designed for both the general public and
groups of professionals.

@ The Office of Environmental Awareness was
the recipient of the second annual Swim Environ-
mental Awareness Award to support work on the
National Forum on Ocean Conservation and the
exhibition “Ocean Planet.”

@ Participants in the National Forum on Ocean
Conservation, held November 19-21, 1991,
filled Baird Auditorium at the National Museum
of Natural History. Cosponsored by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the fo-
rum assembled 53 speakers to discuss problems
and solutions affecting the marine environment.
@ Planning continued for “Ocean Planet,” a trav-
eling exhibition on ocean conservation. Slated to
open at the National Museum of Natural History
in March 1995, the exhibition is a collaborative ef-
fort among OEA, the museum, and the Smithson-
ian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.

g@ OEA’s colorful and informative poster, “A Bet-
ter World Starts at Home,” was redesigned and re-
printed to accompany the SITES exhibition, “No
Laughing Matter: Political Cartoonists on the
Environment.”

Office of Fellowships
and Grants
Roberta W. Rubinoff, Director

The Office of Fellowships and Grants manages the
Institution’s centralized fellowship and internship
programs, other stipend appointments, and other
programs that support research. These research
programs enable students and scholars from
throughout the world to visit the Institution and
use its varied resources. The office also administers
programs to increase minority participation in
Smithsonian research activities and disciplines.
Two competitive grant programs managed by the
office provide scholarly support for Smithsonian
professional staff.

@ The office offered awards to more than 900 stu-
dents, scholars, and scientists to utilize the Institu-
tion’s collections and resources.

@ A record 506 applications were received for the
Smithsonian Fellowship Program, an 11 percent
increase from 1991. Eighty-nine fellowships were
offered.

@ This year the office received 186 applica-
tions—an increase of almost 24 percent from
1991—for the Minority Internship Program.
Funds were provided to support 33 interns to
work on research and museum-related projects.

In collaboration with the Quality Education for
Minorities Network, the office placed three more
interns in science policy projects.

@ The office worked with the Office of Museum
Programs to design a new fellowship program in
museum practice, which was funded by the Smith-
sonian Women’s Committee to celebrate its 25th
anniversary. Four fellowships were offered this
year.

Office of the Registrar

Mary E. Case, Director

The Office of the Registrar supervises the manage-
ment of the Institution’s vast collection of 139
million objects and specimens. By monitoring
Institution-wide collections management policies
and procedures, the office works to ensure in-
creased access to, and continued accountability
for, the national collections.

@ The office updated its principal guiding docu-
ment, Office Memorandum 808: Collections Man-
agement Policy, to encompass mandates on col-
lecting biological specimens and recovering loan
costs.

@ [In conjunction with the Office of Human Re-
sources, the office initiated a study of the classifi-
cation standard for the museum specialist and
museum technician series (GS—1016) to develop
a standard that accurately reflects collections
management activities in the modern museum
environment.

Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory

Irwin I. Shapiro, Director

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
(SAO) is dedicated to studying the physical pro-
cesses that determine the nature and evolution of
the universe. A member of the Center for Astro-
physics (CfA), based in Cambridge, Massachu-
setts, SAO collaborates with the Harvard College
Observatory in a diverse program of research orga-
nized by various divisions: atomic and molecular
physics, high-energy astrophysics, optical and in-
frared astronomy, planetary sciences, radio and
geoastronomy, solar and stellar physics, and theo-
retical astrophysics. Facilities include the Fred
Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) in Ari-
zona, the Oak Ridge Observatory in Massachu-
setts, and a millimeter-wave radio astronomy
installation at CfA headquarters, as well as instru-
ments aboard satellites, rockets, and balloons.

@ A 6.5-meter-diameter mirror intended to re-
place the six separate mirrors of the Multiple Mir-
ror Telescope was successfully cast by SAO’s part-
ner in this project, the University of Arizona. The
mirror is the largest glass blank ever cast in the
United States.

@ An SAO-built far-infrared spectrometer flown
aboard a DC-8 aircraft contributed to studies of
ozone depletion over the Northern Hemisphere
and, in subsequent balloon flights, determined
new upper limits for ozone-threatening hydrogen
bromide in the stratosphere.

@ The first ground-based detection of trillion-elec-
tron-volt-level gamma rays from a source beyond
our galaxy was made by an international team of
scientists at the Whipple Observatory.

@ An SAO scientist, with colleagues elsewhere,
found strong evidence that Nova Muscae (a star
-arlier observed to explode into sudden brilliance)
is a binary system in which the primary compo-
nent is a black hole.

@ Millimeter-wave radio observations revealed
two new and surprising features of the Milky
Way: a thick layer of molecular hydrogen gas ex-
tending above and below the galaxy and a cluster
of molecular clouds some 100,000 light-years
from the galaxy’s center.

@ Observations of cyclic brightening on a star in
the Constellation Cetus show long-term variations
in magnetic activity—the first direct evidence of a
magnetic cycle on a star other than the Sun.

@ A tethered satellite system (TSS-1), conceived
and designed by SAO, was flown aboard a space
shuttle flight in July. Although engineering prob-
lems prevented a full test, deployment and re-
trieval of a small payload on a conducting cable
were shown to be feasible, and SAO studies of sys-
tem dynamics produced promising preliminary re-
sults.

m SAO continued the development of a submilli-
meter-wavelength radio telescope array, a two-
element optical and infrared interferometer, and
various instruments intended for space flight, in-
cluding a high-resolution imager for the Ad-
vanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility, an ultraviolet
spectrograph for the Solar and Heliospheric Obser-
vatory, and detectors for the Submillimeter Wave
Astronomy Satellite. The Whipple Observatory
dedicated an 1 1-meter optical reflector for
ground-based gamma-ray astronomy on January
22, 1992.
Smithsonian Environmental
Research Center
David L. Correll, Director

Scientists at the Smithsonian Environmental Re-
search Center (SERC) in Edgewater, Maryland,
conduct long-term interdisciplinary studies on
how human use of the air, land, and water affects
the Chesapeake Bay region. The center comple-
ments research activities with educational pro-
grams for students—from undergraduates to post-
doctoral fellows—and for the public. SERC’s
research is the primary contribution on the Chesa-
peake region to the U.S. Interagency Global
Change Program and an important component of
the International Geosphere/Biosphere Program.

® Responding to concerns that the stratospheric
ozone layer is threatened, SERC has, for 17 years,
monitored ultraviolet solar radiation at the Earth’s
surface with precision spectral radiometers. Re-
sults for the Washington, D.C., region published
in 1992 included a peak in the summer daily total
ultraviolet-B dose in 1983 that was 29 percent
above the long-term mean.

@ SERC evaluated the effects of land use on the
terrestrial sources of phosphorus in the Chesapeake
Bay. Cropland that had been cultivated and fertil-
ized discharged eight times as much total phos-
phorus as a mature hardwood forest that had never
been cleared. Phosphorus is a key nutrient in the
Chesapeake Bay and much of the total input de-
rives from cropland discharges.

@ Researchers at SERC determined that as nutri-
ents move from the watershed of the Chesapeake
Bay into the estuary, they are assimilated by
plankton, and dissolved inorganic phosphate ts re-
leased from eroded soil particles. As a result, the
ratio of available inorganic phosphorus declines,
and nitrogen becomes the limiting nutrient in the
tidal headwaters of the subestuaries of the bay.
Thus, management of nitrogen inputs is increas-
ingly needed.

@ SERC scientists conducted experiments to test
whether salinity or organic settlement factors re-
leased by attached adults determined where plank-
tonic larvae of three species of the barnacle genus
Balanus occur in the Chesapeake Bay. They found
that the interaction of both factors combined to
cause larvae to settle in their respective estuarine
zones.

@ With National Science Foundation support, re-
searchers at SERC studied an unusual class of
sugar polymer known as chitin to see how much
of it is produced by various marine and estuarine
phytoplankton. This material has many of the
chemical properties of proteins and has been mis-
takenly lumped with proteins in global change
models of the carbon cycle. Diatoms, abundant in
coastal waters, have been shown to produce large
amounts of this material.

@ Automated instruments were used to measure
tidal exchanges of nutrients continuously at two
brackish marshes of differing elevations. The
lower marsh was found to import various organic
nitrogen and phosphorus fractions, while the
higher marsh exported organic fractions. Thus,
these marshes had contrasting nutrient buffering
effects.

Smithsonian Institution
Libraries

Barbara J. Smith, Director

The Smithsonian Institution Libraries (SIL) re-
ports a variety of new efforts this year in the use of
its collections for scholarship and study, the preser-
vation of a major historic collection, and the dis-
semination of information to its users. The Librar-
ies’ collections, accessible through an on-line
catalogue and available to Smithsonian staff and
outside scholars through a system of 17 branch li-
braries and through interlibrary loan, number
more than 1 million books, 15,000 current jour-
nals, 40,000 rare books, and 1,800 manuscript
groups. SIL supports the Institution's curatorial,
research, publishing, education, and public ser-
vice activities by providing reference and informa-
tion services and by building, organizing, manag-
ing, preserving, and restoring its collections.

@ To foster studies into the rich holdings in the
history of science and technology housed in SIL’s
Dibner Library, the Libraries inaugurated a re-
search awards program funded by the Dibner
Fund. The first two Dibner Library Resident
Scholars conducted research in Renaissance city
planning and in roth-century intercultural ex-
change in bridge construction.

m To preserve for future generations its collection
of materials relating to world’s fairs held between
1834 and 1914, SIL launched a massive preserva-
tion project, The Books of the Fairs, in which some
2,000 deteriorating volumes were microfilmed by
a commercial publisher. As part of the project,
SIL published an annotated, illustrated guide to
the collection containing an essay that sets the
world’s fair literature into its historical and schol-
arly context.

@ The range of disciplines that benefit by using
world’s fairs collections was demonstrated at a
symposium, “World’s Fairs and Modern Life,”
attended by scholars, collectors, and the public
and organized by the Libraries in cooperation with
the National Museum of American History. The
symposium and an SIL exhibition on world’s fairs
were funded by the Smithsonian Special Exhibi-
tion Fund and private supporters.

@ To assist Smithsonian scholars and program
staff in their research, the Libraries opened the
Database Searching Center in December. Funded
by the James Smithson Society, the center pro-
vides bibliographic information to offices around
the Institution via remote access.

Smithsonian Institution Man
and the Biosphere Biological
Diversity Program

Francisco Dallmeier, Director

The Smithsonian Institution Man and the Bio-
sphere Biological Diversity Program (SI/MAB)
deals with the challenge of protecting the biologi-
cal diversity of developing countries. The program
focuses on two objectives: (1) to provide biodiver-
sity sampling protocols for protected areas and
other highly diverse ecosystems of the world in a
way that will allow data from diverse sites to be
compared in time and space and (2) to strengthen
short-term professional training capabilities in
host countries and thereby increase the number of
managers and scientists in developing nations who
can address their countries’ conservation priorities.

@ During the past year, SI/MAB conducted suc-
cessful regional training courses on conservation
and management of protected areas and wildlands
in Guatemala, Ecuador, Bolivia, Panama, and
Peru.

@ Among SI/MAB research activities carried out
this year were the second posthurricane census of
the biodiversity plot in the Luquillo Biosphere Re-
serve, Puerto Rico; the four-year census of the four
biodiversity plots in the Beni Biosphere Reserve,
Bolivia; and the establishment of the first biodiver-
sity plot in the unique dry forest ecosystem of the
Virgin Islands National Park, St. John, U.S. Vir-
gin Islands.

@ An evaluation of the last five regional training
courses conducted by SI/MAB was completed this
year. Three forthcoming publications are expected
to improve and modify the courses to meet the na-
tional conservation objectives in the countries
where courses are held.

@ Publications produced this year included the
program’s first newsletter, four user’s guides and
three field guides to the biodiversity plots, and
two related papers.

work of a permanent scientific staff of 30, which

conducts research in the New and Old World trop-
ics, as well as the efforts of the many scientific visi-
tors who carry out field and laboratory investiga-

tions at its facilities.

@ Klaus Winter and collaborators began investi-
gating the biochemical basis of ecological adapta-
tions of tropical plants to various environmental
stresses. Their work will involve studies of the
functional significance of these adaptations under
conditions that simulate possible future increases
of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.
@ Analysis of microfossils in ancient lake sedi-
ments from the Amazon and Panama by the Qua-
ternary paleoecology group formed by Dolores
Piperno, Paul Colinvaux, and collaborators gave
the first strong evidence of climatic cooling of the
American tropics in the last ice age. In contrast,
studies on shallow-water marine fossils, as part of
the Panama Paleontology Program started by Jer-
emy B. C. Jackson and Anthony G. Coates at
STRI, demonstrate no major shift in temperature
for at least the past 2 million years. These conflict-
ing results suggest that climates on land and sea
shift more independently than global climate
models have indicated.

@ Initial surveys of the 50-hectare tropical forest
plot in Lambir National Park in Malaysian Borneo
indicated that it contains more than 1, 100 species
of trees, prompting scientists to hail the area as
one of the most species-rich tropical forests ever
discovered. Tree censuses also continued at Huai

Kha Khaeng in Thailand, another site collaborat-
ing with STRI’s Center for Tropical Forest Science
this year.

@ STRI anthropologist Olga Linares, elected to
the National Academy of Sciences this year, pub-
lished Power, Prayer and Production: The Jola People
of Casamance, Senegal (Cambridge University
Press). The book reflects more than 30 years of re-
search on these rice-growing people.

@ Glenn Tupper donated $1.5 million to STRI to
establish a permanent fund supporting scientific
research on tropical terrestrial and marine ecosys-
tems. A portion of the gift will be used to re-
model the former STRI administration building
to house the Center for Tropical Paleoecology and
to renovate the Naos Island Molecular Biology
Laboratories, where evolutionary research is con-
ducted on organisms separated by the rise of the
Isthmus of Panama.

@ Efforts in international scientific collaboration
were formalized in an agreement with the Pontifi-
cia Universidad Catolica of Ecuador and with the
establishment of the Mpala Wildlife Research
Trust, consisting of the Kenyan Wildlife Service,
the National Museums of Kenya, the Mpala Wild-
life Foundation, and Princeton University. STRI
will administer the Smithsonian’s interest in the
trust, created to support research on wildlife,
global change, and biological diversity, as well as
the education of future scientists in these fields.

Arts and Humanities

Office of the Assistant Secretary
for the Arts and Humanities

Tom L. Freudenheim, Assistant Secretary

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for the Arts
and Humanities advises the secretary and the
under secretary on issues relating to museum poli-
cies, operations, and advocacy. Current priorities
of the office include accessibility, exhibitions, and
museum education.
@ The Accessibility Program convened a 113-
member Accessibility Liaison Council of Smithson-
ian bureau representatives. The council partici-
pated in a 10-month workshop series on accessibil-
ity issues and completed the first phase of a
comprehensive assessment of physical and intellec-
tual access to Smithsonian programs and facilities.
Members will develop a pan-Institutional plan for
improving access to the Smithsonian for staff and
visitors with disabilities.

@ The Experimental Gallery explores and pre-
sents exhibitions that take chances with exhibition
style, content, and process. Unlike the typical
changing exhibition space, the gallery is an open
“exhibition laboratory” in which museum pro-
fessionals from within and outside the Smithson-
ian can experiment with audience development,
interpretation, design, visitor learning styles, and
interactive techniques. Staff members from
participating museums also collaborate with
Smithsonian staff in developing evaluation strate-
gies, marketing plans, public programs, and
printed materials. Among the exhibitions pre-
sented in the gallery this year were “Finding Your
Way,” by the Exploratorium, San Francisco, Cali-
fornia; “Psychology: Understanding Ourselves,
Understanding Each Other,” by the American Psy-
chological Association, Washington, D.C.; and
“Etiquette of the Undercaste,” by Antenna The-
ater, Sausalito, California.

@ The National African American Museum Proj-
ect has identified more than 500 potential do-
nors—including artists, art collectors, filmmak-
ers, historians, and collectors of black memora-
bilia and family history—who have more than
15,000 objects and who want to support the new
museum with gifts, object loans, and financial
contributions. In early 1992, task force commit-
tees were established to assist with long-range
planning for the museum, which will document
and interpret the full range and breadth of experi-
ences of people of African descent in the United
States and throughout the diaspora. The commit-
tees met to define the museum’s research, collect-
ing, and exhibition objectives and to discuss a vari-
ety of issues relating to the museum’s structure,
operations, and programs.

@ Exhibitions that received awards from the Spe-
cial Exhibition Fund, administered by the office,
included “Crosscurrents of Modernism: Four Latin
American Pioneers” (Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden), “Black Mosaic: The Changing

Face of Black Life in Washington, D.C.” (Anacos-
tia Museum), and “Spiders” (National Museum of
Natural History). Acquisitions supported by the
Collections Acquisitions Program included
Charles Willson Peale’s portrait of Anna Green
(National Portrait Gallery) and a Genard printing
press (National Museum of American History).

@ Volume 6 (1844—46) of the Joseph Henry Pa-
pers, which document the life and times of the pi-
oneer American physicist and first secretary of the
Smithsonian, was published by Smithsonian Insti-
tution Press.

@ The American Studies Program provided semi-
nars and independent study opportunities for grad-
uate students in American studies or American his-
tory departments of affiliated universities to
undertake programs of formal course work at the
Institution.

Anacostia Museum

Steven C. Newsome, Director

The Anacostia Museum is a national resource de-
voted to the interpretation of the African Ameri-
can experience in Washington, D.C., Georgia,
Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
Virginia. The museum also examines contempo-
rary social issues and their impact on African
American communities in the region.

@ The museum’s first collection management pol-
icy was completed. The policy statement places
community-based collecting and education at the
core of the museum’s efforts to protect local and re-
gional African American patrimony.

@ The museum produced and premiered the film,
“Climbin’ Jacob’s Ladder.” The film, based on the
museum’s 1987 exhibition about the rise of Afri-
can American churches in Eastern cities, will be
used to encourage the protection and collection of
materials related to the African American church
and African American traditions of worship.

@ Bus service between the National Mall and the
Anacostia Museum was inaugurated. The bus will
also transport local school and civic groups to the
museum.

@ “To Achieve These Rights: The Struggle for
Equal Rights and Self-Determination in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, 1791-1978” opened in Janu-
a

ary. The exhibition is the first to examine the role

of the nation’s capital in the national civil rights
movement.

@ Juneteenth '92, the annual celebration of eman-
cipation, attracted more than 5,000 people, who
enjoyed live performances, craft demonstrations,
and an Underground Railroad reenactment on the
museum's George Washington Carver Nature
Trail.

@ The new African American Family History Pro-
gram provides local residents with instruction and
guidance in genealogical and community history
projects.

Archives of American Art

Richard J. Wattenmaker, Director

A national research repository with centers in
Washington, D.C.; New York; Boston; Detroit;
and San Marino, California, the Archives of Amer-
ican Art has the largest collection in the world of
original source materials on the history of the vi-
sual arts in the United States. These materials in-
clude documents, photographs, works of art on pa-
per, and interviews recorded on audio- and video-
tape. The Archives is dedicated to encouraging
research in American art and cultural history by
making its collections easily accessible. Original

materials are housed in Washington, D.C., with
microfilm copies of much of the collections avail-
able in each of the Archives centers and around
the world through interlibrary loan.

@ Work began ona revised, expanded edition of
the 1989 booklet, The Papers of African American
Artists. This publication features information
about the papers of 10 African American artists
and includes a comprehensive list of the papers
and oral history interviews of African American
artists in the Archives.

m@ A new semiannual newsletter for scholars and li-
brarians provides up-to-date information about re-
cent publications, forthcoming seminars, the com-
pletion of special Archives projects, and work in
progress.

@ In January, the Archives began an 18-month
survey project of American art—related archival
materials in public and private collections in
Paris. The purpose is to locate correspondence,
journals, sketchbooks, and unpublished manu-
scripts, along with exhibition, gallery, and ship-
ping records; school registration ledgers; and asso-
ciation or organization records that illuminate the
activities of American artists in France. The proj-
ect’s goal is to prepare a guide to all of the papers
located.

@ [ra D. Glackens (1907-91) donated a collec-
tion of papers relating to the life and works of his
father, artist William J. Glackens (1870-1938).
Included in the collection is a recorded interview
from 1936, the only known recording of the artist.
@ Ina three-hour taped interview on the eve of
her 99th birthday, Beatrice Wood (b. 1893) re-
flected on her experiences and early involvement
with the Paris and New York avant-garde in the
1920s and 1930s. The interview is part of the Ar-
chives’ Women in the Arts in Southern California
Project.

@ Two exhibitions from the collections of the Ar-
chives of American Art were mounted at the gal-
lery of the Archives’ New York Regional Center.
“Hiram Powers: An American Sculptor and His
Private Patrons” presented a selection from the pa-
pers of the influential roth-century American
sculptor. “Collections—Traces—Connections: Se-
lections from the Robert Smithson Papers”
featured aspects of the extensive papers of the con-
temporary sculptor and pioneer of Earth Art, as
well as paintings, film stills, and sculpture on
loan from other institutions.
Arthur M. Sackler Gallery

Milo C. Beach, Director

The Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, which opened to
the public in 1987, was established with a gift of
nearly 1,000 works of Asian art from Dr. Arthur
M. Sackler (1913-87). The permanent collection
has grown beyond the original donation through
gift, purchase, and transfer. Dedicated to ex-
panding public knowledge of the arts and cultures
of Asia through exhibition, research, and educa-
tion, the gallery also organizes and presents travel-
ing exhibitions, which are enhanced through a var-
ied schedule of free public programs, scholarly
activities, and special events.

@ This year, the Sackler Gallery organized and
presented three major loan exhibitions and issued
publications focusing on vastly different periods
and cultures. “Challenging the Past: The Paint-
ings of Chang Dai-chien” acquainted visitors with
the work of the foremost Chinese artist of the

2oth century. “When Kingship Descended from
Heaven: Masterpieces of Mesopotamian Art from
the Louvre” introduced Washington to one of the
world’s greatest collections of this ancient mate-
rial. “Ancient Japan” presented the culture of pre-
historic Japan as far back as 200,000 B.C.

@ The gallery continued its efforts to encourage
new groups of visitors through two workshops for
area teachers, one on the exhibition “The Arts of
China” and another on “When Kingship De-
scended from Heaven.” The Education Depart-
ment led discussions of how teachers could intro-
duce Chinese art and culture into the school
curriculum and how Mesopotamian art can be
brought into the schools’ study of ancient peoples
through comparisons of rulers then and now.

@ In its efforts to be accessible to many audiences,
the gallery produced a large-print brochure for vis-
itors funded by the Smithsonian Women’s Com-
mittee. The “hands-on” collection, a group of rep-
licas and other touchable objects that docents use
to help public tour participants understand as-
pects of Asian art, grew to 200 objects through do-

nations from the public and the docents them-
selves.

@ Scholarly activities included the publication of
New Perspectives on Chu Culture during the Eastern
Zhou Period, edited by Thomas Lawton, senior re-
search scholar. The book includes four essays on
the ancient Chinese state of Chu between 770 and
221 B.C. Two scholarly symposia, “Chang Dai-
chien and His Art” and the Sackler Gallery session
of “Mughal Gardens: Sources, Representations,
Places, and Prospects,” cosponsored with Dumbar-
ton Oaks, were made possible through the gener-
osity of Mrs. Arthur M. Sackler. A third sympo-
sium, “Art, Technology, and Society in Ancient
Japan,” was supported by a grant from the Japan
Foundation. Additional support was provided by
the Harold P. Stern Memorial Fund and by All
Nippon Airways Co., Ltd.

@ The cultural traditions of Korea were the focus
of the Series in Celebration of Korean Performing
Arts, featuring three free public concerts by Ko-
rean artists. The series was cosponsored with the
U.S.—Korea Foundation of Washington, D.C.,
and was made possible by funding from United
Technologies Corporation.

@ The Sackler Gallery collection benefited from
an outpouring of 65 gifts of art from China, Ko-
rea, India, and Japan. Among this year’s acquisi-
tions was a green-glazed stoneware jar from
China’s Han dynasty (206 B.C.—A.D. 220) pur-
chased with funds from the gallery’s membership
organization, Friends of Asian Arts at the Freer
and Sackler Galleries.

Cooper-Hewitt, National
Museum of Design

Dianne H. Pilgrim, Director

Cooper-Hewitt, National Museum of Design is
one of the largest repositories for design, in the
world and the only museum in the United States
devoted exclusively to historical and contemporary
design. The museum strives to explain the design
process by recognizing the impact of design on so-
ciety, the natural environment, and the individual
and by acknowledging the interplay between cul-
ture and design. Its diverse programs include exhi-
bitions, publications, lectures, courses, school pro-
grams, and conferences keyed to significant design

issues. Cooper-Hewitt makes the collections avail-
able for study, research, and display and offers fel-
lowships, internships, and, in collaboration with
Parsons School of Design, a master’s degree pro-
gram in the history of European decorative arts.
Four curatorial departments—Decorative Arts,
Drawings and Prints, Textiles, and Wallcover-
ings—preserve, interpret, and add to the mu-
seum’s collection of nearly a quarter of a million
objects. The museum also houses a library and sev-
eral archival collections.

@ This summer the Arthur Ross Terrace and Gar-
den at Cooper-Hewitt was replanted by the horti-
cultural team of Linden B. Miller and Mary R.
Smith, who transformed the garden and terrace
into an oasis of beautiful flowers and shrubs. This
beautification added to the enjoyment of the mu-
seum’s many visitors and made Cooper-Hewitt’s
summer concerts and performances in the garden
even more spectacular.

@ Using funds from a federal appropriation desig-
nated for educational purposes, Cooper-Hewitt
presented a summer lecture-concert series, “De
Generacion a Generacion: Mexico's Living Tradi-
tions.” The series celebrated the culture and tradi-
tions that give form and meaning to Mexican
craft, ritual, music, film, and dance. The concerts
were held in the Arthur Ross Terrace and Garden.
@ During 1992, Cooper-Hewitt hired the archi-
tectural firm of James Stewart Polshek and Part-
ners to create a plan to address Cooper-Hewitt’s
problems of accessibility and renovate the mu-
seum’s two townhouses adjacent to the main build-
ing. The plan could serve as a model for other or-
ganizations facing the challenges of compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act as they
address the 20th-century programmatic needs of
museums while preserving the integrity of his-
toric structures.

@ The Colbert Foundation sponsored a benefit in
celebration of Cooper-Hewitt on June 2, 1992.
The foundation contributed $50,000 to the mu-
seum’s general operating funds.

g@ A major symposium presented by Cooper-Hew-
itt, “The Edge of the Millennium,” was a critical
exploration of the role of design at the approach of
the year 2000. The speakers included well-known
architects, industrial designers, graphic designers,
philosophers, critics, and psychologists.

@ Cooper-Hewitt cosponsored a two-day confer-
ence, “Universal Design: Access to Daily Living,”
with Pratt Institute's Center for Advanced Design
Research and Columbia University College of Phy-
sicians and Surgeons’ Department of Rehabili-
tation Medicine. The aim of the interdisciplinary
conference was to educate the public, designers,
and architects on practical and theoretical issues of
access and to explore how designers of all kinds
can create a “universally designed” environment
by developing and redesigning products, services,
transportation, and public spaces.

Freer Gallery of Art

Milo C. Beach, Director

The international reputation of the Freer Gallery
of Art is based on its outstanding collections of
Asian art dating from Neolithic times to the early
20th century and on its major holdings of works
by James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903). Addi-
tions to the collection through gift and purchase
have expanded the character of the original collec-
tion, which was presented to the United States by
Charles Lang Freer in 1906. The Freer Gallery
will reopen in May 1993 after extensive renova-
tion and expansion that will broaden its research,
exhibition, and educational programs.

@ Six masterpieces of Japanese painting from the
16th to the roth centuries from the Freer collec-
tion were conserved by specialists in Tokyo and
Kyoto and returned to Washington as part of a co-
operative effort among the gallery, the govern-
ment of Japan, the Tokyo University of Fine Arts
and Music, and the Art Research Foundation, a
Tokyo organization that supports international cul-
tural projects. Four paintings remain in Japan for
conservation, and additional paintings will be sent
for conservation under a continuing agreement.

@ The B. Y. Lam Foundation of Hong Kong
gave $1.5 million for the Freer to acquire Chinese
works of art. The gift was the largest from a sin-
gle donor that the gallery has received since it
opened to the public in 1923.

@ The Freer and Sackler galleries and the Metro-
politan Center for Far Eastern Studies of Kyoto, Ja-
pan, announced the creation of the Shimada Prize,
a biennial recognition of scholarship in the history
of East Asian art, to be awarded for the first time
in September 1993. The $10,000 prize, named in

honor of the distinguished and influential Japa-
nese scholar Shimada Shujiro, will be given to the
author of an outstanding recent publication in the
field of East Asian art history.

@ The Freer permanent collections grew by 143
works of art from Korea, China, Thailand, Viet-
nam, India, and Japan; these acquisitions in-
cluded 121 gifts and bequests. Six of the new
works were purchased with funds given by the gal-
lery’s member organization, Friends of Asian Arts
at the Freer and Sackler Galleries.

@ In preparation for the gallery's reopening, a
new Class of some 50 docents completed intensive
instruction in Asian art history and culture and
training in effective touring techniques. Together

with 50 veteran docents, the group will offer a
greater variety and number of public tours of the
Freer and Sackler galleries than had been possible
before.

w Seto and Mino Ceramics, by Louise Cort, assis-
tant curator for ceramics of the Freer and Sackler
galleries, with an appendix by Pamela B. Van-
diver, was published as the first in a series titled
Japanese Collections in the Freer Gallery of Art.
The book explores the colorfully glazed and eccen-
trically shaped ceramics from Mino and the fine
glazed pottery from Seto that are represented by
outstanding examples in the Freer’s collection.

Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden

James T. Demetrion, Director

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden ts
the Smithsonian Institution's gallery for modern
and contemporary art. The museum, which
opened in 1974, Is committed to increasing the
awareness and understanding of art through acqui-
sitions, exhibitions and publications, research ac-
tivities, public programs, and the presentation of
its collection in the galleries, plaza, and Sculpture
Garden. The museum provides a public facility

for the exhibition, study, and preservation of

\

1oth- and 2o0th-century art while presenting a
spectrum of contemporary work.

@ With the help of various acquisitions funds and
gifts from generous donors, the museum contin-
ued to acquire significant works by modern and
contemporary artists. Among the highlights for
the year were Clyfford Stull’s oil painting 1948-C
(1948); Christo’s mixed-media construction Ssore-
front (1964); Sigmar Polke’s acrylic painting Bun-
nies (1966); Rufino Tamayo’s oil painting The Solz-
tary One (1970); Christopher Wilmarth’s bronze
and steel construction Do Not Go Gently (1987);
Magdalena Abakanowicz’s burlap and wood sculp-
ture Four on a Bench (1990); and Tony Cragg’s
steel rack of rubber stamps, Sabcommittee (1991).

mw The museum’s plaza underwent a major trans-
formation designed by landscape architect James
Urban, of Annapolis, Maryland, in collaboration
with museum staff. Gradually, six grassy “rooms”
for the display of monumental sculpture from the
permanent collection took shape, enclosed by
trees and hedges and defined by granite paving.
The new plaza will also have a contemplative path-
way around its rectangular site and an access ramp
from the Mall side.

m “Crosscurrents of Modernism: Four Latin Amer-
ican Pioneers” provided a showcase for 94 works
by painters Diego Rivera (Mexican, 1886-1957),
Joaquin Torres-Garcia (Uruguayan, 1874-1949),
Wifredo Lam (Cuban, 1902-82), and Matta
(French, b. Chile, ro11). The exhibition, which
was widely noted in the press, celebrated the infu-
sion of New World culture into modern art. The
project was made possible by grants from the
Smithsonian Special Exhibition Fund and an in-
demnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and
the Humanities. Concurrent programs, supported
by a grant from the Smithsonian Educational Out-
reach Program, included a scholarly symposium
and a Latin American festival for families with
workshops, dance, and musical performances. The
exhibition and programs were part of the Smith-
sonian’s Columbus Quincentenary observance.

g Exhibitions also included a midcareer retrospec-
tive for internationally celebrated, Washington-
born sculptor Martin Puryear and smaller shows
highlighting a theme, a group of works, or a site-
generated project by such contemporary artists as
Saint Clair Cemin, Alfredo Jaar, the collaborative
team of Tim Rollins and K.O.S. (Kids of Sur-
vival), Thomas Struth, and Francesc Torres.
gw Workshops highlighted the museum's educa-
tion programs. Sculptor Martin Puryear con-
ducted a workshop for 35 students from local high
schools, and 50 teachers spent an afternoon at the
museum in a training session on Puryear’s sculp-
ture. The Smithsonian Women’s Committee and
the Silver Spring and Prince George’s County
chapters of the LINKS, Inc., made the programs
possible. To create the centerpiece for their Direc-
tions exhibition, the South Bronx—based collec-
tive of Tim Rollins and K.O.S. held a week-long
workshop at the Duke Ellington School of the
Arts with 11 students from area schools.

@ Visitors were fascinated by A History of the Rus-
sian Revolution from Marx to Mayakovsky (1965), by
American artist Larry Rivers, newly reinstalled in
the permanent collection galleries. The mural-
scaled assemblage, which depicts one of the mod-
ern era’s most eventful narratives, gave viewers a
historical backdrop for contemporary events in
Eastern Europe.

Institutional Studies Office

Zahava D. Doering, Director

The Institutional Studies Office is a pan-Institu-
tional resource dedicated to the scientific study of
the characteristics, attitudes, opinions, and experi-
ences of Smithsonian constituencies. The office
conducts studies for senior management, muse-
ums, programs or research efforts within the muse-
ums, and Smithsonian offices and operations that
have a pan-Institutional focus. Among its topics
are audience and membership profiles, the educa-
tional value of the museum experience, and self-
study of Smithsonian operations, including ongo-
ing analysis of employee composition.

@ The office, in conjunction with the Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Education and Public
Service, completed a major study, Educational Pro-
gram Inventory, based on a 1991 program inven-
tory. The study revealed the breadth and diversity
of Smithsonian educational activities.

@ Ongoing analyses of the racial, ethnic, and gen-
der composition of the Smithsonian staff helped
management monitor a changing environment.

@ Studies for Smithsonian bureaus and offices in-
cluded an assessment of visitor experience at the

exhibition “ ‘Degenerate Art’: The Fate of the
Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany” at both its Wash-
ington, D.C., and Berlin, Germany, venues. The
office also conducted surveys of the membership of
the Cooper-Hewitt, National Museum of Design;
visitors to the Anacostia Museum; and partici-
pants in several Smithsonian concert series and
symposia.

International Gallery

The International Gallery presents exhibitions
that deal with significant topics from various disci-
plinary or cultural perspectives and that either
complement the work of Smithsonian bureaus or
represent an area outside the Institution’s collec-
tions. Public and scholarly programs are planned
in conjunction with exhibitions that appear in the
gallery, which 1s located in the S. Dillon Ripley
Center.

@ “ Degenerate Art’: The Fate of the Avant-
Garde in Nazi Germany,” an examination of mod-
ern works condemned by the authorities in Nazi
Germany, was featured this year in the Interna-
tional Gallery. A well-attended all-day forum,
“Degenerate Art: Perspectives and Issues,” was
presented in conjunction with the exhibition.

@ The gallery organized an exhibition of Arme-
nian tiles from Jerusalem titled “Views of Para-
dise: Tile Paintings by Marie Balian” for a show-
ing in the S. Dillon Ripley Center concourse.

@ The gallery was host to “Art as Activist: Revo-
lutionary Posters from Central and Eastern Eu-
rope,” organized by the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service.

present the history, science, technology, and so-
cial impact of aeronautics and spaceflight and to
investigate and exhibit the nature of the universe
and our environment. The museum’s two histort-
cal research departments—Aeronautics and Space
History—conduct studies on the origin and devel-
opment of flight through the atmosphere and in
space, while the museum's two scientific labora-
tories—the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies
and the Laboratory for Astrophysics—carry out
programs of basic research in satellite remote sens-
ing of the environment, planetary surfaces and at-
mospheres, observational and theoretical astro-
physics, and the development of infrared

astronomical instruments for spacecraft.

@ The museum opened “Legend, Memory, and
the Great War in the Air,” which examines the
mythology of World War I aviation. The gallery
contrasts the popular perception of gallant knights
of the air with the gritty reality of early military
aviation. Accompanying the exhibition were a
book of the same title and a 10-week lecture and
film series.

@ The museum’s “Star Trek” exhibition commem-
orated the 25th anniversary of the popular 1960s
television series and examined how the series used
the science fiction genre to comment on the politi-
cal, social, and ethical issues of its time, including
superpower relations, civil rights and urban un-
rest, sexuality, and Vietnam.

® Scientific papers on the discovery of multiple
jets outflowing from newly born stars, the possibil-
ity of laser emission from coronal lines in galactic

nuclei, and a new theoretical model for the origin
of galaxies were published by the staff of the Labo-
ratory for Astrophysics. The Center for Earth and
Planetary Studies used new results from the Magel-
lan mission to Venus in comparing surface tec-
tonic features on the terrestrial planets and pub-
lished a rationale for a return mission to Chryse
Planitia on Mars, the site of the Viking I lander
that 1s part of the museum’s collection.

@ Efforts continue to reach out to diverse audi-
ences. “Say Yes to a Youngster’s Future,” a pro-
gram designed to enhance math and science learn-
ing among children of varied ethnic backgrounds,
was cosponsored by the National Urban Coalition
and the museum’s Minority Outreach Office. The
museum also offers a summer jobs program that
places local high school students in aerospace-re-
lated and museum jobs in the Washington, D.C.,
area.

@ The Aeronautics Department and the Smithson-
ian Institution Press marked the fifth anniversary
of the Smithsonian History of Aviation Series,
which publishes original monographs, reprints,
and translations and has been recognized as a sig-
nificant contribution to aviation history. Stanley
Sandler's Segregated Skies, an account of the
Tuskegee Airmen, and Michael Gorn’s The Univer-
sal Man, a biography of aerospace scientist Theo-
dore Von Karman, were both published this year
as part of the series. Also published this year by
Oxford University Press was Cardinal Choices,
which details the role of science advisers to the
presidents during the Cold War; the author is the
Department of Space History’s chairman, Gregg
Herken.

@ A temporary structure was erected at Washing-
ton Dulles International Airport to house the
SR-71 Blackbird, which has been stored outdoors
since it was received last year. The structure, 65
feet wide by 12 feet long, is all steel and was fabri-
cated on site with donated materials and services.

National Museum
of African Art

Sylvia H. Williams, Director

The National Museum of African Art is the only
museum in the United States dedicated solely to
the collection, preservation, research, exhibition,
and interpretation of the visual arts of sub-Saharan
Africa. The museum offers visitors the opportu-
nity to gain a better understanding of the extraor-
dinarily diverse cultures and visual traditions of
this vast region through its wide range of educa-
tional programs and its permanent and temporary
exhibitions. In addition, the museum serves as a
research and reference center, housing the Eliot
Elisofon Photographic Archives and the Warren
M. Robbins Library, a branch of the Smithsonian
Institution Libraries, as well as exhibition galleries
and educational facilities.

@ The museum opened “Purpose and Perfection:
Pottery as a Woman’s Art in Central Africa,” a
new permanent exhibition featuring more than 60
vessels collected between 1900 and 1950.

@ The Eliot Elisofon Photographic Archives en-
tered its entire collection of 26,500 field slides by
renowned Life magazine photographer Eliot Eliso-
fon into a new data base. The data base facilitates
access to the collection and allows museum staff
and archives visitors to conduct research by both
theme and ethnic group.

@ The museum acquired a monumental Ubangi
slit gong, carved in the form of a bush cow.

National Museum of
American Art

Elizabeth Broun, Director

The National Museum of American Art is com-
mitted to the acquisition, preservation, study,
and exhibition of American painting, sculpture,
graphic arts, photography, folk art, and crafts. As
the largest collection of American art in the
world, the museum houses more than 36,500 ob-
jects. The Renwick Gallery, a curatorial depart-
ment of the museum, collects and exhibits Ameri-
can crafts and decorative arts and sponsors research
and educational activities in the modern craft
movement. Through all its programs for general

audiences and scholars, the museum seeks to ex-

pand public understanding of American art and to
ensure that its collections include diverse artistic
achievements that were once unrecognized.

@ The Renwick Gallery, the nation’s premier col-
lection of American craft, observed its 20th anni-
versary in 1992 with a variety of public celebra-
tions, including a gala benefit in April and the
exhibition “American Crafts: The Nation’s Collec-
tion,” which highlighted the scope and promi-
nence of the Renwick’s acquisitions. The biennial
Patricia and Philip Frost Prize for Distinguished
Scholarship in American Crafts was established in
observance of the anniversary.

@ A unique new collection of landscape photogra-
phy, acquired by the museum over the past four
years entirely with outside support, was presented
in the spring exhibition “Between Home and
Heaven: Contemporary American Landscape Pho-
tography.” Numbering more than 300 images,
the collection addresses a significant concern of
many artists today: the fragile coexistence of na-
ture and human culture in the late 20th century.
A photography contest for high school students
was held in conjunction with the exhibition,
which will tour nationally to seven locations.

@ Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!), a three-year
nationwide campaign to identify and record the
condition of outdoor sculpture located in 50
states, was officially launched in February by the
museum and the National Institute for the Conser-
vation of Cultural Property. By the fall, SOS! had
funded 63 projects in 36 states, and comprehen-
sive survey training sessions for representatives of
these projects were held at the museum in May
and September.

@ An exceptionally fine portrait, Mrs. George Wat-
son (1765), by John Singleton Copley (1738—
1815), the most renowned of America’s colonial-
era artists, was acquired through partial gift and
purchase. For more than a decade, the museum
had searched for a Copley of this quality for its col-
lections, which represent 200 years of American
artistic achievement.

@ “Folk Art across America,” a new installation
designed to recognize the creativity of self-taught
arusts and delight visitors with its rich variety,
opened in the spring on the museum’s first floor.
Embracing folk art as an equal partner in Ameri-
can art, the display of 60 objects, ranging from a
whimsical bottle-cap giraffe and visionary paint-
ings to fancy quilts and trade signs, redefines the

ways in which visitors are encouraged to think
about the history of American art.

w@ Free within Ourselves: African-American Artists in
the Collection of the National Museum of American
Art, published by the museum in association with
Pomegranate Artbooks, 1s a testament to the ex-
traordinary, yet often untold, contributions of
black artists to the nation’s art and culture. The il-
lustrated book presents a dramatic variety of paint-
ings, sculpture, and works on paper by 31 artists
from the 18th century to the 1980s. The museum
plans to distribute 4,000 copies to school systems
and educators nationwide, and an exhibition
based on the book will go on tour to museums
across the country for two years. The publication,
distribution project, and exhibition were funded
entirely by a donor.

National Museum
of American History
Roger G. Kennedy, Director

The National Museum of American History
(NMAH) preserves, honors, and celebrates the na-
tion’s heritage in exhibitions, concerts, books,
symposia, drama, films, recordings, and school
outreach programs that promote understanding of
the experiences and aspirations of all the American
people. As an educational institution, NNAH
uses its collections of more than 17 million ob-
jects—ranging from American Indian artifacts
and the original Star Spangled Banner to mighty
locomotives and tiny computer chips—to docu-
ment the amazing diversity and vitality of Ameri-
can culture and present this rich, living legacy to
audiences on the National Mall and beyond. Re-
search by scholars and specialists informs all
NMAH undertakings, including the stewardship
and conservation of the national treasures that
make up its collections, and the museum’s ar-
chives are one of the most comprehensive reposi-
tories of American history materials in existence.

@ ‘First Ladies: Political Role and Public Image”
is the first major museum exhibition to study first
ladies from Martha Washington to Barbara Bush
in the contexts of political history, women’s his-
tory, and the American public’s perceptions and
evolving expectations. The permanent exhibition
traces the experiences and impact of these women
through hundreds of historic photographs, docu-
ments, and personal artifacts. “First Ladies”
marked the welcome return to public view of 28
historic gowns and dresses from the popular First
Ladies Collection, removed in 1987 for extensive
conservation work.

mw “American Encounters,” a new permanent exhi-
bition commemorating the Columbus Quincen-
tenary, chronicles the experiences, struggles, com-
promises, and eventual coexistence among Ameri-
can Indian, Hispanic, and Anglo-American peo-
ples in the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico that
began in 1539 with the arrival of Spanish soldiers
and missionaries. An old story with modern impli-
cations, it is told through historic and contempo-
rary artifacts, works of art, and audio and video re-
cordings of narrative stories, music, and dance.

@ The museum's Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks
Orchestra, in conjunction with the Smithsonian
Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, received
a $7 million grant from the Lila Wallace—Reader’s
Digest Fund—the largest single grant ever given
to the Smithsonian—to fund a 10-year program
of traveling exhibitions, performances, educa-
tional programs, recordings, and other activities
at the Smithsonian and throughout the United
States beginning in April 1993.

@ NMAH'’s Division of Musical History joined
with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Per-
forming Arts, the Library of Congress, the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, and the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars to present a festi-
val of performances, symposia, and exhibitions
marking the 200th anniversary of Mozart's death.

@ The National Numismatic Collection acquired
142 counterfeit dies of ancient Greek, Roman,
and Byzantine coins. These dies allow identifica-
tion and documentation of counterfeit coins that
have been considered authentic by experts and mu-
seums throughout the world.

@ [na continuing innovative partnership with
Washington, D.C., public schools, NMAH’s Di-
vision of Education introduced its pilot Young In-
terpreters Program, in which five high school ju-
niors trained and served as museum interpreters.
For six weeks during the summer, they performed
dramatic vignettes in the “Field to Factory” exhibi-
tion and gave cart demonstrations throughout the
museum. The students worked 30 hours a week

and received stipends from DC Arts, a District of
Columbia agency.

@ Duke Ellington’s first Broadway musical, “Beg-
gar’s Holiday,” unrecorded and lost for decades,
was discovered in fragments among the vast Duke
Ellington Collection in the museum's Archives
Center. NMAH’s Division of Museum Programs
reconstructed the score, with lyrics by John La-
touche, and produced the first performance in 45
years of Ellington’s composition as part of the
American Song series.

National Museum
of the American Indian
W. Richard West, Jr., Director

The National Museum of the American Indian 1s
an institution of living culture dedicated to the
preservation, study, and exhibition of the life, lan-
guages, literature, history, and arts of the native
peoples of the Western Hemisphere. Its formal
mission is to recognize and affirm to native com-
munities and the non-native public the historical
and contemporary culture and cultural achieve-
ments of the natives of the Western Hemisphere
by advancing—in consultation, collaboration,
and cooperation with natives—knowledge and un-
derstanding of native cultures. The museum has a
special responsibility, through innovative public
programming, research, and collections, to pro-
tect, support, and enhance the development,

and communities.

@ More than 600 objects have been selected by 28
native selectors from throughout the Western
Hemisphere for “Points of View,” the working ti-
tle of one of four inaugural exhibitions under de-
velopment for the 1994 opening of the George
Gustav Heye Center of the museum in New York
City. “Points of View” will include documented
comments of the selectors. A collaboration among
20 contemporary artists representing various cul-
tures and disciplines, including performance and
visual artists and writers, is also being developed,
along with an orientation exhibition. The inaugu-
ral will include “Shared Visions: Native American
Painters and Sculptors in the Twentieth Century,”
an exhibition from the Heard Museum in Phoe-
nix, Arizona.

m@ “The Way of the People,” the first report of the
continuing dialogue and consultations with Amer-
ican Indians, was released. The report summarizes
the 11 consultations held through November 22,
1991. Dialogue between the museum and the Na-
tive American community began in 1991 and con-
tinued with six consultations held in fiscal year
1992, each attended by approximately 40 partici-
pants. The purpose of these meetings, which will
be a permanent aspect of the museum, is to obtain
programmatic information that will guide the de-
sign of the museum on the National Mall in
Washington, D.C., and the cultural resources cen-
ter in Suitland, Maryland.

@ Progress continued on the renovation and his-
toric preservation of the first two floors of the Alex-
ander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, which will
house the museum’s George Gustav Heye Center
in New York City. The rotunda was completea
for the November 15, 1992, opening of “Path-
ways of Tradition: Indian Insights into Indian
Worlds,” a temporary exhibition of 100 objects
representing a cross section of American Indian
culture and creativity and a microcosm of the mu-
seum’s mission. Objects for the exhibition were se-
lected by 18 American Indians, continuing the
policy of consultation and development by the peo-
ples and cultures that the museum represents.

@ Architectural firms to design the museum’s col-
lections research center in suburban Maryland
were selected in June. The design team consists of
James Stewart Polshek and Partners, of New York
City and San Francisco, a 50-person firm that was
honored in 1992 for a decade of design excellence;
Metcalf Tobey & Partners, of Reston, Virginia,
specialists in the design of technologically com-
plex buildings; and the Native American Design
Collaborative, an association of 24 Native Ameri-
can—owned architectural and engineering firms.
Louis Weller (Caddo/Cherokee), of Albuquerque,
New Mexico, is the chairman of the board of direc-
tors of the collaborative.

@ As the year ended, the Smithsonian had re-
quested submissions for qualifications of architects
and engineers to design and construct the Na-
tional Museum of the American Indian on the Na-
tional Mall, which is scheduled for completion by
the end of the decade.

National Portrait Gallery

Alan Fern, Director

The National Portrait Gallery is dedicated to the
collection, preservation, exhibition, and study of
portraits of people who have made significant con-
tributions to American history and to the study of
the artists who created such portraiture. The gal-
lery sponsors a variety of scholarly and public activ-
ities for audiences interested in American art.

@ The National Portrait Gallery mounted several
special exhibitions this year. “Ralph Earl: The
Face of the Young Republic” was the first exhibi-
tion ever devoted to this artist's work. “Noble
Heritage: Five Centuries of Portraits from the Ho-
sokawa Family” was the latest in a series exhib-
iting foreign portraits. “Arnold Newman’s Ameri-
cans” celebrated the acquisition (by purchase and
gift) of 101 photographic portraits by this contem-
porary master, whose career spans more than 50
years. “‘The Spirit of Party’: Hamilton and Jeffer-
son at Odds” honored the 250th anniversary of Jef-
ferson’s birth and explored the interaction be-
tween these men and their circles of supporters.

@ Major acquisitions by the National Portrait Gal-
lery included a 1769 oil painting by Charles Will-
son Peale titled Anne Catharine Hoof Green, a rare
example of a portrait of a woman professional dur-
ing colonial times, and Thomas Jefferson, an oil
painting on panel copied in 1836 by Charles Bird
King from Gilbert Stuart’s 1805 medallion pro-
file, which was the image most admired by Jeffer-
son’s family and discriminating friends.

@ Special programs and events in 1992 included
“An Evening with Katharine Graham,” an inter-
view with the chairman of the board of the Wash-
ington Post Company, the latest in the gallery's
popular self-portrait series.

gw Among the many public programs at the Na-
tional Portrait Gallery this year were a poetry read-
ing highlighting the works of such American po-
ets as Carl Sandburg, Langston Hughes, Anne
Bradstreet, Walt Whitman, and Phillis
Wheatley, part of the series Cultures in Motion:
Portraits in American Diversity. Other programs
included staged bilingual readings from the plays
of Maria Irene Fornes, produced in collaboration
with the Gala Hispanic Theater; staged readings
of selected plays and poetry by Jessie Fauset and
May Miller; a dramatization of the efforts of inde-
pendent Hawaii's last queen, Liliuokalani, to pre-
serve her country’s culture and political status, as
well as her own reign; a theatrical presentation of
excerpts from the works of Theodor Geisel (Dr.
Seuss); and lectures, performances, and demonstra-
tions relating to the Hosokawa exhibition.

@ The Education Department held a number of
workshops for families drawing inspiration from
exhibitions and the collections. Among them
were photo workshops in conjunction with the
“Arnold Newman’s Americans” exhibition that in-
troduced participants to Newman’s individual
style and gave them an opportunity to explore
photographic composition and produce their own
Polaroid portraits.

@ The Catalog of American Portraits received a

grant from the Smithsonian Women’s Committee

to survey and record portraits in New Mexico.

@ The gallery’s publications this year included No-
ble Heritage: Five Centuries of Portraits from the Hoso-
kawa Family, by Jared Lubarsky, a catalogue docu-
menting the role of this prominent Japanese
family in government, art, and scholarship; Ar-
nold Newman’s Americans, with essays by Newman
and the gallery’s director, Alan Fern, which high-
lights the photographer's record of “a cross section
of the history of our times”; and “The Spirit of
Party”: Hamilton and Jefferson at Odds, by National
Portrait Gallery historian Margaret C. S.
Christman, an account of the roots of the bitterly
partisan rivalry between the two men in the
1790s.

pert in traveling and temporary exhibitions, as
well as permanent installations. The office also pro-
vides training and guidance on exhibit develop-
ment and state-of-the-art artifact storage and han-

dling facilities.

@ OEC continues to prepare a variety of exhibi-
tions for the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Ex-
hibition Service (SITES). This year, working with
curators from the National Museum of American
History, the office edited, designed, and produced
“Perpetual Campaign: The Making of the People’s
President” and “Who's in Charge? Workers and
Managers in the United States.” OEC also de-
signed, edited, and produced “Fragile Ecologies:
Artists’ Interpretations and Solutions,” an art exhi-
bition that addresses environmental concerns. In
addition, OEC created graphics for, edited, pro-
duced, crated, and shipped the SITES traveling
version of “Seeds of Change,” the major Columbus
Quincentenary exhibition of the National Mu-
seum of Natural History.

@ OEC has been actively involved in exhibits at
the International and Experimental galleries since
their inception. Recent projects have included
““Degenerate Art’: The Fate of the Avant-Garde
in Nazi Germany” and “Imperial Austria: Trea-
sures of Art, Arms & Armor from the State of
Styria,” as well as “The Kids Bridge,” which con-
fronts the issues of prejudice and racism.

@ OEC 1s involved in the establishment of exhibi-
tions in the Smithsonian’s newest museums: the
National Postal History and Philatelic Museum
and the National Museum of the American In-
dian. For the 1993 opening of the Postal Mu-
seum, for example, OEC is creating historically ac-
curate ship and railway models, as well as
sculpting horse and human mannequins. For the
National Museum of the American Indian, OEC
is editing scripts, fabricating exhibit furniture,
and sculpting mannequins for the two inaugural
exhibitions at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Cus-
tom House in New York City.

@ OEC undertakes a broad range of projects for
the National Museum of Natural History, provid-
ing specialized services such as taxidermy, speci-
men restoration, freeze drying, and model mak-
ing, in addition to editing and design. For the
museum's new insect zoo, OEC ts creating models
and dioramas, editing text, and advising on ob-
ject selection.

Office of Museum Programs

Rex M. Ellis, Director

The Office of Museum Programs fosters public ac-
cess to the Institution by providing training and
professional development in museum practices.
These opportunities are available to staff, interns,
volunteers, and trustees from the Smithsonian and
from museums throughout the United States and
abroad.

@ The office continued its mandate to increase its
museology services to Smithsonian staff by spon-
soring “Managing Smithsonian Collections,” a
12-week training program attended by more than
40 employees from 15 Smithsonian bureaus and
offices. The course addressed the legal and ethical
responsibilities of assembling and maintaining col-
lections, explained practical measures used to man-
age and care for Smithsonian collections, and sug-
gested ways to communicate collections
management principles to other Smithsonian

staff.

@ The office’s American Indian Museum Studies
programs sponsored five collections and museum
management workshops at tribal museums and
cultural centers throughout the United States and
hosted two American Indian interns at the Smith-
sonian. The creation of the Native American Mu-
seums and Cultural Centers Resource File in the
Museum Reference Center will facilitate the shar-
ing of information with tribal museums and cul-
tural centers. The file contains printed and visual
resources collected by the office since 1981.

@ The promotion of leadership in museum man-
agement and methods continued through two pro-
grams. The Awards for Museum Leadership Pro-
gram recognized the achievements of people of
color who work in museums. This year the award
recipients gathered at the Smithsonian to debate
the resolution “Our society does not need cultur-
ally specific museums.” The Fellowships in Mu-
seum Practice Program, newly established
through a grant from the Smithsonian Women’s
Committee, is the first program in the United
States to fund research that strengthens and ex-
pands the educational role of museums.

@ The office provided orientation and counseling
services and career programs to more than 700 in-
terns at the Smithsonian. Recruitment and out-
reach were enhanced this year with the publica-
tion of a new edition of Internship Opportunities at
the Smithsonian Institution, a comprehensive descrip-
tion of 40 internship programs.

Office of
Quincentenary Programs

Alicia M. Gonzalez, Director

The Office of Quincentenary Programs coordi-
nated the broadest array of programs and activities
the Institution has ever presented for an anniver-
sary commemoration to observe the 500th anniver-
sary of Christopher Columbus’s 1492 arrival in
the Americas. This occasion offered the opportu-
nity to examine the cultural, historical, and scien-
tific repercussions of the meeting of two hemi-
spheres. Activities included exhibitions such as
“Seeds of Change,” “American Encounters,” and
“The West as America, 1820-1920: Reinterpret-
ing Images of the Frontier”; the Festival of Ameri-
can Folklife and the Potato Festival; and myriad
symposia, lectures, performances, publications,
video recordings, and television and radio series.
The pan-Institutional commemoration reflected

the diversity of Smithsonian research interests and
allowed the public to learn about the significance
of Columbus's voyages from a broad perspective.
A sampling of these activities follows.

@ The symposium “Images: Women in the Amer-
icas” examined the ways women have been por-
trayed among Europeans, Africans, and indige-
nous Americans from the period of contact
through contemporary times. The symposium,
which featured speakers from around the world,
looked at women’s achievements and changes in
their social status from a variety of class, color, ra-
cial, religious, and national perspectives.

@ The third issue of The New World, the newslet-
ter of the Office of Quincentenary Programs, was
published in August 1992; it examined the Asian
influence in the Americas. More than 10,000 cop-
ies of the newsletter—in English and Span-
ish—were distributed throughout the United
States, Latin America, and Spain.

w A five-part television series, “Buried Mirror: Re-
flections on Spain and the New World by Carlos
Fuentes,” premiered on the Discovery Channel on
April 19, 1992. The series offered a sweeping
view of Spanish and Latin American history and
was written and narrated by the well-known
author.

@ Meetings were held during the year to develop
a working paper on the Institute of the Americas,
a permanent program to focus on the history and
culture of the Americas. A study will be con-
ducted in 1993.

Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service

Anna R. Cohn, Director

The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition
Service (SITES) expands the Smithsonian’s pres-
ence beyond Washington, D.C., to millions of
people each year by circulating exhibitions to mu-
seums, libraries, science centers, historical soci-
eties, ZoOS, aquariums, community centers, and
schools. SITES programs represent a range of hu-
man perspectives. They pose questions, communi-
cate abstractions, and challenge visitors to make
connections among objects, people, places,
events, and ideas. By emphasizing diverse view-

points and by using inquiry as a means for inter-
preting exhibition themes and images, SITES en-
courages visitors to explore the full breadth of
possibilities inherent in themselves, others, and
the world around them.

@ SITES, the National Museum of American His-
tory, the Office of Public Affairs, and the Office of
Development cosponsored a major media event in
May to announce a $7 million grant from the Lila
Wallace—Reader’s Digest Fund awarded to the
Smithsonian for a 10-year jazz initiative, “Amer-
ica’s Jazz Heritage.” This project will include trav-
eling exhibitions, performances, educational pro-
grams, recordings, special events, publications,
research, and radio programs at the Smithsonian
and throughout the United States.

@ SITES and the American Library Association
produced and began circulating a panel adaptation
of the National Museum of Natural History's ma-
jor Columbus Quincentenary exhibition, “Seeds of
Change.” Five copies began traveling nationwide
in January and will visit public libraries in all 50
states through early 1994.

m@ Nineteen SITES statf became federal employees
in April as the result of a significant federal appro-
priation for staff salaries and benefits received by
SITES in fiscal year 1991. Increased federal sup-
port for SITES will translate into more affordable
traveling exhibitions and thus into expanded op-
portunities for people across the country to experi-
ence the full range of Smithsonian programs.

@ [na distinctive partnership, SITES joined with
Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art, the non-

Education and
Public Service

Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Education
and Public Service

James C. Early, Assistant Secretary

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Education
and Public Service advises the secretary and the
under secretary on policy matters relating to pub-
lic education, cultural pluralism and cultural eq-
uity, and wider audience initiatives. The office
and the units it oversees disseminate information
about the Smithsonian to national and interna-
tional audiences, collaborate with elementary and
secondary schools and educational associations,
and engage in applied research and the documenta-
tion of living cultures. The office also provides pol-
icy guidance and programmatic assistance to help
strengthen the Institution’s overall program of cul-
tural diversity.

@ This year the office focused on developing pol-
icy objectives and goals in education. While recog-
nizing the importance of the Smithsonian’s varied
educational activities, the office identified precolle-
giate educational programming as the top priority
for Institution-wide action.

@ Guidelines for the Educational Outreach Pro-
gram were revised. Grants were awarded in the fol-
lowing areas: teacher enrichment projects; Curricu-
lum development projects that match the needs of
school systems with the resources available at the
Smithsonian; educational projects that underscore
collaboration between museums and other educa-
tional institutions; and educational projects for
teenagers and families in “at-risk” socioeconomic
groups.

@ The Smithsonian published Educational Program
Inventory, the first study categorizing such activi-
ties at the Institution. The study provides the ba-
sis for the current priorities of the office: to foster
stronger collegiality among educators at the
Smithsonian and to monitor and coordinate educa-
tional programs to eliminate the duplication of ef-
fort and to ensure better allocation of budgetary
resources.

@ The Smithsonian's Cultural Education Commit-
tee advised the secretary to expand the employ-
ment of culturally diverse staff throughout the In-
stitution by placing greater accountability at the
managerial level. The committee's recommenda-
tions focused on the hiring and promotion of mi-
norities in research, curatorial, editorial, and con-
tract areas.

Center for Folklife Programs
and Cultural Studies

Richard Kurin, Director

The Center for Folklife Programs and Cultural
Studies engages in cultural conservation and repre-
sentation activities that promote continuity, integ-
rity, and equity for traditional ethnic, tribal, re-
gional, minority, and working-class cultures in
the United States and abroad. Staff folklorists, cul-
tural anthropologists, and ethnomusicologists re-
search the expressive traditions of American and
worldwide grass roots cultures. They publish and
present their work to scholarly and public audi-
ences through the Festival of American Folklife,
Smithsonian/Folkways Recordings, the Folklife
Studies monograph/film series, cultural education
programs, and the Folkways Archives.

@ The 26th annual Festival of American Folklife
featured three programs on the occasion of the Co-
lumbus Quincentenary that examined the encoun-
ters of New and Old World cultures: “New Mex-
ico,” “Creativity and Resistance: Maroon Culture
in the Americas,” and “The Changing Soundscape

in Indian Country.” A fourth program, “Workers
at the White House,” celebrated the 200th anni-
versary of the president's official residence.

@ The U.S. Virgin Islands program presented at
the 1990 Festival of American Folklife was staged
in St. Croix with support and collaboration from
the center and included the participation of Sene-
galese folk artists and the Freedom Singers.

@ In Indonesia, the first part of a 20-volume se-
ries on Indonesian music and verbal arts has been
published on Smithsonian/Folkways Recordings
with the help of the Ford Foundation. The re-
cordings use music to teach history, geography,
and social studies to Indonesian students. The col-
laborative project also helped train Indonesian re-
searchers, technicians, and archivists.

w A Mayan storyteller who participated in the
1991 Folklife Festival published a book about the
festival as he and other Chiapanecos experienced
it. A film documentary by a Chiapaneco team ex-
amines the participation of Chiapan Mayan people
in the festival in relation to that of other Indian
groups.

B Joint teams of folklorists from the United
States and the Commonwealth of Independent
States continue their fieldwork among American
communities and related populations in the for-
mer Soviet Union.

National Science
Resources Center

Douglas M. Lapp, Executive Director

The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) is
operated by the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Academy of Sciences to help improve the
teaching of science in the nation’s schools. The
NSRC collects and disseminates information
about exemplary science teaching resources, devel-
ops innovative science curriculum materials, and
sponsors outreach and technical assistance activi-
ties to help school districts develop and sustain
hands-on science programs.

@ With its first Working Conference for Scien-
tists and Engineers on Precollege Science Educa-
tion, the NSRC launched the National Elemen-
tary Science Leadership Initiative (NESLI).
Twenty-eight scientists and engineers represent-
ing academia, federal research facilities, and pri-
vate industry participated. For one week, they
worked at the California Institute of Technology
with innovative science teaching materials, ob-
served hands-on science teaching and learning in
local public school classrooms, and discussed sci-
ence education reform issues with national leaders
in the field. Participants developed recommenda-
tions on how scientists and engineers can most ef-
fectively contribute to sustained improvement in
precollege (K—12) science education. The NSRC
has since begun national distribution of the recom-
mendations and plans to issue a formal report.

@ The NSRC’s NESLI project also supported two
Elementary Science Leadership Institutes, at-
tended by 29 teams of teachers, administrators,
and scientists from 84 school districts in 15 states.
Since 1989, 72 teams from schools serving nearly
2 million children in 32 states, the District of Co-
lumbia, Mexico, and Canada have participated in
these week-long institutes, which feature work-
shops and discussions on strategies for implement-
ing effective elementary science programs at the lo-
cal level.

@ The NSRC continued to develop, market, and
publish units of hands-on lessons as part of its ele-
mentary science curriculum project, Science and
Technology for Children (STC). To date, 18 STC
units have been trial-taught, 14 have been field-
tested, and 6 are available in commercial editions.
School districts across the country are now intro-
ducing the units into their elementary schools.

@ The NSRC continued to collect and catalogue
information for the publication of a guide to effec-
tive secondary school science teaching resources
similar to its elementary science guide. The ele-
mentary-level guide is being revised, and comput-
erized data bases of the information in both guides
are being upgraded for eventual access by science
educators through an electronic telecommunica-
tions network.

Office of Elementary
and Secondary Education

Ann Bay, Director

As the Smithsonian Institution’s central office for
precollege education, the Office of Elementary
and Secondary Education draws on resources from
throughout the Institution to meet the needs of
teachers and students in the Washington, D.C.,
area and nationwide. The office also serves as a
clearinghouse of information about Smithsonian
educational materials and programs and works to
encourage communication and collaboration
among Smithsonian education units and between
those units and outside educational organizations.
An important goal of the office is to educate
young people and their teachers about the value of
museums and related institutions as learning re-
sources and about how to use museums and their
primary source materials to acquire factual knowl-
edge and analytical skills. These efforts involve col-
laboration with schools, school systems, universi-
ties, and other museums, reaching thousands of
teachers and millions of students each year. The of-
fice carries out programming in four categories:
professional development for teachers, curriculum
materials for schools, programs and materials for
children and teenagers, and clearinghouse ser-
vices.

@ For the second year, a collaboration with two
District of Columbia public schools in affiliation
with the Foxfire Foundation brought teachers into
Smithsonian museums for internships to develop
classroom materials and lessons on African Ameri-
can history and culture.

@ The office’s work in teacher preparation and en-
hancement included the second annual day-long
symposium, “Word of Mouth: Learning and
Teaching through Stories,” and a series of 11 one-
week courses on a variety of subjects relating to
school curricula. Course topics ranged from the
history of U.S. political protest to teaching ecol-
ogy to cross-cultural communications.

@ Supported by a grant from Brother Interna-
tional, the office published “Protest and Patrio-
tism,” a high school curriculum kit that helps stu-
dents explore the history of American protest by
examining populism, the civil rights struggle,
and the environmental movement. More than
15,000 copies were sent on request to schools na-
tionwide.

Wider Audience
Development Program
Marshall J. Wong, Director

The Wider Audience Development Program sup-
ports efforts to strengthen the Smithsonian’s inter-
action with culturally diverse communities. Exam-
ples of the program’s work include coordinating
pan-Institutional observances of federally desig-
nated ethnic and women’s heritage, organizing pe-
riodic forums for Smithsonian staff on issues relat-
ing to cultural pluralism, and collecting and
analyzing data on nontraditional audiences. The
program also provides operational support to the
Smithsonian Cultural Education Committee, a

group of private citizens that advises Smithsonian
management on cultural pluralism in education
and hiring.

@ For American Indian Heritage Month in No-
vember, the Honorable Elijah Harper (Ojibwa), a
member of the Canadian Parliament and honorary
chief of the Red Sucker Lake Band, spoke on sover-
eignty issues facing indigenous Canadians.

gm Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, ethnomusicologist and
senior pastor of Canaan Baptist Church in Har-
lem, was the speaker for Black History Month ob-
servances in February. Walker spoke on the Afri-
can roots of black sacred music.

@ The Smithsonian’s commemoration of
Women’s History Month in March featured a talk
by U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton
(D-D.C.) on contemporary issues facing working
women.

@ During Asian Pacific American Heritage
Month in May, Evelyn Hu-DeHart, director of
the Center for Studies of Ethnicity and Race in
America, University of Colorado at Boulder,
spoke on Asians throughout the Americas.

@ The Hispanic Heritage Month keynote address
in September featured Luis Cancel, executive direc-
tor of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. Cancel
spoke about efforts to increase Latino representa-
tion in museum programs and exhibitions.

ate Program U.S. study tours increased by 13 per-

cent over fiscal 1991. International study tour en-

rollment increased by 13 percent, and

Smithsonian Odyssey tour participation increased
by 72 percent. Among the U.S. program high-
lights was the Delta Queen's inaugural cruise on
the Tennessee/Tombigbee Waterway. In addi-
tion, six groups took advantage of special behind-
the-scenes tours of the Smithsonian and other cul-
tural and historic landmarks during week-long
Odyssey tours of Washington, D.C. More than
250 Associates during the year took part in
“France through the Ages,” the most popular Od-
yssey tour. On other international tours, more
than 100 Associates participated in “Dutch Water-
ways” and visited the Floriade, a vast international
flower show that occurs every 10 years, while oth-
ers joined the Smithsonian's first midwinter pro-
gram in Tibet.

@ Smithsonian Research Expeditions had a re-
cord-breaking year with 20 teams of Associates
participating in scientific projects. A total of
$202,000 and more than 13,000 hours of volun-
teer labor were contributed to the Smithsonian.
Three projects were completed at the Smithsonian

rican American community. RAP public service
activities include its scholarship program for in-
ner-city young people and adults; Discover Graph-
ics, the free printmaking program for local public
high school students and teachers; and the annual
Kite Festival on the National Mall. RAP’s Discov-
ery Theater, the area’s only year-round live theater

duction Banneker to celebrate the Washington,
D.C., bicentennial. The performances enjoyed
record-breaking attendance and critical acclaim.

Visitor Information and
Associates’ Reception Center

Mary Grace Potter, Director

Since 1970, the Visitor Information and Associ-
ates’ Reception Center (VIARC) has served as a
central support unit responsible for Smithsonian
information and assistance programs for the pub-
lic, Associate members, staff, and volunteers. Sev-
eral VIARC programs operate seven days a week
and involve the coordination and direction of a
large corps of volunteers, who provide a primary
source of support for the Institution’s public infor-
mation programs and for project assistance behind
the scenes.

@ Open at 9 A.M. daily, the Smithsonian Informa-
tion Center assisted more than 1.6 million visi-
tors, including some 50,000 Associate members
and their families. Services were expanded to in-
clude a Museum Shop sales component.

@ Smithsonian Columbus Quincentenary pro-
grams were the training focus for VIARC’s 600-
plus volunteer information specialists, who staffed
16 museum information desks in 11 buildings
and the Institution’s central telephone lines. Some
96 information specialists volunteered for extra
duty to support the National Air and Space Mu-
seum “Star Trek” exhibition pass system, distrib-
uting more than 3,500 passes a day from the Feb-
ruary opening to Labor Day.

@ The Public Inquiry Mail and Telephone Infor-

mation Service Unit processed some 43,678 pieces
of mail and responded to some 368,916 telephone
inquiries. The latter included some 1,467 calls for
information on Smithsonian heritage celebrations
and 31,679 to special “Star Trek” exhibition infor-
mation lines.

m VIARC’s Behind-the-Scenes Volunteer Pro-
gram implemented a new customized personal
computer—based volunteer records management
system. Developed in-house at considerable cost
savings, this system greatly enhanced the effi-
ciency and effectiveness of registration and place-
ment activities for some 1,081 volunteers.

@ The Castle Docent Program added public Span-
ish-language tours of the building. During the
spring and autumn months, the program also
added tours of the Enid A. Haupt Garden.

@ The Information Resource Division updated
and maintained VIARC’s automated information
systems; redesigned the visitor orientation map
used on publications and wayfinding signs; pub-
lished monthly pan-Institutional information refer-
ence materials and quarterly issues of the volun-
teer newsletter InfoSpecial; and produced some 13
publications, including Planning Your Smithsonian
Visit, The Castle & Beyond, and special “samplers”
on Quincentenary and heritage celebrations.

Institutional Initiatives

Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Institutional
Initiatives

Alice Green Burnette, Assistant Secretary

The wide-ranging development activities of the
Smithsonian are the responsibility of the Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Institutional Initia-
tives. The office coordinates the Institution’s
broad efforts with those of the bureaus and offices
to ensure that the Smithsonian receives the fullest
possible private support for its research, exhibi-
tions, and educational and public service activi-
ties. The office also conducts special studies and
demonstration projects on behalf of the

Institution.

@ During 1992, an Institution-wide task force of
development and administrative professionals re-
viewed Smithsonian fund-raising activities with
the goal of enhancing these efforts and increasing
their efficiency. The assistant secretary will be re-
sponsible for implementing the task force recom-
mendations.

@ The Office of Institutional Initiatives continued
to coordinate the implementation of the fund-rais-
ing effort for the National Museum of the Ameri-
can Indian, including the completion of staff hir-
ing for the national campaign office.

@ The assistant secretary worked with the Smith-
sonian National Board and the Office of Develop-
ment to design a new subfund of the Smithsonian
Trust as a conduit for the anticipated increase in
development activity by the National Board.

@ In June 1992, the assistant secretary hosted a re-
ception in Mazoe, Zimbabwe, for National Board
members who traveled to Zimbabwe and Botswa-
na on their annual study tour.
National Museum of the
American Indian National

Campaign Office

John L. Colonghi, Director

The National Museum of the American Indian
(NMAI) National Campaign Office is responsible
for conceiving and carrying out the fund-raising
plan adopted for the museum by the Smithsonian
Board of Regents. By legislative mandate, the In-
stitution is required to provide one-third of the
cost of constructing the museum’s facility on the
National Mall. The anticipated campaign goal of
$60 million includes funds for the Smithsonian
one-third share of construction in addition to
funds to endow the museum’s education and out-
reach programs.

@ The NMAI National Campaign continues to
sponsor and benefit from many fund-raising
events around the country, including the “Celebra-
tion for the American Indian” held annually in
Aspen, Colorado. The campaign also seeks finan-
cial and in-kind support from individuals, corpora-
tions, and foundations in pursuit of its fund-rais-
ing goal.

@ Since its inception in April 1991, the NMAI
national membership program has recruited more
than 50,000 members and generated gross reve-
nues of $1.8 million. The success of this program
demonstrates the broad base of support for the vi-
sion of the National Museum of the American
Indian.

@ The NMAI National Campaign has assembled
a prestigious Honorary Committee (see box), in-
cluding national Indian leaders, entertainment ce-
lebrities, and all living former U.S. presidents.
Committee members make a significant contribu-
tion by helping to establish a positive environ-
ment for the campaign, creating the enthusiasm
and momentum needed to generate funds, and as-
sisting the campaign staff in recruiting the active
support of another voluntary leadership group,
the International Founders Council, which will
take on the primary fund-raising role for the
NMAI.

Office of Development

Marie Mattson, Director

The mission of the Office of Development is to
generate private financial support from corpora-
tions, foundations, and individual donors for the
Smithsonian Institution to further its goals and ob-
jectives. The office is responsible for fund raising
in support of institutional priorities and selected
bureau projects and programs and for leading and
coordinating fund-raising initiatives, including re-
lated marketing activities, throughout the Institu-
tion. The office maintains central research and
record-keeping functions and provides other spe-
cialized support services, including management
of volunteer organizations, stewardship of grants,
maintenance of reference information and publica-
tions, maintenance of a pan-Institutional constitu-
ency data base, and development of an informa-

tion data base.

@ Private sector gifts, grants, and pledges to the
Smithsonian increased significantly in fiscal year
1992, with donations made in support of specific
projects and programs increasing by 66 percent
over 1991; general unrestricted gifts to the Institu-

tion increased by 39 percent. Major commitments

received this year include a 10-year, $7 million

gift from the Lila Wallace—Reader’s Digest Fund
to create and circulate jazz exhibitions and con-
certs and create related programs; $1.5 million
from Glenn Tupper in support of the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute; $1.5 million from
the Lam Foundation for acquisitions at the Freer
Gallery of Art; and $950,000 from Grupo IGS in
support of the “Where Next Columbus?” exhibi-
tion at the National Air and Space Museum.

@ The Smithsonian National Board, the Institu-
tion’s primary volunteer fund-raising organiza-
tion, held biannual meetings in Charleston, South
Carolina, and Washington, D.C. The board also
increased its activities in advancement and market-
ing support to the Institution.

@ During 1992, the office completed installation
of a new Institution-wide constituency and devel-
opment information computer system. With this
system, any Smithsonian development officer can
check on-line information about gifts and grants,
research requests, Cultivation activity, and solicita-
tion coordination.

Smithsonian Women’s
Committee

The Smithsonian Women’s Committee supports
the Institution through volunteer fund-raising
and public relations services. Funds raised by the
committee support educational and research pro-
grams throughout the Smithsonian.

@ In celebration of its 25th anniversary, the com-
mittee presented to the Institution a $175,000
Fellowship in Museum Practice. An additional
$10,000 was given to support the initial awards
under this fellowship.

@ The roth annual Washington Craft Show in
April attracted more than 14,000 visitors and net-
ted a record $180,000. The Christmas Dance held
at the National Air and Space Museum netted
$50,000, and the Fourth of July Picnic held on
the roof of the National Museum of American His-
tory showed a profit of $7,000.

@ The committee provided $216,435 in support
of 24 projects in 14 bureaus. These projects in-
cluded development of an educational kit on Na-
tive American cultures, creation of a guide to the
Smithsonian for disabled visitors, and construc-
tion of modest research facilities at the new Mpala
Research Center in Kenya.
Finance and
Administration

Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Finance and
Administration

Nancy D. Suttenfield, Assistant Secretary

Operating behind the scenes at the Smithsonian, a
network of administrative support offices serves
the diverse operations of the Institution. These of-
fices oversee the management and use of financial,
human, and physical resources. Funding for these
central services in 1992 amounted to about 6 per-
cent of the Institution’s total operating expenses.

® The Office of Accounting and Financial Ser-
vices began expanded dialogue with and training
of users, with the goal of improving services. Dur-
ing the year the office also designed and imple-
mented a new data entry system that improved
the efficiency of processing financial transactions.
@ The Office of Architectural History and His-
toric Preservation continued research and publica-
tion on the architectural history of Smithsonian
buildings and oversight of the Smithsonian's obli-
gations for historic preservation.

@ The Business Management Office oversees four
revenue-producing activities: Museum Shops,
Mail Order, Product Development and Licensing,
and Concessions. The net income from these activ-
ities increased significantly from fiscal 1991.

@ The Office of Contracting and Property Man-
agement designed and implemented an auto-
mated requisition tracking system to ensure
timely action on procurement and installed a
“Help Desk” for customer assistance. Contracts
were awarded for a new mainframe computer and
construction of the George Gustav Heye Center of
the National Museum of the American Indian in
New York City.

@ The Office of Design and Construction contin-
ued to direct the facilities programming for the
National Museum of the American Indian. A de-
sign firm was selected this year for the museum’s

Suitland, Maryland, cultural resources center. The
office also supervised construction of the new
chiller plant at the National Museum of Natural
History/National Museum of Man, the plaza reno-
vation at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden, the renovation of the Freer Gallery of
Art, and the replacement of the copper roof on the
Cooper-Hewitt, National Museum of Design.

@ The Office of Environmental Management and
Safety continued its responsibility for ensuring
that safety, fire protection and prevention, indus-
trial hygiene, and environmental principles are in-
tegrated into all aspects of the Smithsonian.

@ The Office of Equal Employment and Minority
Affairs advances cultural and gender diversity, as
well as equal opportunity, by managing, monitor-
ing, and evaluating equal employment opportu-
nity and special emphasis programs. This year the
office established a resource network for minori-
ties, women, and individuals with disabilities; in-
creased the number of participants in the upward
mobility program; strengthened its monitoring of
cultural diversity efforts; increased the number of
complaints settled during the informal and formal
stages; and provided assistance to bureaus and of-
fices in achieving affirmative action objectives.

@ The Office of Facilities Services implemented
the Institution’s long-range facilities planning
process with the establishment of the Capital Pro-
gram Planning Board.

@ The Office of Financial and Management Analy-
sis began making improvements to the directives
issuance and distribution system. The office also
expanded its emphasis on leading and partici-
pating in comprehensive institutional studies and
analyses.

@ The Office of Human Resources led the devel-
opment of a new museum specialist occupational
study affecting approximately 1,200 positions
within the Smithsonian. The study will update oc-
cupational information, which will be used to de-
termine the grade level of these positions govern-
ment-wide.

@ The Office of Information Resource Manage-
ment worked closely with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion Libraries and other users to evaluate replace-
ment systems for the Smithsonian Institution
Bibliographic System (SIBIS). The new system
will be called SIRIS (Smithsonian Institution Re-
search Information Systems) to reflect broader use
as an automated reference tool. A contract for the
new system was awarded at the close of the fiscal
68

year, with operation scheduled to begin in the
spring of 1993.

@ The Smithsonian Ombudsman worked with
employees and management as a neutral party in
solving work-related problems.

@ The Office of Plant Services continued to refine
employee training and development in the rapidly
changing field of facilities maintenance and man-
agement. Efforts in this area will assure the Insti-
tution of better service from a well-trained work
force.

@ The Office of Planning and Budget continued
its efforts to improve the Personnel Cost Projec-
tion System; undertook a comprehensive examina-
tion of the Institution’s planning process; and en-
gaged all members of the office in a team effort to
improve services to bureaus and offices.

@ The Office of Printing and Photographic Ser-
vices is using video disc technologies to develop
pioneering techniques for the preservation of pho-
tographic images while making them available si-
multaneously in electronic form. A program of
providing digitized Smithsonian photographs
through computer networks was expanded to in-
clude the Internet, a program that enables schools
and nonprofit organizations to obtain electronic ac-
cess to Smithsonian images without charge.

m@ The Office of Protection Services centralized se-
curity officer hiring procedures and worked to-
ward improving services by performing security
administration programs on site at major facili-
ties. Assistance in cultural property protection
was provided to the new Russian government
through international conference and outreach
programs.

@ The Office of Risk Management continued to
provide risk and insurance management services
to protect the Smithsonian’s assets against risk or
loss. The Institution’s master Disaster Prepared-
ness Plan was completed, and implementation is
under way.

@ The Office of Sponsored Projects served the
Smithsonian’s research effort by supporting the
work of 139 researchers, who submitted 221 pro-
posals valued at $69 million to federal and nonfed-
eral sponsors in 1992, an increase of 137 percent
over fiscal 1991. One hundred fifty-two grant and
contract awards having a value of approximately
$18.5 million were received from the federal gov-
ernment and other sponsors, an increase of 42 per-
cent over 1991.

® The Travel Services Office implemented its first

contract with a travel agency, and through this
contract received a rebate in excess of $148,000
for the year.

@ The Office of the Treasurer continues to man-
age the administration and investment of the
Smithsonian endowment and working capital
funds.

@ The Smithsonian Institution Women’s Council
initiated discussions with the administration on a
uniform family leave policy and more flexible
work schedules for employees; continued to re-
search options for an Institution-wide mentoring
program; and, through a Women’s History
Month program on employees in nontraditional
roles, inspired serious, constructive dialogue on
possible solutions to the problems women face in
many segments of the work force.

Under Secretary

Office of the Under Secretary

Constance Berry Newman, Under Secretary

The under secretary is the chief operating officer of
the Smithsonian and is responsible for the day-to-
day administration of the Institution. Under Secre-
tary Constance Berry Newman also works with
Secretary Robert McC. Adams and the Board of
Regents to set long-range priorities for the Smith-
sonian and develop mechanisms for carrying them
out.

@ The organizational review study conducted by
the late under secretary, Carmen Turner, was im-
plemented during the year, resulting in the consol-
idation of several offices and the streamlining of
institutional operations.

@ A detailed analysis of each bureau and office
was carried out with the goal of restructuring the
Smithsonian to better meet its priorities and to
function more efficiently in the 21st century.
Office of

Government Relations

Margaret C. Gaynor, Director

The Office of Government Relations represents
the Institution on matters of legislation, policy,
operations, and governance to the Congress and
other government entities at the federal, state,
and local levels. It is the primary conduit of legis-
lative information, as well as the advocate of
Smithsonian interests in the legislative process.

@ Legislation providing for the appointment of
three new citizen members of the Board of Re-
gents and legislation to establish a National Afri-
can American Museum occupied the office
throughout much of the 102d Congress.

@ Areas of ongoing legislative activity include the
extension of the National Air and Space Museum,
biological diversity research and conservation, and
the acquisition of an administrative building for
various Smithsonian offices.

Office of Public Affairs

Madeleine Jacobs, Director

By coordinating publicity and advertising pro-
grams at the Smithsonian, the Office of Public Af-
fairs helps bring the Smithsonian story—its exhi-
bitions, research, public programs, and other
activities—to diverse cultural communities in the
United States and abroad. The office serves as an
information clearinghouse for print and broadcast
journalists by providing news releases (600 a
year), background papers, press conferences, pho-
tographic support, videotapes, logistical support,
and television and radio public service announce-
ments. The office’s publications include Research
Reports (a quarterly research bulletin), Svzzthsonzan
Runner (a bimonthly newsletter for Native Ameri-
cans), the Smithsonian News Service (a syndicated
monthly feature story service for newspapers), the
Torch (a monthly employee newspaper), and a
wide variety of visitor and special resource
publications.

® With support from the Educational Outreach
Program, the office formed and met with a Latino
Media Advisory Committee composed of distin-
guished communications experts from around the
nation. In the area of Latino outreach, the office
continued its year-long publicity and radio adver-
tising campaign on the Columbus Quincentenary
with a national radio promotion; continued bi-
weekly ads in two local Spanish-language newspa-
pers highlighting Smithsonian events of interest
to Latinos in the Washington, D.C., area; and im-
plemented several of the committee’s recommenda-
tions, including the provision of Spanish-language
flyers at several museum information desks and a
Spanish-language events line.

@ The office published and distributed two new
brochures funded by the Educational Outreach
Program. “Exploring African American Heritage
at the Smithsonian” is a four-color, 12-page visi-
tor brochure for secondary-school students and the
general public; “African & African American Re-
sources at the Smithsonian” is a 32-page brochure
with detailed information on research, collections,
employment, and internships for scholars, journal-
ists, students, and others.

@ The office expanded its publicity and advertis-
ing efforts on radio by participating, at no cost to
the Institution, in a weekly five-minute segment
on WMAL-AM radio highlighting activities at
Smithsonian museums; providing weekly paid
commercials to three local radio stations oriented
to African American listeners; and providing
weekly paid commercials to the largest Washing-
ton-area Spanish-language radio station and its af-
filiated television station.

@ The office prepared long-range communications
plans for the National Museum of the American
Indian, including publicity plans for the Novem-
ber 1992 opening of the exhibition “Pathways of
Tradition,” which is a prelude to the opening of
the museum’s New York facility in 1994.

The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts, the National Gallery of Art, and the Wood-
row Wilson International Center for Scholars were
established by Congress within the Smithsonian
Institution, under their own boards of trustees.
The Institution provides administrative services
on contract for Reading Is Fundamental, Inc., an

John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts

James D. Wolfensohn, Chairman

The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts plays a unique role in the cultural life of the
United States. It is the nation’s stage, presenting
the best of American and international artists in
year-round presentations on six stages. The Ken-
nedy Center's producing efforts, commissioning
programs, competitions, and apprenticeship and
training programs, stimulate the creation of new
arts and the development of new artists. The cen-
ter also seeds innovative programs that reach teach-
ers and students from prekindergarten through col-
lege in most of the 50 states.

@ The Kennedy Center was instrumental this year
in organizing the Arts Education Partnership
Working Group, a national bipartisan coalition of
artists, educators, community leaders, arts present-
ers, funders, and policy makers committed to
making arts education a meaningful part of educa-
tion reform. In another national initiative, the
Kennedy Center organized and hosted the Per-
forming Arts Centers and Schools Institute, a fo-
rum to explore and create new programs to incor-
porate the performing arts into the curriculum.

@ Through partnerships with Broadway produc-
ers and regional theaters, the Kennedy Center is

working to keep American musical theater alive
despite rising costs. Topping the list of new pro-
ductions supported by the Kennedy Center was
the Tony Award—winning Broadway sellout re-
vival of Guys and Dolls. In addition, the Kennedy
Center and the Metropolitan Opera Guild commis-
sioned Carly Simon to compose an opera for
young people for spring 1993.

@ The National Symphony Orchestra presented
the world premier performances of two commis-
sioned works by Russian composer Vyacheslav Ar-
tyomov: Gentle Emanations and On the Threshold of
a Bright New World.

@ The Kennedy Center Mozart Festival brought
some of the nation’s finest musical artists together
to mark the December 1991 Mozart Bicentennial.
The Kennedy Center collaborated with the Li-
brary of Congress, the National Gallery of Art,
the National Museum of American History, and
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars to organize a citywide celebration that in-
cluded performances, exhibits, and symposia.

@ The Kennedy Center Tribute to Germany
treated festival-goers to dozens of performances of
music by German composers, featuring fine Amer-
ican and German artists; classical and contempo-
rary ballet with the Stuttgart Ballet; masterworks
of modern dance; and theatrical productions.

@ Ongoing Kennedy Center activities included
the Arts Enterprise Zone Program, which brings
performances, master classes, and much-needed
role models and training to underserved neighbor-
hoods, and the Cultural Passport Program, which
encourages inner-city young people to explore the
vast cultural resources of the capital city. The Na-
tional Symphony Orchestra's NSO in Your Neigh-
borhood Program presented free community and
holiday concerts.

National Gallery of Art

J. Carter Brown, Director

The National Gallery of Art serves the United
States in a national role by preserving, collecting,
exhibiting, and fostering the understanding of
works of art at the highest possible museum and
scholarly standards.
@ In recognition of the 500th anniversary of Co-
lumbus’s first voyage to the Americas, the gallery
mounted the most wide-ranging exhibition in its
50-year history. “Circa 1492: Art in the Age of
Exploration” displayed more than 600 works of
art, as well as maps and scientific instruments bor-
rowed from lenders in the United States and 31
other countries. Programs accompanying the exhi-
bition included a two-day public symposium, two
special high school days for area students and their
families, and a family day—the first held in con-
nection with an exhibition—that drew more than
500 Washington, D.C., families.

@ Other exhibitions during the year included
“Albert Bierstadt: Art & Enterprise,” which fea-
tured more than 70 works by this r9th-century
artist, who was the first to capture the powerful
visual impact of the American West on a monu-
mental scale. A small but important exhibition
brought together for the first time since the turn
of the century the three National Gallery panels of
the recently restored Saint Anne Altarpiece by Ge-
rard David with six smaller panels believed to
have been part of the original altarpiece. Other ex-
hibitions focused on the Italian baroque artist
Guercino, on Kathe Kollwitz and Ernst Kirchner,
and on American Indian Art.

@ Nearly 1,000 works in the permanent collec-
tion were reorganized and reinstalled in refur-
bished galleries in the West Building. The East
Building galleries were reinstalled with 20th-cen-
tury art, including works acquired during the gal-
lery’s recent 50th anniversary year and major loans
from private collections.

@ The gallery’s collections were greatly enriched
by the acquisition of several collections. The
Armand Hammer collection of old master and
modern drawings includes drawings by Leonardo,
Raphael, Correggio, Tiepolo, Watteau, Frago-
nard, Ingres, and Degas. A group of 23 old mas-
ter drawings that had been collected by Ian
Woodner was given to the gallery by his daugh-
ters. William B. O'Neal gave 88 old master draw-
ings. A collection of 129 etchings and lithographs
by Lovis Corinth was given by the family of Sig-
bert H. Marcy, a close friend of the artist.

@ The Education Division introduced three new
audio tours of the permanent collection and pre-
sented a 24-session slide lecture survey of the his-
tory of Western art and eight lectures on the art
and artists of some of the world’s best-loved cities.

Among the National Gal-
lery of Art's acquisitions
this year was this paint-
ing by Claude Monet,
The Japanese Foot-
bridge, 1899. The
painting was a gift of
the late Victoria Nebeker
Coberly, in memory of
her son John W. Mudd,
with help from Walter
H. and Leonore An-
nenberg.

cle of the National Gallery of Art underwrote a
survey and directory of art museum—based teacher

programs.

@ The viewing audience for Extension Programs
materials was more than 43 million. For the first
time, the use of materials by individual public
and instructional television stations within the Af-
filiate Loan system outstripped the broadcast activ-
ity of national educational networks.

@ J. Carter Brown, who had been the gallery's di-
rector for 23 years, announced his decision to re-
tire. His successor, Earl A. Powell II, who had
been a curator at the gallery before becoming di-
rector of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
assumed his duties on September 8.

Reading Is Fundamental, Inc.

an interest in books about science and technology;
a three-year New York Times Foundation pro-
gram to establish RIF projects in communities
where New York Times regional newspapers oper-
ate; and Family of Readers, which trains adult
learners to run RIF programs for their children.

@ While an Arkansas initiative is serving 8 out of
10 fourth graders throughout the state, two serv-
ice organizations—Kiwanis International and the
General Federation of Women’s Clubs—are estab-
lishing RIF projects for preschoolers across the na-
tion. The success of Running Start® for first-grad-
ers led Chrysler to extend the program into a
fourth year and expand its scope.

@ In Los Angeles, where RIF serves more than
30,000 children at 170 sites, RIF President Ruth
Graves led a highly successful book drive during
the American Booksellers Association convention
to help public libraries destroyed in the riots.

@ [n October, the Center for the Book in the Li-
brary of Congress hosted a children’s book party
to launch To Ride a Butterfly, a RIF anthology pub-
lished by Bantam Doubleday Dell to benefit RIF.
@ During the eighth annual Reading Is Fun
Week in April, First Lady Barbara Bush presided
over a ceremony in Washington, D.C.

Woodrow Wilson
International Center
for Scholars

Charles Blitzer, Director

The Wilson Center is an institute for advanced
study established by Congress in 1968 as the offi-
cial memorial to the nation’s 28th president. Its
mission is to honor the career and character of
Woodrow Wilson by bringing together the world
of learning and the world of public affairs. The
center achieves this mission by addressing the en-
tire spectrum of human knowledge and creativity,
from the arts and humanities to the sciences. The
center welcomes fellows and guest scholars from
around the world, sponsors discussion programs,
and conducts publishing and radio programs that
deliver the results of scholarly research.

@ A highlight of the year was the Wilson Cen-
ter's month-long citywide commemoration of the
200th anniversary of Mozart’s death. The Wilson
Center, together with other organizations, collabo-
rated to present a celebration of Mozart’s brilliance
that emphasized fresh insights into creativity.
Among the participants in the symposium and fes-
tival were internationally known scholars of eco-
nomics, history, music, philosophy, and psychol-
ogy, as well as novelist Anthony Burgess and nu-
merous musicians.

@ Another bicentennial program, cosponsored by
the Wilson Center and the National Archives,
commemorated the ratification of the Bill of
Rights. On December 15, Bill of Rights Day,
Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered a
timely lecture on the topic of an independent judi-
ciary and individual rights.

@ The Wilson Center developed themes that will
provide a focal point for scholarly research and
events during the next few years: ethnicity, in
broad comparative international terms; the plight
of the world’s cities politically, economically, and
socially; and power sharing and governance in the
global process of the changing relationship of the
state and civil society.

@ “Dialogue,” the Wilson Center's nationally syn-
dicated radio program, was selected to join the
prestigious American Public Radio network.

@ The Wilson Center announced the appoint-
ment by the White House of Smithsonian secre-
tary emeritus S. Dillon Ripley and New York Uni-
versity professor of writing and literature Carol
Iannone as members of its board of trustees.

@ The Wilson Council, an advisory body of pri-
vate citizens, welcomed three new members: Al-
bert Abramson, an active member of the Washing-
ton, D.C., real estate and philanthropic
communities; Theodore Barreaux, counselor to
the comptroller general, General Accounting Of-
fice; and William Slaughter, a partner in the law
firm Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll.
Benefactors

The Smithsonian gratefully acknowledges the support of the
individuals, foundations, and corporations whose gifts,
grants, bequests, and contributing memberships have helped
sustain the work of the Institution over the past fiscal year,
October 1, 1991, through September 30, 1992.

The Smithsonian owes its founding to the generosity of one
individual, James Smithson. The spirit of private support, as
exemplified by James Smithson’s gift, continues to play a vital
role in providing the Smithsonian with the flexibility and in-
dependence essential to its creative growth.

During most of its history since 1846, the Institution has
relied on a combination of both federal and private funding to
carry out the terms of James Smithson’s will. As a trust instru-
mentality of the United States, the Smithsonian has received
federal appropriations to support its basic operations and se-
lected initiatives. The national and international reputation
for excellence held by the Smithsonian is in large part a result
of the innovative and imaginative activities underwritten by
visionary private citizens. Of particular importance are gifts
that have supported the Smithsonian’s core functions—exhibi-
tions, collections acquisition, research, and public educa-
tion—that are central to its achievements.

Several outstanding gifts during fiscal 1992 exemplify the
diversity and impact of private support on the Smithsonian’s
programs:

@ The Lila Wallace—Reader’s Digest Fund has awarded an un-
precedented $7 million to the Smithsonian to create a unique
national jazz celebration spanning 10 years. “America’s Jazz
Heritage,” to be implemented by the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service, the National Museum of Ameri-
can History, and the Office of Telecommunications, will in-

clude exhibitions, performances, educational programs,
recordings, special events, publications, research, and radio
programs at the Smithsonian and in cities around the country.
“America’s Jazz Heritage” will begin in spring 1993 with the
exhibition “Beyond Category: The Musical Genius of Duke El-
lington” at the National Museum of American History and
performances by the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Or-
chestra.

@ The Freer Gallery of Art received a major gift from the B.
Y. Lam Foundation, of Hong Kong, for the purchase of Chi-
nese works of art. It is the largest donation received from a
single donor since the gallery opened to the public in 1923,
and it will allow the Freer to make important additions to its
collections.

@ The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, headquar-
tered in Panama, has been the beneficiary of several major
gifts from Glenn O. Tupper since 1985, including support
for the construction of the Earl S. Tupper Research and Con-
ference Center, named in honor of his father, a noted philan-
thropist and founder of Tupperware. Mr. Tupper’s fiscal 1992
gift establishes a permanent fund to support scientific research
on tropical marine and terrestrial ecosystems and will assist in
renovating STRI’s previous administration building to house
the new Center for Tropical Paleoecology.

@ “Where Next, Columbus?”—an exhibition examining the
prospects for space exploration and discovery in the future,
was made possible by a unique consortium of international
corporate and government sponsors. The sponsors include the
McDonnell Douglas Foundation; Ameritech Foundation;
Grupo IGS, a real estate development company in Spain;
United Technologies Sikorsky Aircraft; GE Aircraft Engines;
Boeing Defense & Space Group, Helicopters Division; the
Spain ’92 Foundation; and United Airlines.

@ Friends of First Ladies, a group of more than 90 individuals
from around the country chaired by volunteer fund-raiser Dor-
ene D. Whitney, of La Jolla, California, contributed a substan-
tial portion of the funds needed to conserve the first ladies’
gowns and to install a new version of the first ladies exhibition
entitled “First Ladies: Political Role and Public Image.” This
fund-raising effort is endorsed by the seven most recent first
ladies.

@ Philip D. Reed, Jr., and Elizabeth B. Reed’s visionary con-
cern for animal preservation and environmental conservation
was recently expressed by gifts to the Smithsonian's New Op-
portunities in Animal Health Sciences (NOAHS) Center and
the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) from
the Philip D. Reed Foundation, Inc. The Reeds’ gifts will en-
able the NOAHS Center to inaugurate two post-doctoral fel-
lowships in applications of biomedical research technology to
the preservation of endangered species. SERC will build an ed-
ucation/orientation center, named for the Reeds, for visitors
to its Chesapeake Bay facility.
@ Harry and Beverly Mandil, long-time members of the
Smithsonian, recently established an endowment fund to sup-
port the Harry and Beverly Mandil Internship at the National
Museum of American Art. The Mandils’ gift will allow a stu-
dent who would otherwise not be able to participate in the in-
ternship program to pursue professional training through full-
time work during the fall, spring, or summer semesters.

@ For ten years, Pear! Rappaport Kaplan served as a docent at
the Renwick Gallery of the National Museum of American
Art. When she died in August 1991, her family and friends

joined together and gave nearly 100 gifts to establish the

Bequests

It is with special appreciation that we remember and acknowledge
those friends who made gifts by will and thus continue the legacy of
James Smithson, our founder.

Unrestricted gifts become part of the Bequest Endowment Fund.
The principal of this fund is maintained in perpetuity, while the in-
come supports acquisitions, exhibitions, scholarly studies, educational
outreach, and other functions of the Smithsonian. Some gifts are desig-
nated for a special purpose by the donors. Gifts by bequest can be
structured to meet donors’ needs and goals.

The following persons remembered the Smithsonian with gifts by

Memorial and Commemorative Giving
Program

Memorial and commemorative gifts to the Smithsonian honor loved
ones, friends, and colleagues. These gifts not only express special ap-
preciation for the individual being honored, but also help support, in
a very direct way, the mission of the Institution. Donors may choose
to apply the gift to the broadest work of the Smithsonian, or, in cer-
tain instances, may direct the gift to a specific area of interest to the
honoree.
The following persons were so honored by their families and

friends.

Donors of In-Kind and Volunteer Support

In addition to the financial support of individuals, foundations, and
corporations, the Smithsonian Institution acknowledges donors of in-
kind gifts. Ranging from equipment for office or program use to pro
bono professional consulting services, such in-kind gifts contribute
greatly to the success of research and educational programs, as well as

to efficient administration of the Institution.

Donors of volunteer service further enable the Smithsonian to accom-
plish a variety of programs and to offer expanded services to the pub-
lic. The names of our docents and behind-the-scenes volunteers are

lisced annually in the Torch (the employee newspaper). In fiscal 1992,
4,707 volunteers gave 464,680 hours of their time. These invaluable
volunteers bring expertise, experience, and enthusiasm to their work
here, and we express to them collectively our great appreciation for

their dedication to the Smithsonian Institution.

Smithsonian Contributing Members

The Contributing Membership of the Smithsonian National Associate
Program supports the Institution’s work through generous annual con-
tributions.

The James Smithson Society was created in 1977 to encourage and
recognize major gifts to the Institution. The Society, which is the
highest level of Contributing Membership, is composed of Annual
Members ($2,000), Life Members (appointed before 1985 for contrib-
uting significant gifts to the Institution), and Endowed Life Members.
Endowed Life Members are individuals who make a one-time gift of
$40,000, or pledge $45,000 over a three-year period, to become life-
time Society Members. Extraordinary contributions to the Smithsonian
are recognized through the Society's Founder Medal award and its ac-
companying Life Membership.

The Smithsonian gratefully acknowledges the generous support of
the James Smithson Society and the Patron Members ($1,200) of the

Contributing Membership.

Nancy D. Suttenfield, Chief Financial Officer

Introduction

The Smithsonian Institution receives funding from both federal ap-
propriations and nonappropriated trust funds. Federal appropriations
are the primary source of operating funds to address the Institution’s
fundamental responsibilities in caring for and conserving the national
collections, sustaining basic research on the collections and in selected
areas of traditional and unique strength, and educating the public
through exhibitions and other outreach programs about the collec-
tions and research findings. Administrative and support functions are
also supported partially by federal appropriations. Federal appropria-
tions account for 71 percent of the Institution’s net operating funds.
In addition, capital outlays for building repair and restoration and for
Most new construction are also supported primarily through federal
appropriations, although certain construction projects, e.g., the Na-
tional Museum of the American Indian and a planned West Court
complex at the National Museum of Natural History, rely heavily on
private fund-raising or other trust fund resources.

Trust funds account for the remaining 29 percent of the Institu-
tion’s net operating funds. The Smithsonian defines trust funds as all
funds it receives from sources other than direct federal appropriations.
These sources include gifts and grants from individuals, corporations,
and foundations; earnings from short- and long-term investments;
earnings from membership programs; and gross receipts from auxil-
iary activities such as Szzthsonian magazine, museum shops, food
service concessions, and mail order activities. The Smithsonian re-
ceives grants and contracts, primarily from other federal agencies, but
also from state governments, which are considered trust funds.

Smithsonian trust funds, depending on their source, purpose, and
applicable restrictions, are used for operations, construction, and en-
dowment. These nonappropriated trust funds are used to cover the
expenses of income-producing auxiliary activities, supplement federal
appropriations for programs, and cover an appropriate proportionate
share of the Institution's administrative expenses. The use of Smith-
sonian trust funds is further classified as restricted or unrestricted. Re-

stricted funds are those on which the donor or funding agent places
limitations. Seventy percent of the trust net operating funds are re-
stricted. Approximately 54 percent of the endowment is restricted as
well.

The following sections describe the Institution’s gereral financial
situation and its planned responses to changing conditions; specific fi-
nancial outcomes for fiscal 1992; measures, both organizational and
financial, to assure the future fiscal health of the Institution; and rela-
tionships with other affiliated organizations.

Financial Situation and Prospects

During fiscal 1992, an analysis of federal appropriations to the Insti-
tution for the past several years was conducted. That analysis revealed
that a major portion of each annual increment had gone not to sup-
port general operating expenses, but to support specific and/or ear-
marked purposes, such as the new National Museum of the American
Indian, major scientific instrumentation for the Smithsonian Astro-
physical Observatory, new global change research programs, subsi-
dized participation fees for traveling exhibitions, and special
commemorative events such as the Columbus Quincentenary. Despite
the apparent increases in appropriation support, many factors, in-
cluding the need to apply increases to specific activities, had the effect
of eroding the purchasing power of the Institution's operating bud-
get. Other such factors include shortfalls in appropriations relative to
additional new costs, including mandated pay adjustments, employee
benefits, new regulatory requirements, and inflation.

Although the Institution's federal appropriation for operating ex-
penses was $97.3 million greater than in fiscal 1987, the fiscal 1992
funding level (in 1987 dollars) represented a decrease of $22.4 million
actually available for the core programs that were in place in fiscal
1987. This loss of purchasing power resulted in the inability to fill
many positions that perform essential functions, such as collections
care and facilities maintenance and repair; the deferral of the replace-
ment of scientific equipment; the postponement of the purchase of
library books and serials; and the reduction of other basic program
support.

At the same ume, the weakened national economy, along with a
decrease in the number of visitors, has led to decreased revenues from
the Smithsonian's various income producing activities. Unrestricted
trust fund income from these activities dropped to pre—fiscal 1987
levels. In response, the Institution reduced its budget allocations to
fellowships, collections acquisition, scholarly studies, educational out-
reach, and special exhibitions to 28 percent below the fiscal 1987 level
of $6.4 million.

Prospects for catch-up funding from both appropriated and nonap-
propriated sources are dim. Therefore, in planning for fiscal 1993, the
Institution conducted a comprehensive examination of each of its pro-
grams and activities, considering centrality to the Smithsonian’s mis-
sion, quality, and cost-effectiveness. As a result of that examination,
it has begun a multi-year restructuring program to restore and main-
tain financial equilibrium.

The fiscal 1992 federal appropriation of $281.2 million, plus an addi-
tional $1.9 million for the Special Foreign Currency, U.S. India, and
the Canal Zone funds, provided the funding nucleus for ongoing pro-
grams of the Institution and limited support for the new National
Museum of the American Indian and for other areas of cultural plu-
ralism, environmental, and education initiatives. Modest increments
of funding were directed to the reinstallation of outdated exhibitions,
the upgrading and replacement of essential information systems, and
strengthening internal controls.

The Smithsonian concluded fiscal 1992 with a shortfall of $3.813
million in unrestricted general trust funds. The shortfall derived from
continued increases in expenditures while revenues from auxiliary ac-
tivities remained essentially flat in comparison to fiscal 1991. Al-
though management had already initiated reductions in baseline
expenditures, it became evident that additional cuts were required in
fiscal 1993 to bring costs within further reduced levels of unrestricted
trust income.

In fiscal 1992, government agencies sponsored research projects to-
talling $42.7 million at the Smithsonian, an increase of $5.9 million,
or 16 percent over fiscal 1991. Of this increase, $4.4 million repre-
sents funding from the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion (NASA) to support research at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.

Other nonappropriated income from gifts, non-government grants,
endowments, current investments, and revenue-producing activities
totaling $75.55 million augmented funds from federal sources. The
Smithsonian is especially grateful to its many friends in the private
sector whose generosity contributed vitally to its work. Donors are
listed in the Benefactors section of this annual report.

Construction and Plant Fund's (Table 8)

In fiscal 1992, the Smithsonian received $23.599 million in direct ap-
propriations for replacement of major building systems at the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of
American History, as well as for repair, restoration, and code compli-
ance projects throughout the Institution.

Appropriations for major construction included $9.874 million for
reconfiguration of the National Museum of Natural History’s East

Court; $2.37 million for the planned National Museum of the Ameri-

can Indian; and $1.678 million for the initial design for the General
Post Office Building. The National Zoological Park received $7.899
million for repairs and other projects in its master plan, including the
Hall of Humankind and Amazonia. Appropriations for other con-

Endowment (Tables 5, 6, and 7)

The Institution has a large number of endowment and quasi-endow-
ment funds. For investment purposes, these funds are pooled into a
consolidated portfolio, and the investment policy is focused on the
total return (i.e., dividends, interest, and realized and unrealized
capital gains) on the portfolio. Each year, the market value of the
portfolio increases by new gifts, net transfers, and the total return on
the portfolio. It is reduced by the annual payout for current expendi-
tures, fees, and expenses. Each fund within the consolidated endow-
ment purchases shares similar to an investor in a mutual fund. The
value of each share increases as the market value of the consolidated
portfolio (net of new gifts and transfers) increases and, annually, it re-
ceives the applicable payout per share for current expenditures.

The Investment Policy Committee of the Smithsonian’s Board of
Regents oversees the development of the investment policy and the
annual payout for the consolidated endowment. The overall objective
of the endowment is to maintain its real purchasing power (net of
new gifts and transfers). Current policy calls for an average payout of
4.5 percent of the average market value over the prior 5 years. To
achieve the endowment objectives, the investment policy targets a
teal return of 5 percent.

During fiscal 1992, the market value of the consolidated endow-
ment increased to $343.6 million, a $29.8 million gain. Following
past practice to increase the endowment for the future, $3.1 million
in revenue generated from auxiliary enterprises was transferred to the
unrestricted endowment. The total return was 10.3 percent, the pay-
out was 4.2 percent of the five-year average market value, and fees
were 0.4 percent of average market value of the portfolio. With infla-
tion running at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, the real purchasing
power of the endowment increased by 3.8 percent. At fiscal year-end,
the portfolio of the Institution reflected 36 percent in bonds, 7 per-
cent in cash and cash equivalents, and 57 percent in equities.

Financial Management

In 1990, to assure effective financial management, the Smithsonian
established the position of assistant secretary for finance and adminis-
tration and later designated that position as chief financial officer of
the Institution. The chief financial officer has responsibilities for safe-
guarding all of the Institution’s assets and oversees all financial offices
to assure integrated financial planning and proper coordination of all
financial management functions.

Although not required to comply with the Federal Chief Financial
Officers Act of 1990, the Smithsonian has elected to comply volun-
tarily with the spirit and intent of its objectives for sound financial
management and internal controls. The Smithsonian is, in fact, well
ahead of most federal agencies in implementing the principal require-
ments of the act. In addition, the Institution’s finance offices are tak-
ing part in an effort to continuously improve the quality of their
products and services and the cost-effectiveness of their business pro-
cesses through total quality management (TQM). A program to train
all financial staff is under way and implementation of the program is
proceeding.

Specific financial management improvement initiatives undertaken
or completed in fiscal 1992 include

© an external review, arranged by the Private Sector Council, of the
management and organization of Smithsonian finance and admin-
istration by executives from the Eastman Kodak Company, the
Gillette Company, the Lockheed Corporation, and the American
Express Company;

¢ the development of a new accounts payable/ purchase order sys-
tem—to be completed by the end of fiscal 1993;

¢ the development of a more highly coordinated fund-raising pro-
gram plan;

© collateralization of Smithsonian funds on deposit with major banks
through the Federal Reserve Bank;

© the establishment of a Smithsonian-wide disaster preparedness
plan, the acquisition of a fully equipped disaster response trailer,
and completion or initiation of disaster preparedness plans at 22
separate Smithsonian facilities;

© initiation of a study to examine the planning and construction of
exhibitions and recommend opportunities for cost savings—to be
completed in fiscal 1993.

The Institution’s financial statements are audited annually by an in-
dependent public accounting firm. Along with the audit report,
management also receives a report from the auditors with suggested
operational improvements, which management acts upon as appro-
priate. Coopers & Lybrand’s unqualified report for fiscal 1992 is re-
printed on the following pages. The Smithsonian’s internal audit
staff, part of the Office of the Inspector General, assists the outside
auditors and regularly audits the Institution’s various programs, activ-
ities, and internal control systems. The Defense Contract Audit
Agency audits grants and contracts received from federal agencies, in-
cluding the allowability and allocability of indirect cost charges.

The Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Regents met
three times during the fiscal year pursuant to its fiduciary responsi-
bilities and the bylaws of the Board of Regents. The committee re-
viewed the results of the 1991 audit of financial statements and the
1992 audit plan, received reports from the inspector general, and con-
ducted inquiries on a variety of topics directed at safeguarding the
Institution’s various assets.

Related Organizations

The National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Per-
forming Arts, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars were established by Congress within the Institution. Each or-
ganization is administered by its own board of trustees and reports in-
dependently on its financial status. The Smithsonian provides the
Wilson Center with certain fiscal, administrative, and support ser-
vices, as well as office space, on a reimbursement basis.

Administrative services are provided by the Institution on a con-
tract basis for Reading is Fundamental, Inc. The Friends of the Na-
tional Zoo (FONZ), an independent nonprofit organization, operates
under a concessions contract; proceeds accrue to the Zoo.
