REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

ALEXANDER WETMORE
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1948

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GrentLEeMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and its
bureaus during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948.

GENERAL STATEMENT

The Institution carries out its purpose, “the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men,” by numerous methods, but the basic means
remain the same as those proposed by the first Secretary, Joseph
Henry—namely, scientific research, exploration, and publication.
These features interweave to form the pattern of activities of the
Institution and of the scientific bureaus that have grown up around
it and through which it now largely operates. Other features have
been added as the Institution has grown and expanded—for example,
museum and art gallery exhibits, which diffuse knowledge to several
million visitors each year, and the International Exchange Service
for the interchange of publications with the rest of the world.

In the first part of this report I present general features of the
work of the Institution, together with brief summaries of the achieve-
ments of the bureaus, the whole giving a composite picture of the
Smithsonian Institution in the year 1948. For those interested in
further details, fuller reports on each bureau are presented as ap-
pendixes. These include the United States National Museum, the
National Gallery of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Inter-
national Exchange Service, the National Zoological Park, the Astro-
physical Observatory, the National Air Museum, and the Canal Zone
Biological Area. Appendixes 11 and 12 consist of reports on the
Smithsonian library and on the publications of the Institution. The
report concludes with the financial statement of the executive commit-
tee of the Board of Regents.

As the Institution moves into its second century of operation, it is
still handicapped by certain shortages in personnel and especially by
lack of adequate buildings. An institution for the increase and dif-

2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

fusion of knowledge cannot remain static. Its scientific studies in
various fields and its great and growing collections in all fields of
natural history and of human endeavor demand the constant attention
of an adequate staff. Laboratories and large research collections
without suflicient personnel for their scientific study cannot increase
knowledge. It is only as collections are correctly classified, new forms
discovered and described, and groupings and relationships analyzed
and reassesssed that new knowledge emerges for the benefit of man-
kind. For example, with an insufficient number of trained workers
in various divisions of the National Museum, the actual care of the
collections requires such a large proportion of the time of those now
available that research is restricted. In some museum divisions, and
in our other laboratories our efforts have brought about some increase
of personnel, but in others the situation is still acute. Such efforts
will be continued until an adequate staff for all divisions is assured.

The matter of space shortage is even more serious. The latest
permanent building in the Smithsonian group—the Natural History
Building of the National Museum—was opened to the public in 1911.
In that year the number of visitors to the Smithsonian buildings to-
taled 525,207, and the total number of specimens in the National
Museum was estimated at 6,328,660. For the fiscal year 1948 the
number of visitors was 2,393,499—an increase of more than fourfold
over 1911—and the total number of specimens reached 25,470,827—
also a fourfold increase. In other words, the Smithsonian Institution
has today the same amount of space that it had in 1911 in which to
accommodate four times as many visitors and four times as many
specimens. The inevitable result is a greatly overcrowded condition
in the exhibition halls and in the study collections and laboratories,
making expansion of public exhibits impossible and hampering
scientific research.

The Smithsonian group of buildings is near the top of the list of
Washington points of interest for visitors to the Nation’s Capital
from all parts of the country, and the public exhibits should be housed
in modern buildings without crowding and with room for expansion
as new material comes in. In the fiscal year 1946, a Public Buildings
Act was introduced in Congress in which was included provision for
several new Smithsonian buildings, among them a historical museum
and a building for the engineering and industrial collections. The
bill, however, failed of passage. In the year 1947, Congress passed
a bill establishing the National Air Museum as a bureau of the Insti-
tution; this will require an adequate building. ‘These matters are of
vital concern to the proper functioning of the Institution, and the
attempt to obtain adequate and up-to-date buildings will continue to
be a primary concern of your Secretary.

A number of organizational changes were made during the year in
SECRETARY’S REPORT 3

the interests of better administration, notable among them being the
creation of a new department in the National Museum—that of botany,
which had formerly been a division under the department of biology.
The latter was thereafter known as the department of zoology. Other
changes will be noted in the appended reports on the bureaus of the
Institution, but I should mention here the retirement of Harry W.
Dorsey, Administrative Assistant to the Secretary. Mr. Dorsey had
served the Institution faithfully and well for 59 years, and his long
experience in handling important matters connected with the Secre-
tary’s office and his unique knowledge of the history of the Institution
will be greatly missed.

INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT

On December 24, 1947, President Harry S. Truman established by
Executive Order the Interdepartmental Committee on Scientific Re-
search and Development, to be composed of a representative from each
of the following agencies: the Departments of Agriculture, Interior,
Commerce, Army, Navy, and Air Force, the National Military Estab-
lishment, the Federal Security Agency, the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the Veterans
Administration, and the Smithsonian Institution. In brief, the duties
of the Committee are to recommend improvements in the research and
development programs of the Federal Government, to recommend
changes in administrative policies and procedures designed to increase
the efficiency of such programs, and to study and report on current
policies and practices relating to Federal support for research.

Your Secretary was appointed Chairman of the Committee by the
President. An organizational meeting was held at the White House
on April 16, 1948, and shortly thereafter the work of the Committee
got under way. As much of this work is obviously of a confidential
nature, no report on it is made at this time.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846,
according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of England, who
in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to
found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution,
an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress
determined that the Federal Government was without authority to ad-
minister the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted an “establish-
ment” whose statutory members are “the President, the Vice President,
the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments.”
4. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948
THE BOARD OF REGENTS

During the year the following changes occurred in the personnel
of the Board of Regents:

On January 27, 1947, Representative Clarence Cannon was reap-
pointed a regent for another term. On July 26, 1947, Robert V.
Fleming was appointed a regent by Joint Resolution, for the statutory
term of 6 years, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of
Frederic A. Delano. On November 12 Mr. Fleming was given
interim appointment by the Chancellor as a member and Chairman
of the Executive Committee to serve until the next meeting, when
election by the Board would take place. ‘This appointment was con-
firmed at the meeting of January 16, 1948.

Proceedings—The Board of Regents held its annual meeting on
January 16, 1948. Present: Representative Clarence Cannon, Dr.
Vannevar Bush, Dr. Harvey N. Davis, Representative John M. Vorys,
Representative Samuel K. McConnell, Jr., Robert V. Fleming, Sec-
retary Alexander Wetmore, and Assistant Secretary John E. Graf.

The Secretary presented his annual report covering the activities
of the Institution and its bureaus, including the financial report of
the Executive Committee, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1947,
which was accepted by the Board. The usual resolution authorizing
the expenditure by the Secretary of the income of the Institution for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1949, was adopted by the Board.

The Secretary announced a further generous gift to the Institution
by John A. Roebling in support of the work of the Astrophysical
Observatory.

The National Air Museum began independent operations. ‘The
aeronautical collections of the United States National Museum,
numbering approximately 3,500 specimens, were transferred to the
Air Museum, together with pertinent records and files. The staff of
the former division of aeronautics of the National Museum, consisting
of a curator and clerk-stenographer, was also transferred. Under
this new set-up the Nation-wide survey for aeronautical materials
continued. Arrangements were under way to take over the temporary
storage at Park Ridge, Ill., where the air force had been assembling
historical collections for this Museum.

The Canal Zone Biological Area on Barro Colorado Island has
utilized available funds for renovation and repair. John E. Graf,
Assistant Secretary, visited the laboratory in June, in connection with
its administration. T. F. Clark, fiscal officer for the Institution, also
visited the island in October 1947 to check over methods of accounting
and inventory to insure that these meet the most recent requirements
of the General Accounting Office.

The annual report of the Smithsonian Art Commission was pre-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 5

sented by the Secretary and accepted by the Board. A resolution
was adopted to reelect the following members for 4-year terms:
William T. Aldrich, James Fraser, George H. Edgell, Lloyd Goodrich.
The following officers were reelected for the ensuing year: Chairman,
Paul Manship; vice chairman, Robert Woods Bliss; secretary,
Alexander Wetmore.

Regarding the Gellatly Collection, as reported at the last annual
meeting the Court of Claims in an opinion dated May 5, 1947, stated
that “there is no basis in law or equity to set aside the gift or transfer
and no basis in law or equity to allow a recovery in behalf of the
Gellatly estate.” Following this opinion, under date of May 20, 1947,
the Secretary, as the custodian of the property in question, received
a demand, signed by Mrs. Gellatly’s attorney, to surrender possession
of the collection. On June 18, 1947, a summons was served on the Sec-
retary which was turned over to the Department of Justice. That
Department assigned Marvin C. Taylor, Special Attorney, to the case,
and various legal procedures have followed.

As stated in last year’s report, following a decision by the Civil
Service Commission, the Smithsonian trust-funds employees were in-
cluded under the Federal Retirement System as of May 18,1947. The
Secretary submitted to the Executive Committee of the Board of
Regents a detailed plan for carrying out the transfer, which was ap-
proved by the Committee.

FINANCES

A statement on finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian
private funds, will be found in the report of the Executive Committce
of the Board of Regents, page 157.

APPROPRIATIONS

Funds appropriated to the Institution for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1948, totaled $1,800,312, allotted as follows:

In addition $949,426 was appropriated to the National Gallery of
Art, a bureau of the Institution but administered by a separate board
of trustees; and $455,400 was provided in the District of Columbia
appropriation act for the operation of the National Zoological Park.

Besides these direct appropriations, the Institution received funds
by transfer from other Federal Agencies, as follows:

From the State Department, from the appropriation Cooperation
with the American Republics, 1948, a total of $94,882 for the operation
of the Institute of Social Anthropology, including the issuance of
publications resulting from its work.

From the National Park Service, Interior Department, $73,800 for
archeological projects in connection with River Basin Surveys.

From the Navy Department, $11,000 for research studies on the
effects of radiation upon marine life as a result of atomic bomb tests
at Bikini Atoll.

VISITORS

An increase of 40,122 visitors to the Smithsonian Buildings was re-
corded over the previous year, the totals being 2,893,499, for 1948 and
2,358,377 for 1947. August 1947 was the month of largest attendance,
with 334,578 visitors; July 1947, the second largest, with 324,815.

FIFTEENTH JAMES ARTHUR ANNUAL LECTURE ON THE SUN

In 1981 the Institution received a bequest from James Arthur, of
New York, a part of the income from which was to be used for an
annual lecture on some aspect of the study of the sun.

The fifteenth Arthur lecture, entitled “Mexican Calendars and the
Solar Year,” was given by Dr. Herbert J. Spinden, of the Brooklyn
SECRETARY’S REPORT v6

Museum, on March 3, 1948, in the auditorium of the National Museum.
This lecture, with illustrations, will be published in the Annual Report
of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for 1948.

SOMMARY OF THE YBDAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Muscum.—Additions to the Museum’s collections numbered
507,000 specimens, coming mostly as gifts from individuals or as
transfers from Government agencies. The total number of specimens
in the Museum at the close of the year was 25,470,827. Among out-
standing accessions for the year were: In anthropology, 2,000 arch-
eological specimens from Cerro de las Mesas, Veracruz, collected by
the National Geographic-Smithsonian Expedition, the famous Ken-
sington stone lent by the Alexandria (Minn.) Chamber of Commerce,
and casts of the famous Tepexpan skull from Mexico; in zoology,
large collections of birds from Colombia, Panama, Paraguay, and
India, and valuable collections of fishes, mollusks, and marine inverte-
brates from the resurvey of Bikini Atoll; in botany, 5,000 specimens
of fungi bequeathed by the late William H. Long, of Albuquerque,
N. Mex., and 9,100 plants collected by H. A. Allard in the Dominican
Republic; in geology, five meteorites not previously represented, many
thousands of fossil invertebrates, including 15,000 Paleozoic and
Cretaceous fossils collected by the curator of the division, and a number
of outstanding fossil vertebrates including the skull and other bones
of a very rare tillodont from the Bridger formation in Wyoming; in
engineering and industries, a collection of 20,000 items assembled by
the late Charles B. Chaney, Jr., bearing on the history of railroads,
and equipment used in the first practical synchronization of sound in
motion pictures; in history, a large collection from the estate of the
late Victor L. Huberich including among other things 2,500 specimens
of United States, Canadian, and Japanese paper money.

Field parties from the Museum’s departments of anthropology,
zoology, botany, and geology visited many parts of the world, including
Arnhem Land in Australia, the Antarctic continent, the Bikini area
in the Pacific, the Persian Gulf, Colombia, Panama, and numerous
localities in the United States. Changes in the Museum organization
included the dividing of the department of biology into two depart-
ments—those of zoology and botany. The division of aeronautics was
separated from the Museum to become the nucleus of the National
Air Museum, a newly created bureau of the Smithsonian Institution.
Dr. Remington Kellogg, formerly curator of the division of mammals,
became Director of the Museum on May 26, 1948.

National Gallery of Art.—Visitors to the Gallery totaled 2,159,435
for the year, an increase of more than 700,000 over the previous year’s

817369492
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

figure. This large increase was due in part to the crowds attracted
by the paintings from the Berlin museums, which were shown at the
Gallery for more than a month in the spring of 1948. During the
showing, the attendance totaled 964,970, which is believed to be a world
record for museums or art galleries for a comparable period of time.
Accessions to the Gallery for the year numbered 1,360, including 113
portraits presented by the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable
Trust, 8 paintings by fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Italian and
German artists presented by Mrs. Ralph Harmon Booth, and 199
additional prints and drawings given by Lessing J. Rosenwald. Nine
special exhibitions were held at the Gallery, and two traveling ex-
hibitions were circulated to art galleries and museums throughout
the country. <A book of illustrations on the painting and sculpture
in the Widener Collection was issued, and additional fine-quality
color reproductions of paintings in the Gallery were made available
to the public. Many thousands attended the Gallery’s special tours
and lectures, and a calendar of events was mailed out to more than
3,000 persons a month. 'The Sunday evening concerts at the Gallery
were continued with undiminished popularity, 47 such concerts being
given before capacity audiences during the year.

National Collection of Fine Arts—Ruel P. Tolman, Director, re-
tired during the year and was succeeded by Thomas M. Beggs, Assist-
ant Director, formerly professor of art at Pomona College, Claremont,
Calif. At the annual meeting of the Smithsonian Art Commission
on December 2, 1947, four oil paintings were accepted for the National
Collection. Four miniatures, water color on ivory, were acquired
through the Catherine Walden Myer fund. A number of art works
were lent to other organizations for use in connection with special
exhibitions. Six paintings were purchased from the Henry Ward
Ranger fund and assigned to various art institutions. Any such
purchase may be claimed by the National Collection during the 5-year
period beginning 10 years after the artist’s death, and two paintings
by Bruce Crane were so claimed during the year. Photographic
prints and post cards of art works in the National Collection are
available for the public, and large numbers were sold during the year.
Nine special exhibitions were held under the auspices of the National
Collection of Fine Arts, for most of which catalogs were made avail-
able by the organizations holding the exhibitions.

Freer Gallery of Art—Additions to the collections included Chinese
bronze, ivory, lacquer, painting, and pottery; and Persian manuscript,
painting, and pottery. The work of the professional staff was de-
voted to the study of new accessions and to general research within
the collections of Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Persian, and Indian ma-
terials. Reports were made upon 3,498 objects and 1,108 photographs
of objects submitted for examination. The very delicate task of re-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 9

pairing and restoring the Whistler “Peacock Room” was begun dur-
ing the year. Visitors to the Gallery totaled 77,012 for the year, and
1,650 persons visited the main office for special information. Sixteen
groups were given special instruction in the exhibition galleries by
staff members.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of
the Bureau, conducted archeological excavations in western Panama
for 314 winter months in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society, discovering a new, very early culture unrelated to anything
heretofore known in the Republic. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
Associate Director, was occupied mainly in directing the River Basin
Surveys, a unit of the Bureau set up to recover archeological ma-
terial that would be lost through construction of dams and the crea-
tion of river valley reservoirs. Surveys, with limited testing of sites,
were made in 18 States and 88 reservoir areas. A total of 1,576 sites
have been found, of which 250 were recommended for excavation.

Dr. John P. Harrington prepared a number of manuscripts in the
field of Indian linguistics, among them a 750-page grammar of the
Maya language. Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., as chairman of the Board
of Governors of the Arctic Institute of North America, devoted con-
siderable time to the affairs of that organization. Late in the year,
he left Washington to conduct archeological work for the Smithsonian
and the National Museum of Canada on islands in the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago. Dr. William N. Fenton carried on field work among
the Seneca in western New York and started an extensive program
of historical research connected with the League of the Iroquois. Dr.
Philip Drucker spent nearly half the year on detail to the River Basin
Surveys, taking charge of the work in the Columbia Basin. During
the rest of the year he completed two monographs, one on the Nootkan
tribes of British Columbia, the other on the Mexican La Venta culture.
Dr. Gordon R. Willey wrote additional sections of a report on “Ancon
and Supe: Formative Period Sites of the Central Peruvian Coast,”
and nearly completed a monograph on the archeology of the Florida
Gulf Coast. Dr. Willey accompanied Dr. Stirling on the archeological
expedition to western Panama, and also worked in Tennessee for 114
months on detail to the River Basin Surveys.

The Institute of Social Anthropology, an autonomous unit of the
Bureau, is financed by State Department funds to carry out coopera-
tive training in social anthropological teaching and research with the
other American republics. Under the directorship of Dr. George M.
Foster, members of the staff gave courses in various phases of anthro-
pological study and conducted cooperative field work in Brazil, Co-
lombia, México, and Peri. The Bureau issued volumes 3 and 4 of the
Handbook of South American Indians and four publications of the
Institute of Social Anthropology.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

International Exchanges—The Smithsonian International Ex-
change Service is the official United States agency for the interchange
of governmental and scientific publications between this country and
the other nations of the earth. The number of packages handled by
the Service during the year was 760,119, with a total weight of 812,189
pounds. These totals represent an increase over last year of 56,321
packages and 38,214 pounds. The first shipments of exchange pub-
lications to Japan since the war were made this year. Consignments
are now sent to all countries except Rumania, and negotiations are
in progress for resumption of exchange relations with that country.
The Exchange Service now sends abroad 94 sets of United States offi-
cial publications, 73 copies of the Federal Register, and 66 copies of
the Congressional Record, in return for similar material received from
other nations.

National Zoological Park.—The year was a satisfactory one at the
Park in that a number of unusually interesting animals were received,
progress was made in recruiting personnel for the organization, and
various repairs and minor improvements were made to buildings and
grounds. The chief needs of the Zoo are more maintenance funds
and new buildings to replace the remaining antiquated unsuitable
structures built many years ago. The year’s visitors reached a total
of 3,040,540, an increase of more than 300,000 over the previous year’s
figure. The number of groups coming to the Zoo from schools was
1,454, comprising 79,249 individual students. These groups came
from 27 different States, the most distant being Maine, Texas, and
Wisconsin. ‘The total number of animals in the collection at the close
of the year was 2,797, representing 690 different species of mammals,
birds, reptiles, and other forms. Among the exceptionally interest-
ing animals received during the year were three species of penguins,
a monkey-eating eagle, Mindanao tarsiers, and an Arctic fox.

Astrophysical Observatory—W. H. Hoover was promoted to be
Chief of the Division of Astrophysical Research. Dr. Earl S. John-
ston, Chief of the Division of Radiation and Organisms, who has been
responsible for the recent development of the Division, died during
the year. He will be succeeded by Dr. Robert B. Withrow, of Purdue
University.

The field stations at Montezuma, Chile, and Table Mountain, Calif.,
continued regular solar observations, and the values were checked and
tabulated in Washington. The sun and sky radiation studies con-
ducted for 2 years at Camp Lee, Va., under contract with the Office
of the Quartermaster General, were terminated, but similar studies
will go on at the Montezuma and Miami, Fla., stations.

During a search for the best possible site for a new high-altitude
station, promising sites were located in Mexico, southern California,
and the Hawaiian Islands. Instruments were installed at each of
SECRETARY’S REPORT 11

the three sites for extended tests to determine which is the most satis-
factory. A redetermination of the Smithsonian standard scale of
solar radiation confirmed the Observatory’s belief that the scale of a
silver-disk pyrheliometer will remain unchanged for many years.

Research projects completed or well advanced during the year in
the Division of Radiation and Organism included studies of the res-
piration of broad-leaf plants; investigations on the effects of environ-
mental factors on the germination of seeds; and studies of the
developmental physiology of grass seedlings.

The results of Observatory research appeared in nine papers pub-
lished during the year.

National Air Museum.—Created as a bureau of the Smithsonian
Institution in 1946, the National Air Museum did not begin actual
operations in its own right until August 1, 1948, when its first appro-
priation of $50,000 became available. Thereupon the Institution’s
aeronautical collections and staff were transferred to the Air Museum,
the staff was increased from two to seven persons, and separate offices
were provided in the Arts and Industries Building of the National
Museum. The Air Museum’s Advisory Board met twice during the
year and made two important decisions: 1, that there be used as a
storage depot for the temporary safekeeping of Air Museum material
a part of the Douglas aircraft plant built during World War II on the
outskirts of Park Ridge, Ill., 20 miles from Chicago; and 2, that the
Air Museum should be located in the Washington area and that the
aid of the Public Buildings Administration be enlisted in designing
an adequate air museum building. The Public Buildings Adminis-
tration later in the year submitted a preliminary plan for a building
which was approved by the Board. Numerous improvements were
made to the present exhibits in the Aircraft Building, and several
special exhibits were prepared during the year. A large part of the
time of the curatorial staff was devoted to surveys to determine what
items should be added to the aeronautical collections and what ma-
terial was available throughout the country. <A total of 330 objects
were acquired during the year, the largest number of aeronautical
acquisitions recorded in any year of the Smithsonian’s history.

Canal Zone Biological Area——This tropical laboratory on Barro
Colorado Island, placed under Smithsonian administration in 1946,
celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary on April 17, 1948, and in honor
of the occasion the Canal Zone issued a special commemorative 10-cent
stamp. The island is maintained as a completely unspoiled tropical
forest area, with laboratory facilities for investigations in biology
and related subjects. Some 20 scientists from numerous universities
and institutions came to the island to carry on investigations in widely
varied fields, including army-ant studies, a survey of the fresh-water
fishes, termite control through soil poisoning and wood treatment, the
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

effects of tropical conditions on photographic materials and equip-
ment, and studies of deterioration in the Tropics of fabrics, foodstuffs,
and other materials. The most urgent needs of the laboratory are a
more adequate supply of electricity, an enlarged library building, and
new water-storage tanks. The water-supply problem became so serious
that preliminary work has already been done on the site of a new
tank in the hope that the project may be completed next year.

PUBLICATIONS

The Institution’s publications constitute a principal means of carry-
ing out the “diffusion of knowledge” stipulated by the founder, James
Smithson. Starting with a single series in 1848, this important phase
of Smithsonian work has expanded with the growth of the Institu-
tion until today its publications appear in 14 separate series, as
follows:

Smithsonian Institution: Annual Report; Miscellaneous Collections; Special
Publications.
United States National Museum: Annual Report; Bulletin; Proceedings;
Contributions from the National Herbarium.
Bureau of American Ethnology : Annual Report; Bulletin.
Astrophysical Observatory: Annals.
National Collection of Fine Arts: Catalog.
Freer Gallery of Art: Oriental Studies ; Occasional Papers.
Institute of Social Anthropology : Publications.
These various series present the scientific findings of staff members
and collaborators of the Institution, as well as of outside scientists
working on its collections.

During the year, a total of 76 volumes and pamphlets were pub-
lished. Among the year’s outstanding publications may be mentioned
a new member of the Institution’s family of tables—“Smithsonian
Elliptic Functions Tables,” by G. W. and R. M. Spenceley; a Spanish
edition of the “Compendio y descripcién de las Indias Occidentales,”
by Antonio Vazquez de Espinosa, transcribed by Charles Upson Clark,
which had been published by the Institution in English translation
several years ago; “A List and Index of the Publications of the United
States National Museum (1875-1946)”; volumes 8 and 4 of the “Hand-
book of South American Indians” (volumes 5 and 6, the last two
volumes, were in press at the close of the year).

A total of 165,740 copies of publications in all series were distributed
during the year. A complete list of the year’s publications will be
found in Appendix 12.

LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library received during the year 53,129 publica-
tions, mainly in those fields of science and art, with which the Institu-
SECRETARY'S REPORT 13

tion is concerned. Among outstanding gifts was the library of the
late Charles B. Chaney, of Laurel, Md., a collection of 1,510 publica-
tions on the history of railroads. A number of rare, older books
needed in connection with the Institution’s researches were purchased
for the library.

Volumes and pamphlets were cataloged to the number of 6,148, and
35,357 cards were added to catalogs and shelflists, but the large back-
log of cataloging remained untouched for lack of sufficient personnel
to do the work. <A total of 10,151 publications were borrowed for use
outside the library, and the library staff answered more than 15,000
reference questions. For use in aiding destroyed libraries overseas,
36,701 pieces were selected from the Smithsonian library’s collection
of duplicates.

The total number of volumes in the library at the close of the year
was 915,987, more than half of which are housed as the Smithsonian
Deposit in the Library of Congress.

Respectfully submitted.
ALEXANDER Wermors, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1948.

COLLECTIONS

More than 507,000 specimens were added to the Museum’s collec-
tions during the year, divided among the various departments as
follows: Anthropology, 16,585; zoology, 226,889; botany, 54,292;
geology, 107,332; engineering and industries, 22,961; history, 79,337.
Though considerably less than last year’s 757,000 specimens, the total
was still better than average. Most of the accessions were acquired as
gifts from individuals or as transfers from Government departments
and agencies. The complete report on the Museum, published as a
separate document, includes a detailed list of the year’s acquisitions,
of which the more important are summarized below. Catalog entries
in all departments now total 25,470,827.

Anthropology.—The largest archeological accession consisted of
more than 2,000 specimens from Cerro de las Mesas, Veracruz, collected
a few years ago by a National Geographic-Smithsonian Expedition
under the direction of M. W. Stirling. Nearly 500 potsherds, pro-
jectile points, and other artifacts, excavated from a Hopewellian
village site near Batchtown, Ill., came asa gift. The famous Kensing-
ton stone was lent to the Museum for 6 months through the courtesy of
the Alexandria (Minn.) Chamber of Commerce.

In the division of ethnology, the Far East was well represented in
new material received, objects from India, Siam, Japan, and Korea
being noteworthy. Interesting ethnological specimens came also from
Africa, especially three fine native wood carvings. An unusually
well-documented collection of Plains Indian and Apache materials
included several rare pieces of special historical interest, such as the
famed shield of Big Bow, a Kiowa warrior. Thirty-eight water-
color paintings, illustrating the folk costumes of the peoples of Central
and South America, the West Indies, and the Seminoles of Florida,
were presented by the artist, Carl Folke Sablin.

1 Revised estimates of specimens made this year in some departments, in addition to the
normal increase, have raised last year’s total by nearly 6,000,000.

16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

Among the specimens accessioned in the division of physical an-
thropology were four casts of the Tepexpan skull and the head of this
skull as restored by the Washington sculptor Leo Steppat. Skeletal
material was accessioned representing Indian sites in Calhoun, Madi-
son, and Jersey Counties, I1]—additions to similar material of previ-
ous years.

Zoology.—Important mammalian accessions included collections
from the Arctic, Labrador and Newfoundland, Quebec and Maine,
eastern Pennsylvania, Panama, and Egypt. As in past years the
W. L. Abbott fund financed wholly or in part the acquisition of several
avian collections, containing a considerable number of forms new to
the Museum collections and to science; of these may be mentioned
2,630 skins and 145 skeletons of Colombian birds, over 900 birdskins
collected by the Smithsonian-Yale Expedition to Nepal, 835 skins and
skeletons of birds from the Panamanian jungles, 237 birdskins from
India, and 166 from Paraguay. Noteworthy among the reptilian
material received were 1,200 specimens of burrowing snakes of the
genera Sonora and Tantilla from Oklahoma and Texas; 50 Egyptian
and 250 Guatemalan reptiles and amphibians; 75 reptiles from Bikini;
about 50 Brazilian amphibians and 100 Peruvian reptiles and amphibi-
ans, and nearly 400 reptiles and amphibians from Virginia and North
Carolina.

This year, as last, the ichthyological collections were greatly en-
riched by the field studies made at Bikini Atoll for the United States
Navy by members of the Museum staff. More than 6,000 fishes from
this region were accessioned as a result of the 1947 Bikini Scientific
Resurvey. Other large fish collections included nearly 14,000 speci-
mens from Guatemala; about 6,400 fresh-water fishes from Idaho,
Nevada, California, and Arizona; and about 1,200 fishes from the
Texas coast.

Several large lots of insects were received: About 22,000 miscel-
laneous specimens, mostly Lepidoptera, brought together by the late
Elison A. Smyth, of Salem, Va.; 5,000 Far Eastern butterflies; 500
South American chalcid wasps, mostly type material; 1,500 miscel-
laneous insects from Liberia; an equal number from Guatemala; 4,500
from Alaska; and 77,000 transferred from the United States Bureau
of Entomology and Plant Quarantine.

Much scientifically valuable material was received in the division
of marine invertebrates. To the type collection of Foraminifera 836
slides were added, bringing the total now to nearly 11,500 slides.
Nearly 5,000 lots of fresh-water copepods, branchiopods, ostracods,
amphipods, and mysids were donated by the widow of the late S. F.
Light in his memory. Similarly, Mrs. Nathaniel Gist Gee gave about
1,250 lots of fresh-water sponges. The Bikini Scientific Resurvey, of
the Navy, yielded over 1,600 marine invertebrates for the Museum;
SECRETARY’S REPORT 7

about 8,800 Pacific invertebrates came from the Naval Medical Re-
search Unit No. 2; and about 6,000 from the Navy’s Second (1948)
Antarctic Development Project.

Outstanding among the year’s molluscan accessions were 3,000 speci-
mens from Cocos-Keeling Island; 9,000 from Bikini, Rongerik, and
Johnston Islands, collected by members of the staff during the Bikini
Scientific Resurvey ; a large number from various other Pacific islands;
and about 1,500 Antarctic marine mollusks. The Navy Antarctic Ex-
pedition yielded also about 500 echinoderms.

Botany.—Several unusually large plant accessions came to the Na-
tional Herbarium. Among these was the bequest of 5,000 specimens of
fungi, the herbarium of the late William H. Long, of Albuquerque,
N. Mex. H. A. Allard collected 9,100 plants for the Museum in the
Dominican Republic. An unusually interesting lot of Colombian
plants came from the collector Oscar L. Haught, and collecting work
of E. C. Leonard, a member of the staff, yielded 1,900 bryophytes from
the Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge, Maryland. In addition,
many hundreds of desirable plant specimens and photographs were
obtained by exchange or purchase.

Geology—The general mineralogical collections continued to grow
through gifts, exchanges, and purchases, and as usual the year’s acces-
sions in this field included several new species of minerals. The out-
standing addition to the gem series was an Arabian stallion head
carved in turquoise by Oscar J. W. Hansen. Five meteorites not
previously represented in the department’s collections were received
by gift, and excellent additions to the ore collections came from many
sources. Rock specimens received contained important described
material.

Many important specimens of fossil invertebrates came to the
Museum as gifts, four of the larger lots being 2,000 Ordovician fossils
from Minnesota; 1,700 Mesozoic and Tertiary fossils from Cuba;
15,000 Devonian and Upper Paleozoic fossils from Nevada; and
1,700 Jurassic brachiopods and mollusks from the vicinity of the
Smithsonian’s Astrophysical Observatory station at Calama, Chile,
collected by Miss Jessie G. Beach, of the department staff, while on
vacation. Through the Walcott funds there were received 900 speci-
mens of various invertebrates from the famous Permian deposits of
Sosio Valley, Sicily; 2,500 from the Devonian of Ontario; 50,000
Paleozoic fossils collected by Dr. A. R. Loeblich, Jr., of the staff; and
15,000 Middle-Upper Paleozoic and Cretaceous fossils collected by
Curator G. A. Cooper and Elias Yochelson. Several large transfers
of specimens came from the United States Geological Survey.

This was a banner year for the division of vertebrate paleontology,
the greatest number of specimens being added to the collections since
the field season of 1931. ‘The outstanding acquisition was the skull,
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

jaws, and a foot of the tillodont 7’regosus castoridens from the Bridger
formation near Church Buttes, Wyo., the second skull of this rare
mammal to be found during intermittent exploration covering 75
years. Equally significant was the discovery of the rostral portion of
the skull of Y'sthonyx acutidens, an earlier member of the tillodont
order from the Wind River beds of Wyoming. This specimen, found
by H. A. Tourtelot, was transferred from the United States Geological
Survey. Exceptionally valuable for exhibition purposes was the large
slab of giant amphibian skulls and other skeletal parts representing
the Triassic form Buetineria perfecta, secured by the associate
curator’s party near Lamy, N. Mex. Other specimens that came as a
result of the division’s field work were two well-preserved skulls of the
Eocene primate Votharctus,; additional specimens of 7’rogosus, of the
rhino Hyrachyus, and the tapir Helaletes; and skulls of the small
rodents Mysops and Sevuravas. Jurassic fishes collected by the asso-
ciate curator represent some of the earliest bony fishes and are im-
portant in providing unusual specimens for growth studies.

Engineering and industries—An outstanding accession in the divi-
sion of engineering was the collection of railroad historical material
assembled by the late Charles B. Chaney, Jr., totaling about 20,000
items. Another railroad accession was a group of models showing the
evolution of the equipment of The Empire State Express, the New
York Central famous train. Various commercial firms continued their
cooperation by contributing material relating to industrial products
and manufactures, and interesting electrical items came from a num-
ber of sources. Through the Dahlgreen fund 15 fine original prints
of historical and technical importance were added to the graphic arts
collections; included in the group are prints by Breughel, Goya,
Delacroix, Blake, Daumier, Rodin, and Zorn. Among the photo-
graphic material received was equipment used in the first practical
synchronization of sound in motion pictures. An interesting acces-
sion in the division of medicine and public health was one of the
first of the so-called “drunkometer” instruments now used extensively
by police departments to determine the amount of alcohol in the breath
and tissues.

History.—A notable acquisition in this division was a large numis-
matic and philatelic collection from the estate of the late Victor L.
Huberich, consisting of more than 2,500 specimens of United States,
Canadian, and Japanese paper money and about 73,000 Mexican rev-
enue stamps and Japanese postage stamps. This is a collection of
unusual historical interest and is the first important addition to the
Museum’s collection of United States paper currency in many years.
The numismatic series were increased also by the addition of 72 com-
memorative medals lent by the Bureau of the Mint. The most
important addition to the costumes collection was a green silk, flow-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 19

ered, brocade wedding dress, worn by Sarah Pierpont who married
Jonathan Edwards in 1727. The military and naval collections were
enhanced by a number of interesting objects, one lot of special im-
portance being a collection of 72 Teacher Type ship models of the
sort used by the Navy for training during World War II and 10
wooden display cases for them.

EXPLORATION AND FIELD WORK

Field work by members of the staff of the departments of an-
thropology, zoology, botany, and geology was continued during the
year as opportunities offered.

In January four Museum staff members—Frank M. Setzler, head
curator of anthropology, and biologists David H. Johnson, Herbert
G. Deignan, and Robert R. Miller—left for Australia to participate
in an anthropological and biological survey of little-known Arnhem
Land sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, the Australian Com-
monwealth, and the National Geographic Society. This expedition
was still in the field at the close of the fiscal year, but had already
reported good progress in its studies and collections.

Early in the year the associate curator of ethnology, John C. Ewers,
spent nearly 3 months on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana and
the Blood Reserve in Alberta interviewing aged Indians on traditional
arts and crafts and on the role of the horse in Blackfoot culture.
Briefer periods were spent on the Flathead Reservation in
Montana and the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota obtaining
comparative materials on Flathead and Oglala Sioux horse culture.

Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, associate curator of archeology, was detailed
during most of the year to the River Basin Surveys under the Bureau
of American Ethnology and spent considerable time in the field,
particularly in the Missouri River Basin. (See appendix 5 for
details.)

The Smithsonian took part in the Navy’s Second (1948) Antarctic
Development Project, and Commander David C. Nutt was employed
as biologist on a temporary basis to represent the Museum. The re-
sult was the collecting of one of the best representations of Antarctic
marine life, particularly invertebrates, ever to accrue to the national
collections. Charles O. Handley, Jr., likewise temporarily employed,
accompanied a naval expedition to the American Arctic Archipelago,
where he secured a fine lot of Arctic birds and mammals for the
Museum.

During the first 2 months of the year Dr. Leonard P. Schultz,
curator of fishes, Dr. J. P. E. Morrison, associate curator of mollusks,
and Frederick M. Bayer, assistant curator of marine invertebrates,
participated in the Bikini Scientific Resurvey organized by the De-
partment of the Navy, the United States Armed Forces Special Weap-
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

ons Project, and the Atomic Energy Commission. This investigation
was made for the purpose of determining the possible long-range
effects of the Operation Crossroads atom-bomb experiments on the
animal and plant life of the area. Extensive collections were made,
with emphasis on fishes and marine invertebrates.

Donald S. Erdman, biological aid in the division of fishes, left on
March 21 to make a survey of the fishery resources of the Persian
Gulf.

Other zoological field projects participated in by the Museum in-
cluded the following: A survey of the small mammals of eastern
Pennsylvania and their ectoparasites, sponsored by the United States
Public Health Service; a similar survey at Air Transport Command
bases in Greenland, Labrador, Newfoundland, Quebec, and Maine, in
cooperation with the Army Medical Center; two ornithological ex-
peditions financed by the W. L. Abbott fund, one in Colombia and one
in Panama; alcyonarian studies in southern Florida; a survey of
Lithia Spring, Fla., following the reported occurrence there of an
Asiatic snail known as the intermediate host of the disease paragoni-
miasis of the western Pacific.

No formal expeditions were participated in by the department of
botany during the year, but various members of the staff did collecting
work in eastern Canada, Maryland, and southern Oregon and north-
ern California. Dr. F. A. McClure, research associate, was in Central
America from December to June, continuing field studies of American
bamboos.

In the department of geology, field work again yielded interesting
and needed study specimens of fossils. Dr. G. A. Cooper, curator of
invertebrate paleontology, and party collected Devonian and Missis-
sippian fossils in the region of Alamogordo, the San Andres
Mountains, and Silver City, N. Mex., and later Permian fossils in the
Glass Mountains, Tex., and Lower and Middle Ordovician material] in
the Arbuckle Mountains and Criner Hills, Okla. Associate Curator
A. R. Loeblich’s field work took him to western New York and Ontario.
where he collected from Middle Devonian deposits; to Sylvania,
Ohio, where he obtained more Devonian invertebrate fossils; to [h-
nois (Pennsylvanian rocks) and eastern Missouri (Silurian) ; and to
Tennessee, where he collected Ordovician and Silurian fossils in the
Central Basin and also visited important Silurian and Devonian
localities in the western part of the State.

Dr. C. Lewis Gazin, curator of vertebrate paleontology, resumed his
program of mammalian collecting in the Middle Eocene Bridger
formation, Wyoming, and obtained outstanding primate, creodont,
insectivore, perissodactyl, and rodent material, as well as some good
reptile skulls.

Under the leadership of Dr. David H. Dunkle, associate curator
SECRETARY'S REPORT 21

of vertebrate paleontology, a field party spent several weeks at a Tri-
assic rock quarry near Lemy, N. Mex., recovering 19 blocks of the
bone-bed material. Composed primarily of the dissociated remains
of the giant stereospondylous amphibian Buettneria, the collection in-
cludes at least 35 skulls of this animal, as well as a multitude of other
skeletal parts. Dr. Dunkle also made a search for fossil fishes in the
Jurassic beds east of Santa Rosa, N. Mex., and his party obtained 87
specimens representing two genera of primative teleosts. Prior to the
close of the year Dr. Dunkle and A. C. Murray undertook field work
in the marine Pierre Shale north of Lusk, eastern Wyoming.

PUBLICATIONS

Twenty-four Museum publications were issued during the year:
1 Annual Report, 4 Bulletins, 17 Proceedings papers, and 2 papers in
the Bulletin series, Contributions from the United States National
Herbarium. A list of these is given in the complete report on Smith-
sonian publications, appendix 12. Special mention should be made
of Bulletin 193, published in December 1947, comprising a list and
index of all the publications of the United States National Museum
from 1875, when the first Museum Bulletin was issued, until the end
of 1946. It is the first such list and index to be published in more
than 40 years. It was compiled in the editorial division.

The distribution of volumes and separates to libraries and other
institutions and to individuals aggregated 50,970.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION

A number of important changes in the Museum organization were
effected during the year.

On July 31, 1947, the department of biology was divided into two
departments—zoology and botany—the former division of plants (the
National Herbarium) being raised to the status of a full department.
Ellsworth P. Killip was named head curator of the department of
botany, while Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt continued as head curator of zool-
ogy. Three divisions were created in the new department—phanero-
gams, grasses, and cryptogams—and toward the close of the year a
fourth one, the division of ferns, was established, to become effective
on July 1, 1948.

The division of aeronautics was separated from the department
of engineering and industries on July 31, 1947, to become the nucleus
of the National Air Museum, established by Congress in 1946 as a
bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. This change took from the
department Paul E. Garber, curator of aeronautics, with 28 years
of service in the Museum, to become curator of the National Air
Museum.
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

On March 7, 1948, Carl W. Mitman, head curator of the depart-
ment of engineering and industries since 1932, left the staff of the
National Museum to become Assistant to the Secretary for the Na-
tional Air Museum. Frank A. Taylor, curator of engineering, was
appointed head curator of the department on May 3, 1948.

During the year Dr. Alexander Wetmore, who since 1945 had been
serving in the double capacity as Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and also as Director of the National Museum, relinquished the
latter position. Dr. Wetmore had been in charge of the Museum since
1925. On May 26, 1948, Dr. Remington Kellogg, curator of the di-
vision of mammals, was appointed as the new Director.

On June 30, 1948, the Government employees on the staff of the
National Gallery of Art totaled 312, as compared with 305 employees
as of June 80, 1947. The United States Civil Service regulations
govern the appointment of employees paid from appropriated public
funds.

Throughout the year a high standard of operation has been main-
tained in all departments of the Gallery. The entire staff was
especially commended by the Board of Trustees for outstanding serv-
ice during the exhibition of paintings from the Berlin museums,
which brought unprecedented numbers of visitors to the Gallery.

APPROPRIATIONS

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948, the Congress of the United
States appropriated for the National Gallery of Art the sum of
$949,426 to be used for salaries and expenses in the operation and up-
keep of the Gallery, the protection and care of works of art, and ad-
ministrative and other expenses.

From this appropriation the following expenditures and encum-
brances were incurred:

In addition to this appropriation, the Gallery received from the
Department of State the sum of $5,800 to cover expenses during the fis-
cal year of the Inter-American Office, in closing out the Gallery’s
participation in the program of exchange of art and art materials be-
tween the United States and other American republics. Of this sum,
$5,327.06 was expended, primarily in the circulation of eight exhibi-
tions and the subsequent return of loaned objects. The unobligated
balance was $472.94.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 25

ATTENDANCE

There were 2,159,435 visitors to the Gallery during the fiscal year,
an average daily attendance of about 5,932. This was an increase of
711,397 over the total of 1,448,038 visitors in the previous fiscal year.
During the period between March 17, 1948, and April 25, 1948, when
the paintings from the Berlin museums were on exhibition, a total of
964,970 people visited the Gallery. On one day, April 11, 1948, the
Gallery attendance set an all-time high of 67,490.

ACCESSIONS

There were 1,360 accessions by the National Gallery of Art, as gifts,
loans or deposits, during the fiscal year. Most of the paintings and
a number of the prints were placed on exhibition.

PAINTINGS

A special opening was held February 1, 1948, to exhibit recent ad-
ditions to the Ralph and Mary Booth Collection, consisting of eight
paintings by Italian and German artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. These paintings were presented to the Gallery by Mrs.
Ralph Harman Booth, of Detroit, and their acceptance was confirmed
by the Board of Trustees on October 13, 1947. Also exhibited at the
same time were previous donations to the same collection. <A special
catalog was prepared for the opening. The paintings received were:

PAINTINGS FROM THE BERLIN MUSEUMS

On March 6, 1948, it was announced that the National Gallery of
Art, at the request of the Department of the Army, would place on
exhibition from March 17 to April 18, 1948, the 202 paintings from
the Berlin museums which were brought to the United States in 1945
for safekeeping, and which had been stored since that time in the
National Gallery of Art. Shown during the Gallery’s regular exhibi-
tion hours, the paintings attracted widespread public interest, and
were viewed by such large numbers of visitors that new attendance
records were established. The exhibition was extended for one week
to April 25, and the total attendance reached an all-time high of
964,970 visitors, which is believed to be a record for any museum or
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

art gallery in the world in a comparable period. Following the close
of the exhibition, the custody of the paintings passed from the
National Gallery of Art to the Department of the Army.

In accordance with the expressed wishes of the Senate Armed Sery-
ices Committee and the Department of the Army, a meeting of museum
and gallery officials was held at the National Gallery of Art on
April 29, 1948, to prepare plans for an exhibition tour of certain of
these paintings. Attending the meeting were: David E. Finley, Di-
rector, National Gallery of Art, presiding; G. H. Edgell, Director,
Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Mass.; H. F. Jayne, Vice Director, and
Dudley T. Easby, Secretary, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York,
N. Y.; Fiske Kimball, Director, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Phila-
delphia, Pa.; Homer Saint-Gaudens, Director, Department of Fine
Arts, Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Pa.; Daniel Catton Rich, Di-
rector, Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Il.; William M. Milliken,
Director, Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, O.; Edgar P. Richard-
son, Director, Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Mich.; Edward S.
King, Acting Administrator, and David Rosen, Technical Advisor for
Preservation and Restoration, Walters Gallery, Baltimore, Md.;
Blake-More Godwin, Director, Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, O.;
Russell A. Plimpton, Director, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minne-
apolis, Minn.; James W. Foster, Jr., Baltimore Museum of Art,
Baltimore, Md.; also present were: Col. T. Scott Riggs and Maj.
Gerard B. Crook, General Staff Corps, Civil Affairs Division, United
States Army, and Abraham J. Harris, Department of Justice.

At this meeting a proposed schedule of exhibitions throughout the
United States was agreed upon, and subsequently confirmed with
amendments by the Department of the Army.

In conformity with instructions from the Department of the Army,
52 of the paintings which were considered most likely to suffer damage
or deterioration if sent on an exhibition tour were packed for immedi-
ate shipment back to the American Zone in Germany. These paint-
ings were chosen by the following committee, which met at the Na-
tional Gallery of Art on April 27, 1948: John Walker, Chairman,
Chief Curator, National Gallery of Art; Daniel Catton Rich, Director
of the Chicago Art Institute; George Stout, Director of the Wor-
cester Art Museum; Stephen §. Pichetto, Consultant Restorer to the
National Gallery of Art and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art;
and Dr. Irene Kuehnel, formerly Curator of Paintings of the Kaiser
Friedrich Museum and currently attached to Military Government
in the American Zone, Germany.

The remainder of the paintings were packed and sent on tour in ac-
cordance with plans approved by the Department of the Army. At
the Department’s request, the National Gallery of Art agreed to
supervise technical and professional details involved in sending the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 33

paintings on an exhibition tour. The following institutions were
scheduled to participate in the tour:

Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, N. Y.

CURATORIAL ACTIVITIES

The Curatorial Department accessioned 1,360 new gifts to the Gal-
lery during the year. Advice was given in the case of 205 works of
art brought to the Gallery for opinion, and 21 visits were made in
connection with proffered works of art. More than 500 research
problems were investigated in response to inquiries received by the
Gallery. During the year 16 lectures and 4 lecture courses were given
by members of the curatorial staff. Charles Seymour, Jr., gave a
series of lectures on Renaissance art at the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, and carried on special research in Europe in connection with the
Gallery’s sculpture collection.

Changes were made in the installation of the Bliss Collection of
Pre-Columbian Art, to accommodate additional art objects loaned to
the Gallery by Robert Woods Bliss. The cataloging and filing of
photographs in the George Martin Richter Archive is continuing,
with the gradual enlargement of the collection.

Further activities of the department are indicated under the heading
of “Publications.”

RESTORATION AND REPAIR OF WORKS OF ART

Necessary restoration and repair of works of art in the Gallery’s
collections were made by Stephen S. Pichetto, Consultant Restorer to
the Gallery. All work was completed in the Restorer’s studio in the
Gallery, with the exception of the restoration of one painting, work
on which was completed in Mr. Pichetto’s New York studio.

PUBLICATIONS

During the year an article by Mr. Cairns, “The Future of Musical
Patronage,” was contributed to a symposium, “Music and Criticism,”
edited by Richard F. French, published by Harvard University Press,
Cambridge, Mass. It also appeared in the Atlantic Monthly. A lec-
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

ture by Mr. Cairns at the University of Mexico was published by the
University of Mexico, and a Spanish translation of an article by
Mr. Cairns on “Leibniz? Theory of Law” appeared in an Argentine
legal review. Mr. Cairns also edited with an introduction a volume
entitled “Lectures in Criticism,” to be published in the early fall.
His review of Randolph E. Paul’s “Taxation for Prosperity” was pub-
lished in Tax Law Review.

A series of 12 articles on French paintings in the Gallery, pref-
aced by one entitled “Connoisseurship and Nineteenth-Century French
Painting,” was published by John Walker in the Ladies’ Home Jour-
nal. Charles Seymour, Jr., published an article on “XIII Century
Sculpture at Noyon” and another entitled “Houdon’s Washington at
Mount Vernon Reexamined” in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts. Fern
Rusk Shapley contributed to the Gazette des Beaux-Arts. Articles
and book reviews by James W. Lane appeared in the Gazette des
Beaux-Arts, The College Art Journal, Art in America, The Ameri-
can Collector, Antiques, The Catholic World, and Commonweal.
Charles M. Richards contributed an article on measurements to Mu-
seum News. “A Study of a Painting Done by a Mental Patient,” by
Erwin O. Christensen, was published in “Case Studies in the Psy-
chopathology of Crime.”

A book of illustrations on the painting and sculpture in the Widener
Collection was issued during the year. Members of the curatorial staff
prepared a check list of the paintings from the Berlin museums, which
was placed on sale during the exhibition. A catalog of the paintings
presented by Mrs. Ralph Harman Booth was also prepared for the
opening of that exhibit.

Since 1941 the history of the Publications Fund has been one of
continual growth and development, and the fiscal year 1948 marks
another step in providing a varied but well-balanced selection of pub-
lications and reproductions for public use.

The Publications Fund has continued to supply color reproductions
of fine quality at a moderate price. During the year 8 new 11-inch
by 14-inch color reproductions, 8 new color postcards, including 6
subjects from the Index of American Design, and 19 large collotype
reproductions were made available. Of the large collotype reproduc-
tions, the Publications Fund now has 71 available. A new item was
supplied this year in the form of playing-card sets, two of which por-
trayed subjects from the Index of American Design, and one of re-
productions of paintings in the Gallery’s collections.

Catalogues of the various collections continue to be popular. Dur-
ing the year, increased distribution exhausted the supplies of the
Chester Dale Catalogue, the Preliminary Catalogue of Paintings and
Sculpture, and the catalogue entitled Indigenous Art of the Americas.
A fifth edition of the Chester Dale Catalogue is on order, and a textual
SECRETARY'S REPORT 35

catalogue of the entire collection to replace the Preliminary Catalogue
is in preparation. The end of the fiscal year brought the first ship-
ment of illustrated Widener Catalogues, and plans are in progress for
a similar catalogue of the Mellon Collection.

With publication scheduled for 1949 or 1950, the manuscript for
Erwin O. Christensen’s comprehensive survey of the Index of Ameri-
can Design, “Made in America,” is nearing completion. The Na-
tional Gallery of Art is collaborating with Penguin Books Ltd. in
preparing two books, “Popular Art in the United States,” by Erwin
O. Christensen, to be printed soon, and “Pictures from America,” by
John Walker, to be issued sometime next year.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

During the year more than 20,000 persons attended the General,
Congressional, and Special Topic Tours, while over 24,000 attended
the Picture of the Week. Approximately 19,000 came to hear the
lectures and other programs in the Auditorium. Special appoint-
ments, tours, and conferences were arranged for over 2,000 persons.
The Education Department has continued the publication of a monthly
Calendar of Events, announcing Gallery activities, including notices
of exhibitions, lectures, gallery talks, tours, and concerts. The Cal-
endar of Events was mailed out to more than 3,000 persons a month.

LIBRARY

The library was given 131 books, 447 pamphlets, and 26 periodicals
during the year; 439 books, 55 pamphlets, and 608 periodicals were
purchased, and 35 subscriptions to periodicals were made. A total of
55 books, 103 pamphlets, and 406 bulletins were received on exchange
from other institutions; 265 photographs were received as giits to
the library, and 52 photographs were received on exchange. During
the year, 1,249 books were borrowed and returned, 1,175 of which
were borrowed from the Library of Congress. For the remaining
74 books, the library was indebted to museums, universities, and
public libraries. In addition, by special arrangement, the Gallery
received on loan from the Library of Congress a number of other
books on art and related subjects.

INDEX OF AMERICAN DESIGN

The Index of American Design continued during the year to be
enlarged by gifts and exchanges. Index material was used at the
Gallery by 232 persons, while 534 photographs of Index designs were
sold for use in commercial design, publications, references, exhibition,
and other purposes.
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

INTER-AMERICAN OFFICE

The Inter-American Office suspended operations at the close of the
the fiscal year, and its program of promoting art activities between the
American republics was terminated, owing to the discontinuance of
funds previously made available to the Gallery for this work.

CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF BUILDING

The installation of the fourth refrigeration machine to provide addi-
tional air conditioning for the Gallery building was completed in
March 1948. Since that time the machine has been in operation when-
ever required and has been giving satisfactory service.

During the year the mechanical staff overhauled three of the other
refrigeration machines, which would customarily have been done by
outside contract. The usual routine work in connection with the
structural care and maintenance of the building and its mechanical
equipment was carried on throughout the year. Care and improve-
ment of the Gallery grounds also progressed satisfactorily; and con-
siderable replacements were made in the Taxus hedge in various areas.
The gardening staff has continued to grow a substantial portion of the
smaller plants used for the decoration of the two Garden Courts.
Plans are now under way to extend the cold-frame equipment in the
southwest moat, to enable the gardening staff to produce more small
flowering plants used for decorative purposes.

The equipment in the cafeteria kitchen was rearranged during the
year, and additional items were purchased, to facilitate the operation
of the cafeteria.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

During the fiscal period a total of 47 Sunday evening concerts were
given at the Gallery. The concerts, free to the public, attracted
capacity audiences. Five Sunday evening concerts during the month
of May were devoted to the Gallery’s Fifth American Music Festival,
the most successful of these to date.

A total of 155 permits to copy paintings and 107 permits to photo-
graph in the Gallery were issued during the year. Prints of the
motion picture on the National Gallery of Art were loaned during
the year to 19 institutions.

During the year the photographic laboratory of the Gallery made
13,938 prints, 1,037 black-and-white slides, 891 color slides, 2,611 nega-
tives, in addition to infrared photographs, ultraviolet photographs,
and color separation negatives.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 37

OTHER GIFTS

Gifts of books on art and related material were made to the Gallery
library during the year by Paul Mellon and others. A sum of money
was given by an anonymous donor to enlarge a previously established
fund, the income from which will be available for the acquisition of
works of art by American artists, and for prizes and awards to
American artists.

AUDIT OF PRIVATE FUNDS OF THE GALLERY

An audit has been made of the private funds of the Gallery for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1948, by Price, Waterhouse & Co., public
accountants, and the certificate of that company on its examination of
the accounting records maintained for such funds will be forwarded
to the Gallery.

Since it is a provision of the Ranger bequest that paintings pur-
chased from the fund and assigned to American art institutions may
be claimed by the National Collection of Fine Arts during the 5-year
period beginning 10 years after the death of the artist represented,
three paintings were recalled for action of the Smithsonian Art Com-
mission at its meeting December 2, 1947.

Two Ranger Fund paintings were accepted by the Commission to
become permanent accessions of the National Collection of Fine Arts
as listed earlier in this report.

One Ranger Fund painting, The Harvest Moon, by Charles Melville
Dewey, N. A. (1849-1937), was returned to the Fine Arts Society of
San Diego, San Diego, Calif., thus becoming its absolute property.

THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF FINE ARTS REFERENCE LIBRARY

A total of 470 publications (256 volumes and 214 pamphlets) were
accessioned, bringing the total National Collection of Fine Arts
library accessions to 11,016, plus the volumes of serials formerly ac-
cessioned by the Museum library for the “National Gallery of Art,”
now the National Collection of Fine Arts.

PAINTINGS COPIED
The portrait of Commodore Stephen Decatur, by Gilbert Stuart,
was copied by Casimir Gregory Stapko, Washington, D. C., for the
University of Pennsylvania, ROTC.

INFORMATION SERVICE

The large number of requests for information and the volume of
photographic prints and post cards sold in the office give evidence of
the importance and value of these services. No detailed account has
SECRETARY’S REPORT 43

been kept of the many paintings, sculptures, and other art objects
brought and sent in for examination and judgment.

Four outside talks were given to art organizations and service clubs
concerning specific material in the National Collection of Fine Arts,
or on subjects of general art interest. Service on juries of award was
performed for five different art societies holding competitive exhibits.

The long-overdue task of repairing and restoring the Peacock
Room by James McNeill Whistler was begun on October 10, 1947. This
work involves taking down all four walls of the room, removing all
leather from the original paneling, constructing a complete set of new
panels of harborite, reconditioning the leather and cleaning all painted
and gilded surfaces, remounting the leather on the new panels by
means of a moisture-proof wax adhesive, and reinstalling all panels
and shelving. All phases of the actual restoration are being done by
Messrs. John A. and Richard M. Finlayson of the Museum of Fine
Arts, Boston, on a part-time schedule. All structural work is being
done in the Gallery cabinet shop. The work is still in progress.

REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, oflice work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948, conducted
in accordance with the Act of Congress of June 27, 1944, which pro-
vides “* * * for continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii and the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains. * * *”

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

Dr. M. W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau, spent the first part of
the fiscal year in Washington attending to administrative duties and
in preparing a study on “Olmec Jade.”

On January 1 Dr. Stirling left for western Panama where he spent
31% months in the excavation of four archeological sites on the Azuero
Peninsula in cooperation with the National Geographic Society. Two
of these were representative of the relatively late Coclé culture. A
third was a mound site representing a new culture apparently ances-
tral to Coclé, while the fourth site was a shell mound near the mouth
of the Parita River, which was found to contain a very early and
completely new culture, unrelated to anything heretofore known in
Panama. During this work Dr. Stirling was assisted in the field by
Dr. Gordon Willey of the Bureau staff.

At the close of the archeological field season a brief visit was made
to the Guaymi Indians in the Province of Chiriqui.

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., Associate Director of the Bureau
and Director of the River Basin Surveys, was mainly occupied
throughout the fiscal year in directing the River Basin Surveys. In
connection with this work he established cooperative projects with
State and local institutions in various parts of the country, aided in
the preparation of preliminary reports pertaining to the results of
investigations in various reservoir basins, and wrote progress reports
for the cooperating agencies. He went to Lincoln, Nebr., November 26
to December 5, where he inspected the field headquarters and labora-
tory for the Missouri Basin project, received reports on the results
of the summer’s surveys in that area, and aided in the preparation of
plans for evaluating and handling the material collected. While in
Lincoln he attended sessions of the Fifth Plains Conference for Ar-
cheology and presided at a symposium on “The Paleo-Indian in the

53
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

Central Plains.” He also took part in a regional conference of Na-
tional Park Service officials at which various phases of the River
Basins program were discussed and plans for the future were formu-
lated. In May he went to Milwaukee, Wis., to attend the annual
meeting of the Society for American Archeology and presided over a
symposium on “The River Basin Archeological Surveys.” Dr. Rob-
erts’ report on the River Basin Surveys appears in another section of
this report.

Dr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, was occupied at the beginning
of the fiscal year in the preparation of a supplement to his recently
completed Aleutian grammar. This supplement contains a long list
of terms relating to natural history, weather, material cultures,
sociology, religion, and geography. Following this Dr. Harrington
completed a grammar of the Maya language consisting of 750 type-
written pages. This study is of particular importance, as Maya is
one of the “classic” languages of aboriginal America.

Dr. Harrington then prepared and brought to completion a gram-
mar of the Cahuilla language. The Cahuilla Indians are at present
the leading native tribe of southern California. A large report on
the Guarani language of South America was also finished. Guarani
in the Republic of Paraguay has been given equal cfficial and legal
standing with Spanish. This is the only instance in which a native
Indian language has been given a true literate status. A smaller paper
on the Matako language of the central part of the Gran Chaco of
Argentina was next completed. It was found that in many respects
this language is surprisingly similar to Guarani. Another large
paper was then prepared, describing and discussing the three principal
ideographic writing systems of the world, Egyptian, Chinese, and
Maya.

Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., ethnologist, spent the period from June
19 to August 16 on Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., engaged in an archeo-
logical survey of the western end of the island. He found a number of
prehistoric Indian village and camp sites, mainly in the Chilmark-
Menemsha-Gay Head region, and made collections of artifacts. On
returning to Washington he resumed his Eskimo studies.

As chairman of the Board of Governors of the Arctic Institute of
North America, Dr. Collins continued to devote considerable time to
the affairs of that organization. In the course of the year the Arctic
Institute, with increased support from governmental and other sources,
expanded its research and other activities. It opened a New York
office at the American Geographical Society headquarters, established
an open membership, and began publication of a journal. It spon-
sored and administered a number of field studies in anthropology,
botany, zoology, geology, and geography. These projects carried out
SECRETARY’S REPORT 55

in Alaska and northern Canada were financed in large part by the
office of Naval Research and the Canadian Government.

Dr. Collins continued to serve as chairman of the Directing Com-
mittee for the Arctic Institute’s Bibliography and Roster projects.
This committee selected personnel and put into operation these two
projects—the preparation of a comprehensive annotated and indexed
bibliography on the Arctic, and a roster of Arctic specialists. The
projects are supported by funds from the Office of Naval Research,
the Army, and the Defense Research Board of Canada. The bibliog-
raphy project, with four expert bibliographers and three assistants,
is under way at the Library of Congress; the roster project, with a
director and assistant, has been given office space in the building of
the Carnegie Institution of Washington.

At the invitation of the Canadian Government, Dr. Collins left
Washington late in June to conduct archeological work for the Smith-
sonian Institution and the National Museum of Canada in the northern
part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

At the beginning of the year Dr. William N. Fenton was on leave
while teaching in the summer session of Northwestern University
(June 23 to August 23), where he was invited to occupy the post of
professor in the department of anthropology during that quarter.
While in the Chicago area, he was able to spend considerable time
examining rare books and manuscripts in the Ayer Collection of the
Newberry Library and to study ethnological collections from the
Troquois Indians in the Milwaukee Public Museum and in the Chicago
Natural History Museum. Returning, Dr. Fenton spent the first 2
weeks of September at field work among the Seneca Indians of Alle-
gany Reservation in western New York.

Teaching a course in primitive political institutions suggested a
plan for undertaking a comprehensive political history of the League
of the Iroquois which would attempt to test the findings of ethnology
in the historian’s traditional materials. The documentary materials
on the Six Nations comprising the Iroquois League for the Federal
Period alone and for the succeeding first decade of the nineteenth
century exist in several large collections of papers which have not
been used extensively by historians of Federal and Indian political
relations. First, the papers of Samuel Kirkland (1741-1808) contain
interesting sidelights on the political activities of the Six Nations,
covering missionary activities among the Oneida, Tuscarora, and
Seneca tribes; the correspondence of an agent of the American Revo-
Jution; and the gradual civilization of the native Indians. Exami-
nation of the Kirkland papers at Hamilton College was begun in
September with the help of M. H. Deardorff of Warren, Pa., and
Charles E. Congdon, an alumnus. The project is indebted to Dr.
Arthur C. Parker of Naples, N. Y., for the loan of a Seneca Census of

817369—49——5
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

1840 and several minute books of the Six Nations Council at Buffalo
Creek by the New England missionary Rev. Asher Wright; these have
subsequently been acquired by the American Philosophical Society.

Two grants were received for Iroquois research. Toward the col-
lection of materials for a political history of the Iroquois the American
Philosophical Society made a grant for travel, photoduplication, and
secretarial assistance; and a similar grant was received from the Vik-
ing Fund, Inc., for field work.

Beginning in February, Dr. Fenton spent about 1 week of each
month in travel to repositories of historical materials. He visited
Salem and Boston to examine the Timothy Pickering papers, working
in the Essex Institute and the Peabody Museum of Salem, and the
Massachusetts Historical Society and the Houghton Library of
Harvard in the Boston area. Frequent short trips were made to the
library of the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, to ex-
amine parallel papers and to identify a Constitution of the Iroquois
Confederacy by Seth Newhouse. In April Dr. Fenton went back to
Hamilton College for further work on the Kirkland papers, and re-
turning, he stopped at Vassar College library to arrange for copying
the Jasper Parrish papers. Kirkland, Pickering, and Parrish were
all concerned in negotiating treaties with the Six Nations after the
Revolution, and their letters led to the immense collection of mementos
relating to western New York which Henry O'Reilly of Rochester had
collected in 15 large folio volumes for presentation to the New York
Historical Society. By the end of June Dr. Fenton had completed
a first examination of the O’Reilly papers and had arranged for micro-
filming a substantial part of them. A policy of collecting as much as
practicable on microfilm has cut down the cost of travel.

Dr. Fenton completed a term as senior editor of the Journal of the
Washington Academy of Sciences. In June he was appointed anthro-
pologist member of the Language Panel of the United States National
Commission for UNESCO.

A second album of Iroquois records with program notes, edited by
Dr. Fenton, entitled “Seneca Songs from Coldspring Longhouse,”
was published by the Library of Congress.

Dr. Philip Drucker, anthropologist, was detailed to the River Basin
Surveys July 1 to October 1, 1947, for work in the Columbia Basin.
He returned to Washington on October 1, and during the ensuing
months he brought to completion an ethnographic monograph entitled
“The Northern and Central Nootkan Tribes,” based on field investi-
gations which he had made among the Nootkan-speaking Indians of
Vancouver Island, British Columbia, some years before. This report
describes in detail mode of life and customs of these Indians during
the closing decades of the nineteenth century and is to be followed by
a study tracing the cultural changes produced by European contacts
SECRETARY’S REPORT 57

during the maritime fur trade a century earlier. On finishing this
report, he completed an archeological monograph, “La Venta,
Tabasco: A Study of Olmec Ceramics and Art,” which summarizes the
principal results of the studies made by the Smithsonian Institution-
National Geographic Society expeditions to southern Veracruz and
Tabasco, Mexico. In addition, he prepared two short papers for
publication—‘Preliminary Account of Archeological Reconnaissance
on the Chiapas Coast,” and one entitled “The Antiquity of the North-
west Coast Totem Pole”—as well as summary reports for the Director,
River Basin Surveys, on the results of investigations of 14 reservoir
areas in the Columbia Basin and of 10 in California during the pre-
ceding field season.

On May 2 Dr. Drucker proceeded to Boston and Salem, Mass., to
examine collections of manuscript materials and museum collections
from the period of the maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast,
in the archives of the Massachusetts Historical Society and in the
Peabody Museum, Salem. Through the courtesy of officials of those
institutions, he was given access to the collections and was able to
assemble a considerable amount of unpublished data relating to the
problem of culture change due to early European influences. On
May 9 he returned to Washington.

On May 18 he was again detailed to the River Basin Surveys and
left for the Pacific Coast, to resume charge of the River Basin Sur-
veys work there. He was occupied with these duties at the end of
the fiscal year.

Dr. Gordon R. Willey was detailed to the River Basin Surveys for
the period August 15 to October 1, 1947, for work in Tennessee.

In the month of October Dr. Willey was occupied in writing addi-
tional sections of a report, “Ancon and Supe: Formative Period Sites
of the Central Peruvian Coast.” ‘This paper is being prepared in
conjunction with J. M. Corbett and L. M. O’Neale and is to be pub-
lished under the auspices of Columbia University. In November and
December full time was devoted to a long monograph “Archeology
of the Florida Gulf Coast.” This involved both writing and a mu-
seum survey in late November. Collections were examined in Cam-
bridge, Andover, and New York.

On January 1, Dr. Willey accompanied Dr. Stirling to western
Panama for 314 months of archeological excavations in Herrera Prov-
ince. Four sites were examined and stratigraphic tests made in the
most promising locations of each. May and June, following the re-
turn from Panama, were occupied with writing the “Archeology of
the Florida Gulf Coast.” This report should be completed early in
September 1948.

In addition to regular research duties, Dr. Willey has attended
two meetings of the Institute of Andean Research, of which he is a
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

member, and a meeting of Florida archeologists held early in August
at Daytona Beach. He has also served as assistant editor to Ameri-
can Antiquity, to the Handbook of Latin American Studies, and to
the Journal of American Archaeology. For all these journals his work
has entailed the covering of recent South American archeological lit-
erature.

In the Bureau he has acted as consultant during the final editing
of the third and fourth volumes of the Handbook of South American
Indians.

The following articles were prepared by Dr. Willey for publication
during the year 1947-48: “Culture Sequence for the Manatee Region
of West Florida,” American Antiquity, vol. 13, No. 3; “The Cultural
Context of the Crystal River Negative Painted Style,” American An-
tiquity, vol. 18, No. 4; “A Proto-type of the Southern Cult,” Ameri-
can Antiquity, vol. 13, No. 4.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Miss Frances Densmore, collaborator of the Bureau, conducted spe-
cial research on music among the South American Indians and sub-
mitted a manuscript entitled “Musical Customs of the Southern Hunter
Indians of South America” as compiled from the Handbook of South
American Indians.

INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY

The Institute of Social Anthropology was created in 1943 as an
autonomous unit of the Bureau of American Ethnology to carry out
cooperative training in anthropological teaching and research with the
other American republics. During the past year it was financed by
transfers from the Department of State, totaling $94,882, from the
appropriation “Cooperation with the American Republics, 1948.”
The major activities of the Institute of Social Anthropology during
the fiscal year 1948 are as follows:

Washington office—Dr. George M. Foster continued as director of
the Institute of Social Anthropology. He traveled to six South Amer-
ican countries during the period February 14 to April 12, 1948, visiting
Institute of Social Anthropology field stations in Popayan, Colombia,
Lima, Pera, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. In addition, courtesy calls were
made on anthropologists in Barranquilla and Medellin, Colombia,
Quito, Ecuador, Cusco, Pert, La Paz, Bolivia, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
and Caracas, Venezuela. Dr. Foster also spent 8 weeks in México
(November 25—December 15, 1947) reading final proof on Publication
No. 6 of the Institute of Social Anthropology.

Brazil.—Drs. Donald Pierson and Kalervo Oberg continued their
work in Sao Paulo in cooperation with the Escola Livre de Sociologia
SECRETARY’S REPORT 59

e Politica. They gave a number of courses in sociology and anthro-
pology, supplementing other courses given by local professors in the
general field of the humanities. Dr. Oberg, accompanied by several
advanced students, returned to the Mato Grosso for 3 months, July-
September 1947, to complete field work initiated the preceding year
among the Terena and Caduveo Indians. Dr. Pierson, assisted by
advanced students, continued field work at “A Vila,” a caboclo com-
munity near Sao Paulo. The proximity of “A Vila” to Sio Paulo
made it possible to utilize week ends and short vacations throughout
the year, rather than spending a continuous longer period in the field.

Colombia.—Dr. John H. Rowe continued to represent the Institute
of Social Anthropology in Popayan, Colombia, cooperating with the
Instituto Etnolégico of the Universidad del Cauca. Courses in
ethnology, linguistics, and archeology were given to the students
enrolled in the Instituto and 2 months of field work was carried out
among the nearby Guambiano Indians, August-September 1947. Dr.
Rowe also twice visited Bogota to consult with local anthropologists
of the National Ethnological Institute concerning anthropological
activities in Colombia. Sr. Gabriel Ospina, formerly a student of
Institute of Social Anthropology scientists in México, was named
director of the newly established Instituto de Antropologfa Social of
the Escuela Normal Superior. Utilizing field techniques learned
while working with Dr. Foster in Tzintzuntzan, México, he began a
4-year anthropological study of the pueblo of Viani, to train local
personnel, and to throw light on the functioning of this aspect of
Colombian culture.

México.—Dr. Isabel Kelly and Dr. Stanley Newman continued to
represent the Institute of Social Anthropology in its cooperative plan
with the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia. Because of reduced ap-
propriations as compared to the fiscal year of 1947, it was necessary
to terminate studies in cultural geography on August 31, 1947, when
Robert C. West left this service. Five courses in ethnology and lin-
guistics were given during the academic year. Dr. Kelly, assisted by
four students, returned to Tajin, Veracruz, to continue her study of
the 'Totonac Indians. A photographic exhibit in the Benjamin Frank-
lin Library in May 1947, of 'Totonac Indian scenes, prepared by Dr.
Kelly, received favorable comment from many Mexicans, and was
thoroughly described in El Nacional, the official Mexican Government
newspaper. Dr. Newman, working with other faculty members and
students, and working with native informants brought from the field,
continued research on the Otomi and Nahuatl languages.

Pert.—Dr. Allan Holmberg continued to represent the Institute of
Social Anthropology in Perd in its cooperative work with the Instituto
de Estudios Etnolégicos. As in the case of México, reduced appro-
priations made it necessary to reduce the Peruvian staff ; the services of
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

Dr. Webster McBryde were terminated on September 30, 1947. Dr.
Holmberg gave three courses in ethnology during the year; two, in-
cluding a seminar on field methods, in the Instituto de Estudios
Etnoldgicos, and one in the University of San Marcos. Three months,
February through April, 1948, were again spent in the Vira Valley,
bringing to a close the studies initiated the preceding year by Dr.
Holmberg, Dr. Jorge Muelle of the Instituto faculty, and selected
students.

Dr. Holmberg was one of three official United States delegates to
the Hylean Amazon Project of the UNESCO in Iquitos, Pert, in
May 1948.

Publications —Institute of Social Anthropology Publications Nos.
4, 5, 6, and 7, appeared during the fiscal year. These are listed with
the publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology on page 82.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS

The River Basin Surveys, a unit of the Bureau of American
Ethnology organized to carry into effect a memorandum of under-
standing between the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park
Service providing for the recovery of such archeological and paleon-
tological data and materials as will be lost through the construction
of dams and the creation of reservoirs in many of the river valleys of
the United States, continued its investigations throughout the year.
The work was carried on in cooperation with the National Park
Service and the Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior,
and the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, and was
financed by the transfer of $73,800 from the National Park Service
to the Smithsonian Institution. These funds were provided in
part by the National Park Service and in part by the Bureau of
Reclamation.

Most of the work in the field was of a reconnaissance or survey
nature, with only a limited testing of sites where such was necessary
to determine their extent and character. In a few cases, however,
actual excavations were undertaken. The activities involved 18 States
and 38 reservoir areas. By the end of the year the number of reser-
voir basins surveyed, since the first parties started in July 1946, totaled
85. Their distribution is: Virginia 1, West Virginia 2, Georgia 2,
Tennessee 1, Oklahoma 2, Texas 5, Colorado (outside of the Missouri
Basin) 4, California 13, the Missouri Basin (7 States) 50, and the
Columbia Basin (4 States) 15. Those where surveys were under
way but not completed by June 30 are not included in this summary.
In the various areas visited 1,576 sites were noted and recorded and of
that number 250 have been recommended for extensive excavation.
The excavations completed or in progress on June 80 were: New
Mextco 1, Wyoming 1, Nebraska 1, South Dakota 1, North Dakota 1,
SECRETARY'S REPORT 61

Texas 1, and Washington 1. Preliminary appraisals with recommen-
dations for further work, supplemented by some technical reports,
have been completed for all the areas surveyed. Limited editions of
61 have been mimeographed for distribution to the cooperating
agencies. The others were in varying stages of being processed at the
end of the year. These mimeographed pamphlets have not been
made available to the general public because they are not complete
archeological reports and are intended to be used only for reference
purposes by the Surveys staff while the program is going forward.
Reports for general distribution will be issued after the archeological
and paleontological work in each unit has been completed.

General direction and supervision of the work in Georgia, West
Virginia, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado (outside
of the Missouri Basin), and some of the California projects were from
the main office in Washington. Direction of the program in the
Missouri Basin was from a field headquarters and laboratory at
Lincoln, Nebr., while the activities in the Columbia-Snake Basin were
under the supervision of a field office located at Eugene, Oreg.

The assistance and whole-hearted cooperation given to River Basin
Surveys staff men in the field by representatives of the National Park
Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Corps of Engineers con-
tributed in no small degree to the success of much of the work. At
some of the projects temporary office space and storage facilities were
provided, at others transportation was furnished, and in a few cases
labor was made available to help in emergency excavations where
material had to be recovered immediately. The National Park Service
not only obtained the funds necessary for carrying on the program
as a whole, but also served as the liaison between the Smithsonian In-
stitution and the other governmental agencies to the benefit of all
concerned.

Washington office ——The main office of the River Basin Surveys was
under the direction of Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., throughout the
fiscal year. Carl F. Miller, archeologist, continued to operate from
this office, while Joseph R. Caldwell joined the staff as archeologist
on December 14, 1947, by transfer from the United States National
Museum, and Ralph S. Solecki was appointed in the same capacity
on March 2, 1948.

Mr. Miller spent the months from the beginning of the fiscal year
until January in completing a “Comprehensive Report on the Archeo-
logical Aspects of the Buggs Island Reservoir, Virginia and North
Carolina.” He left Washington on January 10, 1948, in company with
Mr. Caldwell, for Augusta, Ga., where they conferred with the Resi-
dent Engineer of the Clark Hill project on the Savannah River.
From Augusta they proceeded to Lincolnton, Ga., where they estab-
lished headquarters, January 13, and proceeded to make a survey of
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

the archeological remains of the area to be flooded by the Clark Hill
Reservoir. During the course of this work they located 128 sites,
70 of which will be covered by water when the dam is completed.
These sites included former village areas, camps, and stone-chipping
stations, with a few mounds. Materials collected from the surface
suggest the former presence of at least six sequent cultural groupings
in the area, including a considerable number which possibly antedate
the introduction of pottery making. Most of the sites are small and, as
a result of long-continued cultivation and erosion, few have any depth.
Three of them have been recommended for excavation. Two of the
latter are representatives of the type of culture which has been named
Stalling’s Island, and the third is the Rembert Mound Group described
by William Bartram in 1791 and partially excavated by C. C. Jones
in 1878 and Cyrus Thomas in 1894 but never thoroughly studied.
These mounds belong in the so-called Lamar period in the South-
eastern cultural sequence.

Miller and Caldwell completed their work at Clark Hill on May 31
and returned to Washington. They spent the remainder of the fiscal
year writing a preliminary report on the results of the survey and
preparing recommendations and estimates for an excavation program
in the basin.

Mr. Solecki left Washington on March 8, 1948, for Hinton, W. Va.,
where he established headquarters and began a survey of the Bluestone
Reservoir Basin on New River. He completed the preliminary recon-
naissance on April 19 and left for Huntington, W. Va., to confer
with the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers. En route he stopped
at Charleston where, with the aid of Mrs. Roy Bird Cook, State
Historian and Archivist, he checked the records and manuscripts in
the History and Archives Department of West Virginia for possible
information on the Indians and early Colonial settlers in the New
River valley. He left Huntington on April 21, for Pittsburgh, Pa.,
stopping to examine some archeological sites at Moundsville, W. Va.
At Pittsburgh he obtained information from the District Engineer,
Corps of Engineers, about the proposed West Fork Reservoir in
the Monongahela Basin in north-central West Virginia. From Pitts-
burgh he proceeded to the West Fork Reservoir area and made a
preliminary reconnaissance of the area that ultimately will be flooded.
This work was completed on May 6, and he returned to the Bluestone
area for more intensive investigation of the remains occurring there.

Inasmuch as both of the reservoir projects surveyed by Mr. Solecki
are in mountainous regions, most of the traces of Indian and Colonial
occupation occur along the river bottoms. A total of 42 archeological
sites were found in the Bluestone area. These include mound groups,
village remains, rock shelters, one location where there are pictographs,
and four Colonial forts. At two of the sites, where potsherds were
SECRETARY’S REPORT 63

found on the surface, Solecki did some test digging. The material
thus obtained places the cultural horizon in late pre-Columbian times
and indicates certain links between the Ohio Valley and the Great Val-
ley of the Shenandoah. Test excavations were also made in the largest
of the rock shelters where both historic and prehistoric objects were
found, the latter occurring in the deposits to a depth of 5 feet.
Because no previous archeological work has been done in this district
the excavation of three of the village sites and the large rock shelter
has been recommended. Solecki found 14 small sites, presumably
places where transient hunting parties had camped, in the West Fork
Basin. None of these are of sufficient size or depth to warrant further
study and no additional work was recommended. The West Virginia
surveys were completed on May 28 and Solecki returned to Washing-
ton where he spent the remainder of the fiscal year preparing reports
on the results of his investigations.

Dr. Gordon R. Willey, archeologist on the regular staff of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, was detailed to the River Basin
Surveys during August and September. On August 14 he went to
Nashville, Tenn., where he visited the office of the District Engineer
for the purpose of obtaining information about the Center Hill proj-
ect on the Caney Fork River near Baxter, Tenn. From there he
proceeded to Baxter and from August 20 to September 12 carried
on a survey of the area to be flooded. He found 29 sites consisting of
temple mounds, small earth-rock mounds, villages, and caves showing
some signs of occupation. Many of the sites proved to be Middle
Mississippian in culture and period; some suggested that they be-
longed in the pre-Mississippian category, and others may even repre-
sent the Archaic. The Middle Mississippian designates the period
when the people lived in large sedentary communities, depended pri-
marily on intensive agriculture for their subsistence, built temple or
substructure mounds, and made characteristic types of pottery and
other artifacts. This generally is believed to have been about A. D.
1300 to 1700. Pre-Mississippian also has been called the Burial Mound
period, or Southeastern Woodland culture. At that stage the people
lived in smaller communities or scattered households, lived pri-
marily by hunting, fishing, food gathering supplemented by a little
agriculture. This was during the centuries from approximately
A. D. 800 to 1300. The Archaic refers to small, scattered groups of
primitive hunters and food gatherers who are believed to have oc-
cupied the area prior to A. D. 700. Excavations were recommended
for one of the temple-mound sites and one of the earth-rock burial
mounds, with testing in some of the village remains. Unfortunately
flooding started before this could be accomplished, and the material
obtained from the survey constitutes most of our knowledge of that
portion of the Cumberland Basin.
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

After completing the survey at Center Hill, Dr. Willey proceeded
to Knoxville, Tenn., where he discussed archeological problems with
members of the Department of Anthropology at the University of
Tennessee. From there he returned to Washington and prepared his
report. He returned to his regular duties as a member of the Bureau
staff on October 1.

Oklahoma.—David J. Wenner, Jr., was appointed field assistant
on July 29, 1947, and proceeded to make a survey of the Hulah Reser-
voir basin on the Caney River in Oklahoma. The area to be in-
undated by this project is not large and he was able to cover it in a
few days’ time. He found four sites, all apparently camping places,
and because of their meager nature, did not believe them worthy of
further investigation. From the Hulah region he proceeded to the
Fort Gibson Reservoir project on the Grand (Neosho) River. A
rapid survey of that basin located 24 sites consisting of 1 mound
group, 1 bluff shelter, and the remains of 22 villages or camps. All but
three of the sites will be covered by water. The most important is the
mound group known as the Norman site. It originally consisted of
six earth mounds and a large surrounding village area. Some work
was done in four of the lesser mounds a number of years ago by the
University of Oklahoma. One of the two remaining mounds is the
largest at the site and is connected to an adjacent low mound by a
ramp. Small test excavations have been made in the low mound
but the large one is virtually intact. It represents a stage of cultural
florescence in the southern United States about which very little is
known and may be comparable in scientific wealth to the famous Spiro
mounds, located in an adjacent county, destroyed by treasure hunters
some 15 years ago. Excavation of the Norman mound probably
would provide information essential to dating the Spiro-type culture
which presumably was the forerunner of the native Caddo culture of
the southern Plains at the beginning of historic times. For this
reason thorough investigation of the remaining manifestations at the
Norman site was recommended.

Mr. Wenner completed his field investigations on August 15 and
proceeded to Norman, Okla., where the University of Oklahoma pro-
vided him with facilities for studying the material collected and writ-
ing his reports. During the period of the surveys and the prepara-
tion of the reports, Dr. Robert E. Bell, of the Department of An-
thropology at the University, assisted Mr. Wenner as an advisor and
consultant. After completion of the work Mr. Wenner left the Sur-
veys to return to college. He again joined the staff on June 28, 1948,
and at the close of the fiscal year was engaged in making a survey of
the Tenkiller Ferry Reservoir on the Illinois River in the eastern part
of the State. Robert Shalkop and William Mayer-Oakes, student as-
sistants, were aiding in this work.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 65

Texas.—The River Basin Surveys in Texas continued to operate
throughout the year from the base and headquarters supplied by the
Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas, Austin.
Excavations were completed at one project, the survey of another res-
ervoir basin was brought to conclusion, and two others were started
and finished.

At the beginning of the year Joe Ben Wheat, archeologist, was en-
gaged in excavations at the Addicks Reservoir. This work was termi-
nated on July 15. Mr. Wheat then proceeded to Austin where he
studied the material he had collected and prepared a preliminary
report covering both the results of his survey of the Addicks Basin
and his excavations in two of the sites located there. He also
wrote a paper “Archeological Survey of the Addicks Basin: A Pre-
liminary Report” which was published in volume 18 of the Bulletin
of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society. He resigned
from the Surveys on August 15 in order to return to the university
and complete his graduate work.

The excavations at the Addicks Reservoir proved interesting because
they revealed a sequence of cultural stages extending from the era
before pottery making and agriculture were introduced through suc-
ceeding centuries until the beginning of contact with European cul-
ture. The period covered is from about A. D. 900 to 1700. Who the
people were is not known, but certain postulations may be made. At
the time of the first French and Spanish explorations of the region
the Akokisa band of the Atakapan occupied the area. Although little
is known of the specific culture of this group, it is generally considered
to have shared the general Atakapan culture extending into the lower
Mississippi Valley. The archeological culture is of the same south-
eastern pattern, which may point to the Akokisa as being the pre-
Columbian inhabitants of the Addicks district.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Robert L. Stephenson, arche-
ologist, was making a reconnaissance of the Whitney Reservoir Basin
on the Brazos River north of Waco. This work continued until Oc-
tober 1, although August 2-4 he returned to Austin for the purpose of
depositing material collected and of conferring with members of the
Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas; August
30 to September 1 he visited the Spanish Fort and other sites in the
central Red River area; and September 13-14 he went to a number of
archeological locations near Waco, but outside the reservoir basin, for
the purpose of gathering comparative data. On August 23 he made a
114-hour flight over the entire Whitney area, successfully locating
archeological sites from the air and obtaining a comprehensive under-
standing of the district asa whole. He returned to Austin on October
1 and spent most of the following 2 months studying the material col-
lected and writing the preliminary report. He also prepared an ar-
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

ticle, “Archeological Survey of Whitney Basin,” which was published
in volume 18 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and Paleonto-
logical Society.

During the course of his investigations Mr. Stephenson located
and recorded 61 sites in the Whitney Basin. These consist of 14 rock
shelters and 47 occupational areas in the open. Two fossil localities
were also located. He recommended 32 sites for further testing and
excavation. Such work should produce important evidence on the
cultural complexes of that portion of Texas.

Mr. Stephenson left Austin on November 26 and went to Lincoln,
Nebr., where he studied the field and laboratory methods being used
by the Missouri Basin Survey group. While at Lincoln he also attend-
ed the Fifth Conference for Plains Archeology and presented a paper
on the work which he had been doing in Texas. He returned to Aus-
tin on December 5 and on the 9th left to begin a survey of the Dam “B”
Reservoir basin on the middle Neches River in the eastern part of the
State. This work was completed on January 18, 1948, having been
interrupted by a trip to the Whitney Reservoir where 3 days were
spent in showing Dr. Theodore E. White, paleontologist, the bone
deposits located earlier. While on this trip Mr. Stephenson located a
large mound and accompanying village remains on the upper Neches
River near Palestine, Tex. From Dam “B” he proceeded to the McGee
Bend Reservoir on the lower Angelina River. Inclement weather,
however, interfered with active work in the field, and most of the time
until February 16 was devoted to studying local collections of arti-
facts, working on field notes, and on the report on the results of the
Dam “B” investigations. During this interval he also went to Galves-
ton, Tex., for a 3-day conference at the office of the District Engineer,
Corps of Engineers, regarding the dates of beginning and completion
of reservoir projects in all parts of Texas. The period from February
16 to April 15, except for 8 days (March 5-7) spent at Nacogdoches
studying old records to obtain data on the early history of the area, was
devoted to reconnaissance of the McGee Bend basin. When the survey
was finished Mr. Stephenson returned to Austin and was occupied until
the end of the year in preparing his reports on the Dam “B” and
McGee Bend investigations.

In the survey of the Dam “B” area 12 sites were located, but none
gave indication of being of sufficient importance to warrant further
examination. Comparable material occurs both in the McGee Bend
Basin and elsewhere in the region. Unless construction work should
reveal subsurface deposits of archeological significance no additional
work will be required at this reservoir and none was recommended.
At McGee Bend 80 sites were located and recorded. Of this number,
8 are early and contain no pottery, 34 are early pottery sites of the
Alto Focus (ca. A. D. 1000 to 1800) , 22 are late pottery sites of Bossier,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 67

Belcher, and Frankston Foci (ca. A. D. 1450 to 1600), and 1 is a historic
site. At many of these locations there are evidences of occupation
through two or more cultural periods and they are important for that
reason. Out of the group 31 sites have been recommended for fur-
ther testing or more extended excavation.

New Mezxico.—The only work done thus far in New Mexico con-
sisted of the excavation of portions of two shallow rock-shelters 8
miles southeast of Tucumcari. The manifestations at that location,
the Hodges site, were outside of the area directly involved by the
Tucumcari project and were in no danger of destruction either by
construction work or flooding. They were being dug, however, on
week ends and holidays by workmen from the project and by settlers
attracted to the district by the development of the irrigation program.
In order to salvage as much as possible of what still remained, the
excavations were initiated by Herbert W. Dick, temporary field assist-
ant, who was employed by the Surveys for that purpose. Mr. Dick
worked at the Hodges site from August 18 to 26. He found that
both shelters contained a homogeneous lot of archeological material
representing a late pre-Columbian cultural period in that part of the
Southwest. On the basis of potsherds, found in association with the
stone and bone artifacts, a late fourteenth or early fifteenth century
dating is given to the archeological manifestations. After completing
the digging Mr. Dick went to Albuquerque, N. Mex., where he proc-
essed the specimens and prepared a preliminary report on his findings.

While Mr. Dick was engaged at the Hodges site it was visited by
Dr. Sheldon Judson who was completing a geological study of the
San Jon, N. Mex., region for the Smithsonian Institution. Dr. Jud-
son found that the lower deposits in the shelters contained interesting
and helpful stratigraphy and from the evidence he obtained there was
able to add another link in the “alluvial chronology” which he has
established for that district, the chronology which promises to con-
tribute much to the understanding of the complex history of the
Late Pleistocene and subsequent periods in the Southwest. Because
of this the Hodges site enjoys an importance out of all proportion to
its antiquity and the archeological information which it produced.

Colorado.—Investigations in certain portions of Colorado are a part
of the major program for the Missouri Basin, but there are a num-
ber of others which fall outside that drainage area and which are
being conducted as separate units of the Surveys as a whole. These
are in the Arkansas and Gunnison Basins. Later they will be ex-
panded to the Colorado-Big Thompson projects and other tributaries
of the Colorado.

Donald Eastman and Gary L. Yundt were appointed field assist-
ants on June 7 and immediately began surveys at a number of reser-
voir basins in the Gunnison drainage. Brief preliminary investiga-
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

tions had been made at a number of these projects by Western State
College, Gunnison, students under the direction of Dr. C. 'T. Hurst of
that institution. Working in conjunction with Dr. Hurst and under
his general direction, Eastman and Yundt completed the surveys of
the Cottonwood, Cebolla, Gateview, and Almont reservoir areas and
at the close of the year were engaged in a reconnaissance of the Taylor
Lake project. The four basins where investigations were completed
contained 16 sites consisting of both rock shelters and open camps.
None appeared to be of sufficient importance to warrant recommenda-
tion for further study by the River Basin Surveys. However, Dr.
Hurst and Western State College volunteered to take over such of
the units as indicated the possibility of contributing some knowledge
and assume responsibility for the additional work needed to obtain it.

Arnold M. Withers was appointed to the Surveys staff on June 13 as
archeologist and on June 21 left Denver accompanied by W. W.
Thompson and M. F. Sullivan, student assistants, to begin the recon-
naissance of a number of reservoir projects in the mountains west of
Pueblo. This work was going ahead at the close of the fiscal year.
Mr. Withers and his associates used space made available by the De-
partment of Anthropology of the University of Denver as their base
of operations.

Missouri Basin—The Missouri Basin project continued in full
operation throughout the year. On July 1, three archeological surveys
and one paleontological reconnaissance were under way and the head-
quarters and laboratory at Lincoln, Nebr., were actively engaged in
processing data and specimens received from the field parties. Most
of the activities were of a survey nature, but some digging was done
at Birdshead Cave in the Boysen Reservoir, Wyo., at Medicine Creek
Reservoir, Nebr., and at several paleontological sites in Wyoming.
By the end of the first week in November weather conditions were such
that it was necessary to stop explorations for the season and all regular
personnel returned to Lincoln. From then until conditions again
became favorable in the spring, the time was devoted to the study of
materials and data collected and the preparation of reports. Field
work was initiated March 29, 1948, when an extensive series of exca-
vations was started at sites soon to be destroyed by construction oper-
ations at the Medicine Creek Dam in western Nebraska. This work
was in accordance with an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation
whereby the River Basin Surveys provided the technical supervision
and the Bureau of Reclamation furnished the necessary labor and
equipment. This undertaking was still in progress at the end of the
fiscal year. On June 1 one archeological party left Lincoln for the
Angostura Reservoir, S. Dak., for further survey and excavation, and
on June 3 another left for Heart Butte Reservoir, N. Dak., to begin
similar activities. A paleontological party departed on June 1 for the
SECRETARY'S REPORT 69

Boysen Reservoir area, Wyoming, to resume the collecting of fossil
material. All three parties were at those respective locations at the
end of the year.

The general results of the Surveys’ findings in the Plains were out-
lined in the 64th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology
and, although subsequent work added important details, need not be
repeated. Some mention, however, should be made of the excavations
carried on in the present year. Birdshead Cave, located near the
base of the Owl Creek Mountains, in the Boysen Reservoir basin,
Wyoming, contained several levels of aboriginal debris of occupation
separated by layers of decomposed rock and dust. The artifacts re-
covered, although small in number, show significant differences from
level to level. If these specimens can be correlated with those from
some of the single-occupation sites in the basin, a task which was being
attempted at the close of the year, it may be possible to arrange the
latter in a sequential order and thus establish a relative chronology
for the area. As a whole the material from upper levels of the cave
suggests a late pre-Columbian occupancy by Indians from the Great
Basin farther west rather than by people from the Plains. This in-
troduces another set of problems pertaining to the interrelationships
between two rather distinct groups over a long period of time. Fur-
ther work in the area should throw light on the subject.

Excavations at the Medicine Creek Reservoir were carried on from
September 5 to November 9, but little more than sampling was under-
taken at that time. When the work was resumed in March, large-
scale operations became possible through the labor and power ma-
chinery contributed by the Bureau of Reclamation. The use of heavy
equipment ordinarily is frowned upon by archeologists. Because of
the short time available for excavation before the sites were destroyed
by construction activities and the lack of funds needed to hire large
labor crews, however, it was deemed advisable to use bulldozers and
highway-grading machinery to remove the overburden from buried
village remains. The results obtained amply demonstrated the prac-
ticability and effectiveness of such equipment in uncovering archeo-
logical materials with a minimum of breakage, and wherever possible
its use probably will be extended to other projects. At Medicine
Creek entire sites were stripped of their sod or other cover, making it
possible to observe the complete village plan, to study village pat-
terns, and to discover small features not readily determinable by the
usual hand-labor methods. From March 29 to June 30 the remains
of 25 houses were uncovered, 37 cache pits located beneath their floors
were investigated, 13 similar pits outside the houses were examined,
and 13 middens were dug. Some 28,000 specimens including utensils
made of pottery, tools of bone, stone, and shell, and the remains of
various food stuffs such as animal bones, mussel shells and charred
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

vegetal materials (corn, beans, seeds of sunflower, squash, and wild
plum) were found. In a number of cases sections of wood in an
excellent state of preservation were obtained from post holes in the
house floors. These specimens are of value for determining the type
of vegetation in the area hundred of years ago and possibly may
furnish information for dating purposes.

Most of the remains in this district belong to the Upper Republican
culture, so named because the first of the type studied and defined
were located in the Republican River drainage of southern Nebraska.
It is not possible at this time to correlate them with any of the known
tribes, such as the Dakota, Pawnee, or Comanche, but this may be
done later. Remains of this culture are believed to date from ca.
A. D. 1200 to 1500. A few of the sites appear to belong to what has
been called “Woodland” because of their close relationship to others
east of the Missouri. Tentative dating places it in the centuries
A. D. 500 to 1200. In addition there are traces of a primitive hunting
people who inhabited the area several millennia earlier. There is no
doubt that the work at Medicine Creek has added a large and im-
portant body of new data on the pre-Columbian inhabitants of western
Nebraska and from it an unusually complete picture of life in the
area should emerge. It seems evident that several long-held scientific
theories regarding those people and their relationship to their environ-
ment will need to be revised. The information from Medicine Creek
certainly will be one of the most significant contributions yet made to
the study of Plains prehistory.

The paleontological work, under T. E. White, while not as important
in some ways as the archeological investigations, is making a definite
contribution to geology. This is particularly true in the Wind River
Basin in Wyoming where data collected by the River Basin Surveys
field party has aided in the identification of younger beds than pre-
viously had been supposed to be present in the area. Furthermore, no
historical summary of paleontology in any of the river basins would
be complete without consideration of the fragments of fossil bones and
leaves frequently found by archeologists in Indian sites. These ob-
jects probably were collected as curiosities, although they occasionally
were used as ornaments and sometimes attempts were made to work
silicified bones into implements. While not of great significance to
paleontology, they are a part of the story, and study of the material
is helpful. Thus far 94 reservoir areas in the Missouri Basin have been
examined either briefly or in some detail, and specimens have been
collected from some 68. In a number of cases this material has helped
to clarify understanding of the area and will provide useful data for
future reference.

As during the previous year, Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, on detail to the
River Basin Surveys from the Division of Archeology, United States
SECRETARY'S REPORT val

National Museum, was in charge of the program. He prepared gen-
eral plans and coordinated all phases of the work, making numerous
trips of inspection to the areas where surveys and excavations were in
progress and supervising the work at Lincoln. He returned to his
official station at Washington on October 31, but during the fall and
winter months made regular monthly trips to Lincoln to check on the
work being done at the field headquarters and laboratory and to assist,
through advice and discussion, in the preparation of the reports on
the summer’s activities. He left Washington on May 26 for Lincoln
and on his arrival there resumed active direction of the program for
the field season.

J. Joseph Bauxar, archeologist, was at Chamberlain, S. Dak., at
the beginning of the fiscal year with the party, under the direction
of Paul L. Cooper, which was engaged in making a preliminary
reconnaissance of the west side of the Missouri River in the Fort
Randall Reservoir area. During the continuance of this work 82
sites were visited, and data on about 20 others were obtained from local
people. On July 19 test digging was initiated in some of the more
promising sites. The period from July 19 to August 20 was devoted
to the examination of burials at the Wheeler Bridge mound site.
These occurred in2 low mounds. At one of these there were 12 bundle
burials, and at the other 2, or possibly 3, of the same type. Inasmuch
as there were no funerary offerings accompanying any of the burials
and the material in the mounds was scarce, there was nothing to
indicate possible cultural relationship for these remains. On August
20 Mr. Bauxar shifted his operations to the Pease Creek site where
he opened an exploratory trench through a large refuse mound.
Two definite occupation levels were noted there, and a large quantity
of cultural material was recovered. The specimens suggest affiliation
with either Upper Republican or prehistoric Arikara peoples. On
September 17 investigations were started at another site which gave
indications of a well-defined occupation level. Two trenches were
dug at that location. They revealed a well-defined occupation level
which extended below the plow zone. This work was completed on
October 6, and attention was then turned to the Oldham site where two
subsurface circular house floors were uncovered. These presumably
belong to a late occupation which apparently was Arikara. Some
slight evidence of an earlier Woodland occupation was also noted.
A preliminary examination of all the data collected from the various
sites investigated indicates a range of cultural types extending back
from late historic Yankton through what possibly was early Arikara
and even earlier Woodland.

Mr. Bauxar returned to Lincoln on November 6 and from then
until April 4 was engaged in working up his material and in establish-
ing an ethnohistory file for the Missouri Basin to be used as a ready

817369—49——_6
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

reference by the staff in correlating archeological materials with those
of known tribes. The Thwaites and Biddle editions of the Lewis and
Clark journals and the Ordway journal were the sources examined
for the desired information. A total of approximately 1,500 items
pertaining to tribal locations, contacts, material culture, and other
features were extracted from these journals. When this material has
been prepared for filing under tribal and subject-matter headings, it
probably will fill some 15,000 index cards.

From April 4 to June 26 Mr. Bauxar was on special assignment to
the National Park Service for the purpose of conducting historical
investigations at the Homestead National Monument in Gage County,
Nebr. Five limited areas were examined, and a report on the excava-
tions was prepared and submitted to the National Park Service,
Region Two Office, at Omaha. Upon the completion of this detail
Mr. Bauxar returned to the Lincoln headquarters and resumed his
work on the ethnohistory project.

On July 1 Wesley L. Bliss, archeologist, was working with the
field party under his direction at the Glendo Reservoir project in
Platte County, Wyo. The survey of this area, started in the month of
June, was completed on July 2, and having located a total of 43 sites
the party moved the following day to Boysen Reservoir, in Fremont
County, where further investigations were carried on until July 26.
During this period tests were made in Birdshead Cave in the Owl
Creek Mountains about 5 miles west of the dam site. This cave
showed six levels of occupation, and prospects for obtaining interest-
ing information about the aboriginal inhabitants of the area were so
promising that plans were made to return to it later in the season.
On July 27 the party moved to the Oregon Basin project in Park
County where it continued reconnaissance work, locating additional
sites which increased the total for the basin to 28, and did some test
digging in two rock shelters. August 11 it moved to the Canyon
Ferry Reservoir near Helena, Mont. Investigations there added to
the number of sites located during the preliminary examination of
the area in 1946, making a total of 31. The work there was completed
on August 26, and attention was turned to the proposed Tiber Reser-
voir near Shelby, Mont., where work continued until September 9.
During this period Mr. Bliss and his party spent 4 days traveling by
boat in order to locate and examine sites exposed along the river-cut
terraces. These sites could not be reached by land and were not
visited during the preliminary reconnaissance made the previous year.
Additional sites located bring the total for Tiber to 53. Leaving this
area, Mr. Bliss returned to the Boysen Reservoir and from September
11 to November 6 completed excavation of the Birdshead Cave and
did some test digging in other sites. He returned to Lincoln on No-
vember 8 and from then until the end of the fiscal year was engaged
SECRETARY’S REPORT 73

in laboratory work and the preparation of supplementary reports
on the Glendo, Boysen, and Canyon Ferry projects. He also wrote
a “Summary Report on the Archeology of the Wyoming-Montana
River Basin Surveys of 1947—with Comments on Smokey Hill and
Republican River Sub-basins in Kansas and Nebraska.” Mr. Bliss
presented two papers at the Fifth Conference for Plains Archeology
in November. One of these summarized the results of the archeologi-
cal surveys in Wyoming and Montana and the other discussed the
subject of Early Man in the northwest Plains. Mr. Bliss also attended
the joint meeting of the American Anthropological Association and
the Society for American Archeology at Albuquerque, N. Mex., in
December, and presented a paper dealing with archeological problems
in the western Plains.

As previously stated, Paul L. Cooper was in charge of a survey party
which at the beginning of the fiscal year was operating in the Fort
Randall Reservoir area in South Dakota. On July 12 and 13 Mr.
Cooper attended a field conference of workers in upper Missouri River
archeology at Bismarck, N. Dak., and from there he accompanied Dr.
Waldo R. Wedel, field director of the River Basin Surveys, and Dr.
Jesse D. Jennings, National Park Service archeologist, on an inspec-
tion trip to a site which was being excavated by the University of
North Dakota near Fort Yates, N. Dak. From there he returned to
Lincoln and until August 4 worked on a preliminary report on the
archeological resources of the Fort Randall Reservoir. On August 6,
after conferring for 2 days with personnel of the Corps of Engineers
in Omaha and with the Director of the University of South Dakota
Museum at Vermillion, Mr. Cooper returned to the Fort Randall field
unit which had been under the direction of Mr. Bauxar during his
absence. From then until October 28 he remained with the field party
and participated in the investigations already discussed in connection
with Mr. Bauxar’s activities. He then returned to Lincoln to take
charge of the field headquarters upon the departure of Dr. Wedel for
Washington.

Mr. Cooper continued this supervision, which was both technical
and administrative, throughout the fall and winter months during the
periods when Dr. Wedel was in Washington. He made several trips
to Omaha and Denver for the purpose of consulting with officials of
the National Park Service, the Corps of Engineers, and the Bureau of
Reclamation. As time permitted, the data collected during the field
season were summarized preparatory to the writing of technical re-
ports, and preliminary reports were prepared on certain phases of the
field work. He also participated in the Fifth Conference for Plains
Archeology, presenting a paper summarizing the field work and dis-
cussing pottery types found in certain districts in the Plains area. In
May Mr. Cooper represented the Missouri Basin project of the River
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

Basin Surveys at the annual session of the Nebraska Academy of Sci-
ences and read a paper explaining and summarizing the activities of
the Surveys. On June 3 Mr. Cooper left Lincoln for North Dakota.
Two days were spent en route in conferring with personnel at the
University of South Dakota Museum. Arriving at the Heart Butte
Reservoir project on the Park River in North Dakota, Mr. Cooper
initiated reconnaissance work and started some test excavations in
a site not far above the location for the dam. These investigations
were in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

Robert B. Cumming, Jr., archeologist, continued to serve as the
laboratory supervisor at the Lincoln headquarters. He planned and
directed the procedures for processing specimens, photographic nega-
tives and prints, the preparation of maps and diagrams for the reports,
the typing of manuscripts and cutting of stencils, and the general
maintenance of equipment. During the course of the year 37,406 speci-
mens were cleaned, repaired if necessary, numbered, cataloged, and
stored. Since the beginning of the project 59,306 specimens have been
processed. Over 830 photographic negatives and their prints were
added to the files, bringing the total to 1,256. Approximately 100
kodachrome positives were cataloged, making 179 now available for
use in illustrating talks about the program. During the year Mr.
Cumming established a file for photographic enlargements suitable
for publicity purposes and one for lantern slides. Reference maps
and aerial photographs were indexed and filed, 835 of the former and
277 of the latter now being available for use by the staff. In addition
Mr. Cumming assisted in and supervised the mimeographing and
assembling of reports issued during the year. These consisted of 10
preliminary archeological reports, 5 supplementary archeological
reports, and 2 paleontological reports. He also carried on the project
inventory and requisitioning of supplies throughout the year. During
such times as the field director and acting director were away from
Lincoln he was in charge of the field office.

From July 1 to November 7, Jack T. Hughes, archeologist, assisted
Wesley L. Bliss in Wyoming and Montana, where he participated in
reconnaissance and survey of several reservoir basins. From Novem-
ber 8 to May 30 he worked in the office at Lincoln where he aided in
the preparation of various reports on the field work of the 1947
season. He wrote two reports entitled “Supplementary Appraisal of
the Archeological Resources of Oregon Basin Reservoir, Park County,
Wyoming” and “Supplementary Appraisal of the Archeological Re-
sources of Tiber Reservoir, Toole and Liberty Counties, Montana.”
He also prepared the following section of a report entitled “Archeology
of Birdshead Cave, Fremont County, Wyoming”: Introduction, site,
locale, occupation, and complexes, as well as parts of those on remains
SECRETARY'S REPORT 75

and conclusions. During this period Mr. Hughes also devoted some of
his time to an analysis of the archeological materials in the collection
of the Nebraska State Historical Society from the Barn Butte site on
the North Platte River in Garden County, Nebr., in the preparation of
a report on this site; the preparation of a table showing proposed
correlations of geological, climatological, and archeological events
at several selected sites in the western United States; and in the prepa-
ration of a report on stonework terminology for the Nomenclature
Committee of the Conference for Plains Archeology.

Mr. Hughes left Lincoln on June 1 for the Angostura Reservoir
in South Dakota where, with J. M. Shippee, field assistant, he began
a reconnaissance and intensive survey of the area to be flooded. This
work was in progress at the close of the year.

At the start of the fiscal year, Marvin F. Kivett, archeologist, was
in charge of a party engaged in an archeological reconnaissance of
the proposed Garrison Reservoir in northwest North Dakota. This
reconnaissance included surface survey and limited test excavations in
a number of the more important of the 70-odd known sites located in
and adjacent to the reservoir. These sites include permanent earth-
lodge villages, buried occupational zones, burial locations, and
numerous tipi-ring groups. The reconnaissance was terminated at
Garrison on August 20, and the party transferred its attention to
the Baldhill Reservoir on the Sheyenne River, where a brief recon-
naissance was carried on from August 22 to August 28. This resulted
in the location of 10 archeological sites, 7 of which were occupational
areas and 8 were mound groups. All the occupational sites yielded
some pottery, while one mound tested yielded four disarticulated
burials. The party returned to the River Basin Surveys Laboratory
in Lincoln on August 29.

On September 5 Mr. Kivett went to the Medicine Creek Reservoir,
Frontier County, Nebr., to do some test digging at several previously
located sites. Four pit-house floors, located in two village sites at-
tributable to a variant of the Upper Republican complex, were ex-
cavated, and an occupational area located on a low terrace near the
mouth of Lime Creek was tested by means of trenches. The latter
site presumably is a variant of the Woodland pattern. This work was
terminated on November 9 because of inclement weather, and Mr.
Kivett returned to Lincoln.

During the period November 10 to March 27 Mr. Kivett prepared
preliminary archeological reports for the Baldhill and Garrison Reser-
voirs in North Dakota, and the proposed Davis Creek Reservoir in
Nebraska. He also worked on a technical paper dealing with a shell-
bead ossuary excavated during the fall of 1946 on Prairie Dog Creek,
Phillips County, Kans., near the upper limits of the Harlan County
Reservoir.
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

On March 28 Mr. Kivett returned to the Medicine Creek Reservoir
to begin an extensive excavation program. During the period March
29 to June 30, three village sites on or near the dam axis were excavated,
and digging was started at the remains of a fourth village a short
distance above the dam in the reservoir basin. This work included
the uncovering of 25 house floors, the recovery of 2 burials, and ex-
tensive excavations in midden areas associated with the house floors.
Power machinery, furnished by the Bureau of Reclamation, was used
primarily for removing the sterile overburden covering most of the
area, for the removal of refuse dirt, and for digging exploratory test
trenches. ‘The bulk of the materials recovered appear to be attribut-
able to the Upper Republican aspect. At the close of the fiscal year
the work was continuing, with attention being directed toward a series
of small sites on the right bank of the reservoir basin approximately
1 mile above the dam axis.

George Metcalf was appointed field assistant on September 25 and
proceeded immediately to the Medicine Creek Reservoir where he
joined Marvin ¥. Kivett in the excavation being conducted there.
He returned to Lincoln on November 9 and from then until March
28, when he again went to Medicine Creek, he devoted his time to
classifying, studying, and writing a technical paper on the specimens
collected during the field work. This report included not only the
material obtained by the River Basin Surveys party, but also that
secured by a group from the Nebraska State Historical Society which
had excavated several house sites in the area during the summer.
Mr. Metcalf’s manuscript will be incorporated into the major report
on the Medicine Creek investigations. On June 30 he was in charge
of a portion of the work at Medicine Creek.

J. M. Shippee, field assistant, was with the Bliss party from July
1 to November 8. After his return to Lincoln he devoted the time
in the laboratory to work on the specimens from Birdshead Cave, the
sorting and classifying of artifacts from other localities, and the prep-
aration of maps. He left Lincoln on June 1 with the Hughes party
and was participating in the surveys at Angostura Reservoir at the
end of the year.

Dr. Theodore E. White, paleontologist, was occupied in paleontolog-
ical reconnaissance from July 1 to September 19. In the course of
this work he visited 7 reservoir areas in Nebraska, 23 in Wyoming, and
25 in Montana. This phase of his investigations was interrupted
from August 21 to September 11 while he dug the skull and several
vertebrae of a dinosaur from the Jurassic Morrison beds in the Middle
Fork Reservoir area in northeastern Wyoming. Dr. White returned
to the Lincoln office on September 20 and spent the time until Octo-
ber 8 preparing preliminary reports on the reservoir projects exam-
ined during the summer. He then left for the Rocky Ford and Philip
SECRETARY’S REPORT Ti

Reservoir areas in South Dakota and from there proceeded to the
Boysen Reservoir in Wyoming where he initiated a survey of the area
to be inundated by that project. While in the Boysen Basin he col-
lected a number of specimens of fossil mammals and a large soft-
shelled turtle. He returned to Lincoln November 7 and from then
until January 6 devoted his time to writing reports and consulting
geological literature for information bearing on the reservoir areas.

Leaving Lincoln, Dr. White went to Texas where, from January 9
to 29, he made a paleontological reconnaissance of the Whitney Reser-
voir basin on the upper Brazos River. From there he returned to
Washington, D. C., and from February 2 to May 15 worked in the
United States National Museum identifying osteological material ob-
tained from archeological sites, examining specimens, consulting geo-
logical literature relative to the reservoir areas in the Missouri Basin
and Texas, and preparing reports. He then went to the Lincoln office
and devoted the period from May 18 to June 1 making preparations
for the summer’s field activities. He left Lincoln on June 1 for the
Boysen Reservoir where he resumed the investigations interrupted by
the onset of bad weather the previous autumn. From June 4 to June
30 he collected a number of specimens of fossil mammals and reptiles
and made extensive notes on the structure and stratigraphy of the
area.

A number of student assistants were employed during the year as
members of the various field parties. Robert L. Hall and Warren
Wittry were with the Cooper party in South Dakota from July 1 to
September 10, when they returned to college. Both men again joined
Mr. Cooper on June 22 and were working with him at the Heart Butte
Reservoir at the end of the fiscal year. Gordon F. McKenzie, John
L. Essex, and Leo L. Stewart were with Marvin F. Kivett at the
Garrison and Baldhill Reservoir projects in North Dakota at the be-
ginning of the fiscal year. Mr. Stewart left the party on August 20, and
Mr. Essex and Mr. McKenzie terminated their employment on August
30 following the return to the Lincoln headquarters. H. G. Pierce was
with the Bliss party in Wyoming and Montana from July 1 to Sep-
tember 10. John C. Donohoe assisted Dr. Theodore E. White from
July 1 to September and again joined him on June 14 for work in the
Boysen Reservoir. Ernest Lundelius joined the staff on June 1 and left
Lincoln with Dr. White when he started for Wyoming. Both he and
Mr. Donohoe were with the White party at the close of the year.

Pacifie Coast area—During the fiscal year the River Basin Surveys
project in the Pacific Coast region carried out investigations of the
archeological and paleontological resources in 14 reservoir areas in
the Columbia Basin, and in 7 reservoir areas in central California.
The results of this work were described in reports prepared for mim-
eographing and limited distribution. A total of 180 sites were found
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

in the Columbia Basin reservoirs, including sites of major and minor
importance, and a total of 80 in those in California.

Dr. Philip Drucker, detailed from the regular staff of the Bureau
to serve as field director, was in charge of activities in thisarea. Dur-
ing the period from July 1 to September 30 he made field headquarters
at Eugene, Oreg., utilizing office space made available to the Surveys
by the Department of Anthropology of the University of Oregon. He
divided his time about equally between the Eugene office, where he
planned the survey work and carried out the routine necessary for its
operation, and the field, where he at times accompanied the survey par-
ties, and checked on the results of their investigations. At the end of
September he departed for Washington, D. C., having closed the field
headquarters for the winter. In Washington he prepared the reports
previously mentioned on the basis of the data collected by the field
parties, in addition to his activities as a member of the staff of the Bu-
reau of American Ethnology.

On May 13 he left Washington for the Pacific Coast, stopping en
route at Milwaukee, Wis., for the purpose of conferring with the
Committee for the Recovery of Archeological Remains which met
in that city on the 14th and of participating in a symposium on the
River Basin Surveys program. He arrived at Portland, Oreg., where
he conferred with the officials of the Columbia Basin Recreational
Survey Office concerning the status of various reservation projects
of the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers in the
Columbia Basin. On May 18 he arrived in Eugene, Oreg., where he
completed arrangements for office and laboratory space at the De-
partment of Anthropology of the University of Oregon. From May
20 to 28 he conferred with officials of the Region Four Office of the
National Park Service at San Francisco on plans for the field season,
and also with representatives of the departments of anthropology at
the University of California, Berkeley, University of California at
Los Angeles, and the University of Washington. As the result of
these conferences, arrangements were made for two cooperative pro-
grams of research. The Department of Anthropology of the Univer-
sity of Washington arranged to put a party in the field under the direc-
tion of a member of the River Basin Surveys staff, to make an intensive
survey and preliminary testing of the Potholes (O’Sullivan) Reservoir
area in eastern Washington. The corresponding department at the
University of California arranged to undertake investigations during
the latter part of the summer in reservoirs in the upper San Joaquin
drainage that had previously been examined by the survey.

During the month of June Dr. Drucker was occupied with planning
the itineraries of survey field parties and obtaining the necessary per-
sonnel and equipment for them. On June 28 the parties were as-
sembled, given the necessary instructions, and sent into the field. At
SECRETARY'S REPORT 79

the close of the fiscal year Dr. Drucker was at the field headquarters
in Eugene.

Franklin Fenega and Clarence E. Smith, archeologists, had just
commenced their field work at the beginning of the fiscal year. During
the month of July they investigated three reservoir areas in the
Willamette River drainage, the Detroit, Dorena, and Meridian, in
Oregon. From there they proceeded to the site of the McNary Reser-
voir on the Columbia River just upstream from Umatilla, Oreg., and
Plymouth, Wash., where they continued investigations for the re-
mainder of the summer. All these reservoirs are Corps of Engineers
projects. McNary Reservoir they found to be extremely rich in archeo-
logical remains, and after the preliminary reconnaissance survey had
been completed on August 20, they carried out an intensive survey to
establish which of the many sites found would most fruitfully reward
excavation. On the basis of their intensive survey it was possible
to make recommendations for the excavation of five groups of sites.
On completion of the field work they summarized their field data, and
submitted a preliminary report. Mr. Fenega resigned from the River
Basin Surveys on September 22 in order to return to his academic
work at the University of California. Mr. Smith was transferred to
temporary headquarters at Berkeley, Calif., on the 22d, and carried
out surveys at the following reservoirs in California: Dry Creek,
Monticello, Kelsey Creek, Indian Valley, Sly Park, and Wilson Valley.
On December 17 he resigned from the Surveys to resume academic
work at the University of California.

Richard D. Daugherty, archeologist, and Francis A. Riddell, field
assistant, were also just starting field work at the beginning of the
fiscal year. During the remainder of the field season they examined
the following reservoir areas: Cascade, Smith’s Ferry, Scrivers Creek,
Garden Valley in Idaho; Equalizing, Long Lake, and Potholes (O’Sul-
livan) in Washington; Anderson Ranch and Palisades in Idaho; and
Hungry Horse in Montana; all projects of the Bureau of Reclamation.
The greatest wealth of archeological remains they found to occur in
the Bureau of Reclamation’s Columbia Basin project, comprising
Equalizing, Long Lake, and Potholes (O’Sullivan) Reservoirs. Both
men resigned from the River Basin Surveys staff on September 24,
having completed the preliminary reports on their field investiga-
tions for the season. On June 15, Mr. Daugherty was reappointed to
the River Basin Surveys staff and was put in charge of the coopera-
tive project arranged with the Department of Anthropology of the
University of Washington. On June 19 he departed for the field
with his crew and established a field camp in the Moses Lake area.
At the end of the fiscal year he was still in the field in that location,
Mr. Riddell was reappointed to the River Basin Surveys staff as field
assistant on July 28 and departed with other members of the survey
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

crew to begin an investigation at Benham Falls Reservoir in eastern
Oregon.

George L. Coale, archeologist, Harry S. Riddell, Jr., field assistant,
and Douglas Osborne, field assistant, joined the staff of River Basin
Surveys on June 28 and proceeded to Benham Falls Reservoir to begin
the season’s survey work there.

Albert D. Mohr and William S. King, who had assisted Clarence
K. Smith during October and November, were employed by the River
Basin Surveys temporarily as field assistants during the period May
16-21 to carry out an investigation of the Mariposa Reservoir basin on
Mariposa Creek on the east side of the San Joaquin Valley in central
California. Only three small sites were located and none were rec-
ommended for further investigation.

Cooperating institutions.—State and local institutions have con-
tributed to the River Basin Surveys program in various ways. In
addition to furnishing space for field offices and laboratories as at the
University of Nebraska, the University of Texas, the University of
Denver, Western State College, the University of California, and the
University of Oregon, universities and local institutions in some cases
have joined forces with the Surveys for cooperative projects and in
others have taken over units in the survey program. As previously
mentioned, the excavation project at the O’Sullivan Reservoir in
Washington was a cooperative undertaking between the University of
Washington and the River Basin Surveys. This also was true for the
surveys in western Colorado where members of the Surveys staff
worked with field parties from Western State College at Gunnison.

During the year the University of Kentucky made surveys at the
Wolf Creek Reservoir on the Cumberland River, and at the Dewey
Reservoir on Johns Creek in the Big Sandy River drainage. In
addition, the University conducted excavations at the Wolf Creek
Reservoir and furnished the River Basin Surveys with a detailed
report on its activities. The University of Georgia established sur-
veys in the Chattahoochee and Flint River basins and did some ex-
cavation work in areas which will be inundated. The Alabama Muse-
um of Natural History did reconnaissance work and some digging.
The Florida Park Service took over the survey of the area in Florida
which will be flooded by the construction of the Woodruff Dam on
the Apalachicola River near Chattahoochee. The University of Ten-
nessee made a survey of the Stewarts Ferry Reservoir basin on Stones
River and did preliminary reconnaissance at the Harpeth River proj-
ect. It also made arrangements for some salvage work at the Center
Hill Reservoir where the impounding of water began too soon for the
River Basin Surveys to do more than make a reconnaissance and rec-
ommend the excavation of certain sites. The University of Missouri,
in cooperation with the Missouri Archeological Society, made surveys
SECRETARY'S REPORT 81

in the Bull Shoals, Clearwater, Pomme de Terre, Joanna, Table Rock,
and Waco Reservoirs, and carried on excavations in key sites at Bull
Shoals and Clearwater. The University of Oklahoma did some exca-
vation work in a village site which will be flooded by the Fort Gibson
Reservoir on the Grand (Neosho) River. The University of Kansas
did survey work and started excavations at a village site in the Kanap-
olis River basin on the Smoky Hill River in Kansas. In Nebraska the
State Historical Society carried on excavations at archeological sites
in the Medicine Creek Reservoir area outside the Federally acquired
lands adding important supplemental information on remains beyond
the localities being worked by the River Basin Surveys. The Lab-
oratory of Anthropology of the University of Nebraska excavated in
two important sites in the Harlan County Reservoir area on the Re-
publican River in the southern part of the State. The University of
Nebraska State Museum carried on paleontological work near the
Medicine Creek Dam site and on Lime Creek, a tributary of Medicine
Creek, where important information was obtained on some of the earli-
est cultural remains thus far found in North America. The Museum
also collected paleontological material from the Harlan County Reser-
voir. The University of North Dakota, in cooperation with the
North Dakota Historical Society, carried on excavations at the Heart
Butte Reservoir, on the Heart River, in the summer of 1947, and at
the Baldhill Reservoir on the Sheyenne River beginning June 21,
1948. ‘The University of Colorado made a preliminary reconnais-
sance of the 8 reservoir areas comprising the Colorado-Big Thompson
project, while the University of Denver made brief surveys of 12 reser-
voir basins comprising the Blue-South Platte project. Western
State College of Colorado did preliminary work in nine reservoir
basins of the Gunnison-Arkansas project. The Museum of Northern
Arizona, at Flagstaff, assumed responsibility for surveys at the Alamo
project on Williams River in the western part of the State, but had
not started investigations at the end of the year. The Archeological
Surveys Association of Southern California, sponsored by a number
of museums in that area, completed surveys in eight proposed reservoir
and flood-control projects in that portion of the State. The Univer-
sity of California, at Berkeley, took over responsibility for the exca-
vation of key sites located by the River Basin Surveys in the Pine
Flat Reservoir on King’s River and in the Isabella Reservoir on Kern
River. Actual operations had not yet gotten under way, however,
by June 30.

Progress reports and completed reports prepared by the cooperat-
ing organizations are sent to the River Basin Surveys so that the
results of their investigations may be coordinated with the over-all
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

program. All the information obtained by these groups thus becomes
a part of the general record of the River Basin Surveys.

Bureau publications.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 83

ARCHIVES

Ever-increasing use is being made of the manuscript and photo-
graphic collections of the Bureau. Cards for the manuscript catalog,
compiled for publication, have been typed and assembled. Upon
completion of this project, a similar catalog of the photographic
negatives in the Bureau collection, was begun. Approximately 2,600
cards for this catalog were typed by the end of the fiscal year.

The Bureau also put into operation its new filing system of photo-
graphic prints, the first installment of 30 albums having been ac-
quired for prints from newly restored negatives. Each print is
labeled with information pertinent to the subject. Full biographical
data is furnished where possible in the case of portraits, so that the
information is easily accessible to inquirers. At the close of the fiscal
year, approximately 200 new file prints have been thus filed. Prints
for the duplicate reserve file also have been labeled and filed with
protecting paper between the prints. Requests for pay orders ex-
ceeded 300 prints during the year.

Up to July 1, 1948, 200 restorations of old negatives were com-
pleted. This necessitated the making of 200 11- by 14-inch enlarge-
ments, 200 mountings, 200 8- by 10-inch negatives, and 600 8- by
10-inch file prints. In addition to the restoration program, the Bureau
photographer filled requisitions for 53 negatives, 988 prints, and 807
enlargements.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sir: [ have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended June
80, 1948.

The Smithsonian Institution is the official United States agency for
the exchange with other nations of governmental, scientific, and
literary publications, This exchange is carried on throughout the
world under various conventions, treaties, and other international
agreements.

The number of packages received for transmission during the year
was 760,119, an increase over the previous year of 56,321. The weight
of these packages was 812,189 pounds, an increase of 38,214 pounds.
The average weight of the individual package is approximately 1
pound, 1 ounce, as compared with the average of the previous year of
1 pound, 2 ounces—an indication that the institutions are shipping
less of the material that was held during the war. The material re-
ceived from both foreign and domestic sources for distribution is
classified as shown in the following table:

The packages are forwarded partly by mail direct to the addressees
and partly by freight to the foreign exchange bureaus. The number
of boxes shipped to the foreign exchange bureaus was 3,107, an in-
crease of 529. Of the boxes shipped 533 were for depositories of full
sets of the United States Government documents furnished in ex-
change for the official publications of foreign governments for deposit

85
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

in the Library of Congress. The number of packages forwarded by
mail was 197,355.

The first shipments of exchange publications to the Japanese Ex-
change Bureau, under the jurisdiction of the National Library of
Japan (the former Imperial Library), were made during the year.

In spite of the fact that considerable savings in transportation cost
were effected by exporting from Baltimore instead of New York, and
in spite of the advantage gained through special arrangements for
shipments to Germany, the allotment for transportation was practi-
cally exhausted by the end of March 1948. Therefore, it was necessary
to curtail shipments sharply during the last 3 months of the fiscal year
1948, which resulted in a backlog at the end of the year of approxi-
mately 225,000 pounds.

Consignments are now forwarded to all countries except Rumania,
with which country negotiations were continued through diplomatic
channels to effect the resumption of normal exchange relations.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received by
the Exchange Service to be sent abroad in return for the official publica-
tions sent by foreign governments for deposit in the Library of Con-
gress is 94 (57 full and 387 partial sets). The Bulgarian Bibliograph-
ical Institute has been added to the list as the official depository of
Bulgaria.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1948.

An appropriation of $455,400 for the operations of the Zoo was
provided in the District of Columbia appropriation act. Subject to
minor changes in final bills, a total of $441,200 was expended for all
purposes, and an unexpended balance of $14,200 remains. This saving
was almost entirely from salaries because of the impossibility of filling
positions promptly.

The year was a very satisfactory one. Animals of exceptional
interest were received; fair progress was made in recruiting the
organization, although it still is not fully manned; and some repair
work was accomplished.

Minor improvements included the construction of 1,200 linear feet
of concrete copings and 12,000 square feet of bituminous concrete
sidewalks around some of the animal exhibits and adjacent to road-
ways; surfacing 4,800 square yards of parking area near the Harvard
Street entrance and a short length of service road with penetrating
oil and slag covering; constructing and placing 48 park benches made
with concrete legs and wood slats.

Chemical fighting of poison ivy was continued with good success.
Supplies of building maintenance material which had become badly
depleted were somewhat replenished, and some construction, repair,
and maintenance equipment was obtained. As a whole the physical
condition of the establishment has been improved by concentrating on
the places that were most in need of attention.

The National Zoological Park renders a variety of services to the
American public. Besides the public exhibits of nearly 2,800 animals
and the providing of an attractive recreation area, opportunities are
offered for students of biology, particularly vertebrate zoology, as
well as for artists, photographers, writers, and research workers—
provided the method of research does not endanger the welfare of the
animals or of the public. Other direct services are answering in per-
son, by phone, mail, and telegraph, questions regarding animals,
their care and transportation; the furnishing of information to other

93
94 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

zoos and private and public agencies regarding structures for keep-
ing and housing animals; cooperation with other agencies of the
Federal, State, and Municipal governments in research work.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

The two chief needs of the Zoo are: 1, sufficient funds for a minor
increase in personnel and to provide for proper care of the animals and
the maintenance of the establishment in a presentable condition; 2,
new buildings to replace antiquated structures that have long since
ceased to be suitable for the purpose, presentable, or even safe for use.
The more urgently needed buildings are: (1) a new administration
building to replace the 143-year-old historic landmark now in use for
an office building for the Zoo, but which is neither suitably located nor
well-adapted for the purpose. This building is in an excellent loca-
tion for a public recreational structure and could probably be rehabili-
tated and used for recreational purposes, perhaps as a children’s mu-
seum, and thus maintained asa historic building. The new office build-
ing should be better located both from the standpoint of accessibility
to the public and convenience for the administration of the Zoo; (2)
a new building to house antelopes and other medium-size hoofed ani-
mals that require a heated building.

VISITORS

It had been anticipated that after the war the fluctuation in at-
tendance during the week would again be pronounced. It has there-
fore been surprising to note that attendance on early days of the week
has been relatively high, and the peak attendance of the week ends
has been less pronounced than before the war. This is probably due
to continued high employment in the Washington area and to increase
in travel accompanying the general economic prosperity.

The total attendance was 3,040,540, an increase in 309,862 over the
previous year and the second largest year’s attendance the Zoo has
ever had.

About 2 p. m. each day the cars then parked in the Zoo are counted
by the Zoo police and listed according to the State, Territory, or
country from which they came. This is, of course, not a census of the
cars coming to the Zoo but is valuable in showing the percentage of
attendance by States of people in private automobiles. The tabula-
tion for the fiscal year 1948 is as follows:

The cars that made up the remaining 11.24 percent came from every
one of the remaining States, as well as from Alaska, Alberta, British
Columbia, Canal Zone, Cuba, Great Britain, Hawaii, Manitoba, Mex-
ico, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Panama, Philippine Is-
lands, Puerto Rico, Quebec, Saskatchewan.

It is well known that District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia
cars bring to the Zoo many people from other parts of the United
States and of the world, but no figures are available on which to base
percentages.

THE EXHIBITS

Animals for the collection are acquired by gift, deposit, purchase,
exchange, births and hatchings, and are removed by return of speci-
mens on deposit, exchange, or death. Although depositors are at lib-
erty to remove the specimens that they place in the Zoo, many leave the
specimens for the rest of their lives.

The animal collection has been definitely improved during the year.
The total number of specimens on hand June 30, 1948, was 2,797, or
210 less than a year ago, but the collection as a whole is more valuable
because of the addition of a number of rare animals.

ACQUISITION OF SPECIMENS

Air transportation of specimens of moderate weight but of unusual
interest has brought to the Zoo some of the outstanding exhibits of
the year, including the collection of tarsiers, cloud rats, tree shrews,
monkey-eating eagle, and other specimens brought from the Philip-
pines by Charles Wharton. The National Geographic Society sent
by air from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, to Washington a pichi ciego mayor
(Burmeisteria retusa), a small, very peculiar type of armadillo, which
is a great rarity in collections. It was alive when it arrived in Miami,
Fla., but unfortunately died before it reached Washington. However,
the National Museum gained a valuable specimen and some of the
Washington biologists had their first glimpse of the remarkable little
creature. This may be the first one to have arrived alive in the United
States.

The outstanding animals received during the year were:

4 King penguins. 1 Arctie fox.
28 Mindanao tarsiers. 2 Snow buntings.
9 Philippine tree shrews. 104 Elepbant shrews. These were
7 Bushy-tailed cloud rats. brought to the United States
1 Monkey-eating eagle. from East Africa by the Medical
3 Coconut crabs. Division of the United States
1 Sitatunga. Navy for studies of tropical dis-
6 Giant racquet-tailed drongos. eases, and were quartered at the
8 Emperor penguins. Zoo until the Navy could provide
4 Adelie penguins. quarters for them.

As in any colony of living things, there is a steady turn-over, so
that the exhibits are constantly changing. Thus, the inventory list of
specimens in the collection on June 80 of each year does not show all
the kinds of animals that were exhibited during the year; sometimes
creatures of outstanding interest at the time they were shown are no
longer in the collection at the time the list is prepared.

APPENDIX 8
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1948:

The Observatory organization comprises the office of the Director
(which includes three shops for the preparation of equipment: the
wood, glass, and metal shops) and two research divisions: (1) the
Division of Astrophysical Research and (2) the Division of Radiation
and Organisms.

In September 1947 W. H. Hoover was promoted to be Chief of the
Division of Astrophysical Research. Mr. Hoover has been a member
of the Observatory staff since 1923. It is a sad duty to record the
death on December 17, 1947, of Dr. Earl S. Johnston, Chief of the
Division of Radiation and Organisms. Dr. Johnston joined the divi-
sion at its beginning in 1929 and was responsible for a large portion
of its development in recent years. Before the close of the fiscal year
the Observatory was fortunate in completing arrangements to have
Dr. Robert B. Withrow, of Purdue University, succeed Dr. Johnston
as Chief of the Division, beginning September 1, 1948. During the year
Dr. R. L. Weintraub, biochemist, and L. B. Clark, expert glass blower
and technologist, transferred to National Defense agencies.

(1) DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

The year may be characterized as one of exploration and develop-
ment since considerable effort was expended in search for a suitable
high-altitude site for a third solar station, and in planning and pre-
paring new equipment. It is proposed at the new station not only
to conduct routine solar-constant observations, but also to test new
electronic equipment and to conduct special researches. One project
planned is a day-to-day study of changes in the infrared band of ozone
at 9 microns wave length. For this work a special double spectroscope
designed by Dr. Abbot, research associate, is being constructed by the
Gaertner Scientific Corporation. New mirrors, aluminized and coated
with magnesium fluoride, for both coelostat and spectrobolometer are
on order. A fused-quartz prism, very free of bubbles, has been com-
pleted, also a new vacuum bolometer. The bolometer, planned and
built by L. B. Clark, is so designed that the vacuum around the bolom-

121
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

eter strips will not deteriorate with time. Preliminary tests show
it to be about three times as sensitive as the bolometers we are currently
using.

Work at Washington —The observations and computations from
the Montezuma and Table Mountain field stations were carefully
checked and appraised. Results for the calendar year 1947 were tabu-
lated in the form given in table 24 of volume 6 of the Annals of the
Astrophysical Observatory.

Arrangements were completed for the preparation of new and com-
pletely revised editions of the Smithsonian Meteorological Tables and
the Smithsonian Physical Tables. Work on the Meteorological Tables
is now in progress under the editorship of R. J. List, of the United
States Weather Bureau. The Physical Tables will be edited beginning
September 1, 1948, by Dr. William E. Forsythe, formerly of the Nela
Research Laboratories, Cleveland, Ohio.

The sun and sky radiation studies at Camp Lee, Va., under contract
with the Office of the Quartermaster General, were terminated on
January 1, 1947, at the completion of 2 full years of observations.
These observations included continuous records of the total sun and
sky radiation, and of the relative energy in the ultraviolet, visible,
and infrared portions of the spectrum, as received on a horizontal sur-
face, on a plane 45° to the east, and on a plane 45° to the south. Part
of the instrumental equipment was left at Camp Lee, and observations
are being continued there under the sponsorship of the Camp Lee
Quartermaster Board. <A total of 16 reports were submitted to the
Office of the Quartermaster General, summarizing the Smithsonian
observations.

Under an extension of the contract with the Office of the Quarter-
master General, equipment for radiation measurements similar to
those made at Camp Lee was prepared for the temporary sea-level sta-
tion (Miami, Fla.), and for the high-altitude, dry station at Monte-
zuma, Chile. These preparations were under the direction of Mr.
Hoover, chief of the division. One difficulty encountered in the Camp
Lee work was the great amount of time required to read and sum up the
many daily records, and special efforts were made to devise an auto-
matic integrator. Mr. Hoover succeeded in working out the details of
such a device, and three were built by the instrument maker, Mr. Tal-
bert. The device is now in successful operation at the Miami station.
It separately sums up the reading of four different recording pyrheli-
ometers as registered on a four-point Brown electronic potentiometer.
By simply taking the readings on each of four counters, the total radia-
tion received by each of the four pyrheliometers is obtained. The re-
sults have repeatedly been checked against a complete reading of the
record, and the integrator has proved surprisingly accurate.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 123

Dr. Abbot, research associate of the Observatory, has made further
contributions in his studies of relationships between solar changes and
weather (see list of publications below). Mr. Hildt, mentioned in
last year’s report as assisting Dr. Arctowski in his researches concerned
with the solar and terrestrial atmospheres, found it necessary to end
this work on October 1, 1947. Miss Joyce Wilson substituted for Mr.
Hildt for the remainder of the fiscal year.

Work in the field.—Regular observations for the determination of
the solar constant were continued throughout the year at two high-
altitude stations, Montezuma, Chile (9,000 ft.) and Table Mountain,
Calif. (7,500 ft.). In addition, at Montezuma preparations were made
for exposures of certain textiles and observations of the amount and
quality of sun and sky light, similar to the work now in progress at the
Miami station. However, unexpected delay was encountered in the
transfer of part of the equipment to Montezuma, so that these ex-
posures and observations had not yet been started at the close of the
fiscal year.

As stated in last year’s report, a cooperative program was arranged
between the General Motors Corp., the Quartermaster Department,
and the Smithsonian Institution for exposures and radiatiton measure-
ments to be carried out at the General Motors Test Field at Miami,
Fla. The program also included the mounting and servicing of the
panels and filter boxes by the South Florida Test Service, under the
direction of E. M. DeNoon. In November 1947, panel exposures both
in the open and under filters, at an angle of 45° to the south, were
begun at Miami. The measuring instruments and the filters are
similar to those used at Camp Lee, Va. In addition, the spectrobo-
lometer formerly at the Tyrone, N. Mex., station has been mounted and
adjusted. Whenever the sky is sufficiently clear of clouds, bolographs
are taken just as in our usual solar-constant program. From these
bolographs we obtain valuable data concerning sea-level water-vapor
conditions, as well as additional data on the relative distribution of
energy throughout the spectrum as received from direct sunlight. The
complete program was started in December 1947.

In July 1947 the Director began a tcur in search of the most promis-
ing high-altitude site to which to transfer the Miami spectrobolomet-
ric equipment at the conclusion of our sea-level observations. It was
thought that possibly somewhere in the high plateau region of
Mexico sufficiently cloudless and pure skies might be found. With
the cordial cooperation of the staff of the National Observatory of
Mexico, at Tacubaya, many records of sky conditions were examined
and several promising sites were visited. It is regretted that though
the climate was uniformly delightful and invigorating, none of these
sites proved to be sufficiently cloudless. Floating clouds are very
prevalent.
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

In September, while vacationing in Honolulu, the Director learned
of a site on the island of Hawaii where the annual rainfall is less than
10 inches and the skies described as remarkably clear. He visited that
location where, at an altitude of 6,500 ft., he found a road, abundant
water supply, electric power and telephone already installed, and skies
which may prove to be clear and uniform from day to day.

In October Dr. Abbot and A. F. Moore visited the region of southern
California near the Nevada border, including Clark Mountain (7,900
ft.), where the annual precipitation is 8 inches. They encountered
excellent skies in this region.

Since tests covering an extended period are the only safe criteria
for determining a satisfactory site for a solar station, Mr. Hoover in
May 1948 installed a recording Eppley pyrheliometer at each of the
three following promising sites: (1) Torreon, Coahuila, Mexico; (2)
Mountain Pass, Calif., near Clark Mountain; and (3) Pohakuola,
Island of Hawaii. The instruments are operated through the kind
cooperation of men living near the sites. The records for the month
of June 1948 indicate Clark Mountain as having the best skies thus far.

Dr. Abbot and the Director spent a month beginning August 10,
1947, at the Mount Wilson Observatory, Calif., having planned to
assist each other on two projects. One project was to redetermine the
Smithsonian standard scale of solar radiation. We reconditioned,
remounted, and adjusted our standard double water-flow pyrheli-
ometer, last used in 1934, and made a series of careful comparisons
between it and two substandard silver-disk pyrheliometers which we
had carried by hand from Washington. The mean of 33 comparisons
agrees within 1 part in 1,000 with the results of 1934 and 1932. This
confirms our belief that the scale of an individual silver-disk pyrheli-
ometer with ordinary care will remain unchanged over a long period
of years.

The second project was a continuation of Dr. Abbot’s previous work
to determine the energy spectra of some of the brighter stars, with the
aid of the 100-inch Mount Wilson telescope. Dr. Abbot’s sensitive
radiometer, now under excellent control, permitted actual measure-
ments on eight different stars at eight different wave lengths. Since
the percentage accidental error was rather large, only the general
forms of these curves were determined. Dr. Abbot has encouraging
plans for improvement in the measurements and he hopes to repeat
this project in the near future.

(2) DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS

Owing to the illness and death of the chief of the division, Dr. Earl
S. Johnston, and to changes in personnel, the research program in
progress at the beginning of the year was necessarily altered and
somewhat curtailed. Leonard Price, now the senior staff member of
SECRETARY’S REPORT 125

the division, has as far as possible arranged to bring current projects
to satisfactory completion and to undertake no new projects except
those of short duration.

Dr. Weintraub, after his transfer to a National Defense agency,
continued periodic visits to the division to complete certain phases
of his work. In these visits Mr. Price found his advice and aid of
much value in rounding out the current experimental work. The fol-
lowing summarizes the work accomplished :

Several years ago, Dr. McAlister developed in the division an in-
strument for measuring accurately and quickly by spectroscopic
means the carbon dioxide content of a volume of gas. Dr. Johnston
later made certain modifications and carefully tested the instrument.
Dr. Weintraub and Mr. Price subsequently used it in a study of the
effect of plant growth regulators on the respiration of potato tubers.
After the construction of a larger respiration chamber, a similar study
was started using broad-Jeaf plants. This project was nearly com-
pleted at the close of the year.

Two new thermostats, installed early in the year, aided greatly in
the control of environmental factors in germination studies using
lettuce seeds. The effects of temperature, light, composition of at-
mosphere, and composition of substrate have been studied individually
and in combination. Two phases of this study are completed and a
third nearly completed.

Considerable progress was made in studies of the developmental
physiology of grass seedlings. Growth curves for both mesocotyls
and coleoptiles of plants grown under various combinations of con-
trolled environmental conditions have been obtained. Plants grown
in various salt solutions have yielded information on cation and anion
effects. Salts show a retarding effect during initial germination
which is then followed by a period of extended growth beyond that
of plants grown in the absence of salts. The retardation and extended
growth periods are proportional, within limits, to the concentration
of the salt used. Several papers on these developmental physiology
studies are in preparation.

The histological study of the mesocotyl, which was undertaken to
explain the gross morphology effects of various environmental con-
ditions, was continued for only part of the year. Being a long-range
project, it was abandoned to permit the completion of other projects
that were further advanced. However, before this work was stopped
the cellular development of mesocotyls of etiolated corn seedlings had
been charted.

A report is in preparation on the study of the effects of various
fungicides on the germination and development of grass seedlings.
Experimentation for this problem has been completed.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL AIR MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Air Museum for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1948.

ESTABLISHMENT

Although the National Air Museum came into being as a new bureau
of the Smithsonian Institution on August 12, 1946, through the enact-
ment of Public Law 722, and an organizational and survey program
was inaugurated shortly thereafter, actual operations of the bureau
in its own right did not begin until August 1, 1947, one month after
the beginning of the fiscal year. On that date the authorized appro-
priation of $50,000 for National Air Museum purposes became avail-
able to the Institution.

Thereupon, and in accordance with a previously prepared plan of
operations, there was effected by administrative action the interbureau
transfer of the Institution’s aeronautical collection and the staff
charged with its care, from the United States National Museum to the
National Air Museum. As a matter of record the Smithsonian Insti-
tution has been gathering and safeguarding significant aeronautical
materials for over 70 years. At the time of the transfer this nucleus
for an air museum consisted of over 3,500 objects, comprising the most
valuable collection of its kind in the United States, or, in fact, in the
world. By this transfer the National Air Museum began its active
life with full responsibility for the proper operation of a “going” aero-
nautical museum. Until it has a building of its own, the Air Museum
has assigned for its use the metal hangar known as the Aircraft Build-
ing and, in addition, a certain amount of exhibition, office, and storage
space in the Arts and Industries Building of the National Museum.
The Air Museum will share, too, with its affiliates the various auxiliary
services of the Smithsonian Institution.

On completion of the transfer of the aeronautical collections, ad-
ministrative action was begun to provide the nucleus for an adequate
staff for the new bureau. By March 1948 a force of seven persons
(an addition of five to the original staff of two) was actively engaged
in the many ramifications of the bureau’s work.

127
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

Another matter given early attention in establishing the Air Mu-
seum was that of obtaining working quarters. These were provided
in the West-South Range of the Arts and Industries Building of the
National Museum and were available to the staff beginning June 15,
1948.

ADVISORY BOARD

Two meetings of the Air Museum’s Advisory Board were held dur-
ing the year, on August 19, 1947, and April 15, 1948, respectively. The
problems of major concern to the Board this year were the acquisition
of a storage depot for the temporary safekeeping of Air Museum ma-
terial, and the determination of a suitable land site and building for
the Air Museum. Both meetings of the Board centered largely on
these two problems.

Prior to the August meeting a careful study had been made by the
Air Museum’s staff and by Mr. Loening, Board member, of several pro-
posed storage depots. Asa result a recommendation was made to the
Board at the August meeting suggesting the selection of a part of the
Douglas aircraft plant built during World War IT and located on the
outskirts of Park Ridge, Ill., about 20 miles northwest of Chicago.
After due deliberation, including consideration of the fact that aero-
nautical museum material gathered by the United States Air Force
for the National Air Museum was stored in this plant, the Board
accepted the recommendation and by resolution directed that “the
Chairman plan the operations of the National Air Museum in such a
way that it will be prepared to take over and operate the storage facil-
ity at Park Ridge .. .”

In considering the problem of sites and a building for the Air
Museum (the planning of which was authorized by law establishing
the National Air Museum) the merits and advantages of various
locations in the Nation were fully considered at the August 1947
Board meeting. The discussion led to the unanimous adoption of a
resolution that “the National Air Museum should be located in Wash-
ington, and that search be made for sites which are to be submitted
to the Advisory Board for approval as to location and adequacy in
size.”

Regarding an appropriate building for the Air Museum, the Board
discussed at length the scope of the aeronautical collections to be
assembled, the quantity of full-size historical and irreplaceable air-
craft that merited consideration for a place in the future building,
and the many factors involved in the maintenance, exhibition, and
preservation of the collection. To further the study of the building
problem the Board at its August 1947 meeting directed the Chairman
to enlist the aid of the Public Buildings Administration of the Federal
SECRETARY'S REPORT 129

Works Agency and to submit a report at the next Board meeting.
Following a full and detailed discussion of this report, the Advisory
Board approved the basic study and building plan presented and in-
structed the Chairman to proceed with the building study to determine
costs.

PLANNING
STORAGE OF MUSEUM MATERIAL

Immediately following the selection by the Advisory Board of a
portion of the Douglas plant near Park Ridge, Ill., for the storage of
Air Museum material, negotiations were begun to obtain this facility.
Following the termination of World War II this Douglas plant, which
had been built during the war by the Government, was taken over
by the U. S. Air Force and used in part as a storage facility and in
part as headquarters of the Air Arm of the Illinois National Guard.
Subsequently, control and management of the property was placed
in the hands of the Air Defense Command of the United States Air
Force, where it rested at the close of the year.

While negotiations for storage space in this building were under
way, attention was given to plans for the Museum’s operating organi-
zation at Park Ridge. The protection, preservation, and maintenance
of the stored Air Museum material will constitute the principal re-
sponsibilities of this field organization. There is planned, therefore,
for this field service a staff of 14, consisting of an associate curator
with administrative and aircraft-maintenance experience, in charge,
an aircraft technician, 10 guards, and 2 skilled laborer helpers.

MUSEUM SITE AND BUILDING

As indicated earlier in this report real progress was made during
the year on the investigation of sites and a building for the Air Museum.
The staff worked closely with the Office of Design and Construction of
the Public Buildings Administration, contributing realistic concepts
of a functional museum structure from knowledge gained through
many years’ experience in the engineering and industrial museum
field. The staff furnished, too, much factual material representing
considered judgment as to the essential requirements of the proposed
building. In this connection the incorporation of a place of honor for
the Wright Brothers’ original aeroplane of 1903 was given full con-
sideration. The advice and suggestions of Mr. Loening, Board mem-
ber, regarding this important matter were most helpful.

The entire museum structure will require in excess of 500,000 square
feet of exhibition area, providing for an expected initial collection of
some 200 full-size aircraft, and for future expansion of the collection.
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

In addition there will be incorporated within the structure the usual
space for offices, laboratories, library, auditorium, manufacturers’
display rooms, and shops, as well as facilities for building mainte-
nance and operation.

CURATORIAL ACTIVITIES

The curator, Paul E. Garber, reports on the year’s work as follows:

EXHIBITION

The close of the fiscal year finds the exhibits in greatly improved
condition. All full-size aircraft were given a thorough cleaning;
several required minor repairs; four engines were reconditioned and
remounted. The exhibition of many propellers was improved. The
insignia which provide a colorful border to the walls of the Aircraft
Building were touched up. A number of bases and cases were reno-
vated and numerous scale models were repaired. At the suggestion of
Gen. Frank Lahm and with the advice and assistance of Orville
Wright, the lever which controls the balance and steering on the
Wright Brothers’ Military Flyer of 1909 was remodeled to conform
with its condition when in active service. The incomplete parts of
the John J. Montgomery gliders of 1905 and 1911 which had been ac-
cessioned the previous year were partly assembled. The series of
frames containing the illustrated story of the Wright Brothers re-
ceived additional drawings and photographs depicting more facts in
this chronicle. Two large cased exhibits were formed to group en-
gines of types used by the “Early Birds” (pioneer flyers of 1903-16)
and those of World War I. The gondola of the balloon Ezplorer-2,
which 13 years after its ascent still holds the world’s absolute manned
altitude record, had its rigging elevated to make a more understand-
able display. The exhibition of the Norden bombsight by which the
atomic bomb was directed at Hiroshima was improved by adding two
large photographs to illustrate its destructive effect. Extensive re-
arrangements of cases effected improvements in space and groupings,
and a program of relabeling provided better captions for numerous
items.

Several special exhibits were prepared: The first use of aircraft for
polar exploration was undertaken by Salamon Andrée and two com-
panions, 1897. Their heroic effort was commemorated by the Air
Museum on the fiftieth anniversary of their departure. During the
month of August the U. S. Air Force displayed current flight equip-
ment including engines, ordnance, instruments, and training devices.
The featured item was a Lockheed P-80 jet-powered fighter. The
National Air Museum prepared a historic aeronautic display for Air
SECRETARY'S REPORT 131

Force Day at Bolling Field, D. C. When the Navy’s Douglas Sky-
streak established a new world speed record of 650.6 miles per hour
on August 20-25, 1947, this event was soon featured in the Museum
by a representative display which included a 1:16-size scale model
of the Skystreak, a drawing showing its functional parts, autographed
photographs of the pilots, and views of the plane in flight. May
15, 1948, marked the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of
air mail on a permanet scheduled basis. The Air Museum had an
outstanding display ready for the anniversary. Special exhibits were
also prepared by the staff on the occasions of meetings of the Smith-
sonian’s Board of Regents and the Air Museum’s Advisory Board.

INFORMATIONAL SERVICES

The Air Museum conducts public relations and educational services
through correspondence, by telephone, and by personal contact, a
function that requires more curatorial attention than any other phase
of the Air Museum’s work. The Department of Education of the
State of California adopted the Handbook of the National Aircraft
Collection as a reference book for use in schools and ordered a number
of copies. The American Helicopter Society was given drawings
and texts to illustrate early rotor experiments. The Air Transport
Association was furnished details on the first commercial air load,
and the curator served as judge for the annual Science Fair held in
Washington, May 3, 1948. The Boeing Aircraft Co. and the Curtiss-
Wright Corp. required photographs of pioneer types of their own
historic craft. Technical charts prepared by the Douglas Aircraft
Co., Inc., were checked and corrected for historic accuracy.

The regrettable death of Orville Wright and the expected return
to America of the famous aeroplane invented and flown by him and
his brother brought a flood of requests for information on Wright
aircraft and details of the brothers’ lives.

Acknowledgments.—Many sources were consulted by the staff in
order to accomplish their duties. The curator wishes to acknowledge
the valued help of Dr. W. R. B. Acker of the Freer Gallery in trans-
lating Japanese inscriptions on ex-enemy equipment and Dr. Waldo
L. Schmitt of the National Museum in making German translations;
the aid by Charles Burgess of the Department of the Navy in review-
ing the development of lighter-than-air craft; the constant assistance
of Alfred Verville, also of the Department of the Navy, in locating
and evaluating naval objects of museum interest; and the supplying,
by the Department of the Air Force, through Lt. Robert Strobell, of
Wright Field, of extensive data on ex-enemy aircraft. The Naval Air
Reserve Training Unit, Anacostia NAS, provided expert technical
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

help in conditioning and mounting several aircraft engines, and the
engineering branch of the Bolling Field Air Force Base dismantled,
moved, and assembled the Curtiss Racer R3C-2 for reexhibition in the
Museum’s aeronautical hall.

tions of California airmen in the National Air Museum.

The associate curator gave one broadcast, as follows:
June 8, a broadcast over station WOL: The famous B-29 bomber Hnola Gay.

SURVEY

In accord with the Advisory Board’s motion, which inaugurated an
extensive survey to locate desirable aeronautic materials, much cura-
torial time was devoted to: first, research to decide what items should
be added to the collection; second, extensive correspondence to inves-
tigate availability, condition, and arrange procurement; third, meet-
ings at the Air Museum with prospective donors; and fourth, visits
to locate, examine, and receive material. The results of successful
surveys are shown in the list of accessions.

Very helpful information on the condition of foreign aeronautical
collections, and a number of leads for procurement of objects, resulted
from a trip abroad by Mr. Loening, Board member, during August
and September. The thorough manner in which he inspected mu-
seums, and the report, photographs, and catalogs which he brought
back enabled the staff to gain a first-hand impression of the extent of
air exhibits in England, France, and, to a certain extent, in Germany.

APPENDIX 10
REPORT ON THE CANAL ZONE BIOLOGICAL AREA

Sir: It gives me pleasure to present herewith the annual report of
the Canal Zone Biological Area for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948.

TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY

On April 17, 1948, the island laboratory celebrated its twenty-fifth
anniversary. A special commemorative 10-cent stamp was issued by
the Canal Zone, consisting of an outline drawing of the island, and
within this the gato-solo (coati-mundi), the most versatile, intelligent
mammal of the island. First-day covers, containing the 1947 annual
report, were sent to those who had been on the island during the past
25 years, and many very interesting repliey were received.

SCIENTISTS AND THEIR STUDIES

Dr. T. C. Schneirla, curator of the department of animal behavior of
the American Museum of Natural History, continued his studies on
army-ant behavior, assisted by Dr. Ernst Enzmann, of the Harvard
Biological Laboratories, and by R. Z. Brown, of Swarthmore College.
They “investigated the behavioral and biological conditions of two
army-ant species, Heiton hamatwm, a typical column raider, and
EF. burchelli, a typical swarm raider. The studies were begun in early
November 1947 and continued through March 1948, thus starting late
in the rainy season and extending well into the latter part of the dry
season.”

The study was concerned particularly with the manner in which
army-ant colonies adapt to dry-season conditions, and the manner in
which these ants produce their fertile females (dichthadiigynes). The
project was designed to complete a general investigation on army-ant
behavior and biological conditions begun in 1932 on Barro Colorado
Island.

As a result of the findings, it is now clear that but one sexual brood
per colony appears annually in the army ants, and that the pre-con-
ditions of this brood are peculiar to the dry season. With further
information about the timing of the one sexual brood per year and
the conditions of its production, the implications of the army-ant situ-
ation for problems of caste and sex determination now are clearer.

137
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

The single sexual brood of 2,000 to 3,000 males and a dozen or less
queen-type individuals is somehow produced by a functional queen
which otherwise delivers huge all-worker broods at regular intervals
throughout the year.

Facts concerning queen production in Eciton were checked in the
study of a number of colonies. It was found that the number of young
queens matured was very small, as a rule less than a dozen. They are
fully developed in advance of the males, usually about 3 days. This
female precocity proves to be very important for the process of colony
division. Since young queens are present as adults before the males
begin to emerge from their cases, it is possible for subsectioning of
the colony to occur on a chemical-attraction basis before emergence of
males arouses the colony into a move from its statary bivouacking
site. The old colony queen is apt to be present in one of the subsections
which becomes a new colony, one of the young new queens in another;
these move off divergently and thenceforth behave as new colonies.
The other young queens, through an interesting behavior process in
the worker, are “sealed off” and eventually abandoned.

Dr. R. A. Johnson, State Teachers College, Oneonta, N. Y., came to
the island when Dr. Schneirla and his associates were studying their
army ants; hence it was a splendid opportunity for him to study the
birds that attend the swarm raids of these ants, their various types of
adjustment to habitat, territorialism, and social stimulation. In ad-
dition to the ant birds proper (Formicariidae), birds of other groups
were found associated with these ant swarms. These associations dif-
fer distinctively, although all are represented by species of the
Formicariidae.

Mrs. Dorothy Hobson, vice president of the Indiana Audubon So-
ciety, spent 2 months studying primarily the birds of the island, their
nesting habits, and general behavior. She added much valuable in-
formation which will appear soon in published form.

Miss Clara Alma Moore, of Indianapolis, Ind., acompanied Mrs.
Hobson and devoted most of her time to painting the birds in their
natural habitats, nestings, and also some of the more conspicuous
flowers. In addition she also made studies of nesting habits of birds.

Fred E. Moorehouse and Don F. Loughnan, of the Forest Products
Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture at Madi-
son, Wis., made careful inspection of the various types of container-
grade plywood which have been in test on the island for several years.
This also included cleated-plywood boxes. The tests were made to
determine the effectiveness of various glues, glue preservatives, and
toxic water-repellent treatments on the maintenance of quality of con-
tainer-grade plywood when exposed to tropical conditions. The in-
formation obtained provides data desired by the Air Forces, as well
SECRETARY’S REPORT 139

as adding much to the laboratory’s knowledge of the effects of tropical
exposure on these various types of plywoods. A comprehensive report
on these results was prepared.

Dr. Edna Robbins, biology teacher at the Mary C. Wheeler School
for Girls, Providence, R. I., spent a short time on the island to get
acquainted with the tropical flora and certain of the invertebrates,
and to add to her knowledge of environmental factors.

Dr. A. Brazier Howell, formerly of Johns Hopkins University, now
retired, spent 10 days on the island in December, accompanied by Mrs.
Howell, for the purpose of noting the changes that have taken place
since he studied here 19 years ago. “A period of this duration can
have practically no effect on a tropical rain forest undespoiled by man,
and undoubtedly the habitat under which the fauna exists at this
locality is now as nearly identical in comparison with two decades ago
as it can be. But it is probable that the fauna is now in a more stable
state than it was then. As time passes the absence of human inter-
ference, coupled with the segregation essential in an island habitat, re-
sults in an adjustment in the interrelationship of the elements of the
fauna that is as near natural as can possibly be.”

Dr. Marshall H. Stone, formerly of Harvard, and now with the
Department of Mathematics of the University of Chicago, accom-
panied by Mrs. Stone, likewise spent a short time on the island, with
broad interests in fauna and flora.

Dr. Nevin S. Scrimshaw, of the University of Rochester Medical
School, returned to the island for a brief visit, to make a survey of
the fresh-water fishes in connection with his previous studies there
on this subject.

John Sellman, of the Sayville High School, New York, spent a
short time on the island studying the animal life, in order to be able
to give first-hand knowledge of the life in the American humid Tropics
to his students. He has published several interesting articles on his
observations.

H. C. Secrest, entomologist in the Division of Forest Insect Investi-
gations of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, came in
order to make examinations of the several thousand soil-poison tests
and treated-wood series installed by Kowal, Dews, and Johnson, and
reported upon in the 1947 report. The results of these experiments
are most interesting, but no conclusions are being announced as yet.

Fred W. Gottschalk and R. B. Putnam, of the American Lumber
& Treating Co., of Chicago, Ill., came in order to get first-hand in-
formation on the very large series of termite tests being conducted by
the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine. These tests, begun
nearly a quarter of a century ago, are, in fact, a history of wood
preservation.
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

Dr. Eugene Eisenmann, lawyer of New York City and an orni-
thologist of note, again spent some time on the island studying the
birds and, as in the past, added many new records. The island is
greatly indebted to him not only for sound advice, but also for his
repeated assistance in other ways.

W. Doyle Reed, who is in charge of the entomological work for the
United States Army, visited the Isthmus in connection with arrange-
ments for the extension of this work in the army units here. Many
conferences were held with the resident manager, and a short stay
was made on the island to get acquainted with the entomological
studies being conducted there. He was accompanied by Maj. Osborn
A. Kinzer, C. E., of Dallas, Tex.; Maj. J. Phoble, C. E., of the Carib-
bean Defense Command; Maj. Ralph W. Bunn, M. Sc., of the Surgeon
General’s Office; Walter V. Kell, O. C. E., of Washington; and Col.
Karl R. Lundberg, M. C., of the Office of the Chief Health Officer of
the Panama Canal.

Jerry H. Staedeli, stationed with the army at Corozal, mainly in-
terested in reptiles, spent 2 weeks on the island observing and record-
ing the fauna seen, covering more than 30 miles of trails, as well as
about 20 miles in a cayuco around the island.

Per Host, from Norway, ornithologist and mammalogist, spent con-
siderable time on the island, chiefly in photographic work. Never
before has the island had a visitor with the equipment he had for
both still and motion pictures. He made over 3,000 feet of what are
probably the finest motion pictures ever taken of the animals of the
island, and many hundred “stills” in black and white and in color.
He duplicated successfully a number of the experiments recorded by
Chapman with the versatile coati-mundi, and has a splendid series
of motion pictures of these in color. He also has slow-motion pictures
of animals climbing and leaping. Most of his spectacular photography
was taken from the main laboratory site. In his own words: “I am
extremely satisfied both with the opportunities for getting pictures
that I enjoyed, and for the education and introduction to the Tropics
made possible by this unique combination of easy access to observa-
tions of a virgin jungle with the facilities of the laboratory and
library.”

Dr. C. C. Soper, in charge of the Tropical Research Laboratory of
Eastman Kodak Co., continued his studies throughout the year on the
effects of tropical conditions. Valuable data have been obtained on
the keeping quality of film, papers, chemicals, and photographic equip-
ment in general. Data have also been obtained on the tropical deteri-
oration of photographic negatives and prints, particularly the de-
terioration attributable to biological origin. The studies on the island
are also adding rapidly to the problems of tropical lighting conditions,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 141

and the exposure of both black and white and color films, as well as
to the related problem of film processing at high temperatures.

Many of the data have been utilized in the preparation of a manu-
script on tropical photography, which when released will be of imme-
diate help to photographers working in tropical and semitropical
areas. This is a most valuable contribution and represents many years
of careful, detailed study right in the Tropics, most of it on the island.
The two basic sources of trouble are heat and humidity, especially the
latter. In this work, Mr. Soper is assisted by Mr. Hermle.

James Zetek continued his studies on fruitflies, as well as the ex-
tensive termite tests in preparation for his forty-first progress report.
This very large series of exposures, which in addition to termite tests,
include rot, beetle, and other tests, is each year yielding more import-
ant data. In addition to this series, examinations were also made of
the extensive soil-poison and treated-wood tests initiated and installed
by Kowal-Dews-Johnson.

Smithsonian Institution. The following were visitors to the lab-
oratory: Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Secretary, who had been in Herrera
Province on ornithological reconnaissance, assisted by W. M. Perrygo,
visited the island in February and in April largely on plans and dis-
cussions with the resident manager. John E. Graf, Assistant Secre-
tary, spent some time op the island, likewise in discussions of plans,
as well as to get acquainted with the island and the Tropics in general.
This was his first visit to the Tropics, and it left him with lasting
impressions and with the urge to return soon. Thomas F. Clark, ad-
ministrative accountant, also spent some time on the island to become
acquainted with the general set-up and to discuss property and fiscal
matters with the resident manager. These three visitors and coun-
selors were most welcome.

Dr. Matthew W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, with Mrs. Stirling, and Richard Stewart, staff photog-
rapher for the National Geographic Society, recently returned from
archeological explorations in the region of Parita, were welcome
visitors in April.

STUDIES ON DETERIORATION AND CORROSION

During World War II a great amount of work was done on the
island with refernce to deterioration and corrosion, much of it related
to war needs. As the program continued, it became more and more
apparent that the island was especially well fitted for this sort of
work, and that in addition, the isolation gave security. The studies
included not only fabrics, foodstuffs, and corrosion of lenses, but also
packing and packaging, the use of substitute materials, and similar
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

problems. High temperatures and humidities, especially the latter,
with the growth of fungus and other organisms, create serious prob-
lems. Elsewhere in this report reference is made to the large number
of such studies undertaken by Eastman Kodak Co., as a result of which
it is possible to avoid many of these difficulties. It is believed that
this phase of practical studies should be expanded, and facilities will
be granted to concerns and government units that have need for such
information.

BUILDINGS

The main laboratory building, 32 by 55 feet, contains laboratories,
a dining room, dormitory, and photographic darkroom. It is in
excellent condition, showing neither termite damage nor rot. Three
buildings—the Barbour guest house, the Chapman house, and the
“Zetek” Z-M-A house—each provide adequate lodging for four per-
sons, and the first two have ample laboratories. The kitchen building
has on the second floor a dormitory for six persons. Other buildings
are the masonite building used by the labor force; the caretaker’s home;
the library; Zetek’s quarters, a concrete-block building used as office
and living quarters for the resident manager; and the kodak test
building, which is itself a termite test in addition to housing Eastman
Kodak’s exposure tests for corrosion and deterioration.

The remaining buildings are five small structures, each located at the
end of one of the island trails. All are available for the use of scien-
tists, each structure accommodating two persons. These buildings are
also practical termite tests.

A paper entitled “Inspection of Test Buildings Treated for Ter-
mites on Barro Colorado Island, Canal Zone, Panama,” by Thomas
KE. Snyder and James Zetek, was published in the March 1948 issue of
Pests and Their Control, Kansas City. Those interested in the effec-
tiveness of treated wood in termite control will find this report of
value.

IMPROVEMENTS MADE

Both the coal-tar creosoted and cypress water tanks were in such
bad condition that replacements were necessary, and a concrete tank
of 4,000 gallons was built at a cost of about $400. This tank is for
safe drinking water. Since plans had to be made for a much more
adequate gravity-flow water supply, a site was selected for a new
14,000-gallon concrete water tank on the Snyder-Molino trail. The
area has been cleared and leveled, and the necessary galvanized pipe
procured. Work on the tank will be started when the rains subside.

The present dock, owing to the silting of the bay and the low level
SECRETARY’S REPORT 143

of Gatun Lake, had to be enlarged. The new center dock, which has
concrete piers, should be adequate for many years to come. The old
shingle roof of the Fuertes House, at end of the Pearson trail, was
replaced with one of galvanized corrugated iron.

URGENT NEEDS

First on the list of urgent needs is a more adequate supply of elec-
tricity on a 24-hour daily basis. The present small generators are
inadequate, and the equipment is in need of repair. An addition is
needed for the kitchen to make room for electric refrigerators. To
reduce fire risk, the present kitchen and the proposed addition should
be remade of concrete blocks and tile. Also on the urgent list is a
larger building of concrete blocks to take care of the expanding library
and herbarium, as well as the species index and scientific equipment,
all of which must be in a fireproof building with provision for heaters
to reduce the humidity.
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

A new concrete water tank of 14,000-gallons capacity mentioned
above will be built this coming fiscal year. It will be located on the
Snyder-Molino trail, high enough so that there will be good gravity
flow with a strong enough head to it. The tank will be so built that
the height can be increased later on to provide for more storage.

The Chapman and the Barbour houses should be rebuilt with con-
crete blocks and tile, and increased in size.

FISCAL REPORT

During the fiscal year 1948, $12,934.25 in trust funds was available.
Of this amount $11,478.64 was spent, leaving on hand only $1,455.61
with which to face the new fiscal year. In addition to this amount,
$1,458.20 is still on deposit, representing local collections, and there
will be added a few table subscriptions, but, even with these, the
coming year will be a rather difficult one financially.

During this fiscal year only $1,907.75 was collected as fees from
scientists, as compared with $4,403.96 last year. This decline is
largely due to the high cost of ocean or air travel, and efforts should
be made to obtain concessions which will reduce materially this heavy
expense. The laboratory, despite the higher costs of food and other
items, has not increased its per diem charge to scientists.

The institutions listed below continued to aid materially in the
support of the laboratory through payment of table subscriptions.
These institutions, because of their support, are given a 25 percent
reduction in the per diem for such scientists as come to the laboratory.

It is most gratifying to record that the Smithsonian Institution
increased its subscription by an additional $500.00 The Forest Prod-
ucts Laboratory of the United States Department of Agriculture
contributed $550.00 as service fees for facilities furnished by the lab-
oratory in connection with the termite and other tests on the island.

It is likewise most gratifying to record donations from Dr. Eugene
Eisenmann of New York City, an ornithologist of note, from Mrs.
G. S. Patton, Jr., and from Mrs. Laurie Randall.

The sum of $5,000 was made available by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution from appropriated funds, and of this amount $4,999.21 was
used for permanent improvements.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 11
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948:

The library received 53,129 publications during the year, 9,250 of
which were transmitted by the International Exchange Service. They
covered broadly the fields of astrophysics, botany, zoology, geology,
anthropology, engineering, the fine and useful arts, history, and many
related subjects. They came from all over the world, by purchase, by
gift, and in exchange, and were written in many different languages.

Friends of the Institution continued to make generous gifts of books,
pamphlets, and periodicals. Especially noteworthy among the 9,798
of the publications so received was the library of the late Charles B.
Chaney, of Laurel, Md., a very fine collection of 1,510 books and
periodicals on the history of railroads, presented for the special use of
the division of engineering. The American Association for the
Advancement of Science and the American Association of Museums
continued to make large donations of current books and periodicals.
The library is, as always, greatly indebted to these friends everywhere
throughout the world for their contributions.

Purchased publications included 1,485 volumes and pamphlets, and
271 periodical subscriptions.

The library is primarily a working reference collection, not a
museum of rare or fine books, but the interests and responsibilities of
the Smithsonian Institution touch so wide and timeless a range of
subjects that many old as well as new books are in daily use. A few
of the out-of-print works purchased to fill lacunae in various subject
fields were the following: A Natural History of Singing Birds, by
Eleazar Albin, Edinburgh, 1776; History of Karly Steamboat Naviga-
tion on the Missouri River, by H. M. Chittenden, New York, 1902, 2
volumes; Art Sales from early in the Eighteenth Century to early
in the Twentieth Century, by Algernon Graves, London, 1918-21,
3 volumes; Atlas der Baumgarten von Java, by S. H. Koorders,
Leiden, 1918-18, 4 volumes; Voyages made in the Years 1788 and 1789,
from China to the N. W. Coast of America, by John Meares, London,
1791, 2 volumes; Conchology, or Natural History of Shells, by E.
Mendes da Costa, London, 1770-72, numbers 1-6; Monograph of the
Snakes in Japan, by Moichiro Maki, with 85 colored plates and 158 text

145
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

figures, Tokyo, 1931, 2 volumes; The Printer’s Grammar, by Charles
Stower, London, 1808; Ceramic Literature: an Analytical Index to
the Works Published in All Languages on the History and Technology
of the Ceramic Art, by L. M. E. Solon, London, 1910; The Voyage of
the Challenger, a Personal Narrative of the Historic Circumnaviga-
tion of the Globe in the Years 1872-1876, by Herbert Swire, London,
1938, 2 volumes; Der Franzésische Kupferstich der Renaissance, by
Krika Tietze-Conrat, Munich, 1925; Zeitschrift fiir die Entomologie,
edited by E. Germar, Leipzig, 1839-44, 5 volumes.

Serial publications, which include not only regularly issued peri-
odicals, but the reports, bulletins, proceedings, monographs, and other
publications of learned societies and research institutions, of museums
and art galleries, of universities, libraries, and laboratories every-
where, form the largest and probably the most indispensable part of
the library’s holdings. Except for the periodical parts represented
by the 271 purchased subscriptions and a few received as gifts, all those
added to the library during the year came in exchange for the Institu-
tion’s own publications. Currently entered were 15,256 periodical
parts, and many annual volumes and irregularly issued serials were
cataloged. Many gaps in serial sets, some of them of long standing,
were filled by the 6,782 volumes and parts received in response to 719
special requests. New exchanges arranged were 314.

To the great Smithsonian Deposit in the Library of Congress, first
established in 1866, were sent 5,809 volumes and parts, many of them
in continuation of files of the scientific and technical proceedings of
learned societies. Also sent to the Library of Congress were 12,342
miscellaneous publications, including 1,023 dissertations on a great
variety of subjects from 14 foreign and 3 American universities, and
a large number of other books and periodicals on subjects not per-
tinent to the work of the Institution.

Most of the 2,339 publications transferred to government libraries
other than the Library of Congress had been received during the year.
Among them were 508 medical dissertations transferred to the Army
Medical Library.

The cataloging of 6,148 volumes and pamphlets was completed dur-
ing the year, and 35,357 cards were added to catalogs and shelflists.
Except for a small number of older publications in urgent need of
cataloging attention, the huge “backlog” of cataloging remained vir-
tually untouched and must continue to remain so until an adequate
staff for doing the work can be provided.

Funds were not giflicient to permit all the volumes of periodicals
completed during the year to be sent to the bindery, but the diligent
studies made by the Government Printing Office to reduce binding
costs permitted 1,052 volumes or 436 more than last year to be bound
SECRETARY’S REPORT 147

for approximately the same sum customarily allotted for binding.
Because of illness on the staff the volumes repaired in the Museum,
826, were somewhat fewer than last year.

Although there was no member of the staff who could be detailed
to work regularly with the library’s large collection of duplicates,
time was found to select 36,701 pieces for use in aid of destroyed
libraries overseas.

The 10,151 publications borrowed for use outside the library can
only hint at the actual use made of the library, which is the true test
of its value to the Institution. Certainly many times that number
of books and periodicals were consulted in the main reading rooms,
the stacks, and the divisional libraries kept immediately adjacent to
the offices and laboratories of the scientific staff in all the buildings
of the Institution. The library staff itself answered more than 15,000
reference questions, most of which required the consultation of more
than one, and some of them of many different publications.

The housing of the library continues to be its most serious unsolved
problem. In an institution charged with responsibility for adminis-
tering research in so many different highly specialized and technical
fields, a good many relatively small decentralized collections of books
and periodicals on special subjects are both necessary and desirable,
but such decentralization should always be made in the direct interest
of furthering the work of a given bureau or division, never merely as
a housing convenience, or at the expense of lowering the working ref-
erence efficiency of the central library collections and consequently
at the expense of the work of the institution as a whole. Our shelves
are now so badly overcrowded everywhere that it has become impos-
sible to avoid committing almost every sin in the library calendar,
both of giving good care to the books and of giving good lbrary
service.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for the
construction of a building to house the collection, and finally in his
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 159

will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to
the estimated value of $1,958,591.42, as an endowment fund for the
operation of the Gallery.

The above fund of Mr. Freer was almost entirely represented by
20,465 shares of stock in Parke, Davis & Co. As this stock advanced in
value, much of it was sold and the proceeds reinvested so that the fund
now amounts to $6,100,164.31 in a selected list of securities classified
later.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTER 163

SEPTEMBER 14, 1948.
To THE Boarp or REGENTS,
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington 25, D. C.

We bave examined the accounts of the Smithsonian Institution relative to its
private endowment funds and gifts (but excluding the National Gallery of Art
and other departments, bureaus, or operations administered by the Institution
under Federal appropriations) for the year ended June 30, 1948, have reviewed
the system of internal control and the accounting procedures of the Institution
and, without making a detailed audit of the transactions, have examined or
tested accounting records of the Institution and other supporting evidence, by
methods and to the extent we deemed appropriate. Our examination was made
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and included all
procedures which we considered necessary in the circumstances.

The Institution maintains its accounts on a cash basis and does not accrue
income and expenses. Land, buildings, furniture, equipment, works of art,
living and other specimens and certain sundry property are not included in the
accounts of the Institution.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly the posi-
tion of the private funds and the cash and investments thereof of the Smith-

Appendix

TO THE SMITHSONIAN REPORT

FOR 1948
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genera, Aprenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. ‘This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. ‘This method has been continued in the present report for 1948.
The Astrophysical Observatory of the

Smithsonian Institution *

By C@. C. Assot, Research Associate, Smithsonian Institution

[With 6 plates}

The Astrophysical Observatory of
the Smithsonian Institution is the
child of S. P. Langley, third Secretary
of the Institution. Owing to his very
keen interest in the sun’s radiation, he
had invented the bolometer? about
1878, and about 1890 equipped it with
photographic registration. His studies
of the solar and lunar energy spectra
were made not only at the Allegheny
Observatory, but also at the summit
of Mount Whitney, Calif., where he
conducted an expedition to measure
the amount of solar radiation.

As Langley had been so exclusively
occupied with the distribution of
energy in spectra, it is a little strange
that in the first years of the Astro-
physical Observatory at Washington,
1890-1900, he turned aside to the
relatively less interesting subject of
mapping the positions of lines in the
infrared spectrum of the sun. Yet
that was the Observatory program
when I joined its staff in June 1895.

In order to observe infrared radia-
tion not transmitted by glass, we were
using large rock-salt prisms made from
clear blocks of salt obtained from the
Russian Government. Two noble
rock-salt prisms were in our equip-
ment, each about 7 inches tall and
about 5 inches on edge. With these,
after improving the bolometer so that

drift and wiggle in the photographic
trace of its galvanometer were greatly
reduced, F. E. Fowle and I mapped
the solar spectrum to wave length 5.3
microns, 53,000 angstroms, observing
indications of more than 600 spectral
lines and bands of solar or terrestrial
origin. It was necessary to determine
more exactly the dispersion of rock
salt in order to fix the wave lengths.
Our photographic registration, with
the highly accurate mechanism fur-
nished by Warner and Swasey, enabled
us to give the values of the index of
refraction of rock salt to six places of
decimals. Because European observers
scoffed at such pretensions, and cut
our values down to four places, it
was a comfort to us when Paschen
repeated the determination and, find-
ing only small differences from us in
the sixth place, referred to our work
as “‘of wonderful precision.”

At the request of H. D. Babcock,
and with the aid of Hugh Freeman, I
repeated the bolometric mapping of
the infrared solar spectrum in 1928
on Mount Wilson. With higher dis-
persion, improved apparatus, and
long bolometric experience, we were
able to detect evidences of over 1,200
lines and bands, some of solar, others
of terrestrial origin, between wave
lengths 0.76 and 2.0 microns. It was
a great satisfaction, when I discussed
this work with Babcock in 1945, to
learn that he finds it still useful, and
that there is almost nothing in our
curves that is not confirmed by present
photographic spectra or by theoretical
physics.

The Solar Constant of Radiation, Its
Imperfect Constancy, and Its Relationship
to Meteorology

The main research of the Astro-
physical Observatory from 1902 to the
present time concerns what was
beautifully and emphatically expressed
by Langley in his report of the Mount
Whitney expedition ° as follows:

If the observation of the heat the sun sends
the earth is among the most important and
difficult in astronomical physics, it may
also be termed the fundamental problem of
meteorology, nearly all whose phenomena
would become predictable if we knew both
the original quantity and kind of this heat;
how much of it reaches the soil; how, through
the aid of the BuMmOspREre, it maintains the
surface temperature of the planet; and how,
in diminished quantity and altered kind,
it is finally returned to outer space.

In the same report, Langley also
said: ‘‘The difficulty of measuring sun
rays accurately at the ground is indeed
very great, but the difficulty of measur-
ing their loss in the atmosphere is
almost insuperable.”

It was a great satisfaction, in view
of these true statements of Langley,
based on his long experience, when
Turner, of Oxford, in a review of
volume 2 of the Annals of the Astro-
physical Observatory, wrote in 1908:
‘Mr. Abbot has shown that he is
measuring something definite, for he
has detected an annual diminution
of 3} percent from August to October,
due to our greater distance from the
sun.”

Since then great improvements in
accuracy, both in ground measures
and in estimates of atmospheric losses,
have been made. In a recent paper *
I was able to show that a periodic
change in the sun’s output of radia-
tion, averaging but 0.13 percent, can

be recognized in our measurements of
the last 25 years, and the form of its
curve of solar variation can be clearly
shown, though its whole average range
is only one twenty-seventh of that
which Turner referred to in 1908.

The steps taken which have led up to
the present condition of our research
will now be mentioned.

After an interlude of observing the
total solar eclipses of May 28, 1900,
and May 18, 1901, we returned to
Langley’s first interest, measurements
of the intensity in different parts of
the solar spectrum, as observed on the
earth’s surface at low and high eleva-
tions above sea level, and as it would
be observed at mean solar distance
outside the atmosphere altogether.
When we began these new studies,
the 1900 edition of Hann’s Lehrbuch
of meteorology gave without preference
values of the solar constant ® of radia-
tion, ranging from Pouillet’s 1.76
calories per, square centimeter per
minute to Angstrém’s suggestion of
4.0 calories. Various types of instru-
ments for measuring the total in-
tensity of solar heating were then in
use which disagreed widely. Only
one of them, the Angstrém electrical
compensation pyrheliometer,® has sur-
vived to the present time, and that
has been decidedly improved. But
even as of the year 1900, Angstrém’s
pyrheliometer was within 3 percent
of the truth.

However, being unfamiliar with the
merit of Angstrém’s pyrheliometer,
we developed our instrument from
Pouillet’s. After several years of im-
provements, we perfected the Abbot
silver-disk pyrheliometer about 1910.
Nearly a hundred copies of this in-

strument have been made by our
instrument maker, Andrew Kramer,
which are in use in all parts of the
world. An Argentinian observer,
Enrique Chaudet, has confirmed our
own experience with them, for he
finds them highly stable in sensitive-
ness over a period of 30 years, and
capable of reading to an accuracy of
one-fourth of 1 percent. We also
devised the water-flow and the water-
stir standard pyrheliometers. ‘The

able and thereby modify weather,
came to us in 1903. Although the
atmosphere over Washington, even
45 years ago, was very unsuitable for
attempting solar-constant measure-
ments, we had been making them
occasionally in 1902 and 1903 on
cloudless days. Suddenly, in March
1903, our results fell about 10 percent
although carried on with the same
instruments and methods as before.
I made a statistical study of the

former we improved, as proposed by
a Russian physicist, V. M. Shulgin,
by employing two electrically com-
pensated hollow chambers. With this
improved instrument, L. B. Aldrich
and I, in 1932, determined very
accurately the absolute scale of the
silver-disk instruments, used so gener-
ally the world over, and often referred
to as “‘the Smithsonian scale of 1913.”

Our first inkling that the sun’s out-
put of radiation, on which the earth’s
temperature depends, might be vari-

temperatures of all available parts of
the Northern Hemisphere and found
the exciting result that simultaneously
with the slump in solar-constant re-
sults there was a general fall of temper-
ature from the normal over the whole
North Temperate Zone. This work
we showed to Secretary Langley and
he published a paper on it.’

With present knowledge we feel
sure that the supposed change of 10
percent in the solar constant in March
1903 was illusory. At that time we
had not perfected our methods to
avoid errors in estimating the at-
mospheric losses. About that time,
as in the eruption of Mount Katmai,
Alaska, in 1912, there were several
violent volcanic eruptions, including
Colima, Mexico, and Pelee, West
Indies. These, as in 1912, probably
caused a great change in the at-
mospheric transparency. This would
alter the temperature of the North
Temperate Zone, and at the same
time alter the error of our imperfect
solar-constant determinations. Never-
theless, erroneous as was our impres-
sion, it caused us to undertake the
long program of observing the varia-
tion of the sun which still goes on,
and which has produced important
results.

When the Mount Wilson Observ-
atory was established in 1904, by the
efforts of George E. Hale, Langley
was invited to use that station for
determinations of the solar constant of
radiation and the range of variation
of the sun’s output of radiation. In
1905 I went to Mount Wilson with a
large outfit, and was joined by L. R.
Ingersoll, now head of the department
of physics, University of Wisconsin.
From 1905 to 1922, with few excep-
tions, my colleagues and I spent
several months each year in solar-
constant measurements on Mount
Wilson. In more recent years I have
occasionally revisited Mount Wilson
for special observations.

Thus I have been priviledged to
watch, as with a bird’s-eye view, those
great advances in astronomy which
have justly given Mount Wilson
Observatory a shining place in the
world. I like to recall from time to
time some of them. Hale’s discovery
of magnetism in sunspots; Adams’
and St. John’s spectroscopic measures
of rotation of the sun; St. John’s
exact spectrum places; Adams’ and

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

1948

Kohlschutter’s spectroscopic paral-
laxes; Nicholson’s and Pettit’s meas-
ures of stellar and planetary radiation;
Hubble’s and Humason’s work on
the distant nebulae; Seares’ photo-
metric studies; and many more fine
pieces of work that it is invidious not
to mention. I saw the mountain
transformed by George Jones’ years
of effort; the building of the road;
the erection of the two solar tower
telescopes and of the 60-inch and the
100-inch reflectors. I saw G. W.
Ritchey’s beautiful direct photographs
with the 60-inch; the long spectro-
scopic programs which have revealed
so much about the stars; especially
the great detailed stellar spectra by
the coudé spectroscope of the 100-
inch. All these wonderful opportuni-
ties of seeing astronomy in the making,
and of knowing the fine men and
women of the staff of Mouat Wilson
Observatory, have indeed been a
profound satisfaction in my life.

In the many years during which
my colleagues and I regularly re-
turned to Mount Wilson, we made
many observations, in addition to
those of the solar constant. As our
measurements seemed to indicate a
variability in the sun’s output of
radiation, we sought to check this
important possibility in several ways.
We erected a tower telescope on our
observatory, and every day, after
observing for the solar constant, we
drifted an 8-inch image of the sun
over the spectrobolometer, selecting
a number of different wave lengths
These drifts gave U-shaped curve.
for the sun is less bright near the
limbs than at the center. The con-
trast is much greater for violet than
for infrared rays. It was our object to
detect whether variations of the solar
constant were associated with varia-
tions of the contrast of brightness
between the edge and center of the
sun. Some indications of such a cor-
relation were indeed found. Another
test of our supposed solar variation
we made by expeditions to the summit

of Mount Whitney in 1909 and 1910,
and to Bassour, Algeria, in 1911 and
1912. Solar-constant measurements
were made at these stations on the
same days that they were being made
on Mount Wilson. In later years, as
I shall tell, we have amplified such
tests by occupying mountain summits
in other parts of the world.

Criticism of our solar-constant work,
based on the supposed impossibility
of correctly estimating atmospheric
transparency, led us to special observ-
ations in 1913. On a very perfect
September day we observed the sun
with pyrheliometer and bolometer
from the instant it rose until midday.
From these observations, extending
from air mass 20 to air mass 1.2, we
computed a series of solar-constant
values, instead of the usual one de-
pending only on air mass change
from 4 to 1.2. They agreed excel-
lently. Also, at A. K. Angstrom’s
suggestion, I designed an automatic
recording pyrheliometer, to be carried
by sounding balloons very high in
the atmosphere. This was flown by
L. B. Aldrich, in cooperation with the
U. S. Weather Bureau, from Omaha,
Nebr., and recovered in Iowa. It
gave excellent records at 15 miles
elevation, where the air pressure was
only one twenty-fifth as great as at sea
level. ‘These records gave a value of
solar radiation about 1 percent lower
than those derived from solar-constant
observing at Mount Wilson.

Both on Mount Wilson and on
Mount Whitney I made many meas-
urements of the intensity of sky light
at all parts of the sky, both by day

and by night. We also confirmed
Lord Rayleigh’s theoretical and obser-
vational studies of the blue of the sky.
Applying Rayleigh’s theory to our
observations, F. E. Fowle found very
close agreement with R. A. Millikan’s
determination of the number of mole-
cules per square centimeter in air.
He also made classical researches
which gave a method for measuring
precipitable water in the atmosphere.

Another thing which attracted wide
attention and afforded amusement to
ourselves and our visitors was the
solar cooker I devised and installed
close beside our cottage on Mount
Wilson. It has a concave cylindric
mirror which follows the sun by rotat-
ing about a pipe at the focus of the
mirror, mounted parallel to the earth’s
axis. Cylinder oil in the pipe when
heated by solar radiation circulates
about ovens in a reservoir some 10
feet above the mirror. Mrs. Abbot
used to cook food for ourselves and
our visitors there for many years.
She baked bread, cooked meat and
vegetables, made jam, and, in short,
did all kinds of cooking by solar heat
except frying and roasting. The ovens
remained hot enough to bake with,
by night as well as by day, for months
each year.

Several times in later years I
attempted to measure the distribution
of radiation in the spectra of the
brighter stars, using a spectroscope at
the coudé focus of the 100-inch
reflector and a radiometer as my
measuring instrument. I made in-
teresting spectral-energy curves for
yellow and red stars, but hope still
172

to improve my results for blue and
white ones.

Establishment of Distant Mountain
Solar Stations

Our program of day-to-day obser-
vation of the solar constant to detect
possible variations in the sun’s output
of radiation, which might be of im-
portance for weather forecasting, re-
ceived a great impetus in 1916.
H. H. Clayton, then chief forecaster
of Argentina, sent us a paper® in
which he showed that if our Mount
Wilson solar-constant values were
used in large groups, graded with
respect to size, temperatures in all
parts of the world seemed to be cor-
related with them. I reported on this
paper to Dr. Walcott, then Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, and
he was also impressed.

Excellent as Mount Wilson at-
mospheric conditions are for photo-
graphic stellar work, the variable
haziness, associated with nearby cities
and the ocean, make it difficult to
determine there the variations of the
solar constant of radiation. After
much inquiry it appeared that the
region of Calama in northern Chile
might prove more suitable. Dr.
Walcott authorized an expedition to
Calama, and in 1918 the Smithsonian
established a solar observing station
there, directed by Alfred F. Moore.
In 1920, by the generous assistance of
John A. Roebling, the Chilean sta-
tion was removed to the summit of
Mount Montezuma. This _ station,
about 10 miles from Calama, lies in a
nearly rainless desert at about 9,000
feet altitude. We have occupied many
solar observing stations in far-away
desert lands, but Mount Montezuma
has proved the best, and is still giving
us nearly daily determinations of the
solar constant of radiation. Another
station on Burro Mountain, N. Mex.,
was occupied until late in 1946; a

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1948

third, on Table Mountain, Calif., is
still in daily operation.

The variation of the sun’s output of
radiation, though small in percentage,
appears to be a factor of importance
in weather. By extensive statistical
studies of the quarter-century of
nearly daily solar-constant values now
available from Montezuma and the
other Smithsonian stations, I have
shown that the short-interval solar
fluctuations of 3 to 5 days in length
strongly affect temperatures. The
temperature changes are large.

In a recent paper ° I show that there
is a regular periodic variation of solar
radiation of 6.6456 days. Its ampli-
tude, not yet thoroughly determined,
seems to vary from zero to over 1
percent of the sun’s output of radia-
tion. The average magnitude of the
variations seems to be about 0.13
percent. Though perfectly regularly
periodic as a solar variation, its effects
on terrestrial temperature show what,
by mechanical analogy, we might
call “‘backlash.”? That is, they some-
times are 1, 2, or, rarely, even 3 days
early or late compared to the average,
but rarely change in phase much in
the four or five recurrences of each
single month. The magnitude of the
temperature changes is also variable,
but surprisingly large. It ranges from
2° F. to 20° F. Thus these short solar
changes are major influences on the
weather, hitherto unrecognized be-
cause irregular in recurrence to the
extent just described. In a test fore-
cast of 36 days, based on the assump-
tion that there would be no change
in “backlash” or in amplitude during
that interval, the ups and downs of
temperature at Washington were cor-
rectly predicted as to times, and the
average daily difference, observed
minus predicted temperature, for 27
days, until a change of amplitude did
occur, contrary to the preliminary
assumption on which the forecast was
based, was 6.6° F. If the causes of

*‘backlash”’ and changes of amplitude
can be discovered, the periodicity
may prove valuable for long-range
forecasting. At least it is an important
weather element hitherto unrecognized.

We have shown also that the sun
varies simultaneously in no less than
16 periods, ranging from 7 months
to about 23 years in length, all nearly
integral fractions of 273 months.
The 23-year period may be related
to the magnetic cycle on the sun
indicated by the reversal of magnetic
conditions in sunspots during alternate
11-year sunspot cycles. These solar-
radiation periodicities are associated
with fluctuations of temperature and
rainfall. The correlation at some
stations is close enough to serve as a

basis for long-range weather
predictions.

In recent time, L. B. Aldrich, who
has succeeded me as Director of the
Astrophysical Observatory, has been
engaged, in cooperation with the
Quartermaster Corps of the Army,
in a program of measurements of the
intensity of sunlight and of skylight
in different parts of the spectrum as it
reaches the earth. This is of im-
portance not only to the military, but
from the medical point of view. It
is hoped to carry on these studies at
different stations so as to yield better
information as to the influence of
latitude, altitude, humidity, and clouds
on the sun’s rays which affect all life
interests.

Atomic Energy in Industry’

By H. A. Winne, Fellow AIEE, Vice President in Charge of Engineering Policy,
General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y.

In the production of special ma-
terials, engineering, scientific, and
industrial groups already have con-
tributed much to the start of the
atomic age. The transformation of
the basic uranium to a degree of purity
and form suitable for plutonium
production in the Hanford Engineer
Works is just one example. The
production of graphite for the Hanford
piles, sufficiently free of neutron-ab-
sorbing impurities to allow a chain
reaction with natural uranium, was a
signal achievement. However, all that
has been accomplished thus far repre-
sents just a beginning.

The use of materials in a nuclear
chain reactor or “‘pile” involves con-
sideration of their “nuclear proper-
ties.” 2. Previous uses of engineering
and construction materials have been
based only on external physical and
chemical properties. The addition of
suitable nuclear properties to the list of
requirements portends many changes
from the engineering materials which
have become common. ‘The periodic
table contains many elements whose
possibilities as useful engineering ma-
terials never have been explored
thoroughly because of such factors as
scarcity, cost, and difficulty of process-

2 “Nuclear properties” refer to properties
such as those which make materials good for
slowing down neutrons (moderator) or low
in absorption of neutrons or suitable to
withstand radiation of neutrons in a pile
(radiation stability).

ing. Many of these have attractive
nuclear properties, but production
methods for refining, reduction, alloy-
ing, and working, have not been
developed. Beryllium is an example
mentioned by Smyth (1)? which is
valuable as a moderator because of its
low atomic weight. The production
of metallic beryllium essentially free
of neutron-absorbing impurities is still
almost a laboratory process.

The potential uses of atomic power
plants for various special purposes such
as ship propulsion, or for the provision
of a source of power where none now
exists, that is, supplementing present
power sources, have been mentioned
by many writers. However, atomic
power development as a whole will be
a long and difficult process.

The use of radioactivity and radia-
tion in chemical and metallurgical
fields has been possible on a very
limited scale for a good many years.
It has not been exploited widely,
largely, no doubt, because of the
scarcity and cost of radioactive ele-
ments. The development of atomic
energy makes possible the production
of radioactive isotopes of great variety
and on a considerable scale. This,
together with widespread interest and
education in the fields of radio chem-
istry, radiation chemistry, and nuclear
physics, should stimulate activity in
using these unique and potent tools.

Atomic Power

As a preface to a discussion of the
problems entailed by the use of
atomic power, the following broadly
reviews the operation of an atomic
power plant.

Figure 1 shows schematically a pos-
sible atomic power plant. The heart
of the plant is the nuclear reactor
which generates heat by the conversion
of mass to energy. The heat is con-
verted to electric energy by extracting
it from the nuclear reactor with a heat-
transfer fluid which boils water in a
heat exchanger to make steam for a

fissionable material by the capture of
neutrons.

Discharged from the pile are the
partly burned fuel and the irradiated
fertile material which contains some
new fissionable material. Later use of
the unburned fuel and the new fuel
both require chemical separation from
any other structural materials, con-
tainers, and from the fission product
wastes.

An optional phase of operation of an
atomic power plant is the production
of radioactive isotopes. This is shown
in figure 1 as the adding to the pile of
a byproduct charge of some “parent”
of radioactive isotopes. ‘This is shown
