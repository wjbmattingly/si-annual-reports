JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

WASHINGTON, January 9, 1889.

The stated annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution was held this day at half-past 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: Chief-Justice MELVILLE W. FULLER, Hon. J. J. INGALLS,
Hon. J. S. MORRILL, Hon. 8. M. CuLiLom, Hon. R. L. Gipson, Hon. 5.
S. Cox, Hon. W. W. PHELPS, Hon. Jos. WHEELER, Dr. HENRY
CopriE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, General M. C. MEIGs, and the Sece-
retary, Mr. S. P. LANGLEY.

On motion of Mr. Morrill, Mr. Ingalls was called to the chair.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. Noam PorTER and
Dr. J. B. ANGELL, and the Secretary stated that Dr. A. D. WHITE was
out of the country.

The journal of proceedings of the Board of the regular annual meet-
ing of January 11 and the special called meeting of March 27, 1888,
was read and approved.

The Secretary stated that since the last annual meeting the death had
occurred of one of the most distinguished and useful members of the
Board, Dr. ASA GRAY, and it was proper that some expression be made
by ie Board in regard to the loss it had sustained.

Dr. Coppée, in afew eulogistic remarks on the late Dr. Gray, portrayed
his character and particularly his active usefulness as a Regent, and
thought the expression of the feeling of every one of his associates
should be placed upon the permanent records of the Institution. On his
motion, it was

Resolved, That-a committee of three be appointed, of which the Sec-
retary shall be chairman, to prepare and record in our proceedings a
resolution expressing the sentiments of the Board upon the loss of Pro-
fessor Gray.

The Chair appointed Prof. 8. P. Langley, Dr. Coppée, and Dr. Well-
ing as the committee, which subsequently reported the following :

THE LATE DOCTOR ASA GRAY.

It is rarely indeed that the departure from this life of any man pro-
duces so profound and so general a sense of personal loss as has fol-
lowed the death of our friend, Dr. Asa Gray, His associates in the

XI
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

Board of Regents, his companions in scientific research, and the great
body of younger men who looked up to him as their master, have all
been made to realize that something has gone from the world which
can ill be spared, and that their own lives have lost a part of that which
made up their fullness.

Upon the Smithsonian Institution his loss falls with particular
weight, since his active interest in its welfare is almost continuous with
its existence, for he was one of the Committee of the American Acad-
emy of Arts and Sciences, the report of which upon the “ plan pro-
posed for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution,” rendered in
1847, has exercised so active an influence upon the subsequent history
of this establishment.

Appointed a Regent in January, 1874, to succeed Prof. Louis Agas-
siz, his efficient and active interest in the welfare of this Institution
has been one of its most valuable possessions, and it is with deeper
feeling than formal resolutions of regret unsually convey that we now
endeavor to express some part of our sense of irreparable loss.

Dr. Gray’s scientific reputation, while literally world-wide, was nat-
urally greatest in his Own country, for it is he who has made the
botanical world acquainted with probably nearly three-fourths of the
forms that grow on this northern continent; and in this country, where
everything was referred to his Harvard Herbarium and to his judg-
ment and classification, as the final court of appeal, he occupied a
unique position as priest and pontiff of American botany. His botanical
labors are otherwise too familiar to need rehearsal here, but it is not
perhaps so generally known that he was an honored sponsor at the
birth of the Darwinian Theory. In this constant correspondence with
its illustrious author, Dr. Gray elicited the frequent expression of an
admiration as hearty as if was sincere;* and in Europe as well as in this
country our friend was recognized rather as the colleague than as the
disciple of the great English naturalist.

As another distinguished botanist has said of him, in speaking on
this same subject, ‘* Wherever it was known that Asa Gray saw noth-
ing sinister, nothing dangerous, in the teachings of Darwin, those
teachings were stripped of all their terrors. The impossibility that
such a man, so eminent in science, so clear in his conceptions, so pure
in his morals, and so steadfast in his faith, could pass judgment upon a
work that he had not thoroughly examined, or favor a doctrine that
could be productive of evil, was apparent to all who knew him, and to
the full extent of Dr. Gray’s wide influence throughout the world, the
works of Charles Darwin were stricken from the index expurgatorius

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XV

appreciation in which this Board holds its departed associate than in
any expectation that formal action can adequately express its sense of
the great loss that we personally feel, and that this Institution has
experienced, your committee submits the following resolutions:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution have been called upon to mourn the death of their distin-
guished colleague, the late Dr. Asa Gray, who has been actively inter-
ested in the welfare of the Institution from its beginning, and who held
for fifteen years the office of Regent, with great advantage to the In-
stitution: Therefore, be it

Resolved, That with a high appreciation of Dr. Gray’s most eminent
labors in the development of all scientific truth, and especially in the
advancement and popularization of the study of botany; with a grate-
ful sense of the service he has rendered to the Smithsonian Institution,
and with reverence for his pure life, we record our admiration of the
Christian character in which the truths of science were all seen in the
same light that shone on a life of steadfast faith.

Resolved, That we mourn not only the great investigator, the teacher
and the associate, whose single mind found outward expression in a
manner so well remembered in its simple and indefinable charm, but
that above all we grieve for the loss of a friend.

Resolved, That this preamble and the resolutions be spread on the
minutes of the Board in respectful tribute to the memory of our vener-
ated colleague, and that a copy be transmitted to his family in token of
the share we take in their bereavement.

The Secretary stated that having learned from the widow of Dr. Gray
that she needed about eighty copies of the second part of the “ Flora
of North America,” by her husband, which had been published by the
Smithsonian Institution, to complete the sets in her possession and ren-
der them available, he had ventured in the name of the Regents to fur-
nish these desired volumes, and had taken the occasion to express their
continued interest in the result of the labors of their late colleague ;
for which Mrs. Gray had asked him to express her very sincere thanks.

The chairman announced the election by joint resolution of Congress,
approved by the President February 15, 1888, of Dr. Andrew B. White,
of the State of New York, as Regent for the term of six years, to fill
the vacancy occasioned by the death of Dr. Gray.

The chair then announced as the next business in order, the election
of Chancellor.

On motion of Mr. Cox, Chief-Justice Melville W. Fuller was unani-
mously elected Chancellor of the Institution.

Mr. Fuller, in accepting the office, after thanking the members of the
Board for the compliment, expressed his desire to promote the objects
of the Institution, in whose welfare, he was well aware, the late chan-
celior, Chief-Justice Waite, had such great interest, and he earnestly
hoped that he should be able to discharge his duties with as much fidel-
ity and success.

Dr. Welling, chairman of the Executive Committee, presented its
annual report for the year ending June 30, 1888; which was read and
accepted,
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

On motion of Mr. Cox it was—

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1890, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to
be expended by the Secratary, with the advice of the executive com-
mittee, upon the basis of the operations described in the last annual
report of said committee, with tull discretion on the part of the Secre-
tary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of the
heads embraced in the established conduct of the Institution.

The Secretary presented his annual report, which in accordance with
the rules of the Board had been printed and distributed in advance to
the members. He expressed his readiness to make additional explana-
tions or remarks in regard to any part of the operations of the Institu-
tion.

Mr. Culiom inquired as to the Zoological Park, and the prospect of
its establishment. He expressed great interest in the project and hoped
it would speedily be realized.

The Secretary briefly urged the importance to science of the measure,
as the means of rescuing from speedy extinction some of the animals
which formerly inhabited this continent in vast numbers, and ex-
pressed his fear that if the land was not now secured (which in its nat-
ural state was pre-eminently fitted for the Park) within a year, so-called
‘‘improvements” would entirely destroy its character and adaptability.

General Meigs stated that thirty years ago he had pointed out to the
Government the desirability of securing the Rock Creek region for a
public park, and the land could then have been procured for an insig-
nificant sum.

After a general expression of opinion by the Regents in favor of the
proposed Zoological Park, the members of the Board in the Senate and
House were requested to urge the passage of the bill by Congress as
speedily as possible.

The Secretary stated that a reference had been made at the last an-
nual meeting of a bill introduced in the Senate December 12, 1887, for
the erection of a bronze statue of the late Professor Baird. This bill
had passed the Senate unanimously February 9, 1888, and was referred
in the House to the Committee on Library, which had not made a re-
port.

Mr. Cox stated that if the bill came up for action in the House he
had no doubt it would be favorably acted on.

The Secretary made the following remarks:

The Smithsonian contribution to the Library of Congress now con-
sists of over a quarter of a million titles, forming a collection of its
kind absolutely unequaled in the world, created mainly out of the
Smithsonian income and practically a donation to the General Govern-
ment. Further, nearly a quarter of the Smithsonian yearly income is
indirectly devoted to the increment of this great collection.

It had been hoped that this collection would have been kept in a hall
distinct from other books in the Library of Congress, but the exigen-
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XVII

cies of the demand on the Librarian have caused it not only to be
crowded into insufficient space, but in an inaccessible room, so that the
collection is not seen and in no way recalls the source of its contribu-
tion, and to the general public its very existence is unknown.

In the new Library of Congress building adequate space will pre-
sumably be provided for its preservation and increase, but if if seems
fit to the Regents that a distinct hall or halls shall be devoted to it,
and that they shall also in their construction and decoration not only
be worthy of the contents, but recall that the collection is due to the
Smithsonian fund, the following resolution is submitted :

Resolved, That since the Smithsonian deposit now numbers over
250,000 titles, and is still increasing at the cost of the Institution, it is,
in the opinion of the Regents, desirable that in the new building for
the Library of Congress sufficient provision shall be made for its
accommodation and increase in a distinet hall or halls, worthy of the
collections, and such as, while recalling to the visitor the name of
Smithson, shall provide such facilities for those consulting the volumes
as will aid in his large purpose of the diffusion of knowledge among
men.

On motion of General Meigs, the resolution was adopted.

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to the act recently
passed by Cungress (approved by the President, January 4, 1889), to
incorporate the American Historical Association, and providing that
said association shall report annually to the Secretary of the Smithson-
ian Institution its proceedings, ete., who at his discretion shall com-
municate the same to Congress, and further authorizing the Regentsof
the Institution to receive on deposit the collections, papers, etc., of the
said association.

On motion of Mr. Cuilom, it was

Resolved, That the American Historical Association be and hereby is
permitted to deposit its collections, manuscripts, books, pamphlets, and
other material for history in the Smithsonian Institution or in the Na-
tional Museum, in accordance with the provisions of the act of incor

poration, and that the conditions of said deposit shall be determined
by the Secretary, with the approval of the executive committee.

On motion of Mr. Cullom, the Board adjourned sine die.

REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS
OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

(For the year ending 30th of June, 1889.)

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Institution, the appropriations by Con-
gress for the National Museum and other purposes, and the receipts and

Congress (act of February 8, 1867) the residuary legacy of Smithson
and savings from annual income and other sources, $134,831. To this
$1,000 have been added by a bequest of James Hamilton, $500 by a

As this amount has been expended by the Smithsonian Institution
in carrying on the system of exchanges over and above the amounts
heretofore appropriated for its support by Congress, your committee
respectfully recommends that Congress be requested to make appro-
priation to re-imburse the Smithson fund.

Your committee also refers to the last report of the Secretary, which
states that up to 1880, inclusive, the Institution had paid $92,386.29
for exchanges, of which it is estimated that more than two-thirds were
on Government account, for which the Government paid nothing
whatever. Since the year 1880 the service has cost $96,065.85, of
which the Government has paid $57,500, leaving nearly $40,000 of the
cost to be borne by the Smithsonian Institution, and this exclusive of
the rent of the rooms, which represents about $3,000 a year in addition.

NORTH AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithsonian income during the year ending 30th June, 1889, all of
which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, or, in his
absence, of the assistant secretary as acting Secretary, and a certifi-
cate that the materials and services charged were applied to the pur-
poses of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the “international
exchanges,” and of the ‘National Museum,” and finds that the bal-
ances above given correspond with the certificates of the disbursing
clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as such dis:
bursing officer was accepted, and his bonds approved, by the Secretary
of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers and-journals, have been
examined and found correct.

The abstracts of expenditures and balance sheets under the appro-
priation for ‘‘ North American ethnology” have been exhibited to us;
the vouchers for the expenditures, after approval by the Director of
the Bureau of Ethnology, are paid by the disbursing clerk of said Bu-
reau, and after- approval by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion are transmitted to the accounting officers of the Treasury Depart-
ment for settlement. The disbursing officer of the Bureau is accepted
as such and his bonds approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.
The balance available tu meet outstanding liabilities on Ist July, 1889,
as reported by the disbursing clerk of the Bureau, is $13,491.22.

SPECIAL MEETING OF THE REGENTS.

WASHINGTON, D. C., November 18, 1887.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian In-
stitution was held this day at the Institution at half past 10 o’clock
A. M. |

Present, Hon. Morrison R. WAtrsE, Chief Justice of the United
States, Chancellor of the Institution; Hon. Jonn J. INGALLS, Presi-
dent of the Senate of the United States ; Hon. Justin S. MoRRILL, Hon.
SHELBY M. CuLLomM, Hon. WILLIAM L. WILSON, Prof. ASA GRAY,
Prof. HENRY COPPEE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, Gen. MONTGOMERY
C. MEras, Prof. JAMES B. ANGELL.

The Chancellor stated that the present meeting had been called in
accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress organizing the
Institution, at the request of three of the Regents which had been
made to the Acting Secretary in the following communication :

Sik: Ata meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board of Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution, November 3, 1887, the following
preamble and resolutions were adopted :

Whereas, the death of Professor Baird, the honored Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, occurred at a time in the last summer when
from the absence of certain Regents in Europe, and from. the dispersion
of others in different parts of the country, it was found impracticable
to summon the Board of Regents in extraordinary session, that it might
take appropriate action in the premises under the immediate pressure
of that deplorable event; and

Whereas, the time bas now come when such an extraordinary meet-
ing is practicable, and is believed to be required alike by the proprie-
ties and by the possible exigencies of the situation resulting from the
lamented death of the late Secretary: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the Acting Secretary of the Institution be requested
tocall a special meeting of the Board of Regents to be held on Friday,
November 18, at 10:30 A. M.

The Chancellor read the following letter from Dr. Noah Porter, one
of the Regents :

YALE COLLEGE, November 14, 1887.

DEAR Str: I had made all necessary arrangements to be present at.
the meeting of the Regents which has been called for the 18th instant,
when I was summoned to respond to another engagement of long stand-
ing, the time for which was fixed on the same day. I regret that 1 can

not be present at Washington as it would give me very great satisfac-
tion to honor the memory of our late distinguished Seeretary for the
singular fidelity, forecast, and devotion with which he has discharged
the manifold duties of this office, and the eminent success which has
crowned his enterprising labors. Under his administration the Smith-
sonian Institution has enlarged its sphere of usefulness and activity
and has established itself most firmly in the confidence and esteem of
the American people. The direct services which the late Secretary
rendered to the wealth and welfare of the American people through
his connection with the Fish Commission and the honor which he
gained for his country abroad are too well known to need any com-
ment, while his personal simplicity and integrity are above all praise.

Very respectfully,

NOAH PORTER,
S. P. LANGLEY, Esq.,
Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Chancellor, Chief Justice Waite, then madethe following re-
marks :

GENTLEMEN OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS: It is my sad duty to
announce to you the death of Spencer Fullerton Baird, LL. D., the
Secretary of the Institution, at Wvod’s Holl, Mass., on the 19th day of
August last. Professor Baird wasappointed by the lamented Professor
Henry, while Secretary of the Institution, on the 5th of July, 1850,
under the authority of this Board, to the office of Assistant Secretary
“in the department of natural history, to take charge of the Museum,
and to render such other assistance as the Secretary may require.”
He entered at once on the performance of his duties, and until the *
death of Professor Henry, nearly 28 years afterwards, filled his place
with great ability, and to the entire satisfaction of his distinguished
chief and of the Regents.

Professor Henry died on the !3th of May, 1878, and on the 17th of
the same month Professor Baird was unanimously chosen his successor
as Secretary of the Institution. From that day until he died he was
faithful to every duty of his high office, and devoted himself untiringly
to giving effect to the will of our munificent founder by the * increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

As his death occurred when some of you were absent in Europe, and
others away in different parts of this country, it was found impracti-
cable to get an extraordinary meeting of the Board to take action upon
the deplorable event at that time. We have now met for that purpose
and I invite your special attention to the subject.

Senator Justin 8. Morrill moved that Prof.S. P. Langley be appointed
to fill the vacancy in the office of Secretary created by the death of
Professor Baird.

It having been represented that the Executive Committee had pre-
pared a minute of proceedings to be submitted to the Board, and that
paper having been called for, it was read by the chairman, Dr. J.C.
Welling:
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XXXIX

“The Executive Committee beg leave respectiully to represent that in
the preamble and resolution accompanying the call of the Acting Secre-
tary for the present extraordinary meeting of the Board of Regents, they
suppose themselves to have sufficiently set forth the reasons why this
call has been so long delayed ; the reasons which dictate the expediency
of holding an extraordinary meeting at the present time, and therefore
the objects which may properly engage the attention of the Board in
view of the proprieties and exigencies of the situation resulting from
the lamented death of the late Secretary.

Cherishing for the late Professor Baird the profound regard inspired
by his talents, by his great attainments, by his life-work in the cause
of science, and by his distinguished services to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and not doubting that this sentiment is shared by every mem-
ber of the Board, your committee have thought that it was due alike
to the memory of the departed Secretary whom we all held in high-
est honor, and to our own sense of the loss which the scientific world
im common with this Institution has sustained in his death, that we
should proceed, at the earliest practicable day, to take that appropri-
ate action in the premises which is dictated by our intimate official and
personal relations with the departed Secretary, and by a sincere desire
on our part to testify and record our heartfelt admiration of the great
and good man whose death we deplore.

With regard to any exigencies, actual or contingent, resulting from
the death of the late Secretary, it does not need to be said that first im
order and first in importance stands the electing of a Secretary. Though
the transactions had by the Board at the last annual meeting, in the
appointment of the Assistant Secretary, who is now the Acting Secretary
of the Institution, may have simplified the solution of this problem so
far as we are concerned, yet there are obvious considerations of delicacy
which, in the case of a sensitive and refined nature like that of the
eminent man in question, must preclude him from acting with official
freedom, and with a full sense of executive authority, until the mind of
the Board shall have been definitely declared with regard to the sue.
cession in this most responsible office; and in the mean time he natu-
rally shrinks from doing aught in his office which may seem to conclude
the final action of the Board in the premises.

As to any possible exigencies which may have arisen in consequence
of the multiplied engagements of the late Secretary, who, besides his
duties as the executive officer of the Smithsonian Institution, was also
charged with the direction of the U.S. National Museum, of the Bu-
reau of Ethnology, and of the U.S. Fish Commission, we beg leave to
say that certain important questions of future policy, deeply concern
ing the prosperity of the Institution and the cause of American science,
may possibly be thrust upon the Board at this juncture in a way to cali
for careful consideration, if not for immediate decision.

It is known to us all that Prof. Joseph Henry, the first Secretary and
XL JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

the organizer of the Smithsonian Institution,entertained the settled opin-
ion thatits operations“ should be mingled as littie as possible with those
of the Government ;” that the funds of the Institution, being specifically
devoted by theterms of Smithson’s bequest to a prescribed object,should
not be diverted to other objects, and that consequently the activities of
the Secretary should not be engrossed by other engagements which, from
their nature or from the administrative cares incident to their manage-
ment, might be judged to impair the distinctive singleness and highest
efficiency of the Institution in laboring for ‘‘the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” He a'so held that the necessity laid upon
the Institution of making annual appeals to Congress for the support
and extension of adjuncts not essential to the conduct of its own special
operations is a necessity which should be avoided as far as practicable
in the interests of a dignified and single-minded administration of the
Smithson trast; and hence he thought it desirable that some more defi-
nite distinction should be made between the Smithsonian Institution and
the National Museum, if on the whole it should be judged best to re-
tain them under acommon jurisdiction. His own judgment inclined in
favor of their entire separation. In the presence of additional engage-
ments so vast, multiform, and important as those involved in the con-
duct of the Fish Commission, it is obvious that these opinions of Pro-
fessor Henry would have gained an added emphasis.

The late Secretary, Professor Baird, while acquiescing in the strict
views of Professor Henry with regard to the precise terms of the Smith-
sonian bequest, and while faithfully working, within the proper sphere
of the Smithsonian Institution, on the general lines laid down by his
predecessor, did not, it is presumed, entirely share Professor Henry’s
opinions as to the reflex influence and effect exerted by the adjuncts in
question upon the normal function and legitimate fame of the Smithson-
ian Institution. Endowed with a wonderful capacity for administrative
detail, and capable of inspiring his subordinates with enthusiam in their
work and with loyalty to their official chief, he doubtless saw in these
manifold adjuncts of the Institution only so many auxiliaries to its be-
neficent design (“ the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men”),
and therefore only so many additional accessories to its usefulness and
glory.

Set as your committee are to execute the will of the Regents and not
at all to define the scope or policy of the Institution, if would obviously
be impertinent on our part to essay any prejudgments on the questions
that may be raised by the existing attitude of the Institution consid-
ered in the kind or degree of its relations to the National Museum, to
the Bureau of Ethnology, and to the Fish Commission. The former
two of these adjuncts are parts and parcel of our jurisdiction, while the
latter from its inception was placed under the responsible management
of the late Secretary, and is now under the direction of Assistant Sec-
retary Goode.
- JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XLI

But while we can not venture on any definitions of policy (all ques:
tions of policy having been left by us in abeyance), we may properly re-
call to the recollection of the Board one great leading principle which
has prevailed in the administration of the Institution from its begin.
ning down to the present day; that principle is, that the Secretary 1s
charged with plenary power in his office, and therefore with an entire
and undivided responsibility for the right and proper administration
of the Smithson trust. That trust gives to him the reason of his offi-
cial being, and it is conferred by the Regents, without restrictions of
their own, because of the confidence reposed in the ability, integrity,
and discretion of the Secretary. Hence any change of policy which
should require a division of responsibility because of a multiplicity or
heterogeneity of operations, would work an entire change in the theory
of our administration, would break up the continuity of our history,
and might seriously jeopard the efficiency of the Institution by marring
jts harmony and unity. This harmony and this unity of operations
would therefore seem to require the establishment of a permanent and
definite line of policy to be pursued by the Institution as far as pos-
sible without break and without chasm because of changes occurring
in its executive head.

It is obvious that anything like a fundamental revision and reconsti-
tution of the proper work and proper relations of the Institution re-
curring periodically at the death of each Secretary would be fraught
with serious detriment to its usefulness and to its fame. But if the
specific nature and at the same time the ensemble of its general opera-
tions can be maintained, it would seem that those operations may re-
ceive any addition or undergo any extension which shall be found
compatible with prudent and efficient administration under a single
head. + How far, therefore, the ties which now bind the Institution to
the National Museum, to the Bureau of Ethnology, and to certain sei-
entific aspects of the Fish Commission, should be tightened or loosened
is a question of expediency to be determined by a careful analysis and
a deliberate weighing of all the elements involved in the problem set
before us—that is, by considering and judging how far each and all
of these adjuncts may be made ancillary to the proper work of the
Smithsonian Institution under the conduct of a single responsible ex-
ecutive officer.

It is with these general convictions, and with the view of bringing
more definitely before you the subject-matters which would seem to
call for deliberation at this extraordinary session, that we venture tosub-
mit the following resolutions to your consideration, some of which, it
will be seen, are suggested as mere starting points for discussion :

1. Resolved, That a committee of three Regents be appointed to draft
resolutions expressive of the exalted admiration cherished by the Board
for the late Spencer F. Baird, LL. D., our gratitude for the long, faith-
ful, and abundant labors which he performed in the service of this In-
stitution, our reverence for his memory, and our profound sense of the
loss which the cause of science has sustained in his lamented death,
XLII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

2, Resolved, That this Board do now proceed at once to the election of
a Secretary to fill the vacancy created by the death of Professor Baird,
and that the rights, powers, aud duties of the Secretary thus elected,
as well as his salary and emoluments, shall be the same as those pre-
scribed by the existing regulations.

3. Resolved, That the newly appointed Secretary is hereby requested
to make report in writing at the coming annual meeting, on any changes
which may seem to him desirable in the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution considered in its relations to the National Museum, to the
Bureau of Ethnology, and to such scientific aspects of the Fish Com-
mission as he may deem germane to the proper theory of the Institu-
tion, avd which shall be capable of reduction under its wise and effi-
cient administration—that is, to consider and report how far the existing
relations between all or any of these adjuncts and the Smithsonian In-
stitution should be increased, altered, diminished, or abolished in order
the better to promote the original and organic design of the Institution
as established by Congress.

4. Resolved, That a committee of three shall be designated by the
Chair, to be composed of one Regent appointed from the Senate, one
Regent appointed from the House of Representatives, and one Regent
appointed from the States, whose duty it shall be to investigate and
consider all the questions that may be suggested by the nature or ex-
tent of the relations now subsisting between the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and anyor all of the other objects and adjuncts which are now
more or less definitely and completely under its administration, or un-
der the personal administration of its Assistant Secretary; that the said
committee, in maturing their views, be invited freely and frankly to
acquaint themselves with the opinions and judgments of the Secretary,
who, to this end, is hereby requested to communicate to the said com-
mittee, in the first instance, any recommendations which he shall sub-
mit in pursuance of the preceding resolution ; and, finally, that the said
committee be instructed to report to the Board at the annual meeting
appointed to take place on the 18th of January next, a digest of any
additional plans, policies or methods of administration which they shall
judge expedient in order to meet any adjustment of relations that shall
seem to be required by the best interests of the Institution committed
to our charge.”

The first resolution in the foregoing series was then taken up for con-
sideration, and on motion of Dr. Gray it was adopted.

Messrs. Gray, Ingalls, and Welling were appointed a committee to
draft resolutions in honor of the late Secretary, and that committee,
through its chairman, Dr. Gray, reported the following preamble and
series of resolutions :

Whereas in the dispensation of Divine Providence, the mortal life of
SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD was ended on the 19th of August last,
the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, now at the earliest practi-
cable moment assembled, desire to express and record their profound
sense of the great loss which this Institution has thereby sustained,
any which they personally have sustained, and they accordingly re-
solve—

1. That iv the lamented death of Professor Baird the Institution is
bereaved of its honored and efficient Secretary, who has faithfully and
unremittingly devoted to its service his rare administrative abilities for
thirty-seven years; that is, almost from the actual foundation of the
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XLIil

establishment, for the Jast nine years as its chief executive officer, under
whose sagacious management it has greatly prospered and widely ex-
tended its usefulness and its renown.

2. That the National Museum, of which this Institution is the admin-
istrator, and the Fish Commission, which is practically affiliated to it—
both organized and in a just Sense created by our late Secretary—are by
this bereavement deprived of the invaluable and unpaid services of their
indefatigable ofticial head.

3. That the cultivators of science, both in this country and abroad,
have to deplore the loss of a veteran and distinguished naturalist, who
was from early years a sedulous and successful investigator, whose
native gifts and whose eXperience in systematic biological work served
inno small degree to adapt him to the administrative duties which
filled the later years of his life, but whose knowledge and whose interest
in science widened and deepened as his opportunities for special investi-
gation lessened, and who accordingly used his best endeavors to pro-
mote the researches of his fellow naturalists in every part of the world.

4. That his kindly disposition, equable temper, singleness of aim,
and unsullied purity of motive, along with his facile mastery of affairs,
greatly endeared him to his subordinates, secured tohim the confidence é
and trust of those whose influence he sought for the advancement of
the interests he had at heart, and won the | high regard and warm affec-
tion of those who, like the members of this ‘Board, were Officially and
intimately associated with him.

5. That without intruding into the domain of private sorrow the Re-

gents of the Institution would respectfully offer to the family of their
late Secretary the assurance of their profound sympathy.
6. That the Regents invite the near associate of the late Secretary,
Professor Goode, to prepare a memorial of the life and services of Pro-
fessor Baird for publication in the ensuing annual report of the Institu-
tion.

The resolutions were seconded by Dr. Coppée, who made the following
remarks:

Mr. Chancellor, I rise to second the resolutions.

As IT have been to some extent associated with Professor Baird as
Regent since 1874, when I found him here as Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, to which post he was appointed in 1850, it
may be proper that I should ask your patience while I add a single
word to the eloquent tribute of just eulogium offered to his memory
in the resolutions of Professor Gray and the committee.

When the distinguished Professor Henry was called to his rest and
reward in 1878, amid tokens of grief in yonder Capitol, there was a
hearty concurrence of voices in the Board of Regents to appoint Pro-
fessor Baird to the vacant place. At that time, sir, it seemed, in con-
tradiction of the maxim of the French philosopher, that he was a neces-
sary man. His large scientific scope, his great knowledge and success
as a specialist in natural history just when that branch of science
needed particular attention to meet its expanding claims, his wonder-
ful industry, his intimate acquaintance with the system and the details
of the Institution, his thorough and brotherly sympathy with its scien-
tific workers, and, withal, his great and increasing reputation, formed;
XLIV - JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

in the view of the Regents, the strongest grounds for his appointment.
Without making comparisons, he was eminently worthy to succeed our
earlier and illustrious scientist and Secretary.

Earnest, courteous, painstaking and exact, he allowed the Institution
to suffer no detriment at his hands. It is specially significant of his
unremitting care for it, that, last year when he was suffering from nerv-
ous prostration, in his eagerness to provide for its future welfare he
asked the Board to appoint an assistant, who should aid him in his
onerous labors, and who, in the event of his permanent disability or
death, should assume the government of the Institution until the Board
of Regents could take action.

Sir, the sad necessity came far too soon. It has called us together
to-day to mourn his loss, recall his virtues and merits, and fill his
vacant place.

The Smithsonian Institution, which had but one Secretary betore
him, will in the flight of time have many. Let me conclude by express-
ing my conviction that among them there will not be a more excellent
Secretary than he, nor a nobler character than that of Spencer Fuller-
ton Baird.

The resolutions were then unanimously adopted by arising vote.

The second of the foregoing resolutions was then adopted, and im-
mediately thereupon Senator Morrill renewed the nomination of Pro-
fessor Langley as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The motion was seconded by Dr. Welling.

In rising to second the motion, Dr. Welling said that he had it in
charge from Professor Langley to make to the Board on his behalf a
certain representation which seemed to him (Professor Langley) to be
due in order that the pending question might be considered with entire -
eandor and freedom on all sides. Dr. Welling said that it was well under-
stood that Professor Langley had been nominated by the late Secretary
as an assistant secretary of the Institution because of the eminent
ability he had shown and the distinguished reputation he had already
gained as an original investigator in an important branch of physical
science. The achievements which Professor Langley had made in astro-
nomical physics were of a nature to shed luster on his name and do high
honor to American science. It would bea great loss to the cause of
science and a great loss to the best interests of this Institution if the
capacity for original research thus demonstrated by Professor Langley
should be smothered by the mere drudgery of official cares and admin-
istrative details. It might be proper to state that Professor Langley
had brought himself to entertain the proposition now pending before
the Board only after much misgiving on his own part, and after much ear-
nest remonstrance on the part of the friends who knew him best as a
scientific worker, and who feared that in accepting this office, dignified
and inviting as it is, he might be making a mistake for the interests of
science and for himself by sacrificing even higher duties and foregoing
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XLV

even higher honors than those awaiting him as director of this Insti-
tution.

Now however that the question of the succession in the office of the
Secretary had been precipitated at an earlier date than we all had ex-
pected when he was chosen an assistant secretary, Professor Langley
held that it was due to the Board and due to himself that he should
frankly state the understanding with which he had finally brought him-
self to the belief that it was his duty to accept the office of Secretary if
it should be conferred upon him by the Board. This understanding was
that while, if called to such a responsible trust, he must needs give with
all fidelity and with all conscientiousness the full measure of time,
thought, and care which shall seem to be required by the Institution
and by its adjuncts, he did not construe this obligation as precluding
the possibility of sometimes giving to himself that physical rest and
mental diversion which should come to every man whois burdened
with the discharge of an exacting office. Professor Langley had
doubtless observed that the first Secretary of the Institution, Professor
Henry, had sougit such rest and such diversion in the change of labor
brought to him by the chairmanship of the Light-House Board, and in
the performance of this function we all knew that Professor Henry had
done good work for the cause of science (as wituess his researches in
sound and in the economies of light-house illuminants), and therefore a
work which had redounded to the honor of the Smithsonian Institution.

Professor Langley had also observed, we may presume, that the late
Secretary, with the approval of this Board, had engaged in great and
useful labors connected with the Fish-Commission, and that hence in
our judgment there was no incompatibility in the pursuit by our Secre-
tary of certain labors extraneous to the immediate precinets of the In-
stitution, if they could be pursued without detriment to its best efficiency
and to the full development of its capacity for usefulness. It was in
this view that Professor Langley begged leave to represent that he, too,
might sometimes wish to find rest and refreshment in a change of labor
from the ordinary routine of official administration in connection with
the Institution, and he would naturally look for such rest and refresh-
ment in the further pursuit of his favorite scientific researches, so far,
and only so far, as that pursuit could be made consistent with his para-
mount duty to the Smithsonian Institution.

Dr. Welling then added that, speaking for himself as a member of the
Board, he felt free to express the conviction that these “ leisure labors”
would serve to enhance the title of Professor Langley to the Director-
Ship of an Institution which had for its object “ the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men;” and while the statement thus made
at the instance of Professor Langley might have seemed to be required
by an honorable frankness on his part, the Board would be likely to
find in this frankness a further ground of confidence in the high sense
of honor and duty which he would bring to the discharge of his respon-
XLVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS,

sible office. We might therefore trust with the full assurance of faith
that the Institution in his case, as in the case of his distinguished
predecessors, would be only the gainer by such intervals of rest as he
might seek in the interest of his health, and by such vicissitudes of
labor as he might seek in the interest alike of this Institution and of his
chosen studies. Such intervals of rest, orat least such variety of labor,
were especially necessary to a man who is placed under stress and pres-
Sure of heavy administrative cares, like those devolved on the Directcr
of this Institution, and the Board had in the character of Professor
Langley the best possible guaranty that he could be freely trusted to
decide all such questions of duty according to a delicate and conscien-
tious sense of right.

The Board then proceeded to ballot for the election of Secretary. Ten
votes were cast, all of which were found to be for Professor Langley,
who was thereupon declared by the Chancellor to be duly elected as
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

After some discussion upon the remaining two resolutions in the fore-
going series as reported by the executive committee—a discussion par-
ticipated in by Messrs. Morrill, Welling, Gray, Coppée, and others—
ihe resolutions were withdrawn.

Dr. Welling was appointed to inform Professor Langley of his elec-
tion, and having done so, he was introduced to the Board, and in a few
remarks expressed his acceptance of the office of Secretary with a solemn
sense of the responsibility devolved upon him, and high appreciation
of the honor which had been conferred.

Dr. Welling offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Whereas the remains of the late Prof. Spencer F. Baird have not yet
been committed to their last resting place; and

Whereas this solemn ceremonial has been postponed at the request
of members of this Board and others, that the friends of the late Secre-
tary in Congress might have the opportunity of testifying by their pres-
ence at his grave the respect in which they held him while living, and
their reverence for his memory now that he is no more: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the Secretary of the Institution, after conference with
Mrs. Baird, be requested to issue public notice of the time and place
which shall be appointed for these funeral services, and to send a spe-
cial notice to the members of the Smithsonian Establishment and of
the Board of Regents.

On motion of General Meigs it was—

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to call the annual meet-
ing of the Board for the present year at the time fixed for the funeral
of Professor Baird.

On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to purchase the oil por-
trait of Professor Baird, painted by Henry Ulke, now exhibited to the
Regents, at a cost not to exceed $300.

The Board then adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.
REPORT OF 8. P. LANGLEY,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889.

To the. Board of Regents of the Smithsonian I nstitution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present the report upon the oper-
ations of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1889,
together with the customary summary of the work performed by the
Bureau of Exchanges, the National Museum, and the Bureau of Eth-
nology.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

As the Annual Reports of the Secretary are intended to present a
history of the affairs of the Institution, it seems proper to state that by
the appointment of the Hon. Melville W. Fuller as Chief Justice of the
United States, the latter became ev officio a regent of the Institution,
and that at the annual meeting of the Board of Regents, held on the
9th of January, 1889, he was unanimously elected its chancellor.

The Hon. Levi P. Morton has become a Regent by his election as
Vice-President, the holder of that high office being ex officio a Regent
of the Institution.

The terms of Senator 8S. M. Cullom, appointed March 23, 1885, and
Senator R. L. Gibson, appointed December 10, 1887, having expired on
March 3 of the present year, those gentlemen were re-appointed by the
President of the Senate.

The Board has lost from its number by death the Hon. 8. 8S. Cox, long
connected with the Institution; but this event having occurred since the
expiration of the year which forms the subject of this report, the re-
marks called out by this great loss will be more properly made in a later
communication.

FINANCES.

[ have in my last report referred to the fact that owing to the chang-
ing value of money, the purchasing power of the Smithsonian fund, in
the language of a committee of the Regents—

‘“while nominally fixed, is growing actually less year by year, and of
less and less importance in the work it accomplishes with reference to
H. Mis, 224 if l

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the immense extension of the country since the Government accepted
the trust ;”

so that it seems most desirable that the fund should be enlarged, if only
to represent the original position of its finances relatively to those of
the country and institutions of learning, and nothing has occurred in the
course of the last year which does not rather increase than diminish the
force of such an observation. It is on the Congressional Regents that
the Institution must largely depend for making its wants known to
Congress, and with reference to the suggestion that the Smithsonian
fund should be enlarged by re-contribution from the Government as well
as from contributions from private individuals, I desire to repeat the
remark of Professor Henry, made in 1872, to the effect that the Govern-
ment, in equity, should then have paid the Institution $300,000 for the
use of the present building. This building, erected wholly out of Smith-
sonian funds, at the cost of over half a million dollars, has, with the
exception of a small portion, continued to be used rent free by the
Government ever since that time.

I recall briefly in this connection the well known facts that the will
of James Smithson was made on October 23, 1826, and that by an act
of Congress approved July 1, 1836, the bequest was accepted, while
under the act of August 10, 1846, a definite plan of organization was
adopted, and that finally, by the act of February 8, 1867, the Regents
were authorized to add to the Smithsonian fund such other sum as they
might see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the
sum of $1,000,000.

The original bequest and the sums since added are as follows:

Bequest of Smithson, 1846 ..--...----- .----+ -- 2220 eee c ee oe teen ee eee eee $515, 169. 00

Total permanent Smithsonian fund in the Treasury of the United
States, bearing interest at 6 per cent. per annum........---.---- 703, 000. 00
There may, therefore, be added to the fund nearly $300,000, on which
the Institution is entitled to receive 6 per cent. under the act of February,
1867, while it has received in bequests only the insignificant sum of
$1,500. This is in striking contrast to the liberality which is understood
to have endowed more than one American institution of learning within
this time with something like ten times the amount of the entire Smith-
sonian fund. No institution in the country, it is believed, enjoys wider
measure of public confidence or is more universally known, and it would
seem that some action might well be taken to bring these facts before
those who are seeking a trustee for the disposition of means intended
for the advancement of knowledge.
In this connection, however, it seems proper to invite the attention of
the Regents to the circumstances of the bequest of James Hamilton,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. o

who donated $1,000 to the Institution in 1874, the interest on which was
to be appropriated biennially for a contribution, paper, or lecture on a
scientific or useful subject. Your former Secretary, Prof. Joseph Henry,
in bis report for 1874, states that—

“The first,installment of interest on the Hamilton bequest has just
been received, and will be appropriated in accordance with the will of
the testator at the end of next year, and so on continually at the end of
every two years.”

And he adds—

‘A statement of the manner of spending this income will be given in
the accounts of the operations of the institution with due credit to the

donor. His name will therefore appear from time to time in the annual
reports and thus be kept in perpetual remembrance.”

Professor Henry continues, in this connection:

‘When the public shall become more familiar with the manner in
which the income of the additional bequests to the Smithsonian fund
is expended, with the permanence and security of the investment, and
with the means thus afforded of advancing science and of perpetuating
the names of the testators, we doubt not that additions to the fund in
this way will be made until it reaches the limit prescribed by law of
$1,000,000.”

Owing, perhaps, to the small amount of this bequest, the intent of
the Secretary does not appear to have been fulfilled. No contribution,
paper, or lecture seems to have ever been furnished, biennially or other-
wise, and with the exception of the exploration of certain bone caves,
mentioned in the report of the Secretary for 1876, the income has
remained unexpended.

I shall have elsewhere to speak of the great loss the Institution has
sustained in the death of Dr. J. H. Kidder, curator of exchanges; but
I refer to it here only in connection with a bequest made by him, con-
stituting the Institution one of his residuary legatees. This bequest,
the terms of which are still awaiting the consideration of the Regents,
will be more properly described, in detail, after their action upon it,
which can not well form a portion of the present report.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand of the income
from the fund was $4,809.23. The interest has been $42,180, while
from miscellaneous sources $3,760.53 have been received. The total
expenditures have been $38,992.29, leaving on July 1, 1889, $11,757.47,
a somewhat larger balance than usual, which has been retained to meet
certain delayed expenditures.

The Institution is charged by Congress with the disbursement of
sundry appropriations through the Secretary, as follows:

The vouchers for the expenditures from the appropriations are passed
upon by the executive committee of the Board of Regents with the ex-
ception of those for ethnological researches. The disbursements from
the latter appropriation are made under the direction of Major Powell.

The estimates prepared to be submitted for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1889, were as follows:

Of the first of these items, that of international exchanges, urgent rep-
resentations were made to Congress to the effect that though it had as-
sumed the charge of this, the expenditures of the Bureau (whose work
largely consists of the transportation of Government documents) con-
tinue to be met, in part, from the private fund of the Institution, but, as
will be seen, no change in this respect has been made.

The estimates prepared to be submitted for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1890, were as follows:

International exchanges.—Twenty-seven thousand and five hundred
dollars was asked for; the House committee reported $15,000; the Sen-
ate committee $20,000; and the amount finally appropriated was
15,000.

North American Ethnology.—The appropriation asked for this service
was $50,000. The House reported $40,000 ; the Senate made no change
and the amount of the appropriation remained as reported by the House.

Preservation of Collections, U. S. National Museum.—The appropria-
tion asked for this service was $160,000. The House committee reported
$135,000; the Senate committee $145,000. The amount finally appro-
priated was $140,000.

Furniture and Fixtures, U. S. National Museum.—An estimate of
$35,000 was submitted. The House committee reported $30,000; the
Senate committee also reported $30,000 and this amount was appropri-
ated.

Heating and Lighting, U. 8. National Museum.—The appropriation
asked for this purpose was $12,000. This amount was agreed to by
the House and Senate committees. There is a deficiency of $1,000 for
the purchase of coal.

Living Animals, U. S. National Museum.—An estimate of $5,000 was
submitted for this service. The House did not report the same.

Postage-Stampsand Foreign Postal-Cards, U. S. National Museum.—An
appropriation of $1,000 was asked for this service. ‘The same was
reported from the Senate favorably, where it originated, and passed
the House.

Publications, U. 8S. National Musewm.—An estimate of $15,000 was
submitted for this service. The House reported $10,000; the Senate
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

committee reported $12,000; and in conference the amount as reported
by the House was agreed upon.

In my last report I stated that it was desirable that the appropria-
tions for the Museum should be made under the direction of the Insti-
tution, and no longer under the Department of the Interior, and I gave
a correspondence with the honorable the Secretary of the Interior upon
the subject. I am happy to state that the Seeretary’s assent being
given the appropriations were transferred by Congress to the care of the
Institution, and are now disbursed under direction of the Regents by
a disbursing clerk in the Institution, whose bonds have been accepted by
the Treasury Department.

A detailed statement of the expenditures for the fiscal year 1889,
under appropriations for International Exchanges, North American
Ethnology, and the National Museum is given in the report of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

BUILDINGS.

.

It will be remembered that the Board of Regents in their meeting
January 17, 1885, recommended to Congress the erection of a new
building planned exclusively for museum purposes, and tbe steps taken
in pursuance of their instructions were laid before the Regents in my
last report, but I regret now to be unable to report any further progress.

The necessity for additional space for the storage of collections, inde-
pendent of that demanded for exhibition purposes, is constantly be-
coming greater, while the assignment by the last Congress to the Fish
Commission of the principal parts of the rooms occupied by the Mu-
seum in the Armory building has still further aggravated the crowded
condition of the Museum exhibition halls and storage rooms, and I
deem it my duty again to urge the necessity of the erection of a new
building, if only for such requirements of storage as may be inferred
from the following statements :

Since the erection of the present Museum building there have been
nearly 14,000 accessions to the Museum, chiefly by gifts, such ‘ aecces-
sions” representing frequently collections, and the collections including,
in many cases, thousands of specimens. From the year 1859 to 1880
the accessions numbered 8,475. It is thus evident that during the last
nine years the accessions have exceeded by more than 5,000 those of the
previous twenty-one years.

Among the more recent collections are several of very great extent,
such as the bequest of the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which con-
tains 20,000 specimens of shells, besides minerals and other objects;
the Jeffries collection of fossil and recent shells of Europe, including
40,000 specimens; the Stearns collection of mollusks, numbering 100,-
000 specimens; the Riley collection of insects, containing 150,000 speci-
mens; the Catlin collection of Indian paintings, about 500 in number ;
the collection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

transportation of which to Washington several freight-cars were re-
quired; the Shepard collection of meteorites; the Wilson collection of
archeological objects, nore than 12,000 specimens ; the Lorrillard col-
lection of Central American antiquities, and very many others nearly
as extensive.

In addition to these are the extensive collections obtained at the close
of the exhibition in Berlin, London, and New Orleans, the annually in-
creasing collections transferred to the Museum by the U.S. Geological
Survey, the U. S. Fish Commission, and the Bureau of Ethnology, be-
sides numerous contributions resulting from Government expeditions
as well as those made by officers of the Army and Navy, and other
Government officials.

The storage Sheds contain many hundreds of boxes of valuable ma-
terial which we have not room to unpack, and the great vaults under
the Smithsonian building, and many of the attic and tower rooms are
similarly crowded.

The growth of several of the most important departments in the
Museum is seriously retarded owing to the fact that no exhibition space
is available for the collections, and that there is not even storage room
where incoming material can be properly cared for.

The collection of birds, which so far as North America is concerned,
is the finest in the world, and now numbers nearly 60,000 specimens, is
very inadequately shown, and requires double the case room now avail-
able.

The collection of mollusks, which is one of the most complete in the
world, and contains nearly 470,000 specimens, is at present almost en-
tirely unprovided for.

The collection of insects, now numbering over 600,000 specimens, is
so far as North America is concerned, equally perfect, but is practically
without any exhibition space.

The same is equally true in regard to the collections of birds’ eggs
(more than 50,000 specimens), of reptiles (nearly 30,000 specimens), of
marine invertebrates (more than 515,000 specimens), of invertebrate
fossils (more than 160,000 specimens), and of fossil and recent plants
(nearly 50,000 specimens).

Many v waluale collections elsewhere than in Washington are at the
service of the Museum, but lack of space has compelled us to decline to
receive them.

It should be borne in mind that under the roofs of the Smithsonian
and the new Museum buildings are grouped together collections which,
in London, Paris, or any other of the European capitals, are provided
for in different museums, for the accommodation of which a much larger
number of equally commodious buildings is found needful.

The necessity for additional space then is constantly becoming greater,
and there is the further reason that by the action of the last Congress
the Armory building, assigned to the uses of the Museum in 1876, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ; q

for several years past occupied in part by the U. S. Fish Commission,
as a fish-hatching station, was assigned to this Commission for head-
quarters. It has been refitted as an office building, and is now almost
entirely relinquished by the Museum, four apartments on the third floor
being retained for the use of a part of the Museum taxidermists.

From the inadequate exposition of our needs just made, it will be
apparent that an extensive additional building is needed, if only for
storage, and where purposes of immediate exhibition are not in ques-
tion.

Irrespective of the construction of this proposed building, however,
I beg tourge the necessity of improving the lighting of the second floor
of the main hall of the Smithsonian building, and more particularly the
indispensability of fire-proofing the west wing, which I have already
urged upon the attention of the Regents, and concerning the latter of
which, one of their number, Senator Morrill, introduced a bill in the
Senate on June 12, 1888, which is referred to in my last report, and on
which no further action has been taken by Congress.

In regard to erections of minor importance, it may be mentioned that
it is intended to put up a small wooden building of one story, of a tem-
porary character, immediately south of the main building, as a cover
for the instruments, which at the same time will render it possible to
make certain observations pending the building of the proposed physi-
cal observatory, and this is more particularly alluded to under the fol-
lowing head of Research.

RESEARCH.

In my last report I spoke of the preparations made by the late Secre-
tary for securing an astro-physical observatory and laboratory of re-
search, and [ mentioned that through his action some friends of the
Institution had already offered to give the means for the erection of
the simple structure needed for the accommodation of such a special ob-
servatory. I added that the site would necessarily be suburban on ac-
count of the special need of seclusion and the absence of tremor in the
soil.

I have elsewhere referred to the collections of the Institution in con-
nection with the purchase by Congress of a zoological park, which it
would appear to have been the first intent of Congress to place under
the care of the Regents. It had been my hope in that case to place this
observatory somewhere in the park, but in view of the long delay which
has already arisen, and of the indefinite further delay which may occur,
I have thought it better to put a wooden structure of the simplest and
most temporary character in grounds immediately south of the Institu-
tion, although this site is quite unsuitable for a permanent building.
Such a shelter will probably be erected before the coming winter, and
will, while serving as a store-house for the apparatus, enable observa-
tions to be commenced.
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The promotion of original research has always in the history of the
Institution been regarded as one of its most important functions, and
the proper object of the personal attention of the Secretary ; and I shall
be very glad to do something in this direction on the most modest scale,
rather than incur the chance of indefinite farther delay.

In this connection I desire to say that a valuable collection of recently
constructed apparatus, most of it exactly suited to the wants of the
proposed laboratory, and which was the property of the late William
Thaw, of Pittsburgh, has been, by his wish and the consent of his ex-
ecutors, loaned to the Institution for use in this direction.

Comparatively few of the collections of the Institution or of the Museum —
have reference to the physical sciences. The apparatus collected by Pro-
fessor Henry, together with some few archaic instruments illustrating
the early history of methods of precision which I have added, are now
being placed in the south hall of the main building, and it will gratify
me to see this lead to accessions in illustration of the history of research
in all branches of science.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Smithsonian Institution has during the year enjoyed the valu-
able assistance of several persons who have expressed their willing-
ness to prosecute special researches in its behalf, or have generously
offered to allow the Museum to share in their results.

In embracing these opportunities it has been the policy of the Insti-
tution to endeavor to obtain information and, when possible, to secure
specimens, in regard to subjects in which the Museum collections
were most deficient, and thus to fill some of the most important gaps
in special collections rather than to obtain large collections of miscel-
Janeous material.

Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadelphia, visited the northern part of
Africa early in the present year, and, before going, kindly offered to make
special inquiries in regard to the civilization of the modern Arabs and
the natural history of the region, and to collect, if possible, linguistic
specimens. It was his intention to journey direct to Tangiers, thence
to Fez and Mequinez, continuing, if time permitted, as far as Mogador
and Morocco. Mr. Williams is familiar with the Arabic language,
which will greatly facilitate his investigations in that country. The re-
gion has rarely been visited by naturalists, and the Smithsonian Insti-
tution will no doubt obtain very important information, and probably
also some valuable collections. The special studies to which Mr. Will-
iams intends to devote himself are botany, geology, and archeology.
At the time of his arrival the North African flora was in flower, so that
his opportunities in the first direction were excellent. The geology
of Northern Africa is poorly represented in the National Museum, and
characteristic rocks and photographs of feature of physical geology
will be very acceptable. The subject of most importance to the Smith-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

sonian Institution, however, is the archeology of this region, and it is
to this that Mr. Williams has been requested to chiefly direct his atten-
tion. It is his intention to visit Kl] Kutel, one of the most striking
monolithic remains in Northern Africa, and other ruins of equal inter-
est. Photographs and measurements will be obtained, for which pur-
pose a photographie outfit has been furnished to Mr. Williams, who is
thoroughly competent to conduct investigations of this kind. The
Smithsonian Institution has also provided an outfit of instruments for
taking observations of temperatures and altitudes, and he has been
requested to obtain musical instruments of all kinds, as far as the lim-
ited sum of money placed at his disposal from the Museum fund will
enable him to purchase them.

News has already been received of Mr. Williams’s arrival in Africa.
He has secured a complete series of musical instruments, from the rudest
whistle to stringed instruments of skillful manufacture. In each in-
stance the native names and names of the parts have been ascertained,
the proper pitch of each string taken, and a native melody, as played
on each kind of instrument, has been noted in our musical notation.
He has also succeeded in obtaining a varied collection of objects illus-
trating the domestic life of the people.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill, of the German legation of Pekin, has for several
years made himself familiar with the customs of the natives of Thibet,
and having recently undertaken a journey through that country, will
make a special study of the ethnology of the region. He has been
supplied by the institution with a barometer and other instruments
desired by him for his journey. His previous investigations have re-
sulted in an exceedingly valuable collection of objects illustrating the
religious practices, occupations, and amusements of various peoples in
different parts of China, Thibet, Turkestan.

Dr. James Grant Bey, who some years ago established a sanitarium
in Cairo, Egypt, and attended the International Medical Congress held
in Washington in 1887, became much interested in the work of the
National Museum, and has since his return to Egypt devoted his leisure
time to special studies of the arts of the ancient Egyptians. Several
valuable collections have already been received from him.

During the summer, the Bureau of Etlinology decided to send Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin to Hoopa Reservation in California for the purpose of
studying the languages and mythology of the tribes of Indians inhabit-
ing the reservation. The Smithsonian Institution was fortunately en-
abled to secure the assistance of Mr. Curtin in investigating their arts
and industries also, and a small sum of money was placed in his hands
for the purchase of objects of Indian manufacture.

Dr. John M. Crawford, U. 8S. consui-general at St. Petersburg, has
kindly offered to allow the National Museum to participate in the results
of his ethnological researches in Russia and Finland. Dr. Crawford is
well known in the United States as a philologist and a student of Scan-
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

dinavian antiquities, and as the author of the English translation of
the Finish epic “The Kalevala.” His appointment as consul-general
at St. Petersburg was made with a special view to enable him to
carry on his studies of the traditions and antiquities of the Finish race
and related peoples. He has offered to make collections for the National
Museum, and in order to facilitate his work, the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has provided him with letters of introduction to several of its cor-
respondents in Russia and Finland. These will no doubt be of great
service to him in enabling him to carry out the object which he desires
to further.

Rey. Frederick H. Post, an Episcopal clergyman of Salem, Oregon,
has recently undertaken missionary work in Alaska, and has taken up
his residence at Anvik, on the Yukon River. He has entered into cor-
respondence with the Smithsonian Institution, and has offered to col-
lect information relating to the tribes of the Upper Yukon. He has
also proposed to make meteorological observations at Anvik. This
offer has been referred to the Signal Office. It is probable that an out-
fit of alcohol, guns, and ammunition will be sent to Mr. Post next year
to enable him to collect the mammals and birds of that region.

Lieut. J. F. Moser, commanding the U. 8. Coast Survey steamer
Bache has continued his explorations for the Museum, and has trans-
mitted a collection of fishes, mollusks, insects, and marine invertebrates
from the vicinity of Cape Sable, Florida.

Prof. O. P. Jenkins, of De Pauw University, Indiana, has made
arrangements to visit the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of col-
lecting fishes, and has expressed his intention of presenting a duplicate
series of specimens to the National Museum. The Smithsonian Institu-
tion has supplied him with seines and has furnished him with a letter
of introduction to the curator of the national museum in Honolulu.

Ensign W. L. Howard, U. S. Navy, has kindly offered to collect
zoological and ethnological material in Alaska, and has been supplied
with collecting apparatus and supplies for use in trading with the In-
dians.

A large outfit of tanks, bottles, and alcohol was supplied to Mr. W.
A. Stearns, of Cambridgeport, Mass., for use in vollecting specimens of
natural history in northern Labrador. No collections have yet been
received from him.

PUBLICATIONS.

Under an arrangement made by the late Secretary, Prof. E. D. Cope
was engaged at the time of my last report in completing and preparing
for publication an investigation upon the Reptilia and Batrachia of
North America, which has been in progress, under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution, for more than twenty years. The monograph
on the Batrachia, mentioned in my last report as having been received,
is now in type, though not yet published, but that on the Reptilia is still

delayed. I have positive assurance from Professor Cope that it will be
completed within the present year, but the expense entailed in the pub-
lication has continued to prove far greater than the late Secretary had
anticipated, and I am sorry that the expectation of its completion dur-
ing the past year has not been fulfilled.

I have referred in my last report to the demand for greater economy
in publication, and to the probability that some change would be re-
quisite in the form of the annual reports. It will be remembered ‘at
the Smithsonian Institution has three classes of publications:

The Contributions to Knowledge.

The Miscellaneous Collections.

The Annual Reports.

A brief review of the past and present condition of each of these
publications may here be made, with special reference to the latter.
For details concerning these different classes, and for the matter
actually presented under each, reference may be made to the appendix.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—The first work of original re-
search published by the Institution was the well-known treatise by Messrs.
Squier and Davis, in 1848, on Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi
Valley. This was the commencement of the quarto series entitled
‘Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” which now numbers
twenty-five volumes. This series is designed to record the results of
original research, offering positive additions to human knowledge, either
undertaken by agents of the Institution or encouraged by its assistance.
In general character these contributions correspond somewhat with
the more elaborate transactions of learned societies. From causes
briefly adverted to in my last report, original memoirs deemed worthy
of a place in this series have been much rarer in later years than in the
earlier portion of the Institution’s history.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—In 1862, a second series of pub-
lications was commenced by the Institution, in octavo form, with the
Meteorological and Physical Tables of Professor Guyot, under the title
of ‘Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.” This series embraces
papers or treatises of a more practical character than those of the Con-
tributions, including résumés of existing knowledge in special depart-
ments, systematic lists or classifications of species in the animal,
botanical, or mineral kingdoms of nature, tabular collections of natural
constants, scientific bibliographies, and other summaries, of value to
the students of physical or biological science. These collections now
number thirty-three volumes.

Among the subjects heretofore included in this series have been the
proceedings or transactions of several scientific societies of Washington
(the Philosophical, the Anthropological, and the Biological), which were
organized under the auspices of officers of the Smithsonian Institution.
To promote their usefulness the stereotyping of their several published
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

journals was undertaken by the Institution and a large extension of their
distribution was thus effected by including their re-issue in the Miscella-
neous Collections, of which series they constitute three volumes. These
societies having now severally attained a highly successful and self-sup-
porting condition of active membership, it has been thought that this
form of patronage might well be withdrawn without detriment to the
welfare of the societies and with advantage to the Institution. These
publications are accordingly no longer stereotyped by the Institution, or
included in its issues.

The Bulletins and Proceedings of the U. 8. National Museum, pub-
lished by an appropriation of Congress, have also been heretofore re-
printed by the Institution and this supplementary edition has occupied
five volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections. It has been decided in
like manner to hereafter omit these publications from the series.

Smithsonian Annual Reports—A provision of the act of Congress or-
ganizing the Smithsonian Institution (Revised Statutes, Title 73, See.
5593) requires that ‘the Board shall submit to Congress at each ses-
sion thereof a report of the operations, expenditures, and condition of
the Institution.” These annual reports have been accompanied with a
“¢ general appendix,” giving summaries of lectures, interesting extracts
from the correspondence, and accounts of the results of explorations
undertaken by the Institution or aided and promoted by it, as well as
of new discoveries in science. In the annual report for 1880 and the
following years my lamented predecessor undertook to give a more
systematic character to the history of discoveries, by engaging a num-
ber of able collaborators in various fields of knowledge, to furnish a gen-
eral summary or record of scientific progress for the year. Appropri-
ate as the scheme appears, it has not been found to work as satisfacto-
rily as is desirable, and as had been hoped for. It has seldom been
possible to collect as complete summaries as were originally contem-
plated; and the delay of publication deprives the record of much of the
freshness and interest it would otherwise possess, while in all these the
rapid increase of scientific literature demanded such a corresponding
increase in the corps of reporters and such a correlatively increasing
expenditure as the fixed Smithsonian fund was growing quite unable
to afford. It will be remembered that of this appendix there are dis-
tributed through members of Congress as many as 9,000 copies, form-
ing the larger part of the whole edition, and that it is thus incumbent
on us to observe that it reaches a large class of readers unable to follow
the work of specialists in original memoirs.

After serious consideration it has been finally determined to restrict,
if not forego, the scheme of a general annual survey of scientific litera-
ture and progress, and to recur in large part to the system of Henry
of selecting memoirs of a special interest and permanent value, which
have already appeared elsewhere and which are sufficiently untechnical
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

to be readily apprehended by readers fairly representative of the intel-
ligent and educated class among the constituents of the members of
POHSEOSS, by whom they are chiefly distributed.

If, as [have already suggested, Congress sees fit to make a small
appropriation for the editing as well as the publication of this appen-
dix, so as to enable it to include, for instance, information relative to
the progress of scientific discovery and its useful application in the
United States, such a record would be in keeping with the objects of
this Institution, and would maintain for this report the popularity and
the educational character just referred to, while promoting industrial
interests in the country...

In this connection I beg to repeat the remark that it would be de-
sirable to have the supplementary matter of the report placed under a
special clause for the avoidance of all question as to the “ necessity
and entire relation to the public business” of such information, a ques-
tion which has arisen by the construction given by the Public Printer
to the act of Congress of August 4, 1885.

Publications of the National Museum.—These publications (already
referred to as being issued by Government appropriations) comprise
two series: First, the ‘Proceedings of the National Museum,” consist-
ing of short essays giving early accounts of recent accessions, or newly
ascertained facts in natural history, and promptly issued to secure the
earliest diffusion of the information, of which series ten annual volumes
have now been issued; and secondly, the “Bulletins of the National
Museum,” consisting of more elaborate memoirs relative to the collec-
tions, such as biological monographs, taxonomic lists, ete., of which
series thirty-six numbers have been issued. These bulletins vary
greatly in size from pamphlets of fifty pages to works of many hun-
dred pages.

Publications of the Bureau of Ethnology.—The principal publication of
this Bureau is the “Annual Report.” This series consists of large royal
octavo volumes, detailing researches relative to the aborigines of North
America, handsomely printed and illustrated with numerous cuts and
lithographie plates. The fifth Annual Report has been issued during
the year, and the series may be referred to, as at the same time credita-
ble to the Government and as fitted to engage public attention by mat.
ter of an interest beyond what is ordinarily found in any Government
document,

Distribution of Smithsonian Publications.—It is manifestly impossible
for the Institution, with its fixed and limited income, to keep pace in its
issues and their distribution with the increase of popular interest in
scientific productions. The ordinary edition of 1,500 copies of each of
the Smithsonian publications which has been produced from the be-
ginning, cannot be enlarged without seriously impairing the efficiency
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

of the fund for other services ; although it wonld be a great satisfaction
to be able to supply more liberally the growing demand for the works
as published. The impracticability, however, of furnishing these to all
interested in scientific pursuits, has required the adoption of more for-
mal regulations to secure the most judicious application of the available
stock of publications. These are presented, first, to those learned socie-
ties of the first class which give to the institution in return complete sets
of their own publications; secondly, to colleges of the first class furnish-
ing catalogues of their libraries and students, and publications relative
to their organization and history; thirdly, to public libraries in this
country having 25,000 volumes; fourthly, in some cases to still smaller
libraries, especially if no other copies of the Smithsonian publications
are given in the same place and a large district would be otherwise un-
supplied; lastly, to institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion
of particular branches of knowledge, such of its publications are given
as relate to their special objects. These rules apply chiefly to distri-
bution in the United States. The number sent to foreign countries,
under somewhat different conditions, is about the same as that distrib-
uted in this country.

A small number of copies not otherwise disposed of has been usually
reserved for sale; although such returns have of course contributed
but little toward the cost of production. As an experiment (which had
been tried in the early history of the institution), I have placed a small
edition of one of our works in the hands of a large publishing house,
the well-known firm of MacMillan & Co., of London and New York.
The work selected for this purpose is the newly revised “tables of
specific gravity for solids and liquids,” by Prof. F. W. Clarke, Chemist
of the U.S. Geological Survey. This being a valuable work of refer-
ence for all practical chemists, as well as for many others, was thought
to be a very suitable subject for trial as to its commercial success. An
edition of 1,000 copies having been reserved for the regular gratuitous
distribution, 500 copies were prepared with the imprint of Messrs.
MacMillan & Co. on the title page, to be disposed of as one of their
own publications, and by their regular business methods.

Facilities afforded to others.—A few instances of assistance in the
direction of printing, etc., granted in special cases, may here be men-
tioned. The widow of Dr. Asa Gray having about 80 imperfect copies
on hand of her husband’s “ Flora of North America,” desired, in order
to complete her sets and render them available for sale, a correspond-
ing number of covies of the first part of the second volume. The re-
quest was cheerfully complied with, and Messrs. Wilson & Son, of
Cambridge, Mass., were authorized by the Regents to print the desired
small edition at the expense of the Institution.

Prof. M. W. Harrington, of Ann Arbor, Mich., made application for
the use of the stereotype plates of Professor Henry’s meteorological
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

essays (included in his published scientific writings), with a view to the
publication of a cheap popular edition of this treatise. In the belief
that such a republication would be in the interests of science and its
wider diffusion, permission to use the plates was readily granted.

A similar request was made by Dr. George H. Horn, of Philadelphia,
who, as joint author with the late Dr. John L. Le Conte of a work of 600
pages on the ‘Classification of the Coleoptera of North America” (pub-
lished by the Institution in 1883, and now out of print), desired the use
of the stereotype plates, from which to print an edition of the book.
This request was also favorably entertained, and the pres. sought
was conceded.

The Eighth International Congress of Orientalists, appointed to be
held at Stockholm and at Christiania, in September, 1889, solicited
through its officers the co-operation of the Smithsonian Institution. In
furtherance of its laudable aims the Institution undertook to print and
distribute in this country 1,000 copies of its circular of announcement
and information.

In compliance with the request of Mr. Sylvester Baxter, secretary of
the Hemenway Expedition of exploration, the privilege of the Smith-
sonian exchange system was granted for the distribution of the report
of the expedition, giving an account of its researches in the Southwest.

These various allowances are believed to be in the spirit of the Smith-
sonian foundation, and of its ancient maxim—* Co-operation, rather than
rivalry or monopoly.”

Storage of the Smithsonian Stereotype Plates.—The stereotype plates of
the Smithsonian publications now constitute a very large collection,
and as the printing of the works had been done in various cities, as
appeared most economical or convenient, a considerable portion of this
material had been stored in Boston, and especially in Philadelphia.
As the fire-proof renovation of the eastern portion of the Smithsonian
building furnished a safe and suitable depository in the basement rooms,
these plates have now all been collected within its store-rooms.

THE SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

The international exchange system was established early in the
history of the Institution, at first purely as a channel for the interchange
of scientific publications and specimens, and therefore as a direct means
for “the diffusion of knowledge,” a means which has proved to be a
great benefit to the scientific institutions of the world, and incidentally
to Congress in building up the unequalled collection of works of refer-
ence deposited in its Library.

Of late years, however, the Government, having decanien the charge
of this system, has made the Institution its agent not only for this
scientific distribution but for the much larger distribution of the publi-
cations of the United States Government abroad, and also for the re-
ceipt and transmission to the Library of Congress of the publications
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of other countries sent in return. In this twofold service it is now per-
forming an important public duty, for which such inadequate provision
is made, that in spite of the efforts for an economical and efficient ad-
ministration of this department the best interests of the Government
as well as those of the Institution are seriously suffering.

In reviewing the past year it is necessary to mention first of all the
serious loss in the death of Dr. Jerome H. Kidder, which however has
been more fully referred to elsewhere. At the date of his death, which
occurred on the 6th of April, 1889, owing to the efficient condition of
the division due to the hearty co-operation of all in it with the labors
of its lamented chief, the office was free from any parcels whatever, and
was ready to close its book accounts completely for the first time.

L regret to record, also, the death on June 17, 1889, of Mr. George Hill-
ier, Superintendent of the New York Custom-House. Mr. Hillier had for
more than thirty years attended to the transmission of Smithsonian ex-
change packages, rendering the Institution most valuable and efficient
service without compensation. In response to a request made to the
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Quackenbush, chief entry clerk of the
New York Custom-House, has been designated to receive and transmit
cases addressed to the Smithsonian Institution in future.

Dr. Kidder was succeeded as curator of exchanges by Mr. William C.
Winlock, who was appointed May 15,1889. The curator’s report to the
Secretary, containing the usual statistics for the fiscal year, will be found
in thé appendix.

In order to convey an idea of the present magnitude and character of
the exchange transactions it may be stated that during the year, 17,218
packages were mailed to correspondents in the United States and 693
boxes, containing 58,035 packages, were shipped to our agents abroad
for distribution to correspondents in nearly every civilized nation of the
earth. The total number of packages received was 75,966, of which
34,996, or nearly one-half, were governmental exchanges.* The services
ofelevent clerks and packers have been required in handling and account-
ing for this material and in conducting the extensive correspondence
that such a business involves. The societies and individuals upon the
exchange list now number 13,130.

The entire expense of “international exchanges” for the fiscal year
was $17,152.10. Of this sum $15,000 were appropriated directly by
Congress, $1,363.54 were repaid by several of the Government Depart-

*It should be noted that almost from the very beginning of the exchange system
the publications of several of the scientific bureaus of the Government were volun-
tarily transmitted by the Smithsonian Institution; but it was not officially desig-
nated for the service till 1878.

tIt is not superflnous to repeat that these are engaged in addition to the proper
personnel of the Institution, the services of whose officers are given without charge.

t The items $2,329.99, under the head of expenditures for exchanges, and $2,189.52
repayments, in the report of the executive committee, include receipts and expendi-
tures made on account of the preceding fiscal year.

ments to which appropriations had been granted for payment of freight
on publications sent abroad through the Institution, leaving «a deficit
of $788.56, which was paid from the Smithsonian fund.

With reference to this deficiency let me observe that in the history of
the Government’s connection with the exchanges three periods may be
distinguished. The first was in 1867 and 1868, when, after twenty years
of useful work in the interests of knowledge, a new duty was imposed
upon the service by acts of Congress* which established for the benefit
of the Congressional Library an international exchange of works pub-
lished by the Government and made the Smithsonian Institution the
agency for this exchange. The second was in 1878, when the Institu-
tion was distinctly recognizedt by the Department of State as the agent
of the United States in the exchange of all Government publications
(including exchanges for the benefit of Bureau libraries) and also in the
exchange between learned societies.

The Institution possessed unequalled experience and facilities for
such work, and though the new class of books brought to the exchange
department was partly foreign to its original object, the propriety of
its assuming such a service, if the Government’s interest could be pro-
moted by this experience, is evident. It certainly, however, was not to
have been anticipated that the Institution should conduct a purely ad-
ministrative work of the General Government out of its private funds,
as it appears to have done for thirteen years, from 1868 to 1881, when
the first appropriation of $3,000 was made by Congress.

In the actt of March 3, 1881, making this appropriation it appears to
have been the intent of Congress to apply the amount indifferently to
all exchanges, whether to those which it undertakes for the Library of
Congress, to those of Governmental bureaus, or to other literary and

scientific objects, thus constituting a third change* in the relations of
the Smithsonian to the Government in regard to the Exchange Bureau.

An approximate estimate of the cost of the exchange for the Library
of Congress from 1868 to 1878, together with the cost of the ‘Govern.
mental” exchange (the Congressional and Departmental) for 1879 and
1880, shows that about $20,000 were paid from the Smithsonian funds
for handling Government property alone. Regarding the whole ex-
pense of international exchanges since 1881 as a charge on the Govern-
ment, the entire amount paid out of the funds of the institution on ac-
count of the General Government is somewhat over $50,000, exclusive
of office rent and minor expenses.

In the report that [ had the honor to submit to the Board of Regents
at their last meeting the expenses and needs of the exchange depart-
ment were dwelt upon at some length, and it was stated that a revised
estimate of $27,050 had been submitted through the Secretary of the
Treasury for the purpose of meeting the expenses of contemplated im-
provements in the service during the fiscal year 1888-89. The amount
finally appropriated was $15,000, an increase of only $3,000 over the
sum appropriated for the year preceding. As I have already remarked,
in spite of efforts for an economical and efficient administration of the
department, slow transportation and free ocean freight, this was $2,-
152.10 less than the service actually cost, and the interests of both the
Government and the Institution suffer from the entire inadequacy of
the appropriation.

Although all of the Government bureaus that have occasion to trans-
mit their publications through the Institution are not provided with
funds available for defraying the cost of the service, it seems to have
been the intention of Congress that its specific appropriation for the
exchange business should be supplemented by special appropriations to
some of the bureaus and departments of the Government, so that the
charge of 5 cents per pound weight imposed by the regents in [878
might be met by them. The average amount annually repaid to the In-
stitution in this way during the past eleven years has been about $1,400,
and does not represent all the cost to the Institution which has been
made up from its private fund.

It has been repeatedly urged that this procedure, for which sufficient
reasons existed at the time of its adoption, may now be discontinued as
no longer advantageous or economical,

By the present system the cost of the service is actually larger than
appears in the specific appropriations for exchanges, and as the specia
appropriations to the different departments vary from year to year, and
are often omitted altogether, a burden which can not be accurately fore-
seen continues to be imposed upon the STN ALDSOMIUE I fund.

i Lae Gin, at w hich the United States was Fo maccnen was concluded at Brus:

official documents and of the scientifie and literary publications of the states ad-
joining thereto,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

In order to effect the change contemplated, that is, to collect in a
single item the entire appropriation for international exchanges and
at the same time to make allowance for a needed compensation to the
ocean steam-ship companies for freight and for like necessary expenses,
tending to secure to the United States a return of many times what
they now receive from foreign governments, with a prompt delivery,
an estimate of $27,500 was submitted for the fiscal year 1889-90.

It should be premised that only about one-third of the Government’s
publications are actually received from the office of the Public Printer
and elsewhere for transmission abroad, and that while special applica-
tion on our part might call out the remainder, we can not undertake to
do this while only partly paid the actual outlay for the portion we
carry already, while a sufficient appropriation to justify the employ-
ment of a special exchange agent in Europe, as has been frequently
and earnestly recommended by the Librarian of Congress, would bring
back in return probably about eight times what we now receive. Ac-
cordingly, in the subjoined estimate of what could be done if Con-
gress paid the actual cost of efficient service (the services of the officers
of this Institution being given without charge), more packages appear
under the new plan than under the old.

Statement of exchanges during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1889, together
with estimates for proposed new departure.

No increase, however, over the amount appropriated for 1887~88
($15,500) was granted, and it is probable that the deficiency for the
coming year will be at least $2,000.

Recurring now to one of the effects of the insufficient appropriations
the writer repeats that there are too many and too great delays in the
transit of packages sent by international exchanges. These delays do
not occur in the office at Washington, nor in those of the agents of the
Institution at London and Leipzig. They are due, broadly speaking, to
the fact just stated, that the Institution has not the means to pay for
rapid transit on land or sea, and that for what it obtains on the latter
it is dependent upon the courtesy of several ocean steam-ship com-
panies, with the natural result that the free freight is often delayed to
make room for that which is paid for. A subordinate cause, however,
lies in the apathy or indifference, or possible insufficient clerical force,
of most of the foreign exchange bureaus.

The employés of the bureau are paid much lower salaries than simi-
lar services command in other branches of the public service, and the
Government pays no rent for the rooms in which they labor, in which
even the office furniture forms a part of the charge on the private funds
of this Institution.

The convention between the United States of America, Belgium,
Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, and Switzerland for the interna-
tional exchange of official documents and scientific and literary publica-
tions, as well as the convention between the same countries (excepting
Switzerland) for ‘‘ the immediate exchange of the official journals,. par-
liamentary annals, and documents,” was concluded at Brussels March
15, 1886, ratification advised by the Senate June 18, 1888, ratified by
the President July 19, 1888, ratifications exchanged January 14, 1889,
and proclaimed January 15, 1889, and since that date formal notifica-
tion has been received of the adhesion to both conventions of the Gov-
ernment of Uruguay. The full texts of these conventions were given
in the Curator’s report for last year.

The adhesion of the United States to the first convention involves no
new departure in the exchange service from the methods of previous
years; but for the fulfillment of the obligations incurred by the second
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

convention—the immediate exchange of official journals—an appropria-
tion of about $2,000 to cover the necessary postage and additional cler-
ical assistance is required; and provision should be made for the prompt
delivery to the exchange office of the documents referred to.

This sum of $2,000 was estimated in reply to an inquiry made by the
Secretary of State, dated February 12, 1889, as to the ability of the
Smithsonian Institution to execute all of the provisions of the two con-
ventions without further legislation by Congress, and the estimate was
duly transmitted by the Secretary of State in a letter to the President
of the Senate, but no appropriation was made.

As heretofore, the Institution is greatly indebted to the lines of ocean
steamers between the United States and other countries, and especial
acknowledgment is due to the agencies of the fellowing companies for
the continuation of many favors in the free transportation of interna-
tional exchange packages :

LIBRARY

I may best preface what I have to say about the library by a repeti-
tion of some introductory remarks in my previous report:
“Ohiefly through its exchange system, the Smithsonian had in 1865

accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications of
learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the
2? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

world in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of
the human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at
least every branch of positive science since the days of revival of let-
ters until the present time.*

“These books, in many cases presents from old Kuropean libraries
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best
collections of the kind in the world.

‘The danger incurred from the fire that year, and the fact that the
ereater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into in-
sufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to be
incurred for this binding, enlarged room, and other purposes connected
with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the Institution,
appear to have been the moving causes which determined the Regents
to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place the Smith-
sonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right of the
Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of binding, ete.
Owing to the same causes (which have affected the Library of Con-
gress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their custody
in a fire-proof building, have never been fulfilled.

“The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now accumulated from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts
of volumes, and form without doubt the most valuable collection of
the kind in existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more
crowded and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer.
It is hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one
more than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress.”

At the last meeting of the Board, the Regents passed the following
resolution :

“ Resolved, That, since the Smithsonian deposit now numbers over
250,000 titles, and is still increasing, at the cost of the Institution, it
is, in the opinion of the Regents, desirable that in the new building
for the Library of Congress, sufficient provision shall be made for its
accommodation and inerease in a distinct hall or halls, worthy of the
collections, and such as, while recalling to the visitor the name of
Smithson, shall provide such facilities for those consulting the volumes
as will aid in his large purpose of the diffusion of knowledge among
men.”

I have brought this resolution of the Regents to the attention of the
present Librarian of Congress and to that of the Chief of Engineers,
the officer in charge of the new building. 1 learn from the latter offi-
cial that, owing to the length of time occupied in the construction, it
will probably be from six to eight years before any effect can be given
to this resolution ; and, in the mean time, with the overcrowded condi-
tion of the present quarters of the Library, the chests sent up from the
Institution still often continue to lie unopened, so that their contents
are inaccessible.

Owing to this overcrowding and, as it is understood, to insufficient
clerical aid in the Capitol Library, this noble collection, the product of
thirty years’ accumulation from the fund of Smithson, is, if not alto-
gether lost to science and learning, at any rate so impaired in its use-

* See Smithsonian Report of 1867.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

fulness that it can not be assumed that any series of learned transac-
tions is now complete or that any stude nt can any longer find what he
seeks in what was once provided for his aid. I beg to recommend this
regrettable state of things to the notice of the Congressional Regents.
The present sad condition must, from the nature of the case, grow
yearly still worse under the present urangement ; and it seems certain
that, by the time the new building is ready for the books, the entire
collection will have its value so impaired as to be pecuniarily and oth-
erwise of little value in comparison with the original cost. The only
remedy still appli¢able would seem to lie in providing temporary quar-
ters for the collection under the care of the Librarian of Congress, but
outside of the overcrowded quarters in the Capitol.

The labor of recording and ecarivg for the acéessions to the library
has been carried on as during the last fiscal year, with this exception,
that, the work being now thoroughly organized, it has been practicable
to dispense with the services of one of the three clerks previously em-
ployed in this department.

The construction of additional cases in the reading-room has given
increased facilities for the display of periodicals, and the number. of
serials now at the disposai of readers has arisen from 265 (as at the
time of my last report) to 432. The reading-room is well used by those
classes of readers for whom it was designed.

The most important operation in connection with the library during
the year has been the commencement of the work of carrying out the
plan for increasing the library by systematic exchanges, which was
originated soon after I entered on my duties as Assistant Secretary, at
the desire of Secretary Baird.

Realizing that there must be many scientific and technical period-
icals of value, especially in branches of science not directly related to
the work carried on at the Institution, which were not known in our
library, and recognizing the fact that many new publications have come
into existence since the last systematic attempt to procure full returns
for the publications distributed by the Institution, I addressed circulars

three hundred gentlemen in this country who are noted for their
eminence in the different branches of knowledge, desiring them to
furnish me with lists of the scientific periodicals which were of value
to them in their special fields of investigation.*

In reply to these circulars, 174 voluminous lists were received, and
these I caused to be carefully collated. The result of this collation is a
list of 3,600 titles, embracing, as it is believed, nearly if not quite all
periodical literature of importance in the various branches of knowledge,
exclusive of belles-lettres and the art of medicine.

In order, however, that this list should be of any practical service to
the Institution, itis first necessary to learn which of these publications
the Institution may already possess, either in isa Tasos or imperfect

* Copies of pies circulars are to be fone in Appendix 4 to my report for 1887-’83,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

files. To ascertain this, each title in the list must be laboriously com-
pared with the records of the library, running back frequently for
many years. Again, should a learned society, publishing transactions,
or the publishers of a journal mentioned in this list, be found to have
received Smithsonian publications without making any adequate return,
the records of the distribution of publications must be searched, in order
to find the exact amount of publications furnished, that upon this the
Institution may base its demand for a return.

It will be seen that the publications in question fall naturally into
four classes.

(1) Journals which receive the Smithsonian publications, and which
are not to be found in the library of the Institution.

(2) Journals which receive the Smithsonian publications, but which
make either no return or an inadequate return for these.

(3) Journals which regularly exchange with the Institution, but of
which the files in the library are for any reason defective.

(4) Journals which regularly exchange with the Institution, and of
which the library possesses a complete file.

When each of the 3,600 titles has been assigned to its proper place
in one of these four classes, a letter must be written to each one of the
journals belonging to the first three classes, as follows: To the first ciass,
offering to exchange; to the second, calling attention to the fact that
the Institution has received no adequate returns for its favors, and to
the third, asking for the volumes or parts of volumes required to com-
plete the files.

It will thus be evident that a work of no small magnitude remained ~
to be performed after the list of journals was prepared. A careful esti-
mate showed that it would require the entire time of a competent clerk
for at least tweive months to perform the necessary routine work. As,
however, the Institution was not in a position to employ an extra clerk
for work which would be so largely for the benefit of the Library of
Congress, the matter was allowed to rest here.

The desirability of the plan, however, commended itself so strongly
to me that I could not willingly see it given up and the large amount
of labor already expended remain unfruitful. Accordingly, towards
the latter part of the past fiscal year, I presented the matter to Mr. A.
R. Spofford, the Librarian of Congress, who, recognizing the advantages
that would accrue to that Library from carrying out the plan, consented
to defray the expense of the necessary clerical work from his own ap-
propriations. The work was accordingly begun on June 1, 1889, and
will be carried on continuously under the immediate supervision of the
librarian, Mr. John Murdoch.

It is estimated that of the 3,600 titles under consideration, at least
one-half, or 1,800, will prove to. be new and desirable accessions to the
library, while the work done in endeavoring to complete broken series
must prove to be of great value.

THE DEPARTMENT OF LIViNG ANIMALS.

The collection of the departmeut of living animals has increased dur-
ing the year (almost wholly by donations) to such an extent as to quite
overcrowd its accommodations, and render if necessary to resolutely
check its growth, while the degree of interest manifested in this small
display has been surprising. This has been shown not only by the
residents of Washington, and visitors to the city, who form the daily
crowd of visitors, but many residents of remote States and Territories
have testified their interest by sending valuable gifts to the collee-
tion.

Besides these, many valuable gifts of quadrupeds and birds have
been received from United States Army officers in Texas. A most val-
uable donation received during the year came from the Hon. W. F.
Cody (Buffalo Bill), of North Platte, Nebr., and consisted of three fine
American elks, two males and a female.

Dr. V. T. MeGillyeuddy, of Rapid City, Dak., offered to deposit in
the collection four American bisons which have been in his possession
for several years. The conditions of the offer were considered suf-
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ficiently liberal to justify its acceptance, and accordingly Mr. George
H. Hedley, of Medina, N. Y., was requested to proceed to Rapid City,
where he received the animals and arrived in Washington with them
in good condition. Being fine specimens they have naturally attracted
much attention.

The overcrowded condition of the temporary cages and yards con-
taining the larger animals has caused extreme trouble, not only to pro-
vide properly for the shelter and comfort of the specimens, but to keep
them from either killing or injuring each other. Only with larger space
and better facilities will it be possible to so care for these animals,
and many others like them, that they will not only be a stock from
which to replenish their races, so rapidly vanishing from the continent,
but a source of constant instruction and recreation for the people.

The department of living animals has served an important purpose
jn aiding to bring about the establishment by Congress of a National
Zoological Park, for the public interest manifested in the collection,
forcibly emphasized the general desire and need for such an institution
founded on a liberal scale. During the period when the Zoological
Park proposition was before the Fiftieth Congress, the Secretary con-
sidered that the curator of this department, Mr. Hornaday, could not
render more important service than by explaining to Members the de-
tails of the plan proposed, and he was accordingly directed to devote
a portion of his time to that duty.

The actual accommodations provided for the living animals are
necessarily of the most temporary character, and do not in the slightest
degree indicate the proper construction of permanent improvements of
this kind in a first-class zoological garden. At present a large num-
ber of living quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles are crowded together in
one small and ill-ventilated building heated by steam, which, during
exhibition hours, is usually filled with visitors to an uncomfortable ex-
tent. It will be a great boon to the public and to the animals com-
posing the collection as well, when the latter can be transferred to the
Zoological Park and provided with suitable accommodations. Under
the circumstances it is very desirable that this should be accomplished
at the earliest date possible.

The total number of living specimens received during the year was
271, of which 126 were gifts, 37 were deposited, and 8 purchased. The
final catalogue entry on June 30, 1889, was 341, which represents the
total number of specimens received since the collection was begun. In
spite of the disadvantages the curator and his two assistants have la-
bored under in the care of this collection, it is gratifying to be able to
report that during the year the losses by death have been almost wholly
confined to the small and least valuable animals; and, with the excep-
tion of an antelope which was presented by Senator Stanford and died
before it had time to recover from the effects of its long journey, all the
large and most valuable specimens are alive and in good health,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. nay |

it is well to direct attention to the fact that Congress has as yet made
no special appropriation for the care of these animals, which, with their
food, represents a considerable sum, ill spared from the limited appro-
priation at the disposal of the Secretary for the increase and preserva-
tion of the collections, on which so many other pressing demands are

made.
ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

In my previous report I stated that a bill had been introdueed by
Senator Beck to create, under the care of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, a zoological garden on Rock Creek, where these animals
might not only form the subject of study, but be expected to increase
aS they do not in ordinary captivity ; and I gave the amendment to the
sundry civil appropriation bill, reported by Senator Morrill, which
was substantially the same as the bill of Senator Beck.

For reasons which may be found in my letter to the chairman of the
Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, quoted later, I gave much
time and labor in the interests of this measure, at first without success,
the House Committee on Appropriations having reported its non-conecur-
rence in the Zoological Park amendment, and, after along debate, which
occupied the attention of the House through a considerable portion of
the 12th of September, 1888, the motion to concur was defeated. In
the subsequent conference on the sundry civil bill, the Senate con-
ferees agreed that the amendment should be stricken out, so that the
bill was lost.

In pursuance of what seemed to me a public duty, I did not accept
this defeat of the bill as final, but brought the matter again before the
attention of Congress.

On the 18th of January, 1889, at the request of the Hon. S. Dibble,
I addressed a letter to him as chairman of the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, to which had been referred a bill of the House,
introduced by the Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, of similar purport to
that introduced in the Senate. This letter the committee made the basis
of its recommendation for the passage of the bill in the following words:

REPORT to accompany bill H. R. 11810,

The Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, to which was re-
ferred the bill (H. R. 11810) “for the establishment of a Zoological
Park in the District of Columbia,” having had the same under consid-
eration, respectfully submits the following report:

Appended hereto is a letter of Prof. 8S. P. Langley, Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, portraying the necessity of such a park and
the advantages to be derived from its establishment; and, for reasons
therein set forth, your committee respectfully recommends the passage
of the bill.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C., January 18, 1889.

My Dear Sir: I write what follows in accordance with the sugges-
tion of your yesterday’s letter, intending it for your consideration and
that of the committee.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

From all parts of the country, for many years, presents of live ani-
mals have been made to the Government through the Smithsonian In-
stitution or the Museum; but the absence of any appropriation for their
care has led to their being sent away (though most reluctantly) to in-
crease the collections of the zoological parks in Philadelphia, New York,
London, and other cities. It should be better known than it is that
everywhere through the country there is a disposition on the part of
private individuals to give to the Government in this way, and without
any expectation of return, remarkable specimens, which the donor (very
commonly a poor man) sometimes refuses advantageous pecuniary offers
for, and it seems hard to decline gifts made in such a spirit, or, accept-
ing them, to give them away again.

But little over a year ago I gave instructions that these live speci-
mens should be retained temporarily, as an experiment, and although a
very few have been purchased, the collection, which is a subject of so
much local popular interest, has been thus formed, substantially by gift,
within perhaps fifteen months, and this though many proffers have been
declined for want of means to care for them. 1am persuaded that, if
it were generally known that the Government would receive and care
for such gifts, within a very few years the finest collection of American
animals in the world might be made here in this way, with compara-
tively no expenditure for purchase.

Among the many interested in the incipient collection was Senator
Beck, whose bill for the formation of a zoological park was brought
before the Senate on April 23, 1888. The writer directed the Senator’s
attention to the fact that a piece of ground singularly suitable, by the
variety of its features, to the provision for the wants of all the different
kinds of animals, existed in tho picturesque valley of Rock Creek in
the part nearest to the city. Here not only the wild goat, the mountain
sheep and their congeners would find the rocky cliffs which are their
natural home, but the beavers brooks in which to build their dams; the
buffalo places of seclusion in which to breed and replenish their dying
race; aquatic birds and beasts their natural home, and in general all
animals would be provided for on a site almost incomparably better
than any now used for this purpose in any other capital in the world.

With this is the pre-eminently important consideration that the imme-
diate neighborhood to the city would make it accessible not only to the
rich, but to the poor, and therefore a place of recreation to the great
mass of the residents, as well as to the hundreds of thousands of citi-
zens from all parts of the country who now annually visit the eapital.

It may be added that, so far as is known to the writer, all those in-
terested in the desirable but larger plan fora public park along the
whole Rock Creek region—that is to say, all those acquainted with the
beauties and advantages of the site—regard the establishment of the pro-
posed zoological park there with favor. It is very difficult for any one
who has not visited the region to understand its singularly attractive
character, due to the good fortune which has preserved its picturesque
features intact urtil now, although the growing city is sweeping around
and enveloping it.

The Smithsonian Institution has not customarily received with favor
the propositions continually made it to place different local or national
interests under its charge, but the very special reasons which seem in
this case to enable it to at once secure a home and city of refuge for the
vanishing races of the continent, and a place for the health and recrea-
tion of the inhabitants of the city, and citizens of the United States,
together with an opportunity for the carrying out an enterprise of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

national scientific value, and the formation of what, as regards its site,
at least, is. the finest zoological garden in existence—all these consider-
ations have moved it to see in this an opportunity to carry out its legit-
imate work, ‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men. ”

W hen, therefore, Senator Beck made ithe understanding that the Smith-
sonian Institution’ would accept the charge of such a park, the primary
condition on which he would undertake to recommend it to Congress,
the Secretary felt authorized to say that he believed it propable that
the proposition would be favorably viewed by the regents, and, the
matter once brought before Congress, he has not disguised his own
interest in the success of the measure.

The bill, brought in by Mr. Breckinridge in the House (and by Sen-
ator Morrill in the Senate), appropriates: 3200,000 for the purchase of
not less than 100 acres of land. The land actually most desired for the
zoological park covers about 120 acres, being precisely that portion of
the Kock Creek Valley which will be soonest destroyed, as regards its
picturesque and attractive features, by the laying out of streets and
lots. Nevertheless, and largely owing to the very fact that the pict-
uresqueness of the locality implies the existence of rocks, precipices,
and valleys, which it would cost much to level and fill in, this land ean
still be obtained at rates which, considering its neighborhood to the
city, are remarkably cheap. The most thorough examination that I
have been able to make, the testimony of various real-estate experts
and others, have satisfied me that the purchase may and will be com-
pleted for somewhat less than the sum named in the appropriation, even
leaving a small margin for the erection of a preliminary shelter for the
animals. .

I beg most respectfully to urge upon the attention of the committee
the fact that itis at once the strength and weakness of this measure
that, so far as is known, it is an entirely disinterested one, the real-
estate holders in the vicinity being generally indifferent or opposed to
it, for reasons which can be explained, if desired, and that it is being
thus pressed upon Congress by those who have the measure at heart,
because anything that is done must be done soon. It is probable that
within a year or two more, the good fortune which has kept this singu-
larly interesting spot intact, while the growing city is encircling it, will
protect it no longer. It is not the mere space on the ap which is to
be secured, but natural advantages which have no relation to the nunm-
ber of acres, and which can not “be restored if once destr oyed, since it
is not in the power of Congress itself by any expenditure of money to
recreate a rock or a tree.

I am, very respectfully, yours,
S. P. LANGLEY,

Hon. SAMUEL DIBBLE, Secretary.

House of Representatives.

It appears, however, that this recommendation could not be brought
to the consideration of Congress in season for action, and at nearly the
same time Senator Edmunds introduced an amendment to the District
bill. There were at this time two measures being pressed upon the
attention of Congress, one for the creation of a national park, inelud-
ing a thousand or more acres upon Rock Creek, extending far beyond
the limits of the proposed zoological park, and requiring a large ex-
penditure not for buildings but for lands, a measure with which the
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Smithsonian Institution was not concerned; the other a much more
limited scheme for the zoological park, which latter it was understood
in Congress was to be placed under the Smithsonian Institution.

Under these circumstances the honorable Mr. Edmunds introduced
an amendment to the District of Columbia bill, as follows :

AMENDMENT intended to be proposed by Mr. Edmunds to the bill (H. R. 11651)

making appropriations to provide for the expenses of the government of the District

of Columbia for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety,
and for other purposes, viz: Insert the following:

‘“‘ For the establishment of a zoological park in the District of Colum-
bia, two hundred thousand dollars, to be expended under and in accord-
ance with the provisions following, that is to say:

“ That, in order to establish a zoological park in the District of Co-
lumbia, for the advancement of science and the instruction and recrea-
tion of the people, a commission shall be constituted, composed of three
persons, namely: The Secretary of the Interior, the president of the
board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, which shall be known and designated as
the commission for the establishment of a zoological park.

‘¢That the said commission is hereby authorized and directed to make
an inspection of the country along Rock Creek, between Massachusetts
avenue extended and where said creek is crossed by the road leading
west from Brightwood crosses said creek, and to select from that dis-
trict of country such a tract of land, of not less than one hundred acres,
which shall include a section of the creek, as said commission shall
deem to be suitable and appropriate for a zoological park.

‘That the said commission shall cause to be made a careful map of
said zoological park, showing the location, quantity, and character of
each parcel of private property to be taken for such purpose, with the
names of the respective owners inscribed thereon, and the said map
shall be filed and recorded in the public records of the District of Co-
lumbia; and from and after that date the several tracts and parcels of
land embraced in such zoological park shall be held as condemned for
public uses, subject to the payment of just compensation, to be deter-
mined by the said commission and approved by the President of the
United States, provided that such compensation be accepted by the
owner or owners of the several parcels of land.

‘* That if the said commission shall be unable to purchase any portion
of the land so selected and condemned within thirty days after such
condemnation, by agreement with the respective owners, at the price
approved by the President of the United States, it shall, at the expira-
tion of such period of thirty days, make application to the supreme
court of the District of Columbia, by petition, at a general or special
term, for an assessment of the value of such land, and said petition
shall contain a particular description of the proper ty selected and con-
demned, with the name of the owner or owners thereof, and his, her, or
their residences, as far as the same can be ascertained, together with a
copy of the recorded map of the park; and the said’ court is hereby
authorized and required, upon such application, without delay, to notify
the owners and occupants of the land and to ascertain and assess the

value of the land so selected and condemned by appointing three com-
missioners to appraise the value or values thereof, and to return the
appraisement to the court; and when the values of such land are thus
ascertained, and the President shall deem the same reasonable, said
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 31

values shall be paid to the owner or owners, and the United States
shall be deemed to have a valid title to said lands.

“That the said commission is hereby authorized to call upon the
Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey or the Director of the
Geological Survey to make such surveys as may be necessary to carry
into effect the provisions of this section; and the said officers are
hereby authorized and required to make such surveys under the direc-
tion of said commission.”

The amendment of Senator Edmunds was understood to be offered
in a spirit entirely f riendly to the interests of this Institution, but it
differs from that reported from the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, in omitting the name of the Regents, in placing the appro-
priation under those for the District, in removing from the Commis-
sion the power to lay out the land, aud in extending the limits within
which they had choice, to the military road, in this, as in other respects,
resembling the limits of the larger scheme of the national park, as
generally proposed. Onthe 28th of February the Edmunds amendment
passed substantially as above given, and by the President’s approval
of the District bill, became a law on Mareh 2.*

In view of the fact that the zoological park will probably in any case
be the ultimate place of deposit for the living collections now under
the charge of the Regents, and that their secretary is named as one of
the commissioners for effecting the purchase, it seems proper to add a
brief statement of the work done by the commission, which, after per-
sonally and carefully inspecting the whole course of the stream from
Massachusetts avenue to Military road, about 4 miles above the city,
found no district so desirable for the single purpose of a zoological
park as that lying between Woodley Lane and Klingle Bridge, and des-
ignated in the original bill of Senator Morrill; and the commissioners
have proceeded to condemn a tract of 166 acres of the remarkably varied
and picturesque country whose character is described in the secretary’s
letter to the chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds already cited.

The condemnation is not complete without the President’s approval,
which had not been given at the date of the completion of the fiscal

“Extracts from the Congressional Record. Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, states,
““T append the report of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds that the
record may show the exact object in view. There is absolute protection from job-
bery in the fact that this isto be under the supervision of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution.” Mr. Dibble says in the same debate, ‘‘We are proud of the Smithsonian,
and the Smithsonian has already, by gift, not purchase, the nucleus of a collection,
and Tam informed by the Secretary of the Smithsonian that this place furnishes the
right kind of location for the propagation and perpetuation of these rapidly disap-
pearing species of American animals, while at the same time it will serve the pur-
poses of a public park.” Mr. Dibble continued, ‘I am informed that the inquiries,
estimates, and offers indicate that the 120 acres which is included in the design now
in front of the reporter’s desk [referring to a large map showing that part of the
creek between Woodley Lane and Klingle road, which the Morrill bill placed under
the caré of the Regents] can be purchased for something less than $200,000, etc.”
oD REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

year, but I may be allowed to so far anticipate a statement properly
belonging to a later report as to say that this approval has since been
given, and that the land will almost undoubtedly become the property
of the Government. The commission has no power to lay out the land,
and has no instruction from Congress as to its ultimate destination,
owing, it may well be supposed, to the general supposition in the House
that the bill as voted contained a clause placing it under the care of the
Smithsonian Institution.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The Statue to Professor Baird.—In recognition of the distinguished
services of the late Professor Baird, a bill was introduced in the Senate
of the United States, and passed by that body February 10, 1888,
making an appropriation for the erection of a bronze statue to com-
memorate his merits. This bill was referred, in the House of Represen-
tatives, to the Committee on the Library, but was not reported. It is
hoped that this important subject will, during the coming session, re-
ceive the attention which it merits. An appropriation of $25,000 was
made by Congress for the benefit of the widow of the late Secretary,
whose life had been so unselfishly devoted to the service of the nation.

Art Collections.—I alluded in a previous report to the fact that a very
valuable collection of art objects had been promised to the Smithsonian
Institution. The intending donor is understood to contemplate the
transfer of the collection at no very remote period, the principal condi-
tion being that the Institution shall provide a suitable fire-proof build-
ing for it.

Upon the representations of the agent of the Institution in Europe, as
to the value of the collection and as to the desire of its owner to see
your Secretary in order to arrange for the formal transfer, the writer
made a brief visit to France last July, for the purpose of such confer-
ence and arrangement, but illness on the owner’s part has delayed ac-
tion, so that the Secretary is not able, as he had hoped to be, to lay the
matter more fully before the Regents at their present meeting.

Assignment of rooms for scientific work.—During the past year the
use of rooms in the Smithsonian building has been continued to the
Coast and Geodetic Survey for pendulum experiments, and a room has
been assigned to the use of the Zoological Park Commission.

Toner lecture fund.—The Secretary of the Institution is ex officio
chairman of the board of trustees. The fund, consisting partly of
Washington real estate and partly of Government bonds, has an esti-
mated value of about $3,000. A lecture was delivered on May 29, in
the hall of the Museum, by Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia, on “A
Clinical Study of the Skull,” the first delivered under this fund for sey:
eral years,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

Grants and subscriptions.—In accordance with the precedents estab-
lished by your first Secretary for encouraging meritorious scientific en-
terprises, undertaken without view to pecuniary gain, a subscription of
twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal, edited by Dr. B. A. Gould,
has been continued.

Privilege of the floor of the House of Representatives—Owing to the
lamented death of the Hon. S.S. Cox, no further action appears to have
been taken by the House in reference to a bill introduced by him to con-
fer the privilege of the floor on the Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitution.

Smithsonian grounds.—At the request of the Director of the Geologi-
cal Survey, permission was granted to place stones for a base line 300
feet on B street, south, to be used as a standard of comparison for tape
lines.

American Historical Association.—Reference was made in the last re-
port to a bill introduced in the Senate to incorporate the Historical As-
sociation and to connect it with the Smithsonian [nstitution. Congress
has since passed the act organizing the association.

Stereotyping.—All the stereotype plates belonging to the Institution
have been brought from Philadelphia to Washington and stored in the
basement of the building.

I have elsewhere alluded to the fact that the practice of stereotyping
the bulletins and proceedings of the Washington scientific societies Las
been discontinued.

Temporary shed.—I have also elsewhere alluded to the purpose of
putting up in the Smithsonian grounds a temporary shelter for instru-
ments and apparatus, which may at the same time permit of some astro-
physical observations being made. This, however, is only a temporary
expedient, and if the Regents ever sanction the erection of an observa-
tory for this purpose it will be necessary to place it in some very quiet
locality far removed from all tremor. Such a locality exists in the new
zoological park, but while *he action of Congress in regard to the pur-
chase of the latter was still uncertain I addressed a letter to the honor-
able the Secretary of War, asking permission in case it were found de-
sirable to occupy a vacant tract of land in the southern portion of the
cemetery at Arlington for this purpose. His assent was given in the
following letter:

WAR DEPARTMENT,
Washington City, January 9, 1889.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 18th ultimo, requesting that the Smithsonian Institution be author-
ized to occupy a site in the Arlington national cemetery, as indicated
in a memorandum and plat inclosed by you, for the purposes of an
astro-physical laboratory. aa

H, Mis. 2243

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

In reply I beg to advise you that there is no objection to the occupa-
tion, in the manner stated, of a piece of ground not exceeding 2 acres,
indicated on a plat which may be examined in the office of the Quarter-
master-General, provided that the ground in question be vacated
whenever it is required by this Department.

Very respectfully,
Wm. C. ENDICOT?,
Secretary of War.
Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary Snrithsonian Institution.

The plat in question shows the location of the lot near the center and
highest part of the unoccupied wooded ridge, near the colored soldiers’
portion of the cemetery. The site, however, is so distant that I should
not propose to occupy it while any better could be procured.

Reception.—I have alluded in my previous report to the habit of the
first Secretary of giving receptions from time to time in the rooms of
the Institution and to the fact that though these rooms are now de-
voted to official purposes, the writer, desiring to maintain the tradi-
tions of this hospitality, had used them once for a similar purpose. He
has again employed them in this year on the 18th of April for a recep-
tion where it was sought to unite the old and new friends of the Insti-
tution.

Correspondence.—The Institution receives annually inquiries from all
parts of the country for information on topics often most incongruous,
but usually connected with science, which are submitted to the Secre-
tary. None of these inquiries is left unanswered, and the burden of
this correspondence is very considerable. Ithas always been regarded,
however, as incumbent on the Institution to reply to them as a part of
its function in the distribution of knowledge, and a good deal of labor
which does not appear, continues to be devoted to this end.

U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The main features of the work of the National Museum are briefly
referred to in this place. They are fully described elsewhere, in the
separate volume forming the report of Dr. Goode, Assistant Secretary
in charge of the Museum, and the Curators of its several departments.

Classified service of the Museum.—In response to a resolution of the
Senate asking for a‘ schedule of the classified service of the officers and
employés of the National Museum,” a letter was addressed by me on
March 2 to Hon. John J. Ingalls, President pro tempore of the Senate,
transmitting a schedule which upon very careful deliberation repre-
sents the actual necessities of the service.

This schedule and the letter of transmittal were printed as miscel-
laneous document No, 92, Fiftieth Congress, second session, and are
here re-printed: "
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

LETTER of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in reference to Senate reso-
lution of October 8, 1888, asking for ‘fa schedule of the classified service of the
officers and employés of the National Museum.”

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
March 2, 1889.

Sir: In response to the Senate resolution asking for ‘a Sclrodate of
the classified service of the officers and employés of the National Mu-
seum,” I have the honor to transmit the accompanying schedule, which
represents the present actual necessities of the service.

The service for the fiscal year of 1887~88 was reported upon in a let-
ter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, dated December
1, 1888 (H. R. Mis. Doc. No. 55, Fiftieth Congress, second session).

In this the aggregate expenditures for service were shown to have
been $122,750.47, of which sum $97,493.32 was paid from the appro-
priation for preservation of collections, $19.203.79 from that for fur-
niture and fixtures, and $6,053.36 from that for heacing, lighting, and
electrical and telephonic service.

A schedule of the number of persons employed in the various depart-
ments of the Museum was also given in this letter (pages 4, 9, 11).
This schedule should, however, be regarded only as an approximate
one, since many of the employés were actually engaged only a part of
the year, and others were temporarily transferred to the pay-rolls of
the Cineinnati Exhibition and were engaged in special work in connec-
tion with that exhibition.

It is estimated that the aggregate expenditures for services for the
present fiscal year (1888~89) will be $129,710, of which amount $103,000
will be paid from the appropriation for preservation of collections,
$20, 000 from that for furniture and fixtures, and $5,710 from that for
heating , lighting, and electrical and telephone service.

In the schedule herewith transmitted it is shown that for the proper
working of the Museum the amount required for services would be as
follows:

The increase in the total expenditure, as indicated, is due partly to
the addition of a number of officers to the scientific staff, and also to
the necessity for a few additional clerks, and a considerable number of
watchmen, laborers, cleaners, and messengers, whose services are essen-
tial to the safety of the collections, as well as to provide for the clean-
liness and proper care of the buildings and for the comfort of visitors.

The rates of pay indicated are in most cases considerably lower than
are customarily allowed for a similar service in the Executive Depart-
ments.

In the schedule now presented, expenditure for services only is taken
into consideration,
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

No attempt has been made to present the needs of the Museum in
regard to the purchase or collecting of specimens, the purchase of gen-
eral supplies, preservatives, materials for mounting and installing col-
lections, books, exhibition cases, furniture, fuel, and gas, the mainte-
nance of the heating and lighting appliances, freight and cartage, trav-
elling expenses of collectors and agents, ete.

For these various purposes the expenditure in the last fiscal year
amounted to $45,249.53, and that for the present fiscal year will, it is
estimated, amount to about $48,000, asum very inadequate to the needs
of the service.

It does not include the expenditures for printing the labels and blanks
and proceedings and bulletins of the Museum, for which the appropri-
ation for many years past has been $10,000, and for which I have asked
$15,000 for the coming fiscal year.

I must not omit to call your attention to the fact that, owing to the
peculiar constitution of the Museum as a scientific establishment, it has
hitherto been possible to secure a special economy, owing to the fact
that its officers and employés are not scheduled as in the Executive De-
partments.

In thus presenting, in obedience to the request of the Senate, a sched-
ule of a durable organization of the service, | wish to remark, emphati-
cally, that there are pressing needs in other directions—needs that merit
the serious consideration of Congress, in order that the National Mu-
seum may be enabled to maintain a satisfactory position in comparison
with those of European nations.

I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,
S. P. LANGLEY,

Hon. JOHN J. INGALLS, Secretary.

President, pro tempore, of the Senate.

In presenting these schedules to Congress I have shown what would
be the cost of the administration of the Museum, in respect to salaries
alone, if it were organized after the manner of the Executive Depart-
ments of the Government.

The salary list alone amounts to $199,121, and the amount expended
in the previous fiscal year for other purposes was $45,000, a sum which
might most advantageously be doubled.

Iam not prepared at present to recommend the adoption of such a
schedule of classified service, since I am of the opinion that the Museum
at the present time has greater need of money to be used in the acqui-
sition of new material by purchase and exploration. The opportunities
for making collections are yearly growing less, and many things which
ean now be done at trifling expense will in a few years be imprac-
ticable.

ee ee ee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oo

The system of appropriation for specific objects, without designating
the number of employés or the amounts of their salaries, has in the
past been found to be economical and efficient, and although the neces-
sity of the change to a classified service may arise at some later time,
I trust that if may be deferred for the present.

The amount asked for in the estimates for the fiseal year of 1891-92,
for the “ preservation of collections,” is intended to provide for a certain
amount of increase of the collections, and also to provide for the pay-
ment of certain salaries.

Increase of the collections.—At the close of the fiscal year (June 30,
1889) a very careful estimate showed that the collections were sixteen
times as great in number of specimens as in the year 1882. I desire to
call your attention especially to the statements bearing upon this point.

The Museum, as I have already said, is growing as it is fitting that
the National Museum of a great country should grow, and it is not only
necessary to care for what is already here, but to provide for the recep-
tion and display of the great collections which will unquestionably be
received in the immediate future.

The extent and character of the accessions during the year.is shown
in the appended table, from which it appears that the total number of
specimens in the Museum is now not far from 3,000,000 :

Catalogue entries.—The number of entries made in the catalogues of
the various departments in the Museum during the year has been
23,171.

The registrar states that 16,625 boxes and packages* have been re.
ceived during the year and entered upon the transportation records
of the Smithsonian Institution. Of this number 2,182 contained speci-
mens for the Museum.

PRINCIPAL ACCESSIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

Among the collections received during the year, those from the U.S.
Geological Survey and the Bureau of Ethnology are especially note-
worthy. The material transferred by the U.S. Fish Commission to the
National Museum included two very valuable collections made by the
steamer Albatross during the voyage from Washington to San Fran-
cisco and while cruising off the coast of Alaska.

The accessions received during the year from general sources are
fully up to the standard of previous years. Among the most important
are the following :

Ethnological.—Collections from Dr. James Grant Bey, of Cairo, Egypt,
and from Mr. W. W. Rockhill, formerly connected with the German
legation in Pekin, the former collection from Egypt, the latter illus-
trative of the religious practices, occupations, and amusements of vari-
ous peoples in different parts of China, Thibet, and Turkestan; a col-
lection of oriental seals from Mrs. Anna Randall Diehl, of New York
City; casts of Assyrian and Egyptian objects obtained by Prof. Paul
Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University.

The valuable co-operation of the Bureau of Ethnology is evidenced
in the transmission of a large and interesting collection of pottery,
stone implements, woven fabrics, shells, beans, etc., collected by Major
J. W. Powell, Arthur P. Davis, Gerard Fowke, Dr. E. Boban, Dr. H. C.
Yarrow, James Stevenson, Dr. J. 8. Taylor, C. C. Jones, James D. Mid-
dleton, General G. P. Thruston, James P. Tilton, H. P. Hamilton, Victor
Mindeleff, H. W. Henshaw, G. H. Hurlbut, W. W. Adams, De L. W. Gill,
William A. Hakes, W. H. Holmes, and Charles L. R. Wheeler. This col-
lection was the result of personal research in the following localities:
Mexico, Peru, New Mexico, Wisconsin, California, Arizona, Alabama,
Georgia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Massachusetts, New York, and Vir-
ginia.

Archeological.—Collection of aboriginal pottery from Lake Apopka,
Florida, contributed by Dr. Featherstonehaugh, and a collection of simi-
lar material from Perdido Bay, Alabama, presented by Mr. F. H. Par-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

the most valuable collectious received during the year were obtained
through the co-operation of Government officials, and are referred to at
length in the report on the Museum for this year.

Co-operation of Departments and Bureaus of the Government.—The Mu-
seum has received, as in past years, many valuable contributions from
United State consuls, officers of the Army and the Navy, and through
the co-operation of the Departments and Bureaus of the Government.

Through the courtesy of the Department of State the work of col-
lectors in foreign countries has been greatly facilitated. The Secretary
of the Treasury has issued several permits for the free entry of Museum
material.

The Secretary of Agriculture has expressed his w'llingness to co-
operate with the National Museum in the matter of making a forestry
exhibit, and Dr. B. E, Fernow has been appointed honorary curator of
the collection.

By direction of the Postmaster-Generai the Superintendent of the
Dead Letter Office has been instructed to inform the Museum of the
receipt in his office of specimens which might be of value for addition
to the collections.

The Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has, as in pre-
vious years, aided our work in many ways.

Photographic exhibit—A collection intended to show the uses of
photography was prepared by Mr. T. W. Smillie, of the National Mu-
seum, for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition. This collection in-
cluded valuable contributions of photographs from Prof. EB. C. Picker-
ing, of Harvard University, Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington, and
froin several officers connected with the Government service, notably
the Light-House Board, the Army Medical Museum, and the proving
ground at Annapolis. At the close of the Exposition this collection
was returned to the Museum, and is now being prepared, in connection
with additional material which has since been received, for permanent
exhibition. It is intended that the scope of this exhibit shall be en-
larged so as to take the form of a historical collection in which shal]
be shown examples of every photographie process that has been in-
vented, together with the appliances used, beginning with the photo-
graph of the solar spectrum as made by Sheele in 1777. Considerable
material has been already gathered which will be incorporated in this
collection. ‘The first camera made in the United States has been ac-
quired by purchase, <A stereoscope containing daguerreotypes and
transparencies by the old albumen process on glass has been presented
by Mrs. E. J. Stone. The Scoville Manufacturing Company of New
York has presented a series of cameras showing the latest improve-
ments, and from the Eastman Dry Plate Company, of Rochester, N. Y.,
A6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

has been received a Kodak camera, together with a’series of enlarged
photographs illustrating its use.

Distribution of duplicate specimens.—Duplicate specimens, to the num-
ver of 11,382, were distributed during the year among museums, colleges,
and individuals. The following table shows the character and extent of
these distributions :

The decrease in the number of specimens thus given away, as com-
pared with last year, is accounted for by the fact that only 2,072 speci-
meus of marine invertebrates have been distributed this year, while
last year 24,750 specimens of this class were presented to applicants.
Eliminating this class of specimens, the number distributed this year is
double that oflast year. The number of requests for duplicate specimens
increase yearly. It is boped that in the future it may be possible for the
Museum to extend its usefulness in this important part of the work.
The material now available for distribution is quite Inadequate to supply
thedemand. The curators of mineralogy and of geology obtained a large
quantity of material during the past summer for this special purpose.
As soon as it has been classified and arranged into sets, an endeavor
will be made to fill the many applications for mineralogical and litho-
logical material now awaiting action. The matter of making up sets of
duplicate bird-skins is now receiving careful attention, there being
much of such material available for distribution.

Labels.—During the year, 3,991 labels were printed, chiefly for use in
the departments of metallurgy, materia medica, and birds.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

Aceessions to the library.—The number of publications added to the
library during the year is 6,052, of which 618 are volumes of more than
100 pages, 903 are pamphlets, 4,345 are parts of regular serial:, and 158
charts. The most important accession was the gift by the heirs of the
late Dr. Isaac Lea, consisting of 137 volumes, 276 “ parts,” and 693
pamphlets, and including a nearly complete series of the “ Proceedings
of the Zoological Society of London.” There are now nineteen sectional
libraries attached to the several curatorships in the Museum.

Publications of the Museum.—The issue of Museum publications during
the year has been unusually small, owing to the pressure of Congres-
sional work at the Printing Office during the long Congressional session
of 1888, which caused the Museum work to be set aside. A number of
special publications are partially completed, and will be issued soon
after the beginning of the next fiscal year.

During the year volume 10 of Proceedings of the U. S. National
Museum (1887) was issued. This contains vill + 771 pages and 39
plates. It includes 78 papers by 26 authors, 10 of whom are officers of
the Museum. Nearly three-fourths of the papers relate to birds and
fishes. In the appendix is printed a catalogue of the exhibit prepared
by Mr. 8. R. Koehler, in charge of the section of graphic arts, for the
Ohio Valley Centenial Exposition. Special papers were prepared by
the curators of several departments, in connection with the exhibits for
‘this exposition, which will be reprinted in Section ITI of the Museum
report for the present year.

Bulletin 33 of the United States National Museum, “A catalogue of
minerals and their synomyms alphabetically arranged for the use of
museums” by Prof. T. Egleston, Ph. D., of Columbia College, was issued
in May. This volume contains a complete catalogue of the names of
minerals and their synonyms, and will be of much value to students
of mineralogy and others interested in this science.

The assistant secretary in charge of the Museum has submitted a
statement reviewing the history of the publications of the Museum, and
making certain suggestions with a view to increasing the extent of the
editions and to the establishment of a systematic method of distribu-
tion. From this statement I quote the following remarks and recom-
mendations relating to the Proceedings and Bulletin:

“The Proceedings was established for the purpose of securing prompt
publication of the discoveries in the Museum. In order to secure this
object the printing has been done, signature by signature, as fast as mat-
ter was prepared. A certain number of signatures has always been dis-
tributed, as soon as published, to scientific institutions and specialists.

The number of sets of signatures thus distributed has been in the neigh-
borhood of 200.

« This method of publication has seemed to be to some extent waste-
ful, and it is thought that equally good results may be secured by dis-
tributing a certain number of the advance copies in the form of authors’
extras. In making arrangements for the printing of Volume XII it
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was decided that out of the edition of 1,200 copies, 100 should be de-
livered in signatures as fast as printed, and 300 in extras or reprints,
in paper covers, of which 50 are to be given to the authors and the
remainder distributed to specialists in the various departments to which
the papers relate, who are not otherwise provided with the publica-
tion; while the 800 remaining volumes are to be bound previous to dis-
tribution.

‘¢In special instances, where a given paper in the Proceedings is be-
lieved to possess great general interest, it has been customary to print
a considerable number of extra copies.

‘‘The publication of the Proceedings and the Bulletin was at first
paid for from the printing fund of the Interior Department, with which
the Museum was at that time in close relations in respect to financial
matters. Subsequently it was paid for from the fund for the printing
of Museum labels, estimates for which were annually submitted by the
Secretary of the Institution. The amount asked for was usu ‘lly $10,000.
In the Book of Estimates the Museum appeared as asking a certain sum
for printing, though the money was actually included in the gross sum
allotted to the Interior Department as a printing fund.

‘In 1882,a separate appropriation was made for the first time, in
these words: ‘For the National Museum, for printing labels and blanks
and for the Bulletins and annual volumes of the Proceedings of the
Museum, ten thousand dollars,’

‘In 1888 the appropriation for the fiscal year 1888-9 was made in the
same words, but was not included, as heretofore, in the appropriations
for the Department of the Interior.

‘¢The edition of the earlier volumes of the Proceedings and Bulletins
was usually only 1,000, of which a portion was distributed by the De-
partment of the Interior and a portion by the Museum. The number
received by the Museum being sometimes 500 and sometimes as few as
250. The edition placed at the disposal of the Museum being so small,
and withal so uncertain as to extent, the distribution was always of
necessity informal, and no effort was made to supply a regular list
of institutions and specialists. A considerable number was expended
in the work of the Museum, and the remainder were sent to corres-
pondents of the Museum in exchange for publications, for specimens,
and incidentally to such institutions as might apply for copies, as well
as to individuals, especially students who made it evident that they
were in a position to make good use of the books.

‘¢ Formal publication was undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution,
it being the intention that the first cost of composition and electrotyping
having been provided for by the special Congressional appropriation,
the Smithsonian Institution should avail itself of the electrotype plates
and use them in making up certain volumes of the Miscellaneous Col-
lections. The papers published in the Proceedings and Bulletins of
the Museum were of precisely the same character which, since 1862,
had made up the great majority of the most important papers in
the Miscellaneovs Collections. The Institution undertook to print
an edition of 1,200 copies in the form of volumes of the Miscellaneous
Collections and to distribute them to the principal libraries of the
world. This was, at the time, regarded as advantageous, since the
cost of composition and electrotyping made up at least two-thirds of
the cost of the edition of 1,200, while the miscellaueous distribution,
for which the Institution, in the case of similar publications printed
at its own expense, had been accustomed to provide, was now already
arranged for out of the preliminary issue of several hundred copies
paid tor from the Museum fund. —
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

“The first four volumes of the Proceedings and the first sixteen num-
bers of the Bulletin were published in this manner.

“Since 1883 no publication of the Bulletins has been made, and none
has been made in the case of the Proceedings since 1882.

“There remain unpublished eleven volumes of the Proceedings and
twenty-one numbers of the Bulletin—in all, enough to make ten thick
volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections. Possibly, by condensation
and omissions, the number might be reduced to nine volumes. If the
Institution were to undertake to print the edition of 1,000 now cus-
tomary in the case of the Miscellaneous Collections, the cost would be
not Jess than $9,000. The same amount expended by the Institution in
printing fresh matter would probably not produce more than one and
one half volumes, or at most two volumes, of Miscellaneous Collections.

“The Institution is possibly under obligations to provide for the pub-
lication of these papers, since in the advertisement to each volume of
the Bulletin as late as 1887 (Bulletin 33) appears the statement that
‘from time to time the publications of the Museum which have been
issued separately are combined together and issued as volumes of the
Miscellaneous Collections.’

“Asa matter of fact, however, the publication of an edition of 1,000
copies by the Smithsonian Institution would not really meet the neces-
sities of the case, since it would leave unsupplied a very large number
of libraries quite as deserving as those already on the distribution
list.”

It seems, in view of all these facts, that it is not desirable that
the Institution showld undertake hereafter the publication of the Mu-
seum Bulletin and Proceedings, since it is evident that these will in-
crease in bulk from year to year, and that the demand upon the Insti-
tution would very soon become too burdensome. Dr. Goode suggests
that Congress be requested to increase the appropriation for the Mu-
seum printing to $18,000 in order that an edition of 2,000 copies may be
printed in addition to the customary number. If this arrangement
should be carried out, the Smithsonian Institution would be relieved of
the responsibility of providing for the publication of these documents.
The issue of the enlarged edition would commence with volume 13 of
the Proceedings and with Bulletin 40 or 41. In considering the question
of publishing back volumes of t he Proceedings and Bulletin, Dr. Goode
remarks:

‘* When we come to the question of the publication of the back vol-
umes, volumes 1 to 4 of the Proceedings and Bulletins 1 to 16 may be
regarded as published, although not to the extent to which it would seem
desirable in the way of supplying local institutions. Of the following,
we have in hand enough to make a very fair distribution, viz: Proceed-
ings, volumes 10 and 11 and Bulletins No. 33 to 37. Of volumes 5 to 9
of Proceedings and of Bulletins 17 to 32, however, no systematic publi-
cation can be made without the printing of an additional number of
copies.

Students.—In accordance with the policy of past years, free access to
the coltections has been granted to students in the various branches of

natural history, and in many instances specimens have been lent to
specialists for comparison and study. Instruction in taxidermy has
been given to several applicants. Two of these intend to apply the
knowledge thus acquired in making collections for the Museum, namely,
Lieut. E. H. Taunt, United States consular agent to the Congo, and
Mr. Harry Perry, who expects to spend several years in Honduras.
Mr. T. W. Smillie has given instruction in photography to the follow-
ing persons: Lieut. KE. H. Taunt, Mr. W. H. Perry, Mr. Barton Bean,
Mr. Howard, Prof. Daish, and Miss Frances Bb. Johnston.

Special researches.—The special researches of the curators are re-
ferred to at length in the report of the National Museum. I may
say, in this connection, that the time which those officers are able to
devote to work of this kind is very limited, owing to the large amount
of mechanical and routine work to which, in the absence of necessary
assistance, it is necessary for them to give their personal attention.

Meetings and lectwres.—The use of the lecture hall has been granted
for lectures and meetings of scientific societies, as follows: The Na-
tional Dental Association met on July 24, 25, and 26. On the evening
of September 20 was held one of the meetings of the Medical Congress.
The American Ornithologists’ Union held its sixth congress on Novem-
ber 13, 14, and 15. A meeting of the Department of Superintendence
of the National Educational Association was held on March 6, 7, and 8.
.The National Academy of Sciences held its meetings on April 16, 17,
and 18. The Council of the American Geological Society and the Ameri-
can Committee of the International Geological Congress held business
meetings on April 19. The American Historical Association held its
fifth meeting in Washington during Christmas week; the evening ses-
sions being held at the Columbia University, the morning sessions at
the Museum.

In the Toner course Dr. Harrison Allen delivered a lecture on May
29 entitled “Clinical Study of the Skull undertaken in connection with
the Morbid Condition of the Jaws and Nasal Chambers.”

The usual course of Saturday lectures, ten in number, beginning
March 9 and ending May 11, was delivered under the direction of the
oint committee of the scientific societies of Washington.

The usual courtesies have been extended to museums and other pub-
lic institutions by the gift and loan of drawings and photographs of
specimens and copies of Museum labels.

Visitors.—The number of visitors to the Museum building is constantly
increasing. The register shows that a total number of 374,843 persons
visited the Museum during the year. This exceeds the number for last
year by 125,818, and shows an increase of more than 50 per cent. The
visitors to the Smithsonian building numbered 149,618, an increase of
46,177 over last year. ‘On March 5, owing to the crowds of visitors to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Hl

the city attending the Inauguration cermonies, no less than 86,107 per-
sons visited the Smithsonian and Museum buildings.

Personnel.—During the year a department of forestry has been estab-
lished, and with the consent of the Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. B. E.
Fernow, chief of the forestry division of the Department of Agriculture,
has been appointed its curator.

Dr. George Vasey, of the Department of Agriculture, has been ap-
pointed curator of botany, and in that capacity controls the botanical
collections in the National Museum and in the Department of Agri-
culture. Prof. Paul Haupt, curator of Oriental antiquities in the Na-
tional Museum, was designated as the representative of the Smithsonian
Institution at the Eighth International Congress of Orientalists, to meet
in Stockholm and Christiania in September. Prof. Otis T. Mason was
instructed to proceed to Europe to visit the principal ethnological mu-
seums of France, Germany, Denmark, and England, for the purpose of
making arrangements for the increase of the collections at the U.S.
National Museum, and incidentally, through the study of methods of
installation, of providing for the more effectual preservation and utiliza-
tion of these collections. Mr. Thomas Wilson was directed to proceed to
Europe to visit the principal museums of France, England, and Dublin
for the purpose of studying the methods of installation employed by
the European museums.

On August 13, Mr. Silas Stearns, of Pensacola, Fla., who for many
years has been a correspondent of the Smithsonian Institution, and has
made important collections of fishes in the Gulf of Mexico, died at
Asheville, N. C.

Explorations.—During the summer of 1888, Mr. George P. Merrill,
curator of geology, made a collecting trip to North Carolina, Pennsyl-
vania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine.
Large collections of rocks were obtained for the Museum. Mr. Thomas
Wilson, curator of prehistoric anthropology, visited mounds in Ohio,
and made interesting collections. Ensign W. L. Howard, U.S. Navy,
who, acting under orders from the Navy Department, sailed for Kotze-
bue Sound in May last, is making collections in Alaska for the National
Museum. Prof. O. P. Jenkins, of De Pauw University, Indiana, is vis-
iting the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of collecting fishes. A series
of his specimens has been promised for the National Museum. In
Augast Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, of the U. 8S. Geoglogical Survey, visited
some of the Western States and Territories partly with a view to
making collections of minerals. These will eventually be incorporated
with the Museum collections.

Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States.—The act
of Congress directing the Executive Departments of the Government,
the Department of Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution (includ-

ing the National Museum and the U. S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries)
to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and
Central States, to be held in Cincinnati from July 4 to October 27, 1888,
passed both houses of Congress and received the approval of the Presi-
dent on May 28. In addition to this, a joint resolution was adopted
in which the true intent of the act was declared, with a view to cor-
recting certain misapprehensions which had arisen in regard to the
objects for which the money appropriated by Congress in connection
with this exhibition could be legally expended. This joint resolution
was approved by the President on July 16. <A copy of the act and of
the joint resolution will be found in the report of the assistant secre-
tary for 1889, wherein is also published a full account of the exhibit
prepared under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution in accord-
ance with the terms of the act referred to. Of the $50,000 appropriated
for the Smithsonian Institution $10,000 was set apart for the U.S.
Fish Commission. About 42,000 square feet of exhibition space were
reserved for the Government exhibits, 12,000 square feet being devoted
to that of the Smithsonian Institution. The assistant secretary was
on May 29 appointed representative of the Smithsonian Institution,
and active operations for the preparation of a creditable display were
immediately commenced. It was unfortunate that only a little more
than a month intervened between the passage of the act and the open-
ing of the exhibition. The Smithsonian Institution has, however, had
a varied experience in preparing exhibits at a short notice. The first
car-load of exhibits left for Cincinnati on June 22, and the last of the
twelve car-loads which were sent was shipped on July 12. The follow-
ing departments of the National Museum were represented at the exhi-
bition, the number of square feet assigned to each being also given :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

In addition to this a special exhibit was prepared by the Bureau of
Ethnology, Maj. J. W. Powell, Director, to which 1,425 square feet were
assigned. The total number of visitors to the exhibition was 1,055,276.

Dr. Goode was unable, on account of other duties, to personally attend
the exhibition, and Mr. R. E. Earll was placed in charge of the exhibit.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in connection with the ex-
penditure of the funds appropriated by Congress for the work of pre-
paring exhibits, owing to the decisions of the special auditor appointed
to audit the exposition accounts. His objections were in every instance
finally withdrawn, and all vouchers have now, after protracted delays,
been approved by that official. An extraordinary number of points of
a trivial nature were raised, which necessitated the writing of as numer-
ous letters to answer questions which had not previously been under-
stood to come within the province of an auditor. In view of this ex-
perience it is urged that should Congress at any time direct the Smith-
sonian Institution to participate in future expositions, the law be so
framed as to require the appointment of an auditing officer who is
familiar with the demands of exhibition work. If, however, this be im-
practicable, it seems proper that the responsibility of selecting and
deciding as to what should be the character of the exhibits should be
left entirely to the judgment of the various Departments, the auditor’s
work being limited to the examination of the accounts, which should of
course be sufficiently detailed to prevent errors. Another cause of de-
lay in settling the exhibition accounts was due to the fact that the
disbursing officer was stationed at Newport, Ky., instead of Washing-
ton, where by far the greater part of the bills were contracted. The
paymaster drew checks upon the Cincinnati depository only, and this
method appeared to be unjust, since it obliged employés to wait several
days before receiving payment, and in addition to lose some part of their
money, owing to the refusal of the Treasury Departmezt in Washington
to honor the checks. The only alternative for them was to present the
checks to local banks, paying the usual discount rates.

Marietta Centennial Exposition.— By an Executive order, dated July
11, 1888, permission was granted to the heads of the departments rep-
resented at the Cincinnati Exhibition to send to the Centennial Expo-
sition at Marietta, Ohio, such objects as could be conveniently spared
either from the exhibits at Cincinnati or direct from Washington. In
accordance with this order an exhibit was prepared under the direction
of the assistant secretary. Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the Museum,
was appointed by him as his representative. Since only one day inter-
vened in this instance between the issuing of the Executive order and
the opening of the exhibition there was no time to be lost. An exhibit,
with a total weight of 7,527 pounds, was prepared and installed at
Marietta before the opening of the exhibition. The exhibit included
specimens selected from the Haida collection of ethnological objects,
lithographs of the game fishes of the United States, a series of medals,
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

photographs of public buildings in Washington, a collection of auto-
types, and a series of specimens illustrating the composition of the
human body. In addition to these a collection of models, engravings,
and paintings illustrative of the methods of transportation adopted by
the early settlers in America was selected by Mr. J. E. Watkins from
the exhibit of the department of transportation at the Cincinnati Ex-
hibition and forwarded to Marietta.

The organization of the Government Board which was charged with
preparations for the Philadelphia Exhibition was so far superior to that
of those more recently formed, that it would seem desirable that the
plan in favor at that time should be followed as far as possible should
similar work be decided upon in connection with future exhibitions.

I regret the growing tendency to withdraw for special expositions a
considerable portion of some of the most valuable parts of the collee-
tion. The Museum is now approaching a final arrangement in classifi-
cation, and the objections to this are therefore much stronger now than
some years ago when the condition of the collections was more unsettled.
The preparation for an exposition seriously impairs the work of the
Museum, while considerable damage invariably results to the collec-
tions, and often in such a degree that.it requires much time and ex-
pense to restore them. The managers of local expositions are no longer
satisfied to accept the specimens which can be most conveniently
spared, but are always anxious to have the most valuable and costly
objects. Temporary exposition buildings are never made fire-proof,
and the time is sure to come, if the present practice prevails, when
some exhibition building containing Government collections to the value
of hundreds of thousands of dollars will be destroyed. The experi-
ence of the Mexican Government in its participation at the New Orleans
Exposition, and of the Government of New South Wales in 1883, may
be cited as warnings. If, however, Congress should order in future
our participation in expositions, I would especially urge that provision
for the work be made at least six months before the date of opening.
In each instance in the past the notice has always been extremely
short, usually only a few weeks, and in one or two cases less than a
week.

I am also disposed to lay stress upon the necessity of liberal appro-
priations, which should be made with the understanding that new ma-
terial may be obtained, which shall not only replace that which has been
lost in past exhibitions, but shall enrich the Museum collections for
home use and for use in future exhibition work. If this necessity is
not recognized, the result will be that in a few years the Museum will
be greatly impoverished, not only by the destruction of material, but
also by the dissipation of the energy of its staff, which, being applied
to temporary purposes in this way, is taken away from its legitimate
work. It would indeed seem only fair that a distraction of this kind,
which affects in large degree every ofticer and employé, should be com-

pensated for by the opportunity to purchase new material which will
remain permanently the property of the Government and increase the
usefulness of the governmental Museum work.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnologic researches among the North American Indians were con-
tinued, under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in compli-
ance with acts of Congress, during the year 1888~’89. Maj. J. W. Pow-
ell, as director of the work, has furnished the following account of
operations:

A report upon the work of the year is most conveniently given under
two general heads, viz., field work and office work.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations -
and (2) general field studies, the latter being directed chiefly to arch-
ology, linguistics, and pictography.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the east-
ern United States was, as in former years, under the superintendence
of Prof. Cyrus Thomas. The efforts of the division were chiefly con-
fined to the examination of material already collected, and to the ar-
rangement and preparation for publication of the data in hand. Field
work received much less attention, therefore, than in previous years,
and was mainly directed to such investigations as were necessary to
elucidate doubtful points, and to the examination and surveys of im-
portant works which had not before received adequate attention.

The only assistants whose engagements embraced the entire year
were Mr. James D. Middleton and Mr. Henry L. Reynolds. Mr. Gerard
Fowke, one of the regular assistants, closed his connection with the
division at the end of the second month. Mr. John W. Emmert was
engaged as a temporary assistant for a few months.

During the short time he remained with the division, Mr. Fowke was
engaged in exploring certain mounds in the Scioto Valley, Ohio, a field
to which Messrs. Squier and Davis had devoted much attention. The
re-examination of this field was for the purpose of investigating certain
typical mounds which had not been thoroughly examined by those
explorers.

Mr. Middleton was employed from July to the latter part of October
in the exploration of mounds and other ancient works in Calhoun
County, Ill., a territory to which special interest attaches because it
seems to be on the border line of different archieologice districts. From
October until some time in December he was engaged at Washington
in preparing: plats of Ohio earth-works. During the next month he
made re-surveys of some of the more important inclosures in Ohio, after
which he continued work in the office at Washington until the latter
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

part of March, when he was sent to Tennessee to examine certain mound
groups, and to determine, so far as possible, the exact locations of the
old Cheroki ‘‘ Over-hill towns.” The result of this last-mentioned in-
vestigation was one of the most valuable of the year, as it indicated
that each of these ‘“ Over-hill towns” was, with possibly one unimpor-
tant exception, in the locality of a mound group.

Near the close of October Mr. Reynolds, having already examined
the inclosures of the northern, eastern, and western sections of the
mound region, was sent to Ohio and West Virginia to study the differ-
ent types found there, with reference to the chapters he is preparing
on the various forms of inclosures of the United States. While thus
engaged he explored a large mound connected with one of the typical
works in Paint Creek Valley, obtaining unexpected and important
results. The construction of this tumulus was found to be quite dif-
ferent from most of those of the same section examined by Messrs.
Squier and Davis.

Mr. Emmert devoted the few months he was employed to the suc-
cessful exploration of mounds in eastern Tennessee. Some important
discoveries were made, and additional interesting facts were ascertained
in regard to the customs of the mound builders of that section.

General field studies.—Early in the month of July Col. Garrick Mal-
lery proceeded to Maine, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, to con-
tinue investigation into the pictographs of the Abnaki and Micmac
Indians, which had been commenced in 1888. He first visited rocks on
the main-land, near Machiasport, and on Hog Island, in Holmes Bay, a
part of Machias Bay. In both localities pecked petroglyphs were
found, accurate copies of which were taken. Some of them had not
before been reported. They were probably of Abnaki origin, either of
the Penobscot or the Passamaquoddy divisions, the rocks lying on the
line of water communication between those divisions. From there he
proceeded to Kejemkoojik Lake, on the border of Queen’s and Annap-
olis counties, Nova Scotia, and resumed the work of drawing and trae-
ing the large number of petroglyphs found during the previous summer.
Perfect copies were obtained of so many of them as are amply suffi-
cient for study and comparison. These petroglyphs were etched and
were made by Miemacs. The country of the Malecites, on the St.
John’s River, New Brunswick, was next visited. No petroglyphs were
discovered, but a considerable amount of information upon the old
system of pictographs on birch bark and its use was obtained. Ilus-
trative specimens were secured, together with myths and legends as-
sisting in the elucidation of some of the pictographs which had been
obtained elsewhere.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded in July to visit the Red Lake and White
Earth Indian reservations in Minnesota. At Red Lake he obtained
copies of birch-bark records pertaining to the Midewiwin or Grand Medi-

cine Society of the Ojibwa, an order of shamans or priests professing the
power of prophesy, the cure of disease, and the ability to confer success
in the chase. The introductory portion of the ritual of this society per-
tains particularly to the Ojibwa ideas of creation. At the same place
several mnemonic charts were secured, consisting of birch-bark records
of hunting expeditions, battles with neighboring tribes ot Indians, maps,
and songs. He also investigates the former and present practice of
tattooing, and the Ojibwa works of art in colors, beads, and quills.

At White Earth Reservation two distinct charts of the Grand Medi-
cine Society were obtained, together with full explanations by two of
the chief midé or shamans, one of whom was the only fourth-degree
priest in either of the reservations. Although a considerable amount
of difference between these three charts is apparent, the principles are
common to them all as well as the general course of the initiation of
candidates. Aninteresting fact appears in the survival of archaic forms
in the charts and ritual, seemingly indicating a considerable antiquity.
A large number of mnemonic songs was also obtained at this reservation.
In addition to much of the ritual, secured directly from the priests, in
the original language, translations of the songs were also recorded in
musical notation. After the completion of his labors at the above reser-
vations, Dr. Hoffman proceeded to Pipestone, Minn., to secure copies
of pictographs reported to oceur.upon the cliffs of that well-known
locality. The reports of the great number of petroglyphs were found
to have been greatly exaggerated, though a number of what appeared
to be personal names were found on the rocks. He then returned to
St. Paul, Minn., to search the records of the library of the Minnesota
Historical Society for copies of pictographs reported to have been made
near La Pointe, Wis. Little information was gathered, although it is
well known that such records existed upon conspicuous cliffs and rocks
near Lake Superior at and in the vicinity of Bayfield and Ashland.

Dr. Hoftman afterwards made a personal examination of the “ pic-
tured cave” 8 miles northeast ef La Crosse, Wis., to obtain copies of
the various characters occurring there. These are rapidly being de-
stroyed by the disintegration of the rock. The colors employed in de-
lineating the various figures consisted of dark red and black. The fig-
ures represented deer, human beings, and various animals and forms
not now distinguishable.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw spent the months of August, September, and
October on the Pacific coast, engaged in the collection of vocabularies
of certain Indian languages, with a view to their study and classifica-
tion. The Umatilla Reservation in Oregon was first visited with the
object of obtaining a comprehensive vocabulary of the Cayuse. Though
there are about four hundred of these Indians on the reservation prob-
ably not more than six speak the Cayuse tongue. The Cayuse have
extensively intermarried with the Umatilla, and now speak the language
of the latter, or that of the Nez Pereé. An excellent Cayuse vocabulary
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was obtained, and at the same time the opportunity was embraced to
secure vocabularies of the Umatilla and the Nez Percé languages. His
next objective point was the neighborhood of the San Rafael Mission,
Marin County, Cal., the hope being entertained that here would be
found some ofthe Indians formerly gathered at the mission. He learned
that there were no Indians at or near San Rafael, but subsequently
found some half dozen on the shores of Tomales Bay, to the north.
From one of these a good vocabulary was collected, and, as was ex-
pected, was subsequently found to be related to the Moquelumnan fam-
ily of the interior, to the southeast of San Francisco Bay. Later the
missions of Santa Cruz and Monterey were visited. At these points
there still remain a few old Indians who retain a certain command of
their own language, though Spanish forms their ordinary means of in-
tercourse. The vocabularies obtained are sufficient to prove, beyond
any reasonable doubt, that there were two linguistic families instead of
one, as had been formerly supposed, in the country above referred to.
A still more important discovery was made by Mr. Henshaw at Monte-
rey, Where an old woman was found who succeeded in calling to mind
more than one hundred words and short phrases of the Esselen lan-
guage, formerly spoken near Monterey, but less than forty words of
which had been previously known. Near the town of Cayueas, to the
south, an aged, blind Indian was visited who was able to add somewhat
to the stock of Esselen words obtained at Monterey, and to give besides
valuable information concerning the original home of this tribe. As a
result of the study of this material, Mr. Henshaw determines the Es-
selen to be a distinct linguistic family, a conclusion first drawn by Mr.
Curtin, from a study of the vocabularies collected by Galiano and Lam-
anon in the 18th century. The territory occupied by the tribe and lin-
guistic family lies coastwise, southof Monterey Bay, as far as the Santa
Lucia Mountain.

On July 5 Mr. James Mooney started on a second trip to the Cheroki
Nation in North Carolina, returning November 14, after an absence of
about four months. During this time he made considerable additions
to the linguistic material already obtained by him, and was able to
demonstrate the former existence of a fourth, and perhaps even of a
fifth, well-marked Cheroki dialect in addition to the upper, lower, and
middle dialects already known. The invention of a Cheroki syllabary,
which was adapted to the sounds of the upper dialect, has tended to
make that the universal dialect. A number of myths were collected,
together with a large amount of miscellaneous material relating to the
Cheroki tribe, and the great tribal game of ball play, with its attendant
ceremonies of dancing, conjuring, scratching the bodies of the players,
and going to water, was witnessed. A camera was utilized to secure
characteristic pictures of the players. Special attention was given to
the subject of Indian medicine, theoretic, ceremonial, and therapeutic.
The most noted doctors of the tribe were employed as informants, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 59

nearly five hundred specimens of medicinal and food plants were col-
lected and their Indian names and uses ascertained. The general result
of this investigation shows that the medical and botanical knowledge
of the Indians has been greatly overrated. A study was made of Cher-
oki personal names, about five hundred of which were translated,
being all the names of Indian origin now existing. The most impor-
tant results of Mr. Mooney’s investigation were the discovery of a large
number of manuscripts containing the sacred formule of the tribe,
written in Cheroki characters by the shamans for their own secret use,
and jealously guarded from the knowledge of all but the initiated. The
existence of such manuscripts had been discovered during a previous
visit in 1887, and a number had been procured. This discovery of gen-
uine aboriginal material, written in an Indian language by shamans for
their own use, is believed to be unique in the history of aboriginal
investigation, and was only made possible through the invention of the
Cheroki syllabary by Sequoia in 1821. Every effort was made by Mr.
Mooney to obtain all the manuscripts possible, with the result of secur-
ing nearly ali such material in the possession of the tribe. The whole
number of formule obtained is about six hundred. They consist of
prayers and sacred songs, explanations of ceremonies, directions for
medical treatment, and underlying theories. They relate to medicine,
love, war, hunting, fishing, seif-protection, witchcraft, agriculture, the
ball play, etc., thus forming a complete exposition of an aboriginal re-
ligion as set forth by its priests in the language of the tribe.

Early in October Mr. Jeremiah Curtin left Washington for the Pacific
Coast. During the remainder of the year he was occupied in Shasta
and Humboldt Counties, Cal., in collecting vocabularies and data con-
nected with the Indian system of medicine. This work was continued
in different parts of Humboldt and Siskiyou Counties until June 30,
1889. Large collections of linguistic and other data were gathered and
myths were secured, which show that the whole system of medicine of
these Indians and the ministration of remedies originated in and is
limited to sorcery practices.

The field of work of Mr. Albert 8. Gatschet during the year was of
limited duration. It had been ascertained that Mrs. Alice M. Oliver,
now in Lynn, Mass., formerly lived on Trespalacios Bay, Texas, near
the homes of the Karankawa, and Mr. Gatschet visited Lynn with a view
of securing as complete a vocabulary as possible of their extinet lan-
guage. Mrs. Oliver was able to recall about one hundred and sixty
terms of the language, together with some phrases and sentences. She
also furnished many valuable details regarding the ethnography of the
tribe. Ten days were spent in this work.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied in field work from August 1 to No-
vember 8, as follows: From the Ist of August to September 20 he was
on the Tuscarora Reserve, in Niagara County, in which locality fifty-
five legends and myths were collectkd. A Penobscot vocabulary was
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

also obtained here, together with other linguistic material. From Sep-
tember 20 to November 8 Mr. Hewitt visited the Grand River Reserve,
where a large amount of text was obtained, together with notes and
other linguistic material.

Dr. Franz Boas was employed from February to April in preparing
for convenient use a series of vocabularies of the several Salish divisions,
previously collected by him in British Columbia.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff left Washington on October 23 for St. John’s,
Ariz., where he examined the Hubbell collection of ancient pottery and
secured a series of photographs and colored drawings of the more im-
portant specimens. Thence he went to Zuni and obtained drawings of
interior details of dwellings and other data necessary for the comple-
tion of his studies of the architecture of this pueblo. He returned to
Washington December 7.

Mr. A. M. Stephen continued work among the Tusayan pueblos un-
der the direction of Mr. Victor Mindeleft. He added much to our
knowledge of the traditionary history of Tusayan, and has made an
extensive study of the house-lore and records of house-building cere-
monials. He furnished also a full nomenclature of Tusayan architect-
ural terms as applied to the various details of terraced house construc-
tion, with etymologies. He secured from the Navajo much useful in-
formation of the ceremonial connected with the construction of their
conical lodges, or ‘ hogans,” supplementing the more purely architect-
ural records of their construction previously collected by Mr. Minde-
leff. As opportunity occurred he gathered small, typical collections of
baskets and other textile fabrics illustrative of the successive stages of
their manufacture, including specimens of raw materials and detailed
descriptions of the dyes used. These collections are intended to include
also the principal patterns in use at the present time, with the native
explanations of their significance.

OFFICE WORK.

Director Powell has devoted much time during the year to tie final
preparation of the paper to accompany the map of the linguistic fami-
lies of North America north of Mexico, the scope of which has been
alluded to in previous years. The report and map are now practically
completed, and will appear in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau,
soon to go to press.

Mr. Henshaw was chiefly occupied with the administrative duties of
the office, which have been placed in his charge by the Director, and
with the completion of the linguistic map, which is now ready for the
engraver.

Col. Garrick Mallery, after his return from the field work elsewhere
mentioned, was engaged in the elaboration of the new information ob-
tained and in farther continued study of, and correspondence relating
to, sign language and pictography.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

Dr. W. J. Hoffman continued the arrangement and classification of
material embracing the subjects of pictography and gesture language
of the North American Indians, but more particularly of the date and
sketches secured by him during previous field seasons.

While Mr. J. Owen Dorsey did no field work during the year, he de-
voted much of the time to original investigations. Samuel Fremont,
an Omaha Indian, came to Washington in October, 1888, and until
February, 1889, assisted Mr. Dorsey in the revision of the entries for
the @egiha-English Dictionary. A similar work was undertaken by Lit-
tle Standing Buffalo, a Ponea Indian from the Indian Territory, in April
and May, 1889. The summary of Mr. Dorsey’s office work is as follows:
He completed the entries for the @egiha-English Dictionary, and a list
of Ponca, Omaha, and Winnebago personal names was made. He
translated from the Teton dialect of the Dakota all the material of the
Bushotter collection in the Bureau of Ethnology, and prepared there-
from a paper on Teton folk-lore. He also prepared a brief paper on
the camping circles of Siouan tribes, and in addition furnished an ar-
ticle on the modes of predication in the Athapascan dialects of Oregon
and in several dialects of the Siouan family. He also edited the man-
uscript of the Dakota grammar, texts, and ethnography, written by
the late Rev. Dr. 8S. R. Riggs. This will soon be published as Part 1,
Volume VII, Contributions to North American Ethnology. In May,
1889, he began an extensive paper on Indian personal names, based on
material obtained by himself in the field, to contain names of the fol-
lowing tribes: Omaha and Ponka, Kansa, Osage, Kwapa, Iowa, Oto
and Missouri, and Winnebago.

Mr. Atbert 8. Gatschet’s office work was almost entirely restricted to
the composition and completion of his Grammar of the Klamath Lan-
guage of Oregon, with the necessary appendices. The grammar and
dictionary are now printed and will soon be published. The ethnog-
raphy will follow.

During the year Mr. Jeremiah Curtin arranged and copied myths of
various Indian families, and also transcribed Wasco, Sahaptin, and
Yana vocabularies previously collected.

On his return from the Cheroki reservation in 1888, Mr. James
Mooney began at once to translate a number of the prayers and sacred
songs obtained from the shamans during his visit. The result of this
work will appear in a paper in the seventh annual report of the bureau
entitled ‘*Sacred formulas of the Cheroki.” Considerable time was
devoted also to the elaboration of the botanic and linguistic notes ob-
tained in the field. In the spring of 1889 he began the collection of
material for a monograph on the aborigines of the Middle Atlantic
slope, with special reference to the Powhatan tribes of Virginia. Asa
preliminary, about one thousand circulars, requesting information in
regard to local names, antiquities, and surviving Indians, were distrib-
uted throughout Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and northeastern Car-
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

olina. The information thus obtained affords an excellent basis for
future work in this direction.

From July 1 to August 1, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in ar-
ranging alphabetically the recorded words of the Tuscarora-English
dictionary mentioned in former reports, and in the study of adjective
word-forms to determine the variety and kind of the Tuscarora moods
and tenses. After his return from the field, Mr. Hewitt recorded
and tabulated ail the forms of the personal pronouns employed in the
Tuscarora language. Studies were also prosecuted to develop the
predicative function in the Tuscarora speech. All the terms of con-
sanguinity and affinity as now used among the Tuscarora were recorded
and tabulated. Literal translations of many myths collected in the
fields were made, and free translations added to four of them. In all
of these studies linguistic notes were made relating to etymology, pho-
nesis, and verbal change.
~ Mr. James C. Pilling has, as usual, given all the time he could spare
from his executive duties to the preparation of bibliographies of North
American languages. The Bibliography of the Iroquoian Languages
was completed early in the fiscal year and the edition was issued in
February last. In the mean time a Bibliography of the Muskhogean
Languages has been compiled, the manuscript of which was sent to the
printer January 8, 1889, the first proof received Febuary 9, and proof-
reading completed early in June. ‘The edition, however, was not de-
livered during the fiscal year. Early in March, 1889, Mr. Pilling made~
a trip to Philadelphia to inspect the linguistic material, particularly the
manuscripts, belonging to the American Philosophical Society. The
library authorities gave him every facility, and much new material was
secured. In June Mr. Pilling made a somewhat extended trip through
New England States and into Canada, visiting the Astor, Lenox, and
the Historical Society libraries in New York; the libraries of the Athe-
neum, Public, Massachusetts Historical Society, and the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, in Boston; that of Har-
vard University, in Cambridge ; the American Antiquarian Society, in
Worcester, and the private library of Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, in
Hartford. In Canada he visited the library of Laval University, and
the private library of Mr. P. Gagnon, in Quebec, of St. Mary’s College
and Jacques Cartier School, in Montreal, and various missions along
the St. Lawrence River, with a view of inspecting the manuscripts left
by the early missionaries. In addition to these he visited many smaller
institutions, private libraries, and publishing houses, and the result of
the whole trip was the accumulation of much new material for insertion
in the Algonquian bibliography. It is thought that the manuscript for
this publication will be in shape to send to the printer before the close
of the year 1889.

Mr. W. H. Holmes has continued to edit the illustrations for the Bu-
reau publications, and has besides engaged actively in his studies of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

aboriginal archeology. He has completed papers upon the pottery of
the Potomac Valley and upon the objects of shell collected by the Bureau
during the last eight years, and he has others in preparation. As cura-
tor of Bureau collections he makes the following statement of accessions
for the year: From Dr. Cyrus Thomas and his immediate assistants
working in the mound region of the Mississippi Valley and contiguous
portions of the Atlantic slope, the Bureau has received one hundred
and forty-six specimens, including articles of clay, stone, shell, and
bone. Mr. Victor Mindeleff obtained sixteen specimens of pottery from
the Pueblo country. Other collections by members of the Bureau and
of the Geological Survey are as follows: Shell beads and pendents
(modern) from San Buenaventura, Cal., by H. W. Henshaw. Fragments
of pottery and other articles from the vicinity of the Cheroki agency,
N. C., by James Mooney. A large grooved hammer from the bluff at
Three Forks, Mont., by Dr. A.C. Peale. <A large series of rude stone,
implements from ee District of Columbia, by DeLancey W. Gill.
Donations have been received as follows: An important series of earthen
vases from a mound on Perdido Bay, Ala., by F. H. Parsons. Ancient
pueblo vases from southwestern Colorado, by William M. Davidson.
A series of spurious earthen vessels, manufactured by unknown persons
in eastern Iowa, by C. C. Jones, of Augusta, Ga. Fragments of pot-
tery, ete., from Romney, W. Va., by G. H. Johnson. Fragments of a
steatite pot from Ledyard, Conn., by G. L. Fancher. A series of
stone tools, earthen vessels, etc., from a mound on Lake Apopka, Fla.,
by Thomas Featherstonhaugh. Fragments of gilded earthenware and
photographs of antiquities from Mexico, by F. Plancarte. Fragments
of gold ornaments from Costa Rica, by Anastasio Alfaro. Loans of im-
portant specimens have been received as follows: Articles of clay from
a mound on Perdido Bay, Ala., by Mrs. A. T. Mosman. Articles of
clay from the last mentioned locality, by A. B. Simons. Pottery from
the Potomac Valley, by W. Hallett Phillips, by 8. V. Proudfit, and by
H. L. Reynolds. Articles of gold and gold-copper alloy from Costa
Rica, by Anastasio Alfaro, secretary of the National Museum at San
José.

Prof. Cyrus Thomas was chiefly occupied during the year in the prepa-
ration of the second and third volumes of his reports upon the mounds.
It is probable that these will be finished during the present fiscal year.
He also prepared a bulletin on the Circular, Square, and Octagonal
Earth-works of Ohio, with a view of giving a summary of a recent sur-
vey by the mound division of the principal works of the above character
in southern Ohio. <A second bulletin was completed, entitled “The
Problem of the Ohio Mounds,” in which he presented evidence to show
that the ancient works of the State are due to Indians of several differ-
ent tribes, and that some, at least, of the typical works were built bv
the ancestors of the modern Cheroki.

Since his return from the field, Mr. H. L. Reynolds has been engaged
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in the preparation of a general map of the United States, showing the
area of the mounds and the relative frequency of their occurrence. He
has since assisted Professor Thomas in the preparation of the monograph
upon the inclosures.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff, assisted by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, has been
engaged in preparing for publication a “Study of Pueblo Architecture”
as illustrated in the provinces of Tusayan and Cibola, material for which
he has been engaged in collecting for a number of years. This report
is now completed, and will appear in the Seventh Annual Report of -
the Bureau.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff and the
force of the modelling room completed the bureau exhibit for the Cin-
cinnati Exposition, and during the early part of the year Mr. Mindeleff
was at Cincinnati in charge of the same. Owing to restricted space
the exhibit was limited to the Pueblo culture group, but this was illus-
trated as fully as the time would permit. The exhibit covered about
1,200 feet of floor space as well as a large amount of wall space, and
consisted of models of pueblo and cliff ruins; models of inhabited
pueblos, ancient and modern pottery, examples of weaving, basketry,
etc., a representative series of implements of war, the chase, agriculture,
and the household, manikins illustrating costumes, and a series of
large photographs illustrative of aboriginal architecture of the pueblo
region, and of many phases of pueblo life. Upon Mr. Mindeleff’s re-
turn from Cincinnati he resumed assistance to Mr. Victor Mindeleff
upon a report on pueblo architecture, and the close of the fiscal year
saw the two chapters which had been assigned him completed. They
consist of a review of the literature on the pueblo region and a sum-
mary of the traditions of the Tusayan group from material collected by
Mr. A. M. Stephen. Work was also continued on the duplicate series
of models, and twelve were advanced to various stages of completion.
Some time was devoted to repairing original models which had been
exhibited at Cincinnati and other expositions, and also to experiments
in casting in paper, in order to find a suitable paper for use in large
models. The experiments were successful.

Mr. J. K. Hillers has continued the collection of photographs of prom-
inent Indians, in both full-face and profile, by which method all the fa-
cial characteristics are exhibited to the best advantage. In nearly every
instance a record has been preserved of the sitter’s status in the tribe,
the age, biographic notes of interest, and in case of mixed bloods the
degree of intermixture of blood. The total number of photographs ob-
tained during the year is 27, distributed among the following tribes,
viz: Sae and Fox, 5; Dakota, 6; Omaha, 6, and mixed-bloods (Creeks),

NECROLOGY.
JEROME H. KIDDER.

Dr. Jerome H. Kidder was born in Baltimore County, Md., on the
26th of October, 1842, and graduated in 1862 at Harvard, where he
is Still remembered as foremost in the gymnasium as well as on his class-
rolls. He immediately then tendered his services for the war, and was
placed in charge of the sea island plantations near Beaufort, S. C.,
where he contracted yellow fever, and was invalided home early in
1863; but upon recovery enlisted in the Tenth Maryland Infantry, in
which he served as private and non-commissioned officer until the fol-
lowing year, when he was selected to be medical cadet, and in that ca-
pacity was employed in the military hospitals near the capital. During
this time he was prosecuting the study of medicine, and in 1866 re-
ceived from the University of Maryland the degree of M.D. In the
same year he was commissioned an assistant surgeon in the U.S. Navy,
becoming full surgeon in 1876.

Dr. Kidder’s first duty was at Japan, where he quickly acquired the
language of the country, and in other ways established the reputation
which attached to him throughout his career for his “capacity for takin’
pains.” While on this foreign service he was decorated by the King of
Portugal in recognition of services toa distressed vessel of His Majesty’s
navy.

Dr. Kidder took part in observing the transit of Venus at Kerguelen
Island, in 1874, as surgeon and naturalist of the expedition, and the ex-
cellent results of his scientific labors and researches therewith will be
found described in the Bulletins of the U.S. National Museum. After
the return of this expedition, Dr. Kidder arranged his specimens and
collections in the Smithsonian Institution, and commenced those kindly
and intimate relations with it which continued through his after life,
with the regard of all his associates there.

In 1878 Surgeon Kidder married, at Constantinople, Annie Mary,
daughter of the Hon. Horace Maynard, minister of the United States
to Turkey, and in 1884, having inherited an adequate fortune, he re-
signed his commission and established his home in Washington, and
here organized the bacteriological laboratory in connection with the
Navy Museum of Hygiene, and also made a sanitary survey of the site
proposed for the new Naval Observatory, while later he was appointed
chemist of the U. 8. Fish Commission, and in that capacity became one
of the most trusted advisers of Professor Baird. His laboratory was
in the Smithsonian building, and under the direction of the Secretary
of the Institution he made, at the request of Congress, an exhaustive
study of the ventilation of the Capitol and of the air in the Senate
chambers and the hallof the House, and submitted an extended report
or the use of the committees engaged upon the sanitary reform of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

building. In 1887, after the death of Commissioner Baird, he served for
a time as Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries, under Commissioner
Goode. While connected with the Fish Commission he carried on a
successful series of experiments to solve the problems relative to the
temperature of living fishes, which have been made public through the
reports of the Fish Commission. Besides the reports just referred to,
Dr. Kidder contributed valuable papers to various professional and
educational publications, and held for years a place on the literary staff
of the New York World, and maintained membership in many learned
societies. He was one of the founders of the Cosmos Club, and among
the organizers of the Harvard Club in Washington, and a prominent
member in the Masonic fraternity.

In 1888 Dr. Kidder accepted from the present Secretary the ap-
pointment of curator of laboratory and exchanges. His pleasant past
relations to the Institution, and the esteem in which he was held
by those connected with it, made the closer connection thus estab-
lished agreeable to all; and the writer can not speak in too warm
terms of the character of Dr. Kidder as shown in their business rela-
tions. His liberal education and views, served by the “capacity for
taking pains” already referred to, were all under the control of the
most conscientious regard for duty, and made him a valued administra-
tor of the department under his charge. He knew how to maintain, to-
gether with exact order, the kindliest relations with all employed in it,
who, it is safe to say, remember him with an affection and regard due
to his excellent personal qualities, an affection and regard which the
writer profoundly shares. Just in his best work, in his fullest physical
vigor, Dr. Kidder was stricken with pneumonia, and died after a brief
illness on the 8th of April, 1889.

His attachment to this Institution, which had always been of the
peculiarly intimate character, was also shown in a bequest of which I
shall elsewhere have to speak.

In conclusion, I can not but add to the statement of this great
deprivation to the Institution an expression of my sense of personal
loss in the parting with a friend who, in every relation of life, was
aman as honorable and worthy of trust as any I have ever known.

JAMES STEVENSON.

In recording the death of Mr. James Stevenson, which occurred on
the 25th of last July, I have to announce the loss of one of the most
valuable as well as one of the oldest and most active collaborators of
this Institution.

Mr. Stevenson was born in Maysville, Ky., in 1840, and while still
little more than a boy, in the spring of 1857, ascended the Missouri
River with the Warren Expedition; and from that time, with the ex-
ception of the interval caused by his acceptable services in the civil war,
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

he annually and regularly visited the Rocky Mountain region, first un-
der the auspices of the United States Exploring Expeditions of Warren
and Reynolds, and latterly under that of the U.S. Geological Survey,
of which he became the executive officer when that organization first
took form, a position in which he remained up to the time of his death.
His capacity and integrity were valued not only by the officials of the
Survey, which he did so much in connection with, but by those of this
Institution, for which during thirty years he gathered in remote regions
specimens of natural history, geology, and ethnology, which are per-
manent testimonials of his enterprise and his industry.

During the season of 1885 he was engaged in making an extended
search amoug the pueblos in the Moquis and Navajo districts of New
Mexico, and in this elevated country he was stricken by the dreaded
disease which lurks there. I met him in this region in 1887, when he
was already aroused, though too late, to a sense of his danger, and am
glad to recollect the circumstances of an acquaintance that associated
him with the regions of the West, in which so much of his life had been
passed, where so much valuable work was done, and where I had an
opportunity to learn something of his fertility of resource in emergency
and in the intimacy of camp life, of the amiable traits of his private
character.

Mr. Stevenson’s work was a double one, for he was equally at home
in cities, and especially in Washington, where he was extensively known
among members of Congress, and where the general confidence reposed
in him by them was a deserved tribute not merely to his skill but to
his personal integrity.

Respectfully submitted.
S. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR.
SMITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

A memoir presented by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, of Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology on the ‘‘ Genesis of the Arietide,” and recommended by Messrs. Alexander
Agassiz, Charles A. White, and William H. Dall, was accepted for publication in the
series of Contributions to Knowledge, in February last (1889). In order that the print-
ing of the memoir might be under the convenient revision of the author, the work was
placed in the hands of John Wilson & Son, of Cambridge, Mass. The printing of the
treatise is well advanced, and it will probably be completed and distributed during
the present year. It will form a volume of about 230 quarto pages, illustrated by 35
figures and 14 plates.

Two other publications of the year in the quarto size should be mentioned here, al-
though not intended to be included in the collected volumes of the Contributions.
No. 671 of the Smithsonian list is ‘‘ Natural History Illustrations prepared under the
direction of Louis Agassiz, 1849. The Anatomy of Astrangia Danae. Six litho-
graphs from drawings by A. Sonrel. Explanation of the plates by J. Walter
Fewkes.” This issue represents merely a fragment of a memoir undertaken forty
years ago by the eminent naturalist, Louis Agassiz, on material collected by him
during his first dredging excursion in one of the steamers of the U. S. Coast Survey.
This memoir, postponed by other occupations, was never completed, and even the
original notes are no longer to be found. But the excellence of the drawings made
under his direction from living specimens seems to warrant their publication, even
at this late day. The text descriptive of the six plates, by Mr. Fewkes, oecupies 20
quarto pages.

672. ‘‘ Natural History Illustrations prepared under the direction of Louis Agassiz
and Spencer I. Baird, 1849. Six lithographs from drawings by A. Sonrel. Expla-
nation of the plates by David Starr Jordan.” This, like the preceding, represents
merely a fragment of a memoir projected by the joint labors of the two distinguished
ichthyologists, and in like manner laid aside under the pressure of more immediate
duties. The text explanatory of the six plates is comprised in 12 quarto pages.
Were these two brochures more recent and more extended they would well deserve a
place in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.

SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

Taking the various publications for the past year belonging to this series in the
order in which they stand in the Smithsonian list, the first is:

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES FOR THE
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889.

WASHINGTON, D. C., November 20, 1889.

Sir: [ have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the ex-
change bureau for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889. During the greater part of
this time the bureau was under the charge of the late Dr. Jerome H. Kidder, whose
able administration has contributed largely to its present efficiency. At the date of
his death, April 6, 1889, Mr. Boehmer, upon whom the care of the office immediately
devolved, reported that the exchange department, for the first time in its history, had
disposed of all packages received, and was prepared to close its book accounts.

In continuation of the statistics usually presented, the following table exhibits in
detail the exchange transactions for each month of the fiscal year:

The small increase in the number of packages (859) received during 1838~’89 as
compared with the preceding fiscal years, though offset by the large increase in weight
(30,298 pounds), isaccounted for by the fact that a number of regular shipments from
Government bureaus were delayed beyond the close of the fiscal year.

EXPENSE.

From an examination of the books of the disbursing officer it appears that the
actual cost of the exchange service for the year has been $17,152.10, divided as fol-
lows:

of the Smithsonian Institution,” $1,363.54* were repaid to the Institution by Govern-
meut Departments to which specitic appropriations had been granted for this pur-
pose, leaving a deficit of $788.56, which was paid from the Smithsonian fund.

Although all of the Government bureaus that have occasion to transmit their
publications through the Institution are not provided with funds available for de-
fraying the cost of the service, it seems to have been the intention of Congress that
its specific appropriation for the exchange business should be supplemented by special
appropriations to some of the bureaus and departments of the Government, so that
the charge of 5 cents per pound weight imposed by the regents in 1878 might be met
by them, The average amount annually repaid to the Institution in this way during
the past eleven years has been about $1,400.

Dr. Kidder strongly recommended, and I beg to renew his recommendation, that
this procedure, for which sufficient reasons existed at the time of its adoptién, may
now be discontinued as no longer advantageous or economical. By the present
system the cost of the service is actually larger than appears in the specific appro-
priations for exchanges, ae as the special appropriations to the different Depart-
ments vary from year to year and are often omitted altogether, a burden which can
not be accurately ieee, is imposed upon the Smithsonian fund.

In order to effect the change contemplated—that is, to collect in a single item the
entire appropriation for international exchanges, and at the same time to make
allowance for a proper compensation to the ocean steam-ship companies for freight,
and to bring the schedule of salaries more nearly up to the standard established for
. the classified service of the Government—an estimate of $27,500 was submitted for
the fiscal year 1889-’90.

This sum would then have been divided somewhat as follows:

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, ETC.

The convention between the United States of America, Belgium, Brazil, Italy,
Portugal, Servia, Spain, and Switzerland for the international exchange of official
documents and scientific and literary publications, as well as the convention between
the same countries (excepting Switzerland), for the ‘‘ immediate exchange of the offi-
cial journals, parliamentary annals and documents,” was ratified by the President of
the United States on July 19, 1888, but final ratifications were not exchanged by the
representatives of the contracting powers until January 14, 1889. The convention
was proclaimed on January 25, the day following, and since that date formal notifi-
cation has been received of the adhesion to both conventions of the Government of
Uruguay. The full text of these conventions was given in the Curator’s report for
last year.

The adhesion of the United States to the first of these conventions involves no new
departure in the exchange service from the methods of previous years; but for the
fulfillment of the obligations incurred by the second convention—the immediate ex-
change of official journals—an appropriation of about $2,000 to cover the necessary
postage and additional clerical assistance is required, and provision should be made
for the prompt delivery to the exchange office of the documents referred to.

This sum of $2,000 was estimated in reply to an inquiry made by the Secretary of
State, dated February 12, 1889, as to the ability of the Smithsonian Institution to
execute all of the provisious of the two conventions without further legislation by
Congress, and the estimate was duly submitted by the Secretary of State in a letter
to the President of the Senate, but no appropriation was made.

While the United States is thus bound by formal agreement to an exchange of its
official publications with but eight countries, a full set of all publications received
from the Government Printer is transmitted to forty-one countries upon the basis of
mutual agreement.

A complete list of the official depositories for publications sent abroad during the
fiscal year, in accordance with the act of Congress of July 25, 1868, with a statement
of the number of packages sent and received from each of the countries repre-
sented, is contained in the annexed table:

78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The utter inadequacy of the return received by the United States, 6,442 volumes and
pamphlets for 22,673 sent out, is but a repetition of the experience of previous years,
and hax been dwelt upon at length in former reports. The Austrian Government
forms a notable exception to the general apathy of foreign nations in the matter,
having transmitted 4,426 volumes, including complete and very valuable sets of Par-
limentary Proceedings; and itishoped that negotiations now in progress will resalt, in
the near future, in a more equitable and satisfactory exchange with other uations,
more especially with England and Germany.

If a complete account of all ‘‘ governmental” exchange business carried by the
Smithsonian Institution is made, that is, if all publications sent or received by the
Government and its bureaus are included, it appears that 9,325 packages were re-
ceived and forwarded to United States Government Departments, including the
Library of Congress, while 25,671 weresent abroad through the exchange service froin
the same Departments. The apportionment among the different countries is shown
below:

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

While a marked improvement appears to have taken place in the exchange serv-
ice during the past few years, still further improvements are no doubt desirable and
possible. The plan adopted by Dr. Kidder of following up promptly and diligently
all complaints, or failures of packages to reach their destinations, has produced ex-
cellent results. The delays due to the fact that the Smithsonian Institution is de-
pendent upon the generosity and public spirit of most of the ocean steam-ship lines
fot the free transportation of its exchange boxes will be provided against, if the ap-
propriation asked for is granted by Congress. The delays which occur in some of
the foreign bureaus, due to indifference or to insufficieut clerical force, are at pres-
ent beyond the control of the Institution. Where regularly paid agencies have been
established, as in London and Leipzig, this cause of embarrassment to the service no
longer exists, and all packages are transmitted with promptness.

Still another difficulty arises from an inadequate or erroneous address upon the
packages, rendering it necessary for the agent to hold them until the error or omis-
sion can be corrected by correspondence. Increased attention to this point on the
part of those who have occasion to send publications through the exchange service
will assist materially in decreasing the number of delayed transmissions,

An important need of the exchange bureau is a more complete index to the early
records, but with the present clerical force this additional work can not be effect-
ually undertaken.

I take pleasure in bearing witness to the faithfulness and efficiency of the em-
ployés of the bureau, and to the prompt attention to the interests of the Institution
of its foreign agents, Messrs. William Wesley & Son, at London, and ‘Dr. Felix Flii-
gel, at Leipzig.

The employés of the bureau receive much lower salaries than those established for
similar grades of work by the classified lists of the Government Departments, and
it is manifestly to the interest of the service to be able to retain, by reasonable ex-
pectation of promotion, men who have acquired pecuiiar and valuable experience
in the exchange transactions.

Grateful acknowledgments are due the following transportation companies and
firms for their continued liberality in granting free freight on exchange parcels and
boxes:

Allan Steam-ship Company (A. Schumacher & Co., agents), Baltimore.
Anchor Steam-ship Line (Henderson & Brother, agents), New York.

ADVERTISEMENT.

; °

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; occasional reports of the investigations
made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general charac-
ter or on special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the
purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly
to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers not published in
the “ Smithsonian Contributions” or in the ‘“* Miscellaneous Collections”
as may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous corre-
spondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from avery early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law, with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part ofits history, been
carried out largely by the publication ot such papers as would possess
an interest to all attracted by scientific progress, so that the appendices
of the annual reports, during the years down to 1880, have been almost
wholly so occupied. ; .

In 1880, the Secretary , induced in part by the discontinuation of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi-
nent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor-
ology, physies, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and anthropol-
ogy. Other subjects which might properly have been ineluded, such as
those of terrestrial physics, hydrography, microscopy, ete., as well as
the more practical topics of generai technology, were omitted, both for
want of time and want of space, so that from the outset the impractica-
bility of a review of the whole field was recognized.

It has already been mentioned in the annual report for 1888 that these
latter provisions seemed justified by further experience until in 1886,
the incompleteness of the special record, the disecouragements from the
increasing delays encountered in the printing of these summaries, the
recent multiplication by private enterprise of special books and periodi-

87
88 ADVERTISEMENT.

cals devoted to critical summaries, and other considerations, induced a
temporary suspension of the project; while it was added that with every
effort to secure prompt attention to the more important details of the
survey of the annual progress of scientific discovery, experience has
shown that it is impracticable to obtain all the desired reports in each
department within the time prescribed, that the plan attempted of
bringing up the deficiencies in subsequent reports has not proved en-
tirely satisfactory, and that in view of these delays, of the ever-increas-
ing range of complexity of the subjects to be treated, and of other con-
siderations, it is probable that it may be thought advisable to revert to
the accustomed, and, it is believed, more widely acceptable plan of pub-
lishing yearly papers selected with a principal view to their general
scientific interest, rather than to attempt the continuation of summaries
chiefly of importance to the professional student.

The earlier established plan of the annual reports is followed in this
volume, though not to the exclusion of such summaries as may be con-
nected with the recognized fields of labor of the Institution.

I.—THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
(Physico-Mathematical Class.)

The Royal Academy of Sciences was established in 1701 by King
Frederick I, upon the solicitation of Leibnitz and received the name
“Royal Society of Sciences ;” the word Academy was substituted in
1744 on occasion of the reorganization of the society under Frederick
the Great. The statutes, approved by royal decree of March 28, 1881,
explain the object and composition of the society as follows: ;

The Academy of Sciences is a society of scientists whose object it is to
promote science without being required to adhere to any plan of instrue-
tion. It comprises four classes of members, but in a more limited sense
it is formed by the whole body of regular members, who, under the
direction of the secretaries attend to the affairs of the entire academy.

The Academy possesses the rights of a privileged corporation, has its
own Seal, owns its premises, has its own funds and aregular, guaranteed
income which it dispenses according to the adopted rules.

For the conduct of some of its affairs the Academy has formed two
sections: the physico-mathematical and the philosophical-historical
class. (Formerly four classes existed, but since 1830 they became
united into two.)

Each section manages its own affairs. No difference of importance
exists as regards the two sections.

The membership is formed of: (1) regular members, (2) foreign mem-
bers, (3) honorary members, (4) corresponding members. ‘The honorary
members are not assigned to any special sections; all other members
are assigned to the respective sections and can belong only to that
section.

The seniority of ordinary and foreign members is regulated by the
time of their election.

90 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

To ordinary membership only such persons are eligible as are residents
of Berlin or live in places the connection of which with the national
capital permits them to take part in their regular academic duties.
Any such member removing to a place not provided for in the above is
transferred to the number of honorary members.

Each class may have twenty-seven regular members. A number of
these places is intended for certain specified branches of science; for
the remaining places all scientists whose activity lies within that speci-
fied section may become eligible.

Vacancies among specialists may be left open, yet, the advantage of
the academy requires all possible competition. In that case the class has
to decide whether any of its members may be selected for the purpose.
Applications for these places can emanate only from regular members.

A proposed class election is to be communicated to the presiding sec-
retary of the academy and then considered by the entire academy at its
next regular session when the candidate is elected by ballot.

The result of the election is to be communicated to the minister who
obtains the king’s approval.

If ascientist, non-resident of Berlin or of any of the places allowed
for, receives the election of regular member he is required to remove to
Berlin within six months of the date of his confirmation—which time
may be increased in special cases. If he fails to comply with this rule
he is enrolled among the honorary members.

The regular members are both permitted and required to share the
labors of the Academy ; they have a seat and a vote both in the general
Academy and in the class, and are permitted to attend the meetings of
either of the classes.

A member of twenty-five years standing or having reached the age
of seventy may be relieved from lecturing or speaking.

The regular members are entitled to all privileges of the royal insti-
tutions and collections. They are furthermore privileged to lecture at
any university of the Prussian domain and enjoy equal rights with the
professors in accordance with regulations to which they are also bound
with regard to the lectures.

With regard to salaries the following regulations are in force:

(1) Each of the fifty-four regular members of the Academy receive an
annual salary of 900 mark ($225.).

(2) Separate salaries, additional to the above 900 mark are given to
two regular members of the physico-mathematical class, of which one
has to be a botanist and the other a chemist, and to two regular mem-
bers of the philosophic-historical class, who are required to be phi-
lologists or historians. The salary of the chemist also includes the
official dwelling in the buiiding of the academy and the use, for scientific
purposes, of any available room in the building not otherwise occupied.
The payment of such a salary is made for special services required in
the conduct of a certain office or professorship, or in the direction of a
scientific institute.

(3) A special salary for special duties may be given by vote of the
academy for such a time as may be required in the performance of
special duties. The pensioning of the salaried officials is optional.

(4) The two salaries may be granted at once at the time of election,
provided the proposition is made at the time of election of the candi-
date. This requires the sanction of the minister.

(5) The widow or, in her absence, the children of a deceased member
continue to draw the salary of their husband or father for the term of
one year, commencing with the day of his death.

Foreign (or non-resident) members are such as do not reside at Berlin
or at one of the places provided for in the statutes. Of these each class
has ten. The Academy is not required to fill vacancies in this number.
The non-resident members enjoy all the rights of the regular members,
and in case of any visit to Berlin, and upon notification of the fact to
the general secretary, they receive invitations to the meeting, ete., the
same as the regular members.

Honorary membership may be extended to such resident scientists
as are prevented from fulfilling the obligations of regular membership ;
it may further be extended to non-resident and foreign scientists who
have excelled in scientific pursuits and insome way have given evidence
of their interest in the welfare of the Academy. There is no limit to
the number of honorary members.

The honorary members are entitled to participate in the meetings of
the Academy of which they are, in each case, informed by invitation.
They are at liberty to make scientific communications and to take part
in the deliberations of business affairs.

The corresponding members are composed of scientists, non-residents
of Berlin. They retain the corresponding membership in the event of
their locating at Berlin. Each class offers one hundred places for eor-
responding members.

The corresponding members are entitled to take part in the publie
and other meetings of the Academy and of the class to which they, re-
spectively, have been assigned and to make scientific communications.
They are also permitted to be present at business meetings, but have
no vote in the same.

The business of the Academy is conducted by four permanent secre-
taries, of which each class furnishes two.

The secretaries are elected for life and draw a salary of 1,800 mark
annually, which amount is also paid to the surviving widow or orphans
for the period of one year succeeding the death of the incumbent.

The secretaries range according to the seniority of their election.

Each of the secretaries carries a seal.

Hach of the two classes elect their secretaries out of their own mem-
bers and in secret session. The election has to receive the King’s sane-
tion.
92 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

It is the duty of the secretaries to conduct the business of the Acad-
emy and to execute its orders. The manner of arranging the duties
among their number is left to their discretion.

In the presidency and the duties of that office and in the conduct of
the affairs of the general Academy, the secretaries change successively
every four monthsin accordance with their seniority, unless they arrange
among themselves for some other method of succession. In case of en-
forced absence of the presiding secretary the last secretary has to take
his place. All four secretaries being unavoidably detained from pre-
siding, the senior of the ordinary members assumes the office.

The business secretary is styled the presiding secretary; he carries
the great seal of the Academy and supervises the officials and clerks of
the Academy. He calls the extraordinary meetings of the members
and the meetings of the secretaries; he issues the invitations and pre-
sides at all meetings; in case of a tie his vote is decisive; he signs the
protocols and arranges for the execution of the various resolutions. He
has charge of the correspondence of the Academy, opens all communica-
tions, submits them and then takes charge of further action. He is re-
sponsible for the observance of the statutes, and for that purpose com-
municates directly with the minister. In submitting his charge of four
months he has to surrender to his successor a complete inventory made
in the presence of the archivist.

The presiding secretary, or his substitute, is the only person per-
mitted to institute legal proceedings in the name of the Academy, for
which purpose he may receive special identification on the part of the
ministry. Money may be paid to the cashier of the ministry.

Within the classes of the Academy the respective secretaries assume
the presidency and the execution of all business affairs for the term of
from four to four months.

The regular salaried officials of the Academy—at present an archivist,
one clerk, one door-keeper and one messenger—are appointed for life or
any specified term in general session and by recommendation of the col-
lege of secretaries. The appointments have to receive the approval of
the ministry.

The following rules are in force regarding meetings, labors, and pub-
lications :

The members participate in the meetings according to the rights of
their respective grade. Others, not members, may be permitted to at-
tend the scientific meetings ; they have to be recommended by a mem-
ber and introduced to the presiding secretary.

The meetings of the Academy are held every Thursday and alternate
with those of the entire Academy and by those of the classes.

At each regular meeting a scientific paper is to be read by one of the
regular members, at the expiration of which other members are permitted
to make scientific communications or in any way to introduce scientific
objects.

The general Academy is empowered to submit questions to the secre-

ae sone
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 93

tary of the respective classes for action or report; or a special commis-
sion or commissioner may be appointed for report on some scientific or
business question ; the appointment of such commission is made by or-
dinary election, or, if required, by secret ballot.

The general Academy holds three public meetings annually ; the one
on July 1 in memory of Leibnitz, its first president, a second one on
January 24in commemoration of the birth of Frederick LI, the re-organ-
izer of the Academy, and the third on the birth-day of the reigning King.
If these days do not fall upon Thursday, the succeeding Thursday is set
aside for such public meeting.

The secretaries alternate in the conduct of the presidency on these
special occasions, and the presiding officer is required either to make
mention of the occasion by a few introductory remarks or to read a
special paper on the subject.

In the meetings held in memory of Leibnitz, regular members, elected
during the year, make their first speech or deliver their first lecture,
each being responded to by one of the secretaries. Hulogies of de-
ceased members are read during the course of the meeting. The busi-
ness of the public meeting consists of the announcement of prizes, the
reading of annual reports on the changes in the personnel, and of other
papers explanatory to the works and results of the scientific enterprises
or foundations connected with the Academy. Papers read in regular
Session may, upon consent of the Academy, be read again in these pub-
lic meetings.

In accordance with the intention of its foundation, it is the duty of
the Academy to render assistance to the scientific enterprises of its
members or scientists generally which require combined activity of sev-
eral scientists, or which, on account of their compass or expense, would
require the assistance of the Academy. A further duty of the Academy
requires it to manage foundations of a strict scientific character, and to
encourage or reward, by the giving of prizes, investigations, or researches
in certain defined directions.

The Academy publishes “ Sitzungsberichte” and ‘ Denkschriften,”
the editing of which devolves upon the college of secretaries, subject
to regulations adopted by the entire Academy. The members receive
copies, beginning with the year of their admission.

Explicit permission of the Academy or one of its classes is absolutely
required for the publication in the academic proceedings of any scien-
tific paper. The request for publication must be accompanied by the
ready manuscript, and the proposition may be voted on at once. Ifthe
expense or any other important point should require a further consid-
eration a commission may be appointed for the purpose, or the subject
may be referred to the board of secretaries or to one of the classes of
the Academy.

Upon the request of one of the members present the acceptance for
publication of any paper or any proceeding connected therewith may
be voted on by secret ballot.

The regular annual revenues of the Academy consist of (1) The income
from its own endowments; (2) dotation of 62,229 mark ($15,587) given
as an annual revenue in place of the endowment of King Frederick
William I{I (Royal decree of August 16, 1809); (3) assistance by the
government; (4) its own profits.

The expenditures are: (1) Payment of salaries and remunerations ;
(2) prizes, publications of the Academy, care and increase of the library,
all rendered domestic expenses required, including heating, lighting,
and repairs; (3) for scientific purposes. With regard to these all pos-
sible equality should be secured for each of the two classes.

Any surplus may be added to the income for the coming year or added

The funds available during the years 1886-’87 amounted to 208,982 |
mark ($52,245.)

The scientific proportion was 194,695 mark ($48,674), of which the
following disbursements were made: (1) Salaries, 111,600 mark
($27,900); (2) real expenses, 83,095 mark ($20,774,) as follows: (a) Publi-
cation of Abhandlungen und Sitzungsbericihte, 22,800 mark ($5,950),

academic prize of 5,000 mark ($1,250), and in intervals of twelve,

twelve, and two years, respectively, the prizes of 2,000 mark ($500) on

account of the Eller legacy, 2,000 mark ($500) on account of the Co-

thenius legacy, and 1,800 mark ($450) on account of the Steiner legacy.

The physico-mathematical class has the benefit of the interest re-

sulting from the ‘‘ Humboldt Stiftung fiir Naturforschung und Reisen.”

This endowment, founded by collections after the death of Alexander von

Humboldt, received the royal sanction by decree of December 19, 1860;

its management rests in the hands of a special curatorship, and is in-

tended to assist prominent talent of all nations in the direction pursued

by Alexander von Humboldt himself and to give pecuniary assistance to

workers on natural sciences and in the execution of expeditions,

The following enterprises have been assisted thus far from the inter-

est of the capital to the amounts specified in each case :

Journey of Dr, Reinhold Hensel to the La Plata regions for the purpose of collecting
fossil remains (1863-1865, and publication in 1867), 30,657 mark ($7,664).

Expedition of Dr. Georg Schweimfurth for the botanical exploration of the south-
western Nile regions (1868-1871), 33,600 mark ($8,400).

Il.—THE ROYAL FREDERICK WILLIAM’S UNIVERSITY.

The document establishing the University was executed by King
Frederick William III, at Konigsberg, in Prussia, on the 16th of Au-
gust, 1809.

By the treaty of Tilsit, on July 9, 1807, Prussia had been deprived of
a considerable portion of its domain and the territory of the King
restricted to about 5,000,000 inhabitants.

By a short but impressive proclamation of July 24, 1807, the King
relieved his subjects beyond the river Elbe from fealty. In that procla-
mation he says: “ Inhabitants of those beloved and trusted provinces,
realms, and towns, you are well acquainted with my views and with the
events of the last year. My army was. conquered and peace had to
96 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

be concluded under the best possible conditions. The tie of 1ove and
confidence of centuries is to be severed. Fate decided, and the father
separates himself from his children, but no fate, no power may extin-
guish your memory in my heart.” Strong and sincere, too, was the love
of the inhabitants of those surrendered provinces for their king. Deep
was the sorrow in Halle and among the members of the university
which Napoleon had dissolved on the 20th of October, 1806. A deputa-
tion, consisting of Schmalz and Froriep was sent to Memel, and in their
name and that of their colleagues requested the King, in a petition of
August 22, 1307, to consider the establishment of a scientific institution
at Berlin. Hufeland, present in Memel, supported the wishes of the
delegation.

On September 4, 1807, the King issued an order to Privy Councillor
Beyme to the effect that, in view of the loss by the state of the Uni-
versity of Halle owing to the surrender of the domain west of the
river Elbe, one of the most important and perfect educational establish-
ments had ceased to exist and that it should be one of the first duties
of the government, in the consideration of a reorganization of the state,
to provide for the erection of some such establishment in the best pos-
sible manner; that the universities at Frankfort and Konigsberg were
not adapted to compensate for the loss, the former on account of the
insufficiency of local auxiliary means and the latter on account of its
great distance from the national capital; that Berlin, however, com-
bined all the means adapted for such an educationalestablishment with
the least possible expense and with the greatest possible advantage
for its usefulness. In view of these facts the establishment at Berlin of
such an institution in connection with the existing Academy of Sciences
was decided upon. All the funds which had formerly been devoted to
the support of the university at Halle were to be employed for the pur-
pose, and Privy Councillor Beyme was instructed to secure for the
new university the services of the prominent professors of Halle before
other chances were offered to and accepted by them.

Frederick the Great, in his endeavors to re-model and re-organize the
state, was not in position to do much towards universities ; he was sat-
isfied with having restored the proper rank to the highest representative
of science, and only occasionally he alluded to the need of high schools.
On April 7, 1784, he wrote to Frankfort that “the students should re-
ceive such instructions as to enable each of them to learn something
useful so as to be enabled to render efficient service to state or church,
since he thought more of this than of any formalities.” All other care
he left to his minister, von Zedlitz, who himself had become a pupil of
the great Kant. The two universities, Kénigsberg and Halle, received
prompt attention; Forster and Wolff had been appointed, and the neces-
sity of a fixed plan of instruction had repeatedly been pointed out. This
being most noticeable in the study of law, a regular schedule was pre-
pared in 1771. In 1787 the higher educational council teok the place

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. on

of the board of curators of universities. The “General Laws for the
Royal Prussian Universities, February 23, 1796,” provide that applica-
tions for public positions can be entertained only of persons who have
graduated from the university.

On January 8, 1805, Minister von Massow submitted his report on a
suitable arrangement of the universities, in the preface of which he
says: “Ithas long been a recognized fact that the universities, considered
as establishments of education or at least of instruction, should be im-
proved and arranged in a way conforming to their principal object. In
order to realize such project and to remedy the abnormal conditions,
remnants of gray antiquity, two principal obstacles have to be over-
come, namely, the dominant character of the scientific man in his one-
sidedness (partiality), and the want of funds ; the improvement of their
own financial condition will have to be the means to overcome their
obstinacy.”

A number of reformatory orders were issued during the following
years: A royal order of April 7, 1804, fixed the academic term at three
years. This was made public by circular letter of October 12, 1804, of
the minister of justice, who adds that the candidates for promotion
could be examined only upon proof of their having completed the pre-
scribed course of studies. A further order of November 27, imposes
that condition on all aliens or foreigners, who were applicants for pos-
itions requiring academic education.

The want of sufficient means too was a source of great complications.
The amounts which, at the time of the establishment of the universities,
had been ample, now barely covered the most urgent necessaries; the
budgets were insufficient to permit even an approach towards securing
the requirements demanded by progressing science. Since the equip-
ment of Halle the grants, by the State, to all universities had been but
very small, Frederick William II, during the eleven years of his reign,
having been able to spare but 12,270 thaler ($10,200,) for the combined
needs of all the universities, and their number having increased to nine
in 1802 the vital question of their existence demanded an early settle
ment.

A commission appointed for the purpose, decided on the abolishment
of a portion of the antiquated establishments. Frankfort’s income was
increased from 12,846 to 15,314 thaler ($9,635 to $11,485); Erlangen
from 30,000 to 57,768 florins ($12,857 to $24,757); Halle from 18,116 to
36,113 thaler ($13,587 to $27,085). Means of instruction were provided
and collections purchased for Frankfort and K6énigsberg. Halle was
enriched by the appointment of professors of repute, and the salaries
were increased by allowances from the royal treasury. In 1805 the
number of students had increased at Frankfort to 307, Konigsberg to
300, and at Halle to 944.

The surrender required by the treaty of Tilsit of the Halle University,
notwithstanding the oppressed condition of the State, demanded im-

mediate action with regard to the establishment of a new university
which could then be commenced in conformity with the experiences
gained by the long-continued inquiries into an improved orgauization.

Although it can not beestablished by documentary evidence, it is suf-
ficiently well known that long before the unfortunate events of 1806
the cabinet of Frederick William III had already considered the ad-
visability of founding a university at Berlin. Privy Councilor Beyme
therefore was well informed on the subject when in 1807 he was re-
quested to formulate plans for the establishment and organization of
a university at the capital of the Kingdom. It may even be positively
asserted that it was Beyme himself with whom the project originated.

He was deeply interested in universities; he was an adherent and
friend of Fichte; he had induced the King to grant him asylum at Ber-
lin; he was instrumental in having him appointed at Erlangen, and was
responsible for the appointments of Schleiermacher and Steffens to Halle

Ata large number of scientific institutions, established at an earlier
day—the Academy, the Military Academy for Officers, the Artillery
and Engineers’ School, the Military Cadet Establishment, the Mining
School, etc.—scientifically educated teachers were employed. The
science of medicine was the best provided for., The ‘ Collegium medico-
chirurgicum” represented a medical faculty for the education of young
army physicians. In 1806 the staff of that establishment was formed
by twenty professors (eighteen regular and two assistant).

Since Frederick’s time lectures were held on other scientific subjects
for purposes of practical instructions ; thus, on law and legal proceed-
ings in the department of justice, and in forestry and technology by the
general directory. TheAcademy of Arts instituted courses of lectures
for the development of the artistic taste. There were high schools con-
ducted by teachers of repute, some of them members of the Academy.
Since however an intermediate step was wanting between the two,
greater demands were made on both teachers and pupils which elevated
them almost to the dignity of an university. There were further, the
library, the botanical garden, the observatory, the natural history col-
lection of the academy, the collections of the mining and smelting de-
partment, the anatomical theater, the collection of physical, astronom-
ical, and chirurgical apparatus, the royal and the academic coin collec-
tions and the picture gallery in the royal castle.

Since the beginning of the reign of Frederick William ITI additions had
been made to the number of the existing older establishments. In 1798
the Eschke Institute for Geaf-mutes was enlarged from means furnished
by the royal treasury; in 1799 the Academy for Architects was founded
and the military establishment enlarged; in 1805 attempts were made for
the improvement of military education, and lectures were instituted for
artisans. In 1804 the academy for young officers was founded, in 1805
the statistical bureau, and in 1806 the Institute for the Blind and the
Agricultural Institute. All branches of knowledge were eared for,

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 39

Soon after Fichte’s appointment Jena furnished a second cclebrated
teacher. In 1800 Hufeland was appointed professor and director of
the “Collegium medico-chirurgicum.” The academy elected him to
membership; the medical affairs were intrusted to him, and in his posi-
tion as physician to the King opportunities were not wanting which
enabled him to render decisions on scientific questions.

For the improvement in agricultural knowledge Thaer was called in
1804, and he at once prepared for the establishment of his ‘‘ Agricult-
ural Institute.”

Alexander von Humboldt, upon the return from his expedition around
the world, on September 3, 1804, declared his intentions to enter the
services of the state. It was about this time that Beyme expected to
organize the new establishment. The programme of Gottingen—or
rather thespirit of the programme freed from all abuses,—a general scien-
tific educational establishment, was his plan for the Berlin University.

Owing to the threatening conditions, however, the project was not
consummated. Soon crushing blows demoralized the state ; on October
27, 1806, Napoleon entered the city of Frederick the Great. .

After the treaty of Tilsit, when the King and his council prepared the
organization of the great reform, the plan for the new university formed
one of the points under consideration and this gave rise to a multitude
of opinions, objections, and deliberations.

During all these deliberations the patriotism and the scientific zeal
of the professors who had already received their commissions, had been
demonsrated ; they had entered on their course of lectures. The Uni-
versity existed, although not by official recognition. It was formed
by the four professors: Schleiermacher, Schmalz, Fichte, and Wolf,
each of whom represented a faculty.

On December 3, 1808,the French evacuated Berlin. Among the changes
which took place in the national administration was the appointment of
Wilhelm von Humboldt to take charge of the public instruction.

In April, 1809, Humboldt left for K6nigsberg in order to personally
urge before the King a final determination. A building became neces-
sary, both in order to enable the professors to appear as public teachers
and to secure an appreciation of the scheme by the inhabitants. The
palace of Prince Henry had been repeatedly suggested for the purpose.
Frederick the Great had constructed it during the years 1754-1764, and
by death it had reverted to the crown. Trederick William III gave
favorable consideration to Humboldt’s wishes and donated the palace
“for all time to come.”

Greater difficulties appear to have presented themselves in obtaining
security for the required means. Hufeland in 1807 already had shown
the desirability of endowment by real estate; Humboldt shared his
views and endeavored to gain the annual means by obtaining donation
in the form of private domain belonging to the crown. In his memorial
on the subject, of July 24, 1809, Humboldt says: “It may appear
100 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

strange that the section of public instruction at the present moment of
time ventures to advocate a plan, the execution of whith would lead
one to the supposition of quieter and happier days.” He continues by
saying that only such high educational establishments as the Berlin
University is intended to be, can exert an external influence, and that
by such a foundation the King would be instrumental in combining with
him firmly everyone throughout Germany interested in education and
enlightenment; he would instill new zeal for the rejuvenation of his
realm and offer to German science a never-hoped-for asylum at a time
when part of Germany had been destroyed by war and another part
was governed over by a stranger. Thus the patriotic ideal became
prominent in the plan for the foundation of the new university.

Wilhelm von Humboldt finally recommended formally its foundation
at Berlin, to bear the time-honored name of University, since the nature
of things requires a division of scientific institutes into schools, univer-
sities, and academies. He asked in the name of the University for a
fund of 60,000 thaler, ($45,000, ) and for the two academies—the Academy
of Sciences and the Academy of Arts—a fund of 4,000 thaler ($3,000)
additional to their present means.

By order of August 16, 1809, the King proclaimed that he considered
the plan for higher education within and without the limits of the realm
of such importance as to prohibit any further delay in the foundation
of a University at Berlin which should be endowed with the privilege
to confer academic honors.

An annual amount of 150,000 thaler ($112,500,) was granted to all the
scientific establishments at Berlin, and the palace of the late Prince
Henry deeded under the name of the “‘ University building.”

At the time of financial trouble the establishment of a new univer-
sity presented a grave economic problem. The King however did not
withhold his private fortune to aid the state or the people. The gold
plate was withdrawn from the royal tables and coined and the remains
were sold.

At last the stage for the settlement of the question of internal ad-
ministration was reached. A royal decree of May 30, 1810, appointed
a commission for the purpose.

The appointment of professors continued at salaries averaging be-
tween 1,200 to 1,500 thaler ($900 to $1,125), with from 200 to 500 thaler
($150 to $375) added for travelling expenses.

On September 22, 1810, the section of public instruction submitted
to the King its tinal report, in which it was stated that ‘‘Thus this
important institute has been opened in accordance with the will of your
Majesty, and the section recognizes with respectful thanks the pow-
erful protection and grateful privileges accorded the university to
which alone it owes its rapid and healthy establishment. For among ail
the renowned universities of Kurope there is not one possessed of such
“a number of tried teachers, with such scientific means, and with such
splendor in building.”

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 101

Indeed, it was an important moment when the section submitted
the first programme of the lectures which contained such celebrated
names. It was the often-promised seed which at last was being sown.

The staff was formed of fifty-eight teachers, of which twenty-four
were regular professors, nine secondary professors, fourteen private
lecturers, Six members of the academy, and five teachers of modern
languages. One hundred and sixteen courses of lectures were an-
nounced, of which the theological faculty had ten, the medical thirty-
four, philosophical sixty-two, and the faculty of law ten.

The general specialties of science were pretty well represented; the
introduction of German antiquity as a subject for historic philological
study was new. MHeindorf, in his introductory address, impressively
urged on the students the expectations held of them, for the improve-
ment of the newly created university.

By order of September 28, Schmalz was nominated rector, and
Schleiermacher, Biener, Hufeland, and Fichte, deans. On October 1 the
section requested the rector to begin matriculations, and on October
6 this act was performed on six students.

On October 10,1810, upon the invitation of the rector, the first as-
sembly took place, at the university building, consisting of sixteen pro-
fessors. It was opened by the rector with an address; in place of oath
of office he bound the professors to this duty by pressure of hand, where-
upon the senate of the university was declared constituted.

The senate ruled that each faculty should conter honors upon the
graduates, and that the use of the lecture-rooms was to be arranged ac-
cording to a compensating table. The lectures were set to begin on
October 19, to which general rule, however, exceptions were permitted,
thus Hufeland commenced his lectures and the instructions at the poli-
clinical institute on the 15th, Griife on the same day, Fichte on the
21st of October, while a few did not commence until the beginning of
November.

As an external mark of distinetion the following epigram was pro-
posed by Wolf:

‘“ Universitati Litterarie Fridericus Guilelmus III rex. A. CIptocce
vit.” It was recommended by Battemann and sanctioned by the
King.

A change in the administration occurred at about the time of the open-
ing of theuniversity. By decree of November 20, 1810, a new presi-
dent was appointed for the department of public instruction, and the
decree was communicated to all German universities. The acts of the
Berlin University begin with it. It stated: “You will be convinced
yourself of the importance which the department of worship and public
instruction now intrusted to your keeping exerts upon the welfare of
the state and its inhabitants, even upon that of humanity. The object
which the section of worship must always have in view is the advance-
ment of true religiousness without compulsion or mysterious fanatism,
102 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

and liberty of consience and toleration without public offense. In its
position as leading oftice it should direct its efforts toward enabling all
classes to obtain a thorough training in science and general knowledge,
and to disseminate clear conception and such opinions as tend to create
usefulness in practical life, true patriotism, obedience to and confidence
in the Government and the constitution. Most especially however it
should guard against the introduction, into science, of the spirit of ex-
clusiveness, which is nowhere more reprehensible than in objects pertain-
ing to human knowledge.”

The winter term of 181213 began under increasing excitement. The
first news of the destruction, in Russia, of the French army, reduced
the number of participants to the lectures. Teachers and pupils were
seized by irresistible desire to regain the fatherland and its most holy
possessions.

On February 3, the King called his people to arms; the word had been
given and all restraint ceased ; the lectures were abandoned, many pro-
fessors dismissing their pupils with impressive words. On March 28,
Schleiermacher read from the pulpit the King’s “call to arms.”

Quiet again reigned in the halls of learning ; as far as the excitement
permitted, the remainder re-commenced their labors. In the bulletin
of March 18, the rector announced, that notwithstanding the small num-
ber of students remaining—most of them being foreigners—the lectures
interrupted during the exciting days would be resumed in the coming
summer, Only fifteen professors resumed their lectures.

Upon the re-entry at Berlin, on March 31, 1814, of the returning vic-
tors, the thought at once was expressed to erect a monument to the
memory of those who had perished for the good of the country. On
July 16, the senate resolved to engrave their names upon a monument
to be erected in the large hall.

The University however gave a further proof of its appreciation and
eratitude, by conferring the honorary doctor title upon the following:

Hardenberg—patrie in discrimine posit sospitatorum felicissimum ;
Bliicher—Germanice libertatis vindicem acessimum, glorie Borussice
recuperatorum in victum, felicem, immortatum, Tauenzien, York, Kleist,
Biilow,—victoriis, preeclarissimis de patrisimmortaliter meritos, German-
ormum libertatis vindices; Gneisenau—consiliis sapientissimis, promp-
tissimis, saluberissimis in procliorum discrimine de patria immortaliter
meritum, Germanorum libertatis vindicem.

On February 9, 1815, the anniversary of the war-like action of the
students had been celebrated, and on April 7 the King called to arms
again. A second hot and bloody summer followed and for a second
time Paris surrendered.

During the Franco-Prussian war of 1870~71, eight hundred students
and professors joined the army, and of this number thirty-eight stu-
dents and one private lecturer lost their lives. On August 3, 1875, the
rector unveiled a tablet erected to the memory of the brave young men.

The oration of Prof. Dr. Mittermaier, of Heidelberg, delivered in the
name of the representatives of the German and Swiss Universities on
October 15, 1860, the fiftieth anniversary of the Berlin Alma Mater
bears witness to the fact that its scientific development fully realized
the expectations expressed in the reseript of November 23, 1810.

The University preserves a grateful memory to all who principally
contributed to its developments. Thus the birthday of King Frederick
William II] and of the reigning King are celebrated by orations.

In addition to the busts of Kings Frederick William III and IV busts
of thirty-three rectors and professors adora the aula.

As regards the organization of the University the propositions of
Schleiermacher were adopted- The faculties of the present day were
considered the fundamental columus of the structure. His memorial
with regard to the organization of the theological faculty served as :
basis for the others.

On December 28, 1810, the regulation of the academic jurisdiction was
issued as fundamental law for all Prussian Universities. As a means
of protection, the Department of Instruction, on February 8, 1811, is-
sued to the students a “ecard of recognition.” On February 20,1811, ree-
tor and senate informed all universities of the opening and joined the
union. The present statutes were sanctioned by the King on October
31, 1816, and delivered on April 26, 1517.

Based on these statutes a later order of January 29, 1858, gave spe-
cial statutes to each of the faculties. Those of the medical and philo-
sophical faculties have repeatedly been altered since.

The decrees of 1819 and 1834, based on the resolutions of the German
Parliament, had originated under influences of principles and conditions
which in consequence of the political movement of 1848 had experienced
such modifications as to induce the Government to relieve the Prussian
universities from the unjust suspicion expressed in those decrees and to
return to them the independence required for the development of an
active corporate life.

Upon request the universities furnished reports as to a comfortable
change with regard to academic jurisdiction and discipline.

On October 29, 1879, a law was promulgated relating to the question
of jurisdiction and discipline at the national universities.

At the opening of the University fifty-eight professors were appointed;
during the summer term of 1886 their number had increased to two
hundred and gighty-three, distributed among the faculties as follows :
Theology, seventeen; law, twenty-two; medicine, one hundred and two ;
philosophy, one hundred and forty-two.

The salaries for the regular professors range between 3,000 ($750) and
12,000 mark ($3,000) annually, and for the secondary professors from
900 to 4,800 mark ($225 to $1,200.)

An almost regular increase has been noticed in the number of stu-
dents. It may suffice here to state that while for the winter term of
104. THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

1810 one hundred and ninety-eight students were received at the
University (and for the summer term twenty-nine), the number of
matriculations for the corresponding terms of 1886 were two thousand
one hundred and sixty-seven, and one thousand and seventy-one, respect-
ively.

Notwithstanding the comparatively short period of its existence, the
University has already become the recipient of many rich bequests for
the benefit of worthy and needy students.

In order to promote diligence among the students prize questions are
propounded annually in accordance with the following ministerial regu-
lations :

REGULATION OF SEPTEMBER 16, 1824, WITH REGARD TO PRIZE QUESTIONS.

(1) The faculties of the Royal University are to publish annually
prize questions for solution by the students.

(2) These prize questions are to relate to strictly scientific subjects,
and, although the fundamental knowledge may have become known in
the academic lectures, they must be of such a character as to demand
thorough study and independent research in order to show, in the
answers, the amount of education received and the individual judgment.

(3) One prize question each is to be published annually by the theo-
logical, juristical, and medical faculties, and two by the philosophical
faculty, the latter alternating from year to year between one general
philosophical and one historical, against one philologhical and one
mathematical or physical.

(4) Hach faculty selects its own questions alternately from its various
branches. The member to whose specialty the question belongs is the
privileged questioner. The proposition has to be made in writing and
be submitted to the faculty in regular session on the 20th July, and is
accepted with two-thirds majority.

(5) All prize questions are published annually, on the birthday of
the King, by means of a Latin programme.

(6) Only students of the Berlin University are admitted to competi-
tion, and the essay has to be written in Latin.

(7) Nine months are allowed for the essay, viz, from August 3 of one
year to May 3 of the following year.

(8) The replies have to be delivered to the University secretary in
sealed envelopes and addressed to the respective faculty. Each essay is
to contain a sealed slip bearing on its inside the name of the writer and
on the outside the motto which has to be written in the essay under-
neath the title. These essays have to be delivered to the faculty un-
opened. Before a decision can be made it is necessary that the essays
circulate among all members of the faculty ; the member who has pro-
pounded the question then has to make an explicit report of all the es-
says and submit the same to the faculty at the latest on the 20th of July,
when the papers will be discussed as to their merits. Every regular

ei

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 105

professor is required to be present at that meeting or to make a satis-
factory excuse. The majority decides as to the award.

(9) A number of essays of insufficient value having been received
only by any faculty, it retains the award until the year following, when
two questions will be propounded. In the case of unsatisfactory results
to the second issue, the ministry reserves the right for future action.

(10) The prize consists of a gold medal in the value of 25 dueats
($60).

(11) The festive proclamation of all the prizes takes place on August
3, the birthday of the King, following immediately upon the oration.
The public speaker of the University is required to announce, in brief,
the decisions of the faculty of each of the essays. Thereupon the en-
velope containing the motto of the victorious student is opened and
read, together with the name of the essayist.

(12) The envelopes containing the names of the unsuccessful candi-
dates are not opened, but may be withdrawn from the secretary, together
with the essay. The crowned essay is also returned to the writer after a
copy has been made of it for the archives of the University, and may
be published by the author for his own benefit.

The same rules are adopted with regard to the municipal prizes, of
which one to the value of 225 mark ($56) is placed at the disposal of
each faculty. The prizes were founded, together with stipend, on occa-
asion of the fiftieth anniversary of the University.

Statistics of prize questions for the years 1825-1885 show the fol-
lowing results: 537 questions were propounded during the past sixty
years; 779 essays have been submitted, and of these 292, 37.5 per cent.
have received the prize ; 25, 3.2 per cent., the second reward ; and 108,
13.9 per cent., public acknowledgment. With regard to the distribu-
tion by faculties the following result is shown:

Institutes connected with the University.

The University Library.—The first impulse towards establishing an
independent library for the University was given in 1829, both by the
rector and the senate of the University and by the chief librarian of the
Royal Library, Prof. Dr. Wicken. In areport to the proper department
of the Government it was stated that the Royal Library had become in-
sufficient for the wants of the professors and students of the University,
and that for those a separate library had become necessary. The es-
tablishment of such a library was then decided by royal decree of Feb-
ruary 20, 1831.

The resources of the library were at first very moderate, and consisted
of 500 thaler ($375), collected from the students; furthermore, it was
decided that each doctor upon promotion, each private lecturer upon
his qualification, and each professor upon receiving his appointment,
was to pay 5 thaler ($3.75) towards the support of the library. For its
location some rooms were allotted in the Royal Library. The chief
librarian of the Royal Library was designated as principal librarian,
and two officials given him for the performance of the administrative
work.

The establishment prospered, notwithstanding the many difficulties
presenting themselves. The moderate means were carefully invested
in suitable books, and the library further increased by many donations
and by the compulsory additions exacted from the publishing houses
of the palatinate Brandenburg.

The library lends books for home perusal and is also used as a read-
ing-room.

For the lending of books the library is open daily from 9 A. M. to 2
P. M.; on Saturdays, only to 1 p.m. The reading-room is open daily
from 9 A. M.to 7 P.M.; on Saturdays to 1 P.M. only. During the sum-
mer vacations the library is open from 11 A. M. to 1 P. M., but the read-
ing-room remains closed.

The budget of the library, exclusive of salaries, is put at 10,500
mark ($2,625) for books and binding, and 4,300 ($1,075) for incidentals.

The personnel consists of a librarian, three custodians, two assist-
ants, two auxiliary helpers, two library messengers, and one porter.

The Mathematical Seminary.—The first “seminary aet,” the request for
the establishment of a mathematical seminary, originated on April 6,
1860, and is worded as follows:

“In the mathematical sciences more than in any other branch of sci-
ence it is necessary that not alone the substance of the lecture is under-
stood, but that the students, and especially the more advanced, should
have an opportunity for instruction in the application of the object of
their studies. For that purpose the establishment of a mathematical
seminary in connection with the University appears to present the best
solution. In the opinion of the petitioners such a mathematical scien-

tific seminary would tend to promote the mathematical education of
the students and exert a greatand favorable influence upon their prac-
tical training as teachers.”

An annual appropriation of 500 thaler ($575) was requested for the
support of the seminary, of which sum one-half was to be devoted to
the acquisition of a special library and the other half to prizes.

On April 23, 1861, the ministry authorized the announcement of sem-
inary exercises under certain provisional regulations, and the sum of
250 thaler ($187.50) was allowed for the purchase of books. On April
26, 1861, the students were invited to participate. The alphabetical
list of the members of the first mathematical seminary is dated. May 5,
1861. 3
On October 15, 1861, the draft of regulations for the mathematical
seminary was submitted to the University and accepted October 7,
1864.

The regulations of October 7, 1864, are as follows:

(1) The mathematical seminary is a public institute established in
connection with the University and has for its object the instruction of
such students of mathematical sciences as have already obtained a cer-
tain degree of proficiency by aiding them in the independent applica-
tion and by affording them literary assistance, thus enabling them later
on to promote and increase mathematical studies.

(2) The minister of education has the appointment of two professors
of the philosophical faculty to supervise the exercises of the students.

(5) Only those matriculated students can be admitted as ordinary
members who devote themselves especially to the study of mathematics
and have been engaged in that study for at least one year at some uni-
versity. Foreigners are eligible on the same conditions.

(4) The admission is granted upon the presentation to the director
of a discourse and an essay, the examination of which will prove
whether the applicant possesses sufficient knowledge and interest to
advantageously partake of the privilege. The essay may be omitted
upon special occasions in which the director’s testimonial is sufficient
guaranty for the efficiency of the applicant.

(5) The number of ordinary members is limited to twelve. The di-
rectors, however, are empowered to exceed that number by the appoint-
ment, as extraordinary members, of a few students possessing the neces-
sary requirements for admission.

(6) Any remiss member may, after having been cautioned and admon-
ished by the director, be excluded from attending the seminary.

(7) The meetings of the seminary take place weekly, at such a time
as will permit its extension to two hours or more.

(8) The scientific exercises of the seminary are both oral and in writ-
ing. The oral exercises consist in the free discussion of known mathe-
matical problems or of questions propounded by the director, or, at times,
by some of the students, and in addresses by the students on the results
108 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

of their own experiments or on the results of their studies. The exer-
cises in writing consist in the execution of problems given by the di-
rector, and are arranged in such succession that they will cover the
entire field of mathematics, and combined, tend to its better understand-
ing, and also in the preparation of larger essays or demonstrations, the
subjects of which are given by the director or are selected by the
students themselves. The board of directors examine and judge these
essays.

(9) The students who excel in both oral and other exercises are—
toward the close of each course—to be reported to the minister of edu-
cation with recommendations for the prizes set apart for the purpose.
These semi-annual reports contain also a statement of the exercises held
and the general state of the seminary.

(10) A library of the best and most useful mathematical works is to
be maintained for the free use of the students and for use in the meet-
ings of the seminary.

The annual appropriation for the seminary, since April 25, 1864, has
been 1,200 mark ($300), of which 750 mark ($187.50) are expended
for the library and 450 ($112.50) for prizes. The latter however were
established by order of March 14, 1884,

The Observatory and Computation Institute.—The first impulse for the
establishment of the Beriin Observatory was given toward the end of
the seventeenth century by the acceptance, on the part of the Protest-
ant powers of Germany, of the Gregorian calendar. King Frederick
I, in order to emancipate the country from foreign researches and labors
which had largely entered into consideration on important occasions,
resolved to utilize this change which affected all domestic affairs, by
establishing an observatory and a society of sciences. He therefore
ordered the erection of a square tower, 84 feet high and 40 feet a side,
the second floor of which was to be reserved for the society of sciences,
while the third floor was to be utilized by the astronomer of the society
for purposes of observation. The building was dedicated on January
19. 1G 11

The first astronomer of the society, Gottlieb Kireh, had been ap-
pointed in July, 1700, but he died (July 25, 1710) before the completion
of the building.

On October 15, 1828, King Frederick William III granted a request
of Alexander von Humbold for the purchase of a Fraunhofer refractor.
The instrument was received in March, 1829, but remained in the pack-
ing cases.

On August 10, 1850, permission was given for the purchase of a site
for a new observatory which was to be located in sufficiently close prox-
imity to the academy and the university to enable employés of the ob-
servatory to continue their connection with those establishments. The
building was completed in 1835.

EE
THE NATIONAL ‘SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN, 109

In 1868 a new meridian circle by Pistor and Martius was purchased ;
in 1869 a hermetically sealed pendalum clock by I*. Tiede and in 1879 a
universal transit by C. Bamberg.

The publication of the ‘“ Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch,” which
had been under the care of the director of the observatory, was in 1874
transferred to a special division of the observatory, known by the name
of * Astronomisches Rechen-Institut” (Astronomical Computation In-
stitute).

The Computation Institute, in addition to its regular staff, gives employ-
ment to five regular and to a varying number of temporary assistants.

The Institute also contains rooms for the exercises of the Univer-
sity Seminary for the instruction, in scientific calculation, of a number
of students.

The budget of the observatory for regular expenses is fixed at 11,340
mark ($2,835), and that of the Computing Institute at 8,800 mark
($2,200), to which for the latter are added 15,000 mark ($3,750), to be
used in the publication of the ‘“ Astronomisches Jahrbuch,” together
with the compensation of any computers required for the same.

In close connection with the “Astronomisches Jahrbuch,” the publiea-
tion of which was begun in 1772 by order of the Royal Academy (and
the one hundred and thirteenth annual volume of which has just been
published), the observatory, since its reconstruction in 1835, has em-
ployed itself prineipally with the determination of positions of fixed
stars, planets, and comets.

The results of these observations are published partly in five folio
volumes, entitled “ Beobachtungen der kéniglichen Sternwarte zu Ber-
lin,” and partly in the “ Astronomische Nachrichten.”

Five planets belonging to the group between Mars and Jupiter and
thirteen comets have been discovered at the observatory.

A remarkable fact is to be recorded in the annals of the observatory
in that the planet Neptune, the existence of which had been surmised
by Bessel in 1823 from some inexplicable irregularities in the motion of
Uranus, and the location of which had been calculated by Le Verrier
and Adams on the basis of these disturbances was really discovered in
the calculated place on September 23, 1846, by Galle, with the aid of
the Fraunhofer refractor.

The Meteorological Institute.—-This Institute owes its existence to the
exertions of Alexander von Humboldt, as a result of which, the King
by order of October 17, 1847, caused its establishment under the direc-
tion of the Royal Statistical Bureau, of which it formed an independent
scientific division until Mareh 31, 1886.

Negotiations for the re-organization of the meteorological bureau pend-
ing for ten years at last terminated in the spring of 1885, and Dr. von
Bezold, professor at the technical high school at Munich, who had been
induced to accept the newly created chair of meteorology at the Berlin
University, was appointed director of the Meteorological Institute,
110 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The Institute is to be regarded as a central point for the collection,
computation, and publication of meteorological stations of North Ger-
many, the meteorological systems of Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, Hesse,
the Saxon states and other smaller states having combined with it.

The system represents the following arrangemént of stations :

(a) One hundred and thirty stations of Class 11, that is, such stations
making three observations daily of all the instruments.

(b) Fifty stations of Class IIT, at which a limited number of instru-
ments is observed twice daily.

(c) Highty rain-fall stations.

At present a plan is under consideration for the incorporation in the
system of the stations (about one hundred and fifty) of the ‘ Society
for Agricultural Meteorology in the province of Saxony and in the Uck-
ermark,” and of the stations of the “Agricultural Central Association
of Lithunia and Masuren.”

Theappropriation for the Institute for the administrative year 188687
amounted to 73,060 mark ($18,265), of which 32,560 ($8,140) were in-
tended for salaries of officials, assistants, and computors, 21,000 mark
($5,250), for the payment of observers on stations, and 19,500 mark
($4,875) for other expenses. For architectural changes within the
rooms occupied, and for the purchase of instruments, 44,000 mark
($11,000) were allowed by special act and further amounts promised
during the coming year.

The Physical Institute-—Upon the extensive space lying between the
Neue Wilhelmstrasse, Schlachtgasse, Dorotheenstrasse and river Spree
two large buildings are located, each of 108 meter frontage, of which
the one along the Dorotheenstrasse has been fitted up for the Physio-
logical and Pharmacological Institutes, while that facing the Spree is
occupied by the Physical and the Second Chemical Institutes, all being
provided with the required directorial dwellings.

The total cost of the entire structures is 4,500,000 mark ($1,125,000),
of which 200,000 ($50,000) were paid for the foundations of the Physi-
ological Institute, 310,000 ($77,500) for that of the Physical Institute,
120,000 ($30,000) for that of the Pharmacalogical Institute, 110,000
($27,500) for that of the Chemical Institute and 60,000 ($15,000) for
those of the dwelling houses, representing 800,0°0 mark ($200,000),
or almost one-fifth of the entire cost of construction.

Until the year 1833 the University did not possess any proper col-
lection of physical apparatus, though a few instruments employed in the
course of lectures by professors had been purchased and placed in the
hands of professors using them for scientific investigation. It is true
that the University had allowed 500 thaler ($375) annually for in-
creasing the collection of physical apparatus, yet the money was gen-
erally employed for other purposes. ‘The want of proper apparatus be-
came apparent when Professor Magnus, the late director of the col-

lections, desired to employ a number of them in illustrating some phys-
ical lectures. On that occasion Baron von Altenstein, the minister of
instruction, proposed to professor Magnus to purchase the required in-
struments from his own means and suggested a repayment by the
state, of 500 thaler ($375) for four successive years, in consideration of
which a certain proportion of the apparatus was to become national
property.

The proposition was accepted and the instruments thus purchased
formed the nucleus of the present physical collection. At the expira-
tion of the above contract a similar arrangement was made, being
renewed annually until 1543, when, upon the recommendation of Min-
ister Eichhorn, the collection was placed in possession of a certain
allowance per year, which formed the only means ever placed at its dis-
posal with the two exceptions of the donations of the collection used
at the university for illustrating Goethe’s color theories, and of a col-
lection in the hands of Prof. Paul Erman, and transterred to the insti-
tute upon his death. Both collections combined represented only
twenty-seven pieces, so that almost the entire collection may be said to
have been procured from private means.

Since 1844 the collection had its rooms in the university building,
but space was wanting to enable physical researches to be executed.

The personal collection of apparatus and the library of Professor
Magnus, bequeathed to the university, formed the foundation of the:
physical laboratory of the university. Rooms were assigned upon the
first floor of the east wing and connected with basement rooms con-
taining the collections by means of winding stairs.

The present building was begun in 1873, and in 1878 had progressed
sufficiently to jastify the removal from the university building.

After the first few terms of instruction all available space had been
occupied, and further applications for admittance had to be rejected.

The present director of the institute is Privy Councillor of Govern-
ment, Professor Dr. von Helmholtz.

The Mineralogical Museum.—The collection of minerals established
by Privy Councillor of Mines Dietrich Karsten, in 1789, by order of
Minister Heinitz, consisted of Karsten’s private collection, which he
had presented to the State in 1781, and of the purchased collections of
Councillor of Mines Ferber and Privy Councillor of Finanee Gerhard.
In i801 it had been placed in the mint building, and by royal decree of
October 18, 1510, became incorporated in the collections of the univer-
sity under the conditions that the mining department should ber ecog.
nized as co-partner and should be consulted in case of required changes-
In September, 1814, it was placed on exhibition in the university build-
ing after having been named, in May, 1814, the Mineralogical Museum
of the University.
112 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN,

For the support and increase of the museum 1,000 thaler ($759) were
allowed annually since August, 1816, which amount has since been in-
creased to 5,020 mark ($1,255), not to include the personal expenses.

The museum contains the following divisions:

(1) Systematic mineralogical collection.

(2) Display collection of large specimens.

(3) Collection of cut stones and rocks.

(4) Meteorite collection.

(5) Systematic geognostie collection.

(6) Geographical collection, or the geognostic collection of the vari-
ous countries of the earth.

(7) The paleontological collection.

(8) The library, with collection of charts, well supplied with topo-
graphical maps and geognostic maps by the L. v. Borch collection.

The First Chemical Institute.—It is certainly a very remarkable fact
that of all the German universities that of Berlin should have been the
very last to organize a chemical institute, comprising everything re-
quired for the present state of science, since the chemists connected
with the University during the first fifty years of its existence occupy a
prominent place among the most celebrated investigators of the present
century.

But if, notwithstanding such illustrious representations, a great
chemical institute was not established until about twenty years ago, it
must be considered that at the time of the foundation of the University
chemistry was already existing in the academy of sciences, and that the
chemical chair at the University was generally occupied by the academical
chemist, and hence the University was relieved, in a measure, from the
responsibility of providing laboratories for the chemical professors.

The Chemical Institute of the University owes its existence to the
energy of the Minister of Education in demanding the appointment of a
university professor for the chemical chair.

The selection of a proper site was the next difficulty to overcome, and
this was accomplished by the purchase, for the sum of 72,000 mark
($18,000) from the Academy of a portion of its own estate, to which suf-
cient additional ground was obtained for the erection of an edifice, which
was begun in 1865 and completed in 1867.

In addition to the sum estimated, 75,000 mark ($18,750) were expended
on the internal arrangements; thus, counting all necessary expenditures,
including the 72,000 mark ($18,000) paid the academy and two-thirds of
the purchase money paid for the additional lot (only two-thirds of the
ground having been used in the erection of the building), 954,000 mark
($238,500) were willingly paid by the Prussian Government for the
erection of the new institute.

The Second Chemical Institute.—This institute was established simul-
taneously with the Pharmacological Institute, and opened on Easter,

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 113

1883. It serves specially for the study of inorganic, analytic, and min-
eral chemistry, and stands under the direction of Prof. Dr. Karl Fried-
rich Rammelsberg. °

For the practical teaching two divisions have been established. In
the synthetic laboratory the students are employed in the preparations
of chemical substances and the easier problems of quantitative analysis,
while in the analytical division quantitative analysis forms the princi-
pal subject.

The budget for regular expenditures of the institute, including the use
of water and gas has been fixed at 11,285 mark ($2,821).

The Technological Institute.—This Institute originated in the private
laboratory of Professor Wichelhans. To this were added the techno-
logical collections of the late Professor Magnus, and by decree of Sep-
tember 11, 1873, the first means were provided for the ‘establishment
of a technological laboratory and for the tectnological colleetion of the
University.” In April, 1883, the newly created Technological Institute
was removed to its present quarters under the direction of Prof. Dr.
Karl Hermann Wichelhans.

The publications of the institute are printed principally in the “Be-
richte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft,” in the “ Verhandlungen
des Vereins zur Befoérderung des Gewerbetleisses,” and in the ‘ Patent-
Schriften.”

The Botanical Garden.—The greater part of the present Botanical
Garden was, at about the middle of the seventeenth century, employed
for the growing of hops, to be used in the electoral brewery. In 1679,
on occasion of the abolishing of the brewery, Elector Frederick William
ordered the garden to be planted in fruit trees and garden truck.

Under the reign of King Frederick I the entire internal arrangement
was changed. Glass-houses were erected, oranges were raised, and the
kitchen garden changed into a royal pleasure garden.

Under Frederick William I the plans were changed; the garden
began to expand and to assume a really botanical character; but the
reform had barely begun when the garden was transferred to the keep-
ing of the Society of Sciences. It again lost its botanical character,
since, in planting medicinal herbs and plants for the royal pharmacy,
the practical king had sought to utilize it to the fullest extent. The
society could not afford to expend more than 600 mark ($150) a year on
the garden, and furthermore, its great distance from the city rendered
it difficult to find a suitable person to supervise it.

In 1809, on oceasion of the founding of the University, the Academy
of Sciences was relieved of the Botanical Garden, which was then placed
under the University, with a guarantied income of 13,000 mark ($3,250).

In 1820 the present winterhouse was erected, and in 1821 the oldest
palm house; the latter, however, proving too small it was replaced by
the present succulent house, In 1832 the garden possessed eighteen

H. Mis. 224——8

greenhouse divisions, representing a combined length of 350 meters
(1,148 feet) with 7,920 kilometer cubic contents.

On July 22, 1852, the Victoria Regia bloomed for the first time in a
building erected for its exclusive tse.

In view of the principal object of the garden, the advancement of sei-
entific botany, it should be the effort of the director to collect in his
garden extensive material for scientific botanical research, and to see
that it represents the entire vegetable kingdom to completeness.

The scientific means at the command of the garden are the library,
the microscope with auxiliary apparatus, all of which, together with
the catalogues of plants, are preserved in the offices of the palm house.

The working force consists of two principal assistants (foremen), fifteen
regular assistants, ten younger assistants, some of them voluntary assist-
ants without compensation, one overseer, one engineer, One mason,

‘one cabinet-maker, one carpenter, one glazier, one house-keeper, seven-
teen laborers, seven to ten char-women, and ten to twelve boys.

The plants cultivated in the garden during the year 1886 comprise
18,837 species, varieties, and forms. The budget is fixed at 85,365
mark ($21,341).

The garden is open to the public every day (except Saturday, San-
day, and legal holidays) from 8 A. M. to7 Pp. M. (in winter until dusk).
Strangers are admitted at any day.

The public makes very good use of this permission, more especially
during the period of blooming of the Victoria Regia, and also when the
plantation of gourds is at its height. From six to seven thousand vis-
itors have been recorded in a single day.

Special permission by card to visit the grounds is given to any one
desiring to investigate or study, and this special permission includes
the privilege to visit portions closed against the ordinary public, and
it also entitles the bearer to receive flowers or other material for in-
vestigation. Plants or parts of plants are also furnished to non-resi-
dent botanists. The garden supplies the University and Royal Schools
with the material required for botanical lectures.

The Botanical Museum.—Collections of curious objects from the
vegetable kingdom as well as of dried and mounted plants had been
commenced by the Society (later Academy) of Sciences in the last cen-
tury. The first herbarium presented to the society which possessed a
really scientific value was that of Andreas Gundelsheimer, consisting
of oriental specimens. Another important collection was begun by Lud-
wig Stosch in the Netherlands, France, and the Pyrenees by order of
King Frederick I. The Royal Library, too, and the Art Collection con-
tained a few collections of plants bound up in book form, of which the
oldest and most interesting is that of J. 8. Elsholz, the court physician
of the great elector and director of the pleasure garden, The “ Gesell-

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 115

schaft naturforschender Freunde” at Berlin, too. had its own cabinet
of natural curiosities, but all these divisions were gradually transferred
to the Botanical Museum.

The Royal Herbarium proper, which did not receive the designation
“Royal Botanical Museum” until 1879, existed since 1818, when the
Willdenow collection of plants was purchased for 36,000 mark ($9,000. )

The collections were at first deposited in the rear portion of the build-
ing (Dorotheenstrasse 10) belonging to the Academy, and in 1822 were
transferred to a house which had been purchased as a dwelling house for
the officials of the garden, but which had been let to the “ School for
Gardeners.” :

In 1824 the herbarium of Inspector Otto was purchased, comprising
between fourteen and fifteen thousand species and Leopold von Buchs
presented his collection made at the Canary Islands.

A new feature was now introduced, that of the lending out of collec-
tions. Until then they had been used and studied in the building by
but few people ; now any botanist employed in morphological and floral
studies could have the required material sent him; thus the herbarium
obtained a number of collaborators who voluntarily undertook the
determination of species, which resulted in the acquisition of a number of
original specimens. Upon the return of a collection the duplicates were
divided and employed in exchange with the leading establishments of
London, St. Petersburg, Paris, ete. The budget for the purchase of
plants being limited to 720 mark ($180), only collections of the greatest
importance could be procured from these means.

Although the means for running expenses were thus limited, the Gov-
ernment provided liberally on extraordinary occasions to secure the
acquisition of large and important private collections.

By such means the Kunth herbarium was obtained, which consisted of :
(1) A general collection of about 44,500 species in about 60,000 speci-
mens, comprising many duplicates, from the Paris Museum, and about
3,000 originals to ‘ Humboldt, Bonpland, and Kunth Nova Genera et
Species ;” (2) a collection of dried plants from the botanical garden at
Berlin, comprising 10,300 species; and (3) a collection of woods. The
price paid was 24,000 mark ($6,000).

The Link herbarium purchased in 1852 for 4,500 mark ($1,125)
enriched principally the European flora, especially by specimens col-
lected by himself in Portugal and Greece. It also increased the collee-
tion of fungi. The arrangement of garden plants, too, was of great
importance. The entire collection represented 3,113 eryptogams and
16,382 phanerogams.

The von Nees von Hserbeck collection of glumacexw was purchased
in 1855 for 2,700 mark ($675). It contained 9,559 species.

The collection of lichens of Major von Flotow was purchased in 1857
for 6,000 mark ($1.500),
116 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

Two donations were received which, aside fromthe transportation,
did not cause further expense. One of them, the herbarium of Lieu-
tenant General von Gansauge, obtained in 1871, contained about 15,000
species, while that of Professor Laurer, received in 1874, contained a
rare collection of lichens and of mosses.

Upon the death, in 1877, of A. Brauns, the state purchased his collec-
tions for 21,000 mark ($5,250), the Academy of Sciences his scientific
manuscripts for 4,000 mark ($1,000). They were transferred to the
museum on condition that they were to be preserved and made
accessible to specialists. The botanical collections consisted of: (1) a
morphological herbarium of forty-three maps; (2) an herbarium of
phanerogams of considerable extent, which excelled by its wealth of
forms and localities; (3) a valuable herbarium of cryptogams ; (4) a
collection of fruits and seeds, among which the cycadie, conifer, and
juglandie deserve special mention.

Owing to the want of sufficient accommodation the herbarium was,
in 1857, transferred to Berlin, and assigned rooms in the éast wing of
the University. Here the collections remained until March, 1880, when
they wereremoved to the new building, erected at a cost of 280,000 mark
($70,000) for the building and 80,000 ($20,000) for its internal arrange-
ment.

At about that time the large and precious Mettenius collection of
ferns was purchased for 6,000 mark ($1,500).

The most valuable collection of Dr. Georg von Martens was pre-
sented by his heirs. It comprised 12,459 species and contained among
others the originals employed in “ Schiibler and Martens flora of Wiir-
temberg,” valuable collections made by the Wiirtemberg Travelers
Society, and also 4,101 species of salt water alge in the best possible state
of preservation and fully described by the former owner.

Finally the herbarium of the late Professor Lorentz was received
(who died in the Argentine Republic), which contained a large and crit-
ical collection of mosses as well as a rich herbarium of the Argentine
flora, being largely the originals employed in ‘‘ Griesebach’s determina-
tion of the Argentine plants.”

Access to the collections is granted to any one personally known or
properly introduced. Any one desiring to compare or study plants or
other objects receives permission upon application, and is furnished
desk and temporary desk-room. Responsible botanists within the Prus-
sian domains can obtain the use of objects at their respective homes
for a limited period of time. Non-resident botanists can obtain that
privilege only upon special permission from the department.

The collections of the museum are open to the general public in sum-
mer on Monday and Thursday afternoons.

The University Garden.—Owing to the great distance of the botanical
garden the establishment of a garden as auxiliary means in the botan-

. * . . . . = s
ical instructions received early consideration soon after the founding of

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 117

the University, and in 1820 the space in the rear of the University was
employed tor the purpose. The garden was intended to contain the
principal officinal plants and those resembling these; and also, as far as
practicable, economical, technical, and commercial plants; while in the
surrounding vacant spaces, ornamental trees and shrubs were to be
planted. The establishment was completed in 1821~22. It was pro-
vided with a green-house containing a cold and a hot division. The
plants were furnished by the botanical garden, under the care of which
the new plantation was placed. In 1837 if was made independent, by
the appointment as University gardener, of Mr. Sauer, of the botanical
garden. As long as but one regular chair existed at the University for
botany, the incumbent always held the appointment of director of both
the Botanical and University gardens. .

The garden has not increased in extent. A small earth-house was
added to the existing green-house. Another small dirt-house without
furnace serves for the wintering of less sensitive plants. The heating
of the other houses is effected by means of hot water through copper
pipes. In the selection of green-house plants special attention was
given to those used for officinal and domestic purposes.

The Botanical Institute.—This Institute was established in 1878 on the
top floor of the old Exchange Building. A large hall with favorable
light was set aside for microscopical examinations by beginners, and
several other rooms were given to the more advanced students. A small
chamber served as dark-room and a large corner room was fitted up as
a physiological laboratory. The director, the assistants, and the mes-
senger had each one room assigned; an assembly room and a lecture
hall seating from thirty to thirty-five were also provided.

In the autumn of 1883 the Institute was transferred to its present lo-
cation, the situation of which, in the vicinity of the University and of
the University garden, may be pronounced as very favorable.

The Institute possesses at present nineteen large and twenty-eight
small microscopes, together with all the required auxiliary apparatus
(prisms, micrometer, goniometer, etc.), twenty-six demonstration micro-
scopes for use in lectures, one microtom, one micro-spectroscope, one
solar spectroscope, one large spectral apparatus by G. & S. Merz, one
heliostate by Heele, one achromatic lens by Steinheil (81 millimeters
aperture), one cathetometer by Heele, one compression-pump with lever
by Pfeil, one double-action air-pump, one double aspirator by Warm-
brunn & Quilitz, one gas-regulator, one gasometer, one astatic mirror
galvanometer by Siemens & lace gneve battery, three klino-
stats, among which one very large and powerful by Heele, one auxan-
ometer with self-registering clock-work, two pair of balance-scales, and
numerous smaller apparatus and models for physiological research.

The budget, exclusive of administration and salaries of assistant
and messenger, was 5,950 mark ($1,482.50) until 1885 when, in consid-
eration of lessened necessities, it was decreased to 3,930 mark ($982.50),
118 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The direction of the Institute is combined with the chair of anatomy
and physiology of plants at the Royal University.

The Institute of Vegetable Physiology.—The Institute was created in
1873, and in 1880 united with the botanico-microscopical laboratory of the
Agricultural High School in such a manner that the use of the scientific
apparatus and inventory belonging to the University is available to the
students of either of these establishments, while the means of support
are to be furnished by the Department of Agriculture exclusively.

The object of the Institute is the study of morphology, development,
and physiology of the plants. For this purpose lectures are delivered
and practical instruction furnished ; the students also have an oppor-
tunity for making individual examinations.

The Institute contains (1) a hall for the students in microscopy, seat-
ing twenty, and facing north; (2) a room for the director; (5) a room
seating four for chemical work ; (4) a large room for the assistant and
six of the advanced students. This room also contains the library.
(5) A dark-rocm ; (6) a room for physiological research and containing
a Pfeffer rotary apparatus ; (7) two greenhouses, in which the objects
for microscopical and physiological research are produced ; (8) a small
experimental garden.

The Institute is well provided with optical instruments and physiolog-
ical apparatus ; it also contains extensive collections for instruction,
comprising the subject of morphology, productionand development, and
the physiology of plants.

The Zodlogical Museum.—The establishment of the Zodlogical Museum
is contemporaneous with the foundation of the University. The Museum
was located in the University building since its erection, but from the
beginning the plan and execution exceeded the material required for
demonstration, and that in the direction of creating a basis for the sys-
tematic knowledge of all living animals, thus to form a zodlogical center
for Germany similar to that at Paris, London, Leiden, Vienna, for their
respective countries. The Museum was planned by Count Joh. v. Hoff-
mannsegg, who made the first donation, consisting of several thousand
specimens of Brazilian mammals, birds, and reptiles, The principal
and fundamental stock was formed by the donation, by the royal col-
lections, of a number of natural history objects, consisting of mammals,
birds, insects, and shells; to these were added the following original
collections :

(1) The collection of fishes of Dr. Marcus Elieser Bloch, practicing
physician at Berlin. Originals (partly dried, partly in sieoRen described
in his ‘ Naturgeschichte der Fische Deutschlands,” 1782-1785, and
‘“ Naturgeschichte der ausliindischen Fische,” 1785-1795.

(2) The collection of crustacea, of Joh. Friedr, Wilh. Herbst, pastor at
the Church of St. Mary, and purchased for 447 thaler ($312.75). CGrigi-
nals used in his ‘** Naturgeschichte der Krabben und Krebse,” 1790-1804.

“Tt. US |
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 119

(3) A large collection of corals, presented by counsellor of the court,
Dr. Gerresheim of Dresden, whose oil portrait has been placed in one of
the halls of the Museum. The collection serves as basis to Ehrenberg’s
systematic classification of corals.

A few but highly important original specimens of fishes and conehy-
lie from Northeast Asia were presented by P.S. Pallas, explorer of
Russia.

Of other collections added by explorers at the earlier times the fol-
lowing may be mentioned: Krebs and Bergius, South Africa; C. G.
Ehrenberg and Hemprich, Egypt, Nubia, and the coasts of the Red
Sea; Sello and v. Olfen, Brazil and the La Plata regions; von Sack,
Deppe, and Schiede, Mexico; Carl Ehrenberg, West Indies, principally
St. Thomas; J. Cabanis and Zimmermann, southern portion of North
America; v. Minutoli, Canary Islands; v. Sack, Cyprus; Eversmann,
Bokhara; Lamare-Picquot, Maskarena, and Bengal (purchased in 1836
for 6,000 thaler) ($4,500); Lhotsky and Schayer, Australia, ete.

The museum is provided with a fair library, which is placed in the
rooms of the director and custodians.

The budget was, in 1810, fixed at 2,200 thaler ($1,650), of which 1,900
($1,425) were paid for salaries (exclusive of that of the director). In
1837 the budget was increased to 3,550 thaler ($2,662.50) (salaries 3,400,
($2,550) ); in 1843 to 5,565 thaler ($4,173.75). At present the amount
allowed is (exclusive of the director’s salary) 1,800 mark ($450) 54,670
mark ($13,667.50), from which salaries are paid to the curators 3,300
($825) and 4,800 mark ($1,200), together with allowance for dwelling to
assistants, and taxidermists from 1,200 to 2,400 mark ($300 to $600),
while 22,960 ($5,740) are set aside for incidentals, of which amount
one-half is reserved for purchases.

The museum is open to the general public every Thursday and Friday
from J2 to2 P.M. Owing to the fact that the exhibition halls are not
heated, the attendance varies with the season; it is most numerous on
holidays. Classes of schools may be admitted any day upon proper
application. Studentsare supplied with tickets which admit them every
forenoon. Artists, upon receiving permission from the director, have
an opportunity of drawing and sketching. Scientific geologists are
admitted at any hour of the day

The Zoological Institute—When, upon the death of Prof. Wilhelm
Peters, director of the museum, a separation of the University protes-
sorship and direction of the Royal Zoological Museum had been de.
cided on, the establishment of a Zoological Institute, devoted exclu-
sively to the needs of academic instruction and to scientific investiga-
tion, became urgent.

The Natural History Museum.—The Zoological Museum and the Zoo-

logical Institute were, in 1888, removed to a new building, which bears
the name “ Natural History Museum.”
12U) THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The building consists of three stories above the basement. ‘The front
portion is intended to contain the Mineralogical Museum; it forms almost
a square around a glass-covered court, which serves as an entrance to
the rear portion of the building containing the Zoological Museum.

The Zoological Garden.—The history of the Berlin Zoological Garden
antedates that of any similar establishments of Germany.

Its nucleus was the colleetion of live animals of King Frederick Will-
iam III, located upon the ** Pfaueninsel,” near Potsdam. Upon hisdeath
Professor Lichtenstein, the naturalist, influenced King Frederick Will-
iam IV to consign the animals, as a beginning, to a zoological garden,
the erection of which, in the neighborhood of the capital, had already
been considered.

The former pheasant garden (Koénigliche Fasanerie) was given up to
the enterprise, which soon was called into existence by a syndicate, with
the assistance of money grants from the Government.

For a number of years the garden served principally for scientific
investigations until, in about 1865, by the establishment of gardens else.
where the general attention was drawn toward it. A comparison with
the more recent establishment proved rather unfavorable to the home
garden. A visit of the Queen Augusta to the zoological garden at
Cologne gave rise to the consideration of important improvements, sug-
gested with the view of making the Berlin garden worthy of the. dis-
tinction of being located in the national capital.

The first step was the formation of a company which issued shares to
the amount of 300,000 mark ($75,000) and effected an additional loan of
1,500,000 mark ($375,000). The ground was donated by the Govern-
ment, and Dr. H. Bodinus, former director of the Cologne garden, was
invited to assume the directorship. So energetically did he proceed
that the first concert could be arranged for in the garden in the sum-
mer of 1870, before the commencement of the Franco-Prussian war.
The new establishment had extended its usefulness and combined the
scientific investigations with amusement.

Inrapid succession the various buildings were now erected which were
to serve as quarters for the many animals, so that, in addition to the
old buildings, accommodations were prepared for the mammals, animals
of prey, birds of prey, for the antelopes, birds, elephants, ete. Consid-
erable additions were made to the stock of animals, and thus, within a
remarkably short space of time, an establishment was created which,
while it could favorably compare with any other existing garden, was
also worthy its rank, and took a conspicuous place among the points of
interest of the residence of the German Empire.

With regard to the collection it may be said that it comprises repre-
sentatives of most all the important mammals and birds, in as many
species and specimens as can successfully be provided for.

The more recent construction of a house for monkeys has offered an

opportunity for a rich and carefully selected collection of those ani-
mals.

The Aquarium.—The aquarium, constructed during the years 186769
(by the genial architect H. Luer), is an original and interesting struct-
ure, rich in grottoes and caves, and is intended to harbor animals of
other classes besides aquatic animals. The marine invertebrates are
principally represented.

The Berlin Aquarium, in its arrangement and facilities for the obser-

vation and study of the lower ciasses of animals, offers considerable
means for natural history instruction, and thus aids materially in the
development of natural history study.

To scientists it offers facilities by placing at their disposal the mate-
rial collected from many places and seas.

II.—THE MILITARY MEDICAL INSTITUTES.

[Omitted here. ]
IV.—THE AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL.

With regard to agricultural instruction in the margraviate Branden-
burg it may be stated that a chair for agriculture was founded in 172
at the University of Frankfort on the Oder.

In 1806, by invitation of King Frederick William [Ll Albrecht Thaer
established the first German agricultural academy under the name of
“ Royal Academic School of Agriculture at Méglin.”

In 1810, the trying time for the Kingdom, when the development of
economie and industrial resources assumed the greatest importance in
the struggle to supply means for a successful warfare, the agricultural
school became incorporated in the University; the distance, however,
preventing the close relationship anticipated, a separation again took
place.

Notwithstanding the discontinuance of agricultural lectures, some few
agriculturists continued in their attendance to the University, and the
authorities kept up their relationship to the agricultural academy in

_ order to enable students in the branches of political sciences to complete

their studies by participating in the practical course of instruction.

While in most of the Prussian provinces special agricultural schools
were established, the agricultural central union of the district of
Potsdam insisted on having the connection kept up between the Royal
Academic School of Agriculture and the University at Berlin.

In 1860 the old agricultural academy at Méglin ceased to exist and
an agricultural school was established at Berlin, which at first, accord-
ing to sections 1, 3, 4, and 5, of the programme illustrating the object
of the institute, was depending on the University in so far as being open
to all matriculated students.

The present requirements exact of an agriculturist a more thorough

‘scientific training than was expected at the agricultural school at

MOglin.
122 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

Since 1866 the students are required to register at the central bureau
of the Agricultural Department instead of at the University as formerly.
In 1867 the Department of Agriculture began the establishment of an —
agricultural museum, the nucleus being formed by the exhibits re-
turned from the Paris exhibition. 4

:

The demand for increased accommodations becoming felt more press-
ingly each year, the east portion of the site formerly occupied by the
Royal Iron Foundry, was assigned to the erection of an agricultural
building while the remaining portions were to be devoted to buildings
for the Geological Institute and Mining Academy, and for the natural
history Museum of the University. F

The agricultural building was erected during the years 1876—~80
and opened in 1880, with the International Fishery Exhibition, which

‘was held in the portion of the building intended for the agricultural
museum. The opening of the museum, therefore, had to be deferred
until after the close of the exhibition.

By royal decree of February 14, 1881, the united institute and museum
received the name ‘*“ Agricultural High School.” Its constitution was
arranged for by provisional statutes of May 27, 1881, of the Minister
of Agriculture. -

The constitution provides for the appointment of a commission for
the decision of points of organization and to submit propositions.

The directors of the various divisions have been granted considerable
freedom of action and separate funds have been placed at their dis-
posal.

The corps of teachers is presided over by a rector whose election
rests with the above-named commission, subject to confirmation by the
ministry.

The business affairs of the establishment are conducted in part by a
board of trustees and partly by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The degree of education required for admission is that demanded to
secure the privilege of voluntary service in the army.

An addition was made to the scope of the institute by the establish-
ment, in 1883, by ministerial decree of October 10, 1882, of a geodetic
and technical course for surveying. Special teachers have been em-
ployed for the purpose. The students of geodesy are required to pos-
sess the degree of the highest class of a gymnasium or real school.

The museum is to serve the double purpose of academic instruction
and of being the central institute which enables investigators to engage
in special studies; by its exhibits it also serves for the education of the
people.

The budget for 1886~87 fixed the expenses of the high school at
224,970 mark ($56,242.50): its income is 39,328 mark ($9,832); hence’
an appropriation of 185,642 mark ($46,410.50) is required. |

Examinations take place for (1) agriculturists, (2) land surveyors, (3)
technical culture, (4) agricultural teachers.

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 123

Three prize questions are propounded at the close of each summer
term, which pertain (1) to agriculture, (2) fundamental sciences, (3)
technic of cultivation. The award is 150 mark ($37.50) in each case.
Essays of merit, though not quite up to the standard of perfection,
receive honorable mention.

The Central Library.—lIts object and purpose is to offer to professors
and students of the agricultural high school all necessary scientific
means, and in its capacity as the most complete specific library, to aid
all interests. For this purpose much attention is given to its comple-
tion in all branches of agriculture, forestry, ete.

The Physical Cabinet and the Meteorological Observatory.—The collection
contains the apparatus required for instruction in physics. They are
employed by the students in the course of lectures and in investigations.
A series of meteorological apparatus has been provided, which serves
the purpose of instruction. Three daily readings are made of the in-
struments prescribed forstations of thesecond class; the results are pub-
lished by the Prussian Meteorological Institute. A number of automatic
apparatus register the progress of pressure, temperature, precipitation,
force, and velocity of wind, and these automatic records serve in the
preparation of essays on climatology, etc. The entire arrangement is
that of a station of the second order. A regular exchange of barograms
has been arranged with Hamburg, Magdeburg, Wien, and Copenhagen

The Chemical Institute—The principal object of the institute is the in-
struction of the students in general chemistry, qualitative and quantita-
tive analysis. Itis located in a building adjoining the Agricultural High
School, and also accommodates the laboratory of the Society for the
Production of Beet Sugar in the German Empire. The ground floor
contains a large work room arranged for fifty students, and is provided
with skylight; furthermore an auditory, having a capacity of one hun-
dred and forty. The upper floor accommodates the private laboratory
of the director and a few rooms intended for special investigations.

The chemical instruction comprises: (1) In winter, lectures on inor-
ganic, and (2) in summer, on organic chemistry ; (3) practical exercises
in qualitative and quantitative analyses, and other chemical experi-
ments, for which purpose the laboratory is open daily from 9 A. mM. to 5
P. M.

The Mineralogic-Pedological Institute.—In view of the existing connec-
tion between mineralogy, geology, and agriculture a chair of mineralogy
and pedology (zéd0v, earth, soil, and 2dyos) was provided at the re-

organization, in 1881, of the agricultural high school. The occupant

has also the charge over the recently created mineralogic-geologic-
pedological museum.

Its collections resolve themselves into the two classes for (a) educa-
tion and (b) exhibition.
124 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

(a) The educational collections contain minerals, rocks, and soils of
importance in agriculture ; the collection has been made instructive by
the selection of specimens showing the changes produced by exposure.

(b) The exhibition collections are placed in horizontal and perpendic-
ular glass cases, and represent a well organized and described material
for the instruction in and contemplation of the composition and variety
of the native soil.

The mineralogical coliection is arranged according to the Zirkel sys-
tem, and shows the more important minerals in their characteristic forms.

The petrographic collection is arranged according to Credner’s sys-
tem, and exhibits characteristic forms of rocks. The exhibition hall
also contains several geological charts, of which may be specially men-
tioned that of the Harz Mountains and the Thuringian forest, which is
composed of eighty-one sheets.

The geological and pedological collection is exhibited in the adjoining
hall. Commencing with the most recent formations, it passes through
the various layers of humus, clay, lime, gravel, sand, and ferriferous
soils, including the organic inclosures of alluvium, diluvium, and tertiary
periods which connect with the mesozoic, paleozoic, and archaic periods.

Chemical analyses, microscopic preparations, solutions, reliefs, pro-
files, and tableaus complete the objects. Illustrations of sceneries be-
longing to the various geological periods and illustrating their pecu-
liarities are suspended above the exhibition cases.

The pedological division has found accommodations along the light
court of the museum. It contains apparatus for examination of the
soil, the mineral fertilizers, fuel, representations of Thuringian brown
coal industry, manipulations of asphaltum, flint, and peat, and indus-
tries.

The Agronomic-Pedological Institute—The Institute embraces two
divisions, the agronomic-pedological and agricultural-chemical labor-
atory, and the division for soil, fertilizer, and irrigation and drainage.

The agronomic-pedological laboratory purports to promote the scien-
tific explorations ef the soil in its relation to the structure of plants and
to its cultivation, and to offer facilities for the study and execution of
agronomic-pedological and agricultural-chemical experiment.

The agronomic-pedological laboratory consists of a large room for the
accommodation of the assistant and twenty students, and contains all
apparatus for agricultural-chemical and physical examination and
analysis.

The Institute of Vegetable Physiology.—The Institute was established
in 1881, and comprises a laboratory for physiological work, with dark
room, microscopic room, chemical division, green-house, and experi-
mental garden. It possesses all the necessary apparatus, instruments
and collections, and a library. ‘The Institute prepares the physio-
logical experiments required in the lectures, and offers opportunity to
the student to practice vegetable physiology and pathology. To the

director, his assistants, and the practitioners it affords means for spe-
cial investigation in vegetable physiology and the diseases of culti-
vated plants.

The Vegetable Division of the Museum.— When the request was made on
the agriculturists to furnish exhibits for the Paris Exposition of 1867
they readily responded, but expressed themselves desirous of transfer-
ring their exhibits, after the close of the exposition, to the Government,
to serve in the foundation of an agricultural museum. This proposi-
tion was accepted, and many objects were added to those exhibits, by
donation or by purchase. The products of agriculture, of course, re-
ceived the first consideration, and thus the wealth of the division may
be explained. Corresponding to the enlargement of the agricultural
administration to a department of agriculture, lands, and forests, the
science of forestry has received consideration, and the collection of
woods has becomea very complete one, owing to donations of foreign
governments, especially of those of India, Japan, and of the French
colonies.

The Zoological Institute.x—The collections of the Institute are rela-
tively complete, especially with regard to the osteology of mammals; it
contains the collection of skulls and skeletons of Herm von Nathu-
sius and those of the abandoned agricultural academies of Eldena and
Proskau. In addition to the skulls of other mammals it contains large
collections of the skulls of horses, hogs, cattle, sheep, and dogs of the
various breeds, domestic and foreign, which in completeness can not be
excelled by any other museum. The remaining divisions of the zoolog-
ical collections are generally restricted to the European animals of
interest or importance tothe agriculturist, without, however, excluding
such foreign animals as may be required in the systematic study of the
animal kingdom. The Institute proposes to investigate all zoological
questions relating to agriculture, and to carefully trace the derivation
and evolution of all domesticated animals, for which purpose a special
interest is given to the fossil and subfossil remains of the domestic
animals and to their relatives.

The Institute of Animal Physiology.—Since the enlargement of the
last year, the institute has the use of two largeand four small laborato-
ries, Which are provided with all improvements required for the analyt-
ical and vivisectory labors of the institute. It also controls a stable
with divisions for the various animals and some basement rooms which,
on account of their good light, are well adapted for the keeping of ani-
mals under observation. A small respiratory apparatus has found room
in the basement.

The institute possesses the required apparatus for microscopical
work and for the study of material changes of the mechanism of the
nervous system, of respiration and cireulation. Additions to the appa-
ratus are made whenever needed, as far as the means at disposal per-
mit.
12G THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The institute serves for instruction in so far as it aids the lectures on
animal physiology, sanitation, ete., by actual demonstration and experl-
ments.

The Zoo-technical Institute.—The means by which the Zoo-technical
Institute expects to succeed, excepting the necessary apparatus, ete.,
are found in the representations, models, and, as regards sheep-
raising, of samples of wool. The wealth of the collection and the cor-
rectness of the representations render this portion of the museum a
permanent animal exhibition, with however the additional advantage
that the model does not represent one single act, but that each typical
appearance of the agricultural domestic animal has been shown therein.
It is a further object of the Zoo technical Museum to keep before the
pubiie all possible phases of animal industry of the nation.

The Institute is in charge of Privy Councellor, Prof. Dr. H. Settegast.

The Institute of Geodetic Instruction.—The geodetic collection,
founded in 1883, contains ten theodolites (three with microscopes), two
compass apparatus, eleven levelling instruments, of which two are for
exact work having all auxiliary apparatus, one sextant, one prism circle,
one engineer’s table, one Fortin barometer, four aneroids, three Amler
planimeters, two precision planimeters, two pantographs, apparatus
for the examination of the above instruments, demonstration apparatus,
and surveying apparatus. Available for instruction are further a geo-
detie library, a collection of plans, and a series of forty-two wall-dia-
grams representing geodetic instruments.

The surveying exercises are—during the summer—executed in the
open air; in winter, indoors in a large hall which has been constructed
for the purpose. Two large rooms are used in geodetic computations
and drawing; adjoining these is the room of the assistant, which con-
tains the collection of plans, and that of the professor, which contains
the library.

Division of Machinery and Models.—The collection,located in a hall of
the ground floor, consists of measuring apparatus, actual machines, or
models. Among the latter may be mentioned the Rausch models ex-
hibited in the southern vestibule and show the historical development
of hand implements and of the plow. The requirements of instruction
and of practical use determine the enlargement of the collections; the
additions, therefore, confine themselves principally to elements of con-
struction and to apparatus for the testing of useful machinery.

A collection of serviceable machinery in complete working order is
employed for instruction. For that purpose an engine of 35 horse-
power has been mounted in the hall. A water reservoir located in the
hall contains a pulsometer, a centrifugal pump, an open archimedian
screw, an overshot and an undershot wheel. Exhibitors have free use
of space for terms of six months; the articles exhibited are published
annually in the Deutsche landwirthschaftliche Presse. The space will

admit of the exhibition of about two hundred objects, including three
to four locomotives and as many combined threshers.

The Division of Fermentation and Starch-making.—This division repre-
sents the above industries and belongs to the State only in so far as it
occupies an official building and its director is one of the teachers of
the agricultural high-school. The management is in the hands of the fol-
lowing technical associations: The Society of Distillers in Germany,
the Society and Experimental Institute for Brewing, and the Society of
Starch Manufacturers in Germany. These associations, with a mem-
bership of about three thousand, pay 100,000 mark ($25,000) annually
towards the support of the division.

The Division of Sugar Industry.—This division, supported by the Society
for Beet-Sugar Industry in the German elas receives its rooms from
the state free of expense, Its objects are: (1) the education of chemists
for the sugar industry; (2) any nat required by a member of
the society and the testing of instruments of precision ; (3) the opening
up of new fields regarding the composition of raw substances, auxiliary
substances, and products of manufacture, as well as the development
of technic and supervision of management. These objects are attained
by the labors of the very completely organized laboratory, by lectures,
and by attendance to the periodical meetings of the industrials.

The Royal School for Gardening, and the National Nursery.—Although
occupying separate localities, but closely related, both establishments
owe their existence to the exertions, in 1823, of the general director of
the gardens, Dr. Lenné, who secured the means necessary for their es-
tablishment from the munificency of King I’rederick William III, from
the interested departments of the government, from the society for the
promotion of horticulture in the Prussian states and from the stock-
holders of the national nursery. The royal decree of August 20, 1823,
granted them the privileges of a corporation.

The Gardening school, whose principal object was the education of the
various grades of gardeners, had its practical division at Schéneberg, a
suburb of Berlin, while the division for scientific and artistic instrue
tion was located upon the “ Pfaueninsel,” near Potsdam. Owing toinsuf-
ficient results caused by the separation the divisions at Schoneberg were
abandoned and combined with the establishment at Potsdam.

The principal building of the establishment, in addition to the apart-
ment set aside for the inspector, contains halls for instruction and for
the collections, as also accommodation for twenty-seven apprentices
which number, however, is generally exceeded. This arrangement, to-
gether with the permission of the Emperor of the freedom of the im-
perial gardens for purposes of instruction, and the connection with the
national nursery, affords great facilities.

The National Nursery is located upon a territory of 200 acres in ex-
tent. In addition to the training of young gardeners it has engaged in
128 ‘THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

the examination of important pomological questions and subjects and is
testing and supplying to fruit-growers reliable standard trees.

Both establishments have been placed under the care of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and are managed by a board of trustees composed
of a representative of the Department of Agriculture, lands and for-
ests, who is the president, a representative of the royal garden in-
tendancy and a member of the society for the promotion of horticulture
in the Royal Prussian state. The immediate administration is in the
hands of Royal Garden Inspector Jiihleke, assisted by two inspectors
and one secretary.

V.—THE GEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AND THE MINING ACADEMY.

The Mining Academy.—This was called into existence by royal decree
of September 1, 1860,. In its organization the same points were con-
sidered which for some time prior had been adopted in the training of
candidates for technical positions.

The mining officials requiring an education which involves a knowl-
edge of law, national economy, and the natural sciences, in addition to
their technical attainments were, until then, required to finish their
studies at some national university. In the organization of the Berlin
Academy all branches had been provided for thus enabling the student
to complete his studies without being obliged to visit a university.
The programme of instruction therefore provided for the following
branches:

(1) Science of mining. (2) Mining, surveying and mathematical
geography. (3) Practice of mine surveying and in drafting. (4) Sei-
ence of salt mining. (5) Science of manufacture. (6) General metal-
lurgy. (7) General assaying. (8) Blowpipe. (8) Iron mining. (9)
Projecting of iron-works. (11) Assaying of iron. (12) Metallurgical
technology. (13) Chemical technology. (14) Science of machinery.
(15) Machines for mining and smelting works. (16) Construction. (17)
Architectural construction. (18) Drawing. (19) Plane and spherical
trigonometry, stereometry, and analytical geometry. (20) Descriptive
geometry. (21) Differential and integral calculus. (22) Mechanics.
(23) Mineralogy. (24) Mineralogical practice. (25) Petrography.
(26) Petrographic practice. (27) Paleontology. (28) Paleontological
determinations. (29) Fossil plants. (30) Geognosy. (31) Geology of
quaternary formations. (32) General geology. (33) Analytical chem-
istry. (34) Chemical laboratory. (35) Mining laws.

The Geological Institute.—The first beginning of the present institute
may be traced back to the year 1862. he office of the royal director
of mines had commenced the construction of geological maps of the
Rhine province and of Westphalia at a scale of 1:80000, of Nether and
Upper Silesia at a seale of 1:100000, and for the province of Saxony it
had undertaken a continuation of von Strombeck’s map of the district
of Magdeburg.

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 129

When, in the execution of that work, the maps of the general staff,
which were prepared to ascale of 1: 25000, were compared, it was shown
in a prominent manner that geological maps constructed according to
that scale would be of infinitely greater value both for scientific and
practical purposes than maps constructed at a scale of 1:100000. It
was, therefore, decided to accept the scale of 1:25000 as a basis for all
the maps of the entire State.

The execution of the survey and the construction of the maps on the
prescribed scale was commenced in various portions of the State. First
of all, attention was given to the provinces of Hesse and Hanover,
which, in 1866, had been added to the Kingdom, because they would
form a continuation of the survey already begun of the Harz Mount-
ains and the Thuringian Forest. It then was extended to the former
Duchy of Nassau, the southern portion of the Rhine province and to
the plains of North Germany and to the provinces of Silesia.

The Kingdom of Saxony, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Grand Duchy of
Hesse have since adopted the Prussian plan and have consented to the
construction of a geological map on a scale of 1: 25000.

As regards the organization of the geological survey, it may be stated
that since 1862 geological surveys were made by teachers of mineralogy
at the mining academy at Berlin. The building of this academy con-
tained the geological and mineralogical collections intended both for
instruction and for explorations, and the results of the surveys were
worked out in that building.

On January 1, 1873, the Royal Geological Institute was established,
and on April 8, 1875, received the final statutes, as follows:

SEc. 1. It is the object of the Geological Institute to execute the
geological examinations of the Kingdom of Prussia and to digest the re-
sults in a manner to make them available and useful to science, as well
as to the economic interest of the country.

Sec. 2. In accordance with the above the Geological Institute
will execute the following work: (1) The construction and publication
of a geological map of the entire state, on the basis of the original
surveys of the General Staff, on a scale of 1: 25000. This chart is to
contain a representation of the geological formations, condition of the
soil, and the occurrence of useful stone and minerals, and is to be ac-
companied by descriptive text. (2) The construction of a geological
chart on a basis of 1: 100000. (3) The publication of monographs on
geological or mineralogical objects of special interest. (4) The publi-
cation of essays on geological, paleontological, or montanistic con-
tents, supplementing the geological chart. (5) The collection and
preservation of all documents obtained in the construction of the publi-
cations. All these, together with profiles and other representations
and illustrations, will be combined in the Geological Museum, to which
are to be connected the technological collections of the ‘Museum of
Mining and Metallurgy.” These combined collections will afford a very

H. Mis. 224——9
130 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

complete representation of the geological structure, composition of
soil, mineral wealth, and of the industries of the country based thereon.
(6) The collection and preservation of geological specimens and infor-
mation relating thereto.

Src. 3. The superintendeney of the Geological Institute will be
placed into the hands of two directors appointed by the King, one of
them to be the director of the Royal Mining Academy. The works of
the Geological Institute will be performed, under their direction, by
geologists of the Government and assistants.

Src. 18. The Geological Institute and the Mining Academy are placed
under the Ministry of commerce, industry, and public works. The
director of the mining academy is to conduct the business of the Insti-
tute. He will be assisted by a board of trustees, to be appointed by
the Minister of commerce, industry, and public works, who are obliged
to participate in the organic arrangement and in the determination of
the regular course of instruction.

The library consists of about 36,000 volumes, relating to mining,
smelting, salines, mineralogy, geology, geography, ethnography, pale-
ontology, and scientific explorations. A large portion is represented
by the former mining library of the department.

Its use is intended primarily for the Institute and the Academy, ana
their professors and students, as well as for the other divisions of the
department of public works. The privilege may however be extended
to other persons. Connected with the library is a reading-room, which
is open to the public on all days of the week from 10 A. M. to 2 P. M.,
but is closed during the month of September.

VI.—THE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL.

The Technical High School originated on April 1, 1879, in the uniting
of the Royal Academy for Architects (founded in 1799) with the Tech-
nological Institute (founded in 1821).

Its organization is regulated by a constitutional statute of July 28,
1882. Its object is to afford a higher education in all technical and in-
dustrial branches and to promote the sciences and arts which form part
of technical education.

The Technical High School presents five divisions: (1) architecture ;
(2) civilengineering; (3) machine emgineering and naval architecture ;
(4) chemistry and metallurgy ; (5) general sciences.

The regular professors receive their appointment from the King.

The plan of instruction applies to a yearly term; the students have
the selection of the lectures and of the exercises desired by them.

Admittance is granted to graduates trom Prussian high schools.
Others may be accepted upon the personal decision of the rector as to
their qualification.

Each division is managed by a director, who is assisted by a commit-
tee selected from among the teachers of the respective divisions, while
the rector and the senate supervise the entire high school. :

at
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 131

Each division is complete in itself. It is the duty of the committees
of teachers to oversee the scientific instruction of the students within
their own section. Its president, elected from among their own num-
ber, communicates with the rector and the senate.

The senate consists of the rector, as presiding ofticer, the retired rec-
tor (prorector), the chiefs of the divisions, the chief of the section of
naval architecture, and a number of teachers appointed by the various
committees for the term of two years.

The position of private lecturer may be obtained by adhesion to one
of the existing divisions. The applicant is required to furnish the fol-
lowing documentary evidence: (1) a curriculum vitae; (2) graduation
from a high school (gymnasium or realschule); (3) testimonial of a
tbree-years academic study and proof of the successful performance of
the first technical examination required by the state or of the diploma
examination at some German technical high school, or of the doctor de-
gree of some German university ; (4) proof of a continued three-years
course of scientific or artistic study following the university term; (5)
a manuscript or printed essay on the specialty of the applicant (archi-
tects may replace the essay by plans or by bringing satisfactory proof
of having had charge of some important construction) ; (6) an official
testimonial of character, and in case the applicant is a German, proof
of his having performed his military duties. All the above conditions
having been complied with to the satisfaction of the division, the appli-
cant is required to hold one lecture and to subject himself to an exami-
nation.

The corps of teachers at present consists of fifty-seven professors
and twenty-four private teachers.

The Mineralogical Institute.—In addition to the lecture-rooms the Insti-
tute comprises: (1) The laboratory for crystallographic-physical, and
chemico-mineralogical experiments; (2) a mineralogical collection ; (3)
a geological collection; (4) the mineralogical museum.

The lectures combine a course for the practical determination of min-
erals by microchemical tests and by blow-pipe, determinations of rocks,
and instructions for geological surveying.

The public museum, comprising two halls, contains: (1) The system-
atic mineralogical collection (Tamnan); (2) a mineralogic-technical
collection ; and (3) the geoiogical collection.

The geological room contains a collection from the Gotthard Tun.
nel, together with geological profile of the Gotthard in the plane of the
axis of the tunnel; projection, 1:2000; a geological collection arranged
according to formations.

The Laboratory for Inorganic Chemistry.—The laboratory has room for
Sixty-six operators; they occupy two larger and two smaller halls.
Separate rooms are provided for special work.

An auditory of one hundred and seventy seats is situated within the
middle section; it connects with rooms for preparation and collections.
132 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The Laboratory of Organic Chemistry.—Erected by Prof. A. Baeyer in
1860, with eighteen students as part of the former Technical Academy.
It was enlarged to forty places on occassion of the re-construction of the
Technical High School. It is used by students of the fifth and sixth
terms. The studies comprise analytical and preparative exercises in
the field of organic chemistry; facilities are given for independent
researches.

The Metallurgical Laboratory.—The institute is the most recent of the
laboratories of the Technical High School. In addition to the lecture
rooms, and the room for the instruction of drawing and projecting, of
smelting works, ete., the Laboratory comprises: (1) the metallurgical
laboratory ; (2) the assaying laboratory, and the metallurgical collec-
tion.

The assay laboratory of sixteen seats, and separated from the assay
room by a glass door, occupies a separate room. It is provided with
all necessary apparatus, consisting of muffles, wind furnaces of various
sizes, tables, and quenching troughs, ete.

A forge iia some storage rooms eoruplere the facilities of the labor-
atory.

The Laboratory confines itself to the examination of metals, flux,
smelting products, fuel; it pays special attention to gas analysis in its
relation to generator gases, noxious gases, etc.; to electrolysis; to the
examination and production of fire-proof articles.

The Laboratory of Technical Chemistry.—Established in 1884, the Lab-
oratory occupies rooms on the second floor for an auditory and chemico-
technological collection consisting principally of raw materials of inter-
est to the chemical industry, especially those employed in ceramics,
glass manufactory, textile industry, manufactory of sugar, also inter-
mixtures, and finished articles.

The Photo-chemical Laboratory.—It was established in 1864 as part of
the instructions of the Technological Institute; photographic experi-
ments were added in 1865, experiments with intermittent light in 1870,
spectral analysis in 1873, lectures on electric-lighting in 1881, and lect-
ures on interior application of electric light in 1886. The object of the
Laboratory has received due consideration in the re-organization of the
Technical High School.

The Royal Mechanico-technical Institute.—The object of the Institute
is to make official tests of materials required in technics, with the ex-
ception of building materials, and to undertake scientific examinations
in that direction. It was established in 1871, and in 1878 received its
present organization, which provides for the general supervision of this
and of its connection with and relation to other similar establishments
by the royal commission for the supervision of the technical experi-
mental institutes.

The Institute comprises three divisions, of which the first is to ex-
periment on finished articles of metals, belts, ropes, chains, woods,
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 133

machinery, etc., while the second division has to test on the principle
of Wohler-Spangenberg duration experiments, and the third is confined
to the official testing of paper. A mechanical workshop has been
placed under the charge of the second superintendent.

The Institute owns two excellent machines for the testing of finished
articles, having a power of 100,000 and 50,000 kilograms (system Wer-
der and Marten’s), six smaller machines for the same purpose, eleven
machines for duration tests, photographic, microscopic, ete., apparatus.

The Royal Testing Station of Building Materials.—This was founded on
March 1, 1871, in connection with the Technical High School; it decides
as to the quality of cements and other building material furnished to
the Government. The station owns apparatus for the testing of dura-
bility and other physical properties of burnt and unburnt artificial
stone, natural stone, cement, plaster, lime, clay pipes, and all other
building material.

The hydraulic press of the station, of 140,000 kilograms (308,646
pounds) pressure, permits the test of bodies (including pillars of brick
or natural stone) of 1 meter height and of 55 by 55°™ diameter. Tests
can be made both as to the stone and to the binding material. .

A 20-fold lever is employed in testing the resistance of cylindrical
bodies, and a 30-fold lever is used in the testing of elasticity of roofing
paper and of the adhesiveness of mortar.

Tests of clay pipes are made by horizontal pressure of from 20 to 30
atmospheres to 1 to 3 meters internal diameter.

The tests of cement are made in accordance with the rulings of No-
vember 12, 1878, of the Ministry of commerce, industry, and public
works.

With regard to adhesiveness of cement and cement mortar, a 50-fold
normal lever apparatus is used with sample piece of 59 centimeters at
the point of rupture; in pressure tests and break tests the hydraulic
press, a 500-fold lever and a 20-fold lever are employed.

With regard to fineness of grain, sieves of from 600, 900, and 5,000
“meshes to the square centimeter are employed. In ail cement tests the
officially introduced normal sand alone finds employment.

A horizontal disk of emery, operated by a gas-motor, which also oper-
ates a diamond plane machine used in finishing the bodies for pressure
tests, is employed in the experiments as to the wear of the building ma-
terials.

VIII.—OTHER SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL INSTITUTES.

The Astro-physical Observatory.—Until the first quarter of the present
century astronomy employed itself almost exclusively with the discovery

ry
134 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

of mechanics of the heavens; and the physical conditions of the stars
received but occasional, and more accidental than systematic, attention
from a few astronomers. Astro-physies had not fully developed itself as
a branch of astronomy. When, then, later, more attention was given to
certain changes on the surface of the sun and to other phenomena, the
observations were restricted to the use of such apparatus as was then
found in a well-equipped observatory, and not much difficulty was expe-
rienced in combining new requirements with the existing apparatus. It
was not until the more extending field of study brought physical and —
chemical examinations in contact with the astronomical, and more es-
pecially since theapplication ofthe spectral analysis upon the astro-phys-
ical investigations proved the most powerful means for the discovery of
the substances of which the heavenly bodies are composed, and since
photography had begun to be employed in fixing certain events observed
in the skies, it was not until then that the needs of separate establish-
ments was fully recognized, equipped with suitable instruments not re-
quired by observatories of the older kind. Such an establishment is
now found in the Astro-physical Observatory at Potsdam.

As early as 1860 it was suggested to establish, in the vicinity of Berlin,
an Observatory for the physical examination of the sun. The conditions
however were then not favorable, and it was not until 1871 that the
first steps were taken towards the realization of the project. The Crown
Prince, whose attention had been called to the effort by Prof. D. Schell-
bach, managed to have propositions invited with regard to the subject
from the director of the Berlin Observatory to which it was planned to
connect the proposed solar observatory. To this the director responded
on September 30, 1871, by submitting a memorial. It was proposed to
establish an observatory in the vicinity of Berlin well-equipped for the
direct, spectroscopic, and photographie investigation of the surface of
the sun, this observatory at the same time to be the central station for
magnetic and meteorological observations.

The Academy of Sciences, at the request of the Government, on April
29, 1872, while recognizing the interest of the subject, objected to the
execution of the proposition from the stand-point that the scientific re-
quirements would demand the establishment of two institutes, of which
one should be devoted to astro-physiecs and the other to tellurian phys-
ics; it opposed an organic combination of the two on the ground that
its scope would be too large for a successful administration. In this
case however the observations of the sun would have to form but a
part of the labors of the astro-physical institute.

The Minister of Education then called together a special commission
under the presidency of Privy Counsellor E. du Bois-Reymond, which,
in accordance with the academic consideration, recommended at first
the establishment of an astrophysical observatory, with the proviso,
however, that, in the case of uncertainty of the early erection of a tel-
lurian observatory, such magnetic observations should be provided for
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 135

which are of essential interest in the study of the sun’s activity. A
plan was prepared with regard to the establishment, organization, and
equipment of the observatory, which was accepted by the Royal Gov-
ernment and sanctioned by legislative action of 187574.

The cost of the building for astrophysical observations was 874,000
mark ($218,500). ‘

The budget for the Observatory is 71,600 mark ($17,900), of which
42,000 ($10,500) are paid out for salaries and compensation.

The astro-physical institute is not an establishment for teaching, but
is intended exclusively for the scientific investigation of this new branch
of astronomy. Since the short existence of the Observatory many scien-
tists have taken part in its works, most especially as they relate to
spectral analysis and photography.

The Observatory possesses the following larger telescopes:

One large refractor of 29.8 centimeters (113? inches) aperture and 5.4
meters focus. Objective by Schréder, mountings by A. Repsold, Ham-
burg. Placed in the central cupola. Refractor by Grubb of Dublin,
aperture 20 centimeters (7§ inches), focus 3.2 meters; in place in the
west cupola. <A refractor by Steinheil, 13.5 centimeters aperture and
2.2 focus; placed in the east cupola. Photo-heliograph and mount-
ings by Repsold, objective by Steinheil, aperture 16 centimeters and
focus 4 meters; placed in the southern addition to the main building.
Comet-seeker by Reinfelder and Hertel.

The observatory possesses a large number of spectral apparatus,
among them one large by Schroder, for observations of the sun, and
one spectroscope by the same. John Browning furnished two spectro-
scopes for observations of the stars and for solar protuberances, re-
spectively. Other spectroscopes emanate from the shops of Hilger,
London; Schmidt & Hiensch, Berlin ; Repsold, Hamburg; Topper,
Potsdam. In connection with the prism apparatus some finely gradu-
ated grates of glass and metal for the representation of grate spectra
may be mentioned ; among these are some excellent ones by Wanschaff,
Berlin.

In addition to the larger apparatus for photographie work the equip-
ment for laboratory work is excellent. For photometric representa-
tions of spectral analysis a large Zollner photometer by Wanschaff and
several smaller photometers are employed.

The Geodetic Institute—The purpose of the Institute is the improve-
ment of geodesy by scientific investigations. At the time of its estab-
lishment it was also intrusted with the Prussian portion of the European
Geodetic Survey ; in fact that undertaking was the cause of the estab-
lishment of the institute. The Kuropean Geodetic Survey developed
itself out of the Middle European Survey. In 1862, at the suggestion
of Lieutenant- General Baeyer—the collaborator of Bessels in the East-
ern Prussian Geodetic Survey and chief of the trigonometrical division
136 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

of the general staff of the Army—a convention took place of delegates
of most of the German States, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark,
Sweden, Norway, etc., for the Geodetic Survey of the represented
States. 3

The Institute is divided into four sections, each of which has a chief,
one regular and one temporary assistant. The field work of the sum-
mer is computed during the winter and published.

During Baeyer’s administration, from 1869 to his death, September
10, 1885, the Institute measured the longitude of sixty-three places,
obtained longitudinal differences of twenty-one places, and completed
the astronomical work of twenty-seven stations of the trigonometrical
system. The triangles were completed by elaborate work along the
Rhine from Belgium to Switzerland and from the Middelrhein through
Thuringia to Berlin, etc., and provided with two new base lines, ob-
tained by means of measurements with a platin-iridium apparatus by
Brunner at Paris. Pendulum observations were made at thirteen
places, older ones corrected, new levels obtained from Swinemiinde to
Constanz and to the frontier of the Netherlands and of the mean water
height of the Baltic Sea. The greater portion of the work has already
been published.

The Museum of Ethnography.—sSince the middle of the present century
ethnology and anthropology have begun to take definite shape as a
science with well-pronounced objects and purposes.

Of the exotic material which reached Europe as a result of the discov-
eries of, and scientific journeys in foreign continents the objects which
could be incorporated in natural history collections found their proper
places in the zoological or botanical museums, while the objects relat-
ing to man did not have any relation to the special studies of the
times, and they therefore became more the subject of curiosity and
wonder than of earnest consideration.

These objects generally received a place in the section of foreign
curiosities in most the cabinets enjoying a princely protection, and
these sections followed the movement of their respective museums.

Thus in Berlin, where from the days of the colonial policy of the
Great Elector an interest had continued in that direction, and where
the “ Silver Chamber” of the Royal Castle contained many ethnological
articles, which, in the union of the old and the new museum were trans-
ferred under the designation of “ Ethnographic division. ”

In the new Museum one hall contained the pre-historic collections of
Prussia, while three other halls contained everything of an ethnolog-
ical character which had found its way thither by donation or purchase.
The same arrangement existed in London, Copenhagen, Lyons, Munich,
Gottingen, Wien, ete.

In the middle of the present century however, when anthropological
and ethnological studies experienced that powerful impulse which has
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 137

produced their rapid development and when the movement originated
in Engiand and France was transferred to Germany, it soon became
apparent that the space devoted to these collections demanded an im-
mediate enlargement.

Deliberations to that effect commenced in 1873 and continued during
the years 1873-1876, and finally, in 1880 resulted in the accomplish-
ment of the desire for an independent ethnographical museum.

The building was finished in the spring of 1886, at a cost of 2,000,000
mark ($500,000).

The Standard Measures Commission.—Article 18 of the law of August
17, 1868, relating to weights and measures within the North German
Confederation provides for the establishment of a standard measures
commission, with its seat at Berlin and duties specitied as follows :

‘“* A standard measures commission is to be appointed by the Confed-
eration. The same is to be located at Berlin. It is the duty of the
commission to see that all the measures within the Confederation
are conducted on a uniform system. It has to prepare the standard
and to communicate the same to all measure bureaus throughout the
Confederation, and for that reason it is to be equipped with all neces-
sary apparatus and instruments. The standard measures commission
has to issue orders and prescriptions with regard to material, form,
designation, and other conditions of weights and measures, and to de-
termine the limit of errors. It decides on the kind of scales to be used
in public and for special industrial purposes, and determines their ac-
curacy. It is to issue all necessary prescriptions and formulas for the
manufacture of weights and measures and to test the accuracy of any
articles which may be offered for the purpose. The standard measures
commission has to regulate the fees to be exacted by the measuring
establishments, and in fact the entire technics of weights and measures.

‘* All bureaus of measures within the North German Confederation,
in addition to the local stamp, have to use the mark of the standard
measures commission which will be furnished for the purpose.

‘The standard weights and measures are to be preserved after true
and attested copies have been made of them.”

Article 22 of the law providing for the introduction of the new
weights and measures, on and after January 1, 1870, called for the
immediate formation of the conference in order to enable the bureau
of measures to have the necessary facilities and standards in time for the
testing and approving of any new weights and measures brought
before them.

As a result of the conference metrical regulations were established on
July 16, 1869; and on July 21, 1869, the business instructions and the
composition and organization of the standard measures commission
were completed.

According to the rules adopted, the standard measures commission
was to consist of the director, assisted by the regular force required
138 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

for the business affairs of the commission, and of attached members
to be called in for conference; their number is to correspond to the
demand. They are recommended for appointment of five years by the
director and confirmed by the chancellor of the Empire. Their office is
an honorary one, but members, non-residents of Berlin, are refunded
expenses incurred on occasion of official business conferences at Berlin.
All projects relating to the entire system of measures are to be consid-
ered in full session.

The business instructions provide that the director be assisted by two
experienced technicians, well versed with gauging; further, some per-
son or persons skilled in making mathematical computations or physical
examinations, a secretary, a messenger, and the required number of
clerks and copyists.

The scientific publications of the commission relate to measurements,
weighings, barometric, thermometric, and areometric examinations,
to which are added experiments on alloys, inflammability of petro-
leum, ete.

The commission employs the following apparatus: universal com-
parator, by A. Repsold Sons, at Hamburg; longitudinal comparator, by
A. Repsold Sons, at Hamburg; universal cathetometer (vertical, trans-
versal, and longitudinal comparator), by C. Bamberg, at Berlin; kilo-
gram scale, within hermetical glass bell, by P. Stiickrath, at Berlin;
scale of 100 grams by P. Stiickrath; seales of 500 milligrams, by P.
Stiickrath; standard barometer and manometer, with vertical compar-
ator; thermometers, and apparatus for the testing of air thermometers,
by Fuess.

In addition to the above the commission possesses a number of ap-
paratus and instruments, consisting of comparators, scales, barometers,
barographs, thermometers, alcoholometers, areometers, hollow meas-
ures, gas-meters, cubic apparatus, petroleum tester, crucibles and fur-
nace for alloy, measuring-scales of platinum, brass, crystal, iron, and
aluminium.

The more delicate apparatus are mounted in rooms having double
walls of zine, the intervening space of which is tested by gas for the
preservation of a constant temperature. They are lighted by Siemens’s
regenerative shallow burners, the radiation of which is prevented by
cloaks of water, while the light is carried through a hollow lens filled
with a solution of alum and is retlected by mirrors upon the scales to be
read. The instruments have been isolated by placing them upon pillars
extending in wells to a depth of 8 meters.

The Hydrographic Office of the Imperial Admiralty.—On December 18,
1853, Professor Berghaus suggested to Prince Adalbert, of Prussia, the
establishment of a hydrographic office. The. plan was accepted, but
its execution delayed on account of insufficient funds. The desirability
and necessity of such an establishment becoming more urgent, a Direc-

a
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 139

tion of Navigation was established on June 28, 1854, to form a technical
division of the naval office at Danzig. On account of insufficient force
the institute had to limit its operations to the needs of the war navy.

The Direction of Navigation at Danzig was dissolved on September
25, 1861, and in its place a ‘* Hydrographic Bureau” was established to
form a section of Division X of the Ministry of Navy. Its functions re-
mained unchanged, and in addition it was commissioned with the current
work of sea charts and with the collecting and tabulating of nautical
informations, which, between the years 1863 and 1868, were furnished to
the vessels of the war navy. In order to extend its usefulness to the
mercantile marine these informations were published, since 1869, under
the title of ‘‘ Nachrichten fiir Seefahrer,” at first as additions to the
‘¢ Preussisches Handelsblatt” and since 1870 as additions tothe“ Marine
Verordnungs- Blatt.” |

The demands on the Hydrographic Office increased with the rapid
increase of the war navy, until it became unable to do all the work
expected of it. In January, 1874, therefore, it was enlarged and
appointed a separate division of the Admiralty, with the following per-
sonnel :

One full captain (or admiral), in charge; two chiefs of division, five
section chiefs (including the chief of the Wilhelmshaven Observatory),
five assistants, one librarian, and a number of draughtsmen, engravers,
and mechanics.

For the business administration the following clerical foree was ap-
pointed: Two chiefs of bureaus, two registrars, two secretaries of chan-
celry, and the required subordinates.

The Hydrographic Office in first line serves the interests of the im
perial navy, but its advantages are extended to the mercantile navy as
far as possible.

A survey of the entire territory of the North and Baltic Seas was
begun in 1867 and completed in 1879; from 1880 to 1884 test measure-
ments were made, scientific experiments instituted along the German
coasts, and the knowledge of the physical conditions of the native seas
improved.

The Central Telegraph Bureau and the Telephone Service.—With regard
to its importance in the telegraphic intercourse the Bureau at Berlin
occupies the first place among the telegraphic stations of the Empire.
It is attached to the second division of the Imperial Post-oftice Depart
ment and serves as center of the telegraphic and pneumatic intercourse
for Berlin.

A few figures will exhibit the importance of the establishment and
afford an illustration of its operations.

The service of the Central Bureau gives employment to four hundred
and ninety-two officials and one hundred and twenty-eight subordinates.

The telegraphing business requires the application of fifty-four type
apparatus, Hughes’s construction, one hundred and seventy-eight Morse
140 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

apparatus, and fifty-one apparatus of a peculiar construction. Two
hundred and eighty-two wires center at Berlin; of these fifty-six are
underground and serve the larger circuit, thirty-seven, seventy, and
twenty-eight overhead wires are used for foreign, the larger and smaller
domestic circuits, respectively, while fifty-six underground wires accom-
modate the city trade. Within the city limits all wires, with the ex:
ception of those used in telephoning, are placed underground.

One hundred and twenty-four batteries, representing 7,350 elements,
together with eight batteries for special purposes representing 290 ele-
ments, are employed in the central office.

The Berlin service comprises 351.8 kilometers (218.6 miles) of lines,
with 2,428.5 kilometers (1,509 miles) of wire; the pneumatic service
comprises 40.5 kilometers ‘25 miles’ of lines. with 46.35 kilometers (29
miles) of tubes.

The pneumatic line commences at the Central Telegrap.a Bureau,
radiates in six principal directions, and together with the branch lines
forms connection with thirty-three pneu matie offices. Each line runs one
train every fifteen minutes in either direction, with a velocity of 1,000
meters (5281 feet) per minute. The pressure and vacuum are produced
at eight stations, each of which is provided witha double set of en-
gines of a total force of 135 horse-power. Forty-four compartments of a
total capacity of 772 cubic meters serve to hold the compressed air and
the air ejected by the tubes. Each line controls a special series of sig-
nals.

The telephone service was established in 1881. At the beginning
two central offices were established. Each of these received two switch-
boards for fifty plugs each. The great advantages of immediate personal
communication and the extraordinary simplicity of the arrangement
became so apparent that this mode of communication soon came into
general use. The increase is best illustrated by stating that from the
end of November, 1881, to June, 1886, the number of participants had
increased from 442 to 5,194, while the line had increased from 1,319
to 10,477 kilometers (819 to 6,510 miles.)

In order to enable the subscribers to communicate with their own
homes or places of business from more distant parts and also to throw
the service open to general utility, public stations were established
which could be used by any one so desirous upon the payment of a small
fee. At present there are twelve such stations.

The constant increase in the number of telephones rendered it desira-
ble to extend the telephonic service beyond the city limits. The prog-
ress made in this field of technic, especially in the construction of long-
distance microphones, rendered it practicable to establish, in November,
1882, connection between Berlin and Charlottenburg; in May, 1883, it
was extended to Berlin and Potsdam; in December 1883 connection was
made between the exchanges of Berlin and Magdeburg; in the years
1884 and 1885 with the surburban places: Westend, Képenick, Steg-
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 141

litz, Rixdorf, Gross Lichterfelde, Weissensee, Pankow, Rummelsburg,
Friedenau, and Griinau.

The greatest distance of 347 kilometers (215 miles) was accomplished
between Berlin and Hanover, and a large number is projected between
Berlin and Halle, Breslau, Leipzig, Hamburg, etc.

The total cost of construction of the telephone service in Berlin to
and including the year 188485 has been about 2,000,000 mark ($500,-
000). Large amounts are required for the support and changes of
lines and for their maintenance and operation.

Until the beginning of the year 1886 the conduct and supervision of
the telephone service was inthe hands of the Central Telegraph Bureau ;
the extent and growing demand however made it desirable to establish
the service on an independent basis with a rank of an office of the first
class. The service, at present employs two hundred and seventy-five
regular officials with a corresponding number of subordinates.

The principal supervision of the erection of buildings for the tele-
phonic service and of its administration, belongs to the Imperial Post-
Office Department at Berlin, which has established a special division
for the purpose. This is in charge of a councilor of post assisted by a
telegraph inspector and ten officials for the business affairs of the bureau.
To these, ten officials have been added who are employed in technical
affairs, that is, in the preparation of plans and execution of the necessary
building and changes in the lines and who have charge of a large number
of laborers. And all decisions in telephonic affairs are rendered by tbis
second division of the imperial post-office department.

The Telegraph Workshop, etc.—The duties of the telegraph apparatus
workshop comprise: (1) The manufacture of apparatus and parts of
such, as well as of the materials and tools required ; (2) the changes and
repairs to existing apparatus; (3) the making of contracts for the
manufacture of apparatus and their parts, tools, materials, ete.; (4) the
testing of apparatus, tools, materiais, or changes or repairs made at
private shops; (5) the examination of the bills; (6) the care and stor:
age of apparatus and their parts; (7) the transmission of apparatus
and their parts; (8) the sale of condemned material; (9) the keeping
of accounts with regard to tools, apparatus, and their parts, materials
and equipment; (10) the keeping of a list of applicants for mechanical
positions; (11) the employment of assistant mechanics appointed by
the post-office department.

The telegraph workshop is therefore divided into three branches,
viz: (a) the bureau, (b) the mechanical work shop, (c) the carpenter
shop and shipping office.

The bureau gives employment to one official of the first class, and three
of the second, while the mechanical workshop employs one official of the
first class who supervises the force, consisting of twenty mechanics.

Each mechanic has a separate and completely equipped place assigned
within the shop.
142 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The cable examination-room serves in the first line for continued
measurements of the underground lines of Berlin, which are made once
a week; it is furthermore used for the accurate measurements and ex-
periments with new batteries, apparatus, and switches, ete. The cur-
rents of the two underground cables, Beriin and Thorn and Berlin and
Dresden, are measured by the aid of two self-registering apparatus lo-
cated in the testing-room.

The use of underground cables made it desirable to test their elec-
trical properties at regular, short intervals by measuring the resistance
of the copper wire, the isolating resistance, ete., of the insulating mate-
rial, etc. This had the effect of giving full information of the state of
the cable at all times; any mechanical injury was at once indicated, and
could be repaired without delay. These regular measurements offered
an opportunity for the instruction to a large number of officials located
throughout the Empire, thus enabling them to be of service in case of
emergency.

The Postal Museum.—The collections of the postal museum are located
on the ground floor of the monumental building of the central Post-
Office Department of the German Empire.

The Postmaster-General, soon after entering upon his duties, endeav-
ored to interest the official bureaus, private individuals, artists, scien-
tists, ete., in his ideas, and succeeded therein in such a measure that at
the beginning of the present decade already a pretty complete repre-
sentation from the beginning of communication to the present days, was
presented in the collections of the postal museum.

In the mean time, by the incorporation, in 1876, of the telegraphy
with the post, all the apparatus, models, materials, etc., collected by
the former general director of telegraphy were transferred to the older
sister establishment, and this collection being very rich and complete,
the telegraph division of the postal bureau offers to the technician and
to the physical science a rich source for earnest study, and especially
a true historical picture of the development of the telegraph.

The postal division, of course, is still more extended, for the history
of communication is as old as man himself. In the museums are rep-
resented the Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Hebrews, and other people
of antiquity; Egyptian hieroglyphs, papyrus with hieratic writing, and
Niniveh writing upon terra-cotta plates are the proofs which those
people offer. The little plates of the Greeks and Romans which were
laid before the oracle of Dodons, the skytale written upon parchment,
the well executed imitations of the rare “ tabelle duplices et trip-
lices” and the ** Diptyches,” distributed by the Roman consuls upon the
commencement of their terms of office, conclude the antiquity. The
gradual development of more regulated forms of later periods, inchud-
ing the Middie Ages, are illustrated by precious samples of writings
emanating from the contemplative quiet of the monasteries, representa-

tions of boats, wagons and teams, streets, ships, ete., etc., while the
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 143

- modern cosmopolitan character of the “ post” is represented by natural
models of all peoples and countries. Everything is represented, from
the most primitive row-boat to the highly elegant steamer, from the
“dog post” to the six-horse postal carriage, railway post, pigeon post,
field post, ete. Numerous illustrations of the homes of the post in all
zones, and models of the stately buildings of modern times, complete
the panorama.

IX.—THE ROYAL LIBRARY.

The establishment of a public library dates back to the year 1661, and
is owing to the Grand Elector who ordered the collection of the frag-
ments of the monasterial libraries and had them combined with the
library of the castle, forming a collection comprising 1,618 European
and Oriental manuscripts and 20,600 printed works, representing about
90,000 volumes. Frederick I added to it the purchased Spanheim col-
lection of books, and Frederick II the library and collection of charts of
Colonel Quintus Icilius and other valuable purchases. The present
building was erected in the years 1774-1780 by order of Frederick the
Great; the books were transferred to it in 1782, and the reading-room
was opened in 1784.

According to the report of the director, in 1836, the library contained
about 200,000 printed volumes, and 4,611 manuscripts. The growth of
the library was such, that toward the end of the reign of Frederick
William III, the lower floor of the building—used for the storage of
books, had to be applied to the use of exposition. It was re-modelled
during the years 1840 to 1842, and divided into two stories. The burn-
ing in 1843, of the Royal Opera House, immediately opposite the library,
called attention to the importance of fire-proofing the building, the
provision of iron stairways, doors, etc., and of suitable water reservoirs.

The extraordinary increase of the collections—amounting at present
(1886) to 800,000 volumes, and 20,000 manuscripts, rendered it necessary
to divide the elevation of the stories byemeans of iron ceilings, and to
use a portion of the attic for the storage of books.

The budget for 188687 allowed 96,000 mark ($24,000) for the pur-
chase of books, manuscripts, journals, music, charts, and illustrations,
and for the necessary expense for the binding of books.

X.—THE ROYAL BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING.

In 1850, when the Finance Department had under advisement the best
method for preventing the manufacture of counterfeit money, a propo-
sition was made to have all paper money and securities made at some
central establishment. On April 30, 1851, a royal decree authorized
the establishment of a bureau for the manufacture of paper money,
bonds, and other securities, and a building was purchased for the put-
pose at a cost of 5,380 thaler ($4,135).
144 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

In 1852, the establishment commenced operations with a personnel
consisting of four officials, two messengers, and fifteen laborers. At
present nine hundred persons are employed.

On August 1, 1852, the manufacture of postage stamps, stamped en-
velopes,; newspaper wrappers, which until then had been made by pri-
vate contract, was given to the bureau together with all the necessary
machines and implements for the manufacture of the same, which had
been the property of the Post-Office Department.

At the close of the year 1860, when the Royal Lithographing Institute
became combined with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, it was
found necessary to employ copper engraving with photographie and gal-
vanoplastic processes in engraving of charts instead of lithography,
and this change again was productive of an enlargement of the office
together with a corresponding increase in machinery.

A great source of revenue and profit was offered in the enormous sup-
ply of postage stamps and cards required by the totally unexpected de-
velopment of the postal service. This kind of work had formerly been
performed by the printing office of Decker, which by decree of May 23,
1877, had been purchased by the German Government for the sum of
6,780,000 mark ($1,695,000) and had been placed under the jurisdiction
of the Postmaster-General.

By law of May 15, 1879, the Prussian Bureau of Engraving was pur-
chased by the Imperial Government for a consideration of 3,573,000
mark ($893,250) and consolidated with the printing establishment under
the name, “ Royal Bureau of Engraving and Printing.”

The amalgamation took place at once from a business point of view,
the general supervision remaining in the hands of the chief of the Ger-
man post and telegraph administration, in whose bureau a separate
division was established under the name “ Director of the Royal Bureau
of Engraving and Printing.”

In order to accommodate the increased force of the combined offices,
the adjacent buildings were purchased in May, 1879, for the sum of
517,500 mark ($129,375); the téaring down of the old buildings began
at once and in the autumn of 1881 the new building was ready for
occupation.

The bureau at present employs ninety-five artists and regular mechan-
ies, and seven hundred and seventy laborers (male and female), appren-
tices, and porters.

The work of the bureau increases from year to year although a great
deal of it, not involving money or bonds, is now turned over to private
industries.

At present the ordinary work required by the Government and bu-
reaus represents about 120,000,000 sheets, of which the Imperial Post
and Telegraph Administration uses about 13,000,000 sheets and about
60,000,000 cards, independent of the large amount of work ordered from
private firms.
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS.*

BY G. W. DE TUNZELMANN, B. SC.

H. Hertz has been engaged for some time past in a series of researches
on electrical oscillations, which have led to results of very exceptional
importance, and as these results throw considerable light on the nature
of electrical action, it will be of interest to have a connected account
of the investigations, to which I therefore propose to devote a short
series of papers.

In Hertz’s first paper on the subject, viz, *‘On Very Rapid Electrical
Oscillations” (Wiedemann’s Annalen, 1887, vol. XXxI, page 421), he
refers to a paper by Colley, ‘‘On Some New Methods for Observing
Electrical Oscillations, with Applications” (ibid., vol. XxvI, page 432),
who calls attention to the fact that Sir William Thompson in 1853,
showed the possibility of producing electrical oscillations by the dis-
charge of a charged conductor, and gives references to all the investiga-
tions in the same direction which were kuown to him.t

146 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

According to these investigations, the electrical oscillations produced
in an open circuit by means of an induction coil are measured by ten
thousandths of a second, while in the case of the oscillatory discharge
of a Leyden jar they are about a hundred times as rapid, as was shown
by Feddersen.

According to theory, still more rapid oscillations should be possible
in an open circuit of wire of good conducting material, provided its ends
are not connected with conductors of any considerable capacity ; but it
is not possible to determine from theory whether measurable oseilla-
tions are actually produced. Some observations of Hertz’s led him to
believe that under certain circumstances oscillations of this kind were
produced, and his researches show that this is so, and that the oscilla-
tions are about a hundred times as rapid as those observed by Fedder-
sen; so that their periods are measured by hundred millionths of a
second, and they therefore occupy a position intermediate between
acoustic and luminous vibrations.

Preliminary Experiments.—It is known that if in the secondary circuit
of an induction coil there be inserted, in addition to the ordinary air
space, across which sparks pass, a Riess spark micrometer, with its
poles joined by a long wire, the discharge will pass across the air space
of the micrometer in preference to following the path of least resistance
through the wire, provided this air space does not exceed a certain
limit, and it is upon this principle that lightning protectors for tele-
graph lines are constructed. It might be expected that the sparks
could he made to disappear by diminishing the length and resistance
of the connecting wire; but Hertz finds that though the length of the
sparks can be diminished in this way, it is almost impossible to get rid
of them entirely, and they can still be observed when the balls of the
microineter are connected by a thick copper wire only a few centimeters
in length.

This shows that there must be variations in the potential measure-
able in hundredths of a volt in a portion of the circuit only a few centi-
meters in length, and it also gives an indirect proof of the enormous
rapidity of the discharge, for the difference of potential between the
micrometer knobs can only be due to self-induction in the connecting
wire. Now the time occupied by variations in the potential of one of
the knobs must be of the same order as that in which these variations
can be transmitted through a short length of a good conductor to the
second knob. The resistance of the wire connecting the knobs is found
to be without sensible effect on the results.

In Fig. 1, A is an induction coil and 6 a discharge. The wire con-
necting the knobs 1 and 2 of the spark micrometer
M, consists of a rectangle, half a meter in length,
of copper wire 2 millimeters in diameter. This rect-
angle is connected with the secondary circuit of the
coil in the manner shown in the diagram; and when
the coil is in action, sparks—sometimes several
millimeters in length—are seen to pass between the
knobs 1 and 2, showing that there are violent elec-
trical oscillations, not only in the secondary circuit
itself, but in any conductor in contact with it. This
experiment shows even more clearly than the previ-
ous one that the rapidity of the oscillations is com-
parable with the velocity of transmission of electrical
disturbances through the copper wire, which, ac-
cording to all the evidence at our disposal, is nearly Fis. 1.
equal to the velocity of light.

In order to obtain micrometer sparks some millimeters in length, a
powerful induction coil is required, and the one used by Hertz was 52
centimeters in length and 20 centimeters in diameter, provided with a
mercury contact breaker, and excited by six large Bunsen cells. The
discharger terminals consisted of brass knobs 3 centimeters in diame-
ter. The experiments showed that the phenomenon depends to a very
great extent on the nature of the sparks at the discharger, the micro-
meter sparks being found to be much weaker when the discharge in
the secondary circuit took place between two points, or between a point
and a plate, than when knobs were used. The micrometer sparks were
also found to be greatly enfeebled when the secondary discharge took
place in a rarified gas, and also when the sparks in the secondary were
less than half a centimeter in length, while on the other hand, if they
exceeded 14 centimeters the sparks could no longer be observed be-
tween the micrometer knobs. The length of secondary spark which
was found to give the best results, and which was therefore employed
in the further observations, was about three-quaiters of a centimeter.

Very slight differences in the nature of the secondary sparks were
found to have great effect on those at the micrometer, and Hertz states
that after some practice he was able to determine at once from the
sound and appearance of the secondary spark whether it was of a kind
to give the most powerful effects at the micrometer. The sparks which
gave the best results were of a brilliant white color, only slightly
jagged, and accompanied by a sharp crack.

The influence of the spark is readily, shown by increasing the distance
between the discharger knobs beyond the striking distance, when the
micrometer sparks disappear entirely, although the variations of po-
tential are now greater than before. The length of the micrometer cir-
cuit has naturally an important influence on the length of the spark, as

148 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

the greater its length the greater will be the retardation of the electrical
wave in its passage through it from one knob of the micrometer to the
other.

The material, the resistance, and the diameter, of the wire of which
the micrometer circuit is formed, have very little influence on the spark.
The potential variations can not therefore be due to the resistance, and
this was to be expected, for the rate of propagation of an electrical dis-
turbance along a conductor depends mainly on its capacity. and co-effi-
cient of self-induction, and only to a very small extent on its resistance.
The length of the wire connecting the micrometer circuit with the
secondary circuit of the coil is also found to have very little influence,
provided it does not exceed a few meters in length. The electrical dis-
turbances must therefore traverse it without undergoing any appreciable
change. The position of the point of the micrometer circuit which is
joined to the secondary circuit, is on the other hand of the greatest
importance, as would be expected, for if the point is placed symmetric-
ally with respect to the two micrometer knobs the variations of poten-
tial will reach the latter in the same phase, and there will be no effect,
as is verified by observation. If the two branches ot the micrometer
circuit on each side of the point of contact of the connection with the
secondary are not symmetrical, the spark can not be made to disappear

entirely ; but a minimum effect is obtained when the point of contact is”

about half-way between the micrometer knobs. This point may be
called the null point.

Fig. 2 shows the arrangement employed, e being the null point & the
rectangular circuit, Sach is 125 centimeters long
by 80 centimeters broad. When the point of con-
tact is at a or b, sparks of from 35 to 4 millimeters
in length are observed, when it is at e no sparks
are seen, but they can be made to re-appear by
shifting the point of contact a few centimeters to
the right or left of the null point. It should be
noted that sparks only a few hundredths of a milli-
meter in length can be observed. If when the
point of contact is at e another conductor is placed
in contact with one of the micrometer knobs the
sparks re-appear,

Now the addition of this conductor can not pro-
duce any alteration in the time taken by the dis-
turbances proceeding from e to reach the knobs,
and therefore the phenomenon can not be due simply to single waves
in the directions ca and db respectively, but must be due to repeated re-
flection of the waves until a condition of stationary vibration is attained,
and the addition of the conductor to one of the knobs must diminish or
prevent the reflection of the waves from that terminal. It must be as-
sumed then, that definite oscillations are set up in the micrometer cir-

Fics: 2.

cuit just as an elastic bar is thrown into definite vibrations by blows
from a hammer, If this assumtion is correct, the condition for the dis-
appearance of the sparks at M will be that the vibration periods of the
two branches e1 and e2 shall be equal. These periods are determined
by the products of the coefficients of self-induction of these conductors
into the capacity of their terminals, and are practically independent of
their resistances.

In confirmation of this, it is found that if when the point of contact is
at e and the sparks have been made to re-appear by connecting a con-
ductor with one of the knobs, this conductor is replaced by one of
greater capacity, sparking is greatly increased. Ifa conductor of equal
capacity is connected with the other micrometer knob the sparks disap-
pear again; the effect of the first conductor can also be counteracted
by shifting the point of contact towards it, thereby diminishing the
self-induction in that branch. The conclusions were further confirmed
by the results obtained when coils of copper wire were inserted into one
or other and then into both of the branches of the micrometer circuit.

Hertz supposed that as the self-indnetion of iron wires is, for slow
alternations, from eight to ten times that of copper wires, therefore a
short iron wire would balance a long copper one; but this was not
_ found to be the case, and he concludes that, owing to the great rapidity
of the alternations, the magnetism of the iron is unable to follow them
and therefore has no effect on the self-induction.*

Induction phenomena tn open circuits.—In order to test more fully his
conclusion that the sparks obtained in the experiments described in the
previous section, were due to self-induction, Dr. Hertz placed arectangle
of copper wire with sides 10 and 20 centimeters in length, respectively,
broken by a short air space, with one of its sides parallel and close to
various portions of the secondary circuit of the coil, and of the micro-
meter circuit, with solid di-electrics interposed, to obviate the possibil-
ity of sparking across, and he found that sparking in this rectangle
invariably accompanied the discharges of the induction coil, the longest
sparks being obtained when a side of the rectangle was close to the dis-
charger.

A copper wire, i g h (Fig. 3), was next attached to the discharger,
and a side of the micrometer circuit, which was supported on an insu-
lating stand, was placed parallel to a portion of this wire, as shown in
the diagram. The ae at M were then found to be ea) feeble
