JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

WASHINGTON, January 9, 1889.

The stated annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution was held this day at half-past 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: Chief-Justice MELVILLE W. FULLER, Hon. J. J. INGALLS,
Hon. J. S. MORRILL, Hon. 8. M. CuLiLom, Hon. R. L. Gipson, Hon. 5.
S. Cox, Hon. W. W. PHELPS, Hon. Jos. WHEELER, Dr. HENRY
CopriE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, General M. C. MEIGs, and the Sece-
retary, Mr. S. P. LANGLEY.

On motion of Mr. Morrill, Mr. Ingalls was called to the chair.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Dr. Noam PorTER and
Dr. J. B. ANGELL, and the Secretary stated that Dr. A. D. WHITE was
out of the country.

The journal of proceedings of the Board of the regular annual meet-
ing of January 11 and the special called meeting of March 27, 1888,
was read and approved.

The Secretary stated that since the last annual meeting the death had
occurred of one of the most distinguished and useful members of the
Board, Dr. ASA GRAY, and it was proper that some expression be made
by ie Board in regard to the loss it had sustained.

Dr. Coppée, in afew eulogistic remarks on the late Dr. Gray, portrayed
his character and particularly his active usefulness as a Regent, and
thought the expression of the feeling of every one of his associates
should be placed upon the permanent records of the Institution. On his
motion, it was

Resolved, That-a committee of three be appointed, of which the Sec-
retary shall be chairman, to prepare and record in our proceedings a
resolution expressing the sentiments of the Board upon the loss of Pro-
fessor Gray.

The Chair appointed Prof. 8. P. Langley, Dr. Coppée, and Dr. Well-
ing as the committee, which subsequently reported the following :

THE LATE DOCTOR ASA GRAY.

It is rarely indeed that the departure from this life of any man pro-
duces so profound and so general a sense of personal loss as has fol-
lowed the death of our friend, Dr. Asa Gray, His associates in the

XI
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

Board of Regents, his companions in scientific research, and the great
body of younger men who looked up to him as their master, have all
been made to realize that something has gone from the world which
can ill be spared, and that their own lives have lost a part of that which
made up their fullness.

Upon the Smithsonian Institution his loss falls with particular
weight, since his active interest in its welfare is almost continuous with
its existence, for he was one of the Committee of the American Acad-
emy of Arts and Sciences, the report of which upon the “ plan pro-
posed for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution,” rendered in
1847, has exercised so active an influence upon the subsequent history
of this establishment.

Appointed a Regent in January, 1874, to succeed Prof. Louis Agas-
siz, his efficient and active interest in the welfare of this Institution
has been one of its most valuable possessions, and it is with deeper
feeling than formal resolutions of regret unsually convey that we now
endeavor to express some part of our sense of irreparable loss.

Dr. Gray’s scientific reputation, while literally world-wide, was nat-
urally greatest in his Own country, for it is he who has made the
botanical world acquainted with probably nearly three-fourths of the
forms that grow on this northern continent; and in this country, where
everything was referred to his Harvard Herbarium and to his judg-
ment and classification, as the final court of appeal, he occupied a
unique position as priest and pontiff of American botany. His botanical
labors are otherwise too familiar to need rehearsal here, but it is not
perhaps so generally known that he was an honored sponsor at the
birth of the Darwinian Theory. In this constant correspondence with
its illustrious author, Dr. Gray elicited the frequent expression of an
admiration as hearty as if was sincere;* and in Europe as well as in this
country our friend was recognized rather as the colleague than as the
disciple of the great English naturalist.

As another distinguished botanist has said of him, in speaking on
this same subject, ‘* Wherever it was known that Asa Gray saw noth-
ing sinister, nothing dangerous, in the teachings of Darwin, those
teachings were stripped of all their terrors. The impossibility that
such a man, so eminent in science, so clear in his conceptions, so pure
in his morals, and so steadfast in his faith, could pass judgment upon a
work that he had not thoroughly examined, or favor a doctrine that
could be productive of evil, was apparent to all who knew him, and to
the full extent of Dr. Gray’s wide influence throughout the world, the
works of Charles Darwin were stricken from the index expurgatorius

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XV

appreciation in which this Board holds its departed associate than in
any expectation that formal action can adequately express its sense of
the great loss that we personally feel, and that this Institution has
experienced, your committee submits the following resolutions:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution have been called upon to mourn the death of their distin-
guished colleague, the late Dr. Asa Gray, who has been actively inter-
ested in the welfare of the Institution from its beginning, and who held
for fifteen years the office of Regent, with great advantage to the In-
stitution: Therefore, be it

Resolved, That with a high appreciation of Dr. Gray’s most eminent
labors in the development of all scientific truth, and especially in the
advancement and popularization of the study of botany; with a grate-
ful sense of the service he has rendered to the Smithsonian Institution,
and with reverence for his pure life, we record our admiration of the
Christian character in which the truths of science were all seen in the
same light that shone on a life of steadfast faith.

Resolved, That we mourn not only the great investigator, the teacher
and the associate, whose single mind found outward expression in a
manner so well remembered in its simple and indefinable charm, but
that above all we grieve for the loss of a friend.

Resolved, That this preamble and the resolutions be spread on the
minutes of the Board in respectful tribute to the memory of our vener-
ated colleague, and that a copy be transmitted to his family in token of
the share we take in their bereavement.

The Secretary stated that having learned from the widow of Dr. Gray
that she needed about eighty copies of the second part of the “ Flora
of North America,” by her husband, which had been published by the
Smithsonian Institution, to complete the sets in her possession and ren-
der them available, he had ventured in the name of the Regents to fur-
nish these desired volumes, and had taken the occasion to express their
continued interest in the result of the labors of their late colleague ;
for which Mrs. Gray had asked him to express her very sincere thanks.

The chairman announced the election by joint resolution of Congress,
approved by the President February 15, 1888, of Dr. Andrew B. White,
of the State of New York, as Regent for the term of six years, to fill
the vacancy occasioned by the death of Dr. Gray.

The chair then announced as the next business in order, the election
of Chancellor.

On motion of Mr. Cox, Chief-Justice Melville W. Fuller was unani-
mously elected Chancellor of the Institution.

Mr. Fuller, in accepting the office, after thanking the members of the
Board for the compliment, expressed his desire to promote the objects
of the Institution, in whose welfare, he was well aware, the late chan-
celior, Chief-Justice Waite, had such great interest, and he earnestly
hoped that he should be able to discharge his duties with as much fidel-
ity and success.

Dr. Welling, chairman of the Executive Committee, presented its
annual report for the year ending June 30, 1888; which was read and
accepted,
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

On motion of Mr. Cox it was—

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1890, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to
be expended by the Secratary, with the advice of the executive com-
mittee, upon the basis of the operations described in the last annual
report of said committee, with tull discretion on the part of the Secre-
tary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of the
heads embraced in the established conduct of the Institution.

The Secretary presented his annual report, which in accordance with
the rules of the Board had been printed and distributed in advance to
the members. He expressed his readiness to make additional explana-
tions or remarks in regard to any part of the operations of the Institu-
tion.

Mr. Culiom inquired as to the Zoological Park, and the prospect of
its establishment. He expressed great interest in the project and hoped
it would speedily be realized.

The Secretary briefly urged the importance to science of the measure,
as the means of rescuing from speedy extinction some of the animals
which formerly inhabited this continent in vast numbers, and ex-
pressed his fear that if the land was not now secured (which in its nat-
ural state was pre-eminently fitted for the Park) within a year, so-called
‘‘improvements” would entirely destroy its character and adaptability.

General Meigs stated that thirty years ago he had pointed out to the
Government the desirability of securing the Rock Creek region for a
public park, and the land could then have been procured for an insig-
nificant sum.

After a general expression of opinion by the Regents in favor of the
proposed Zoological Park, the members of the Board in the Senate and
House were requested to urge the passage of the bill by Congress as
speedily as possible.

The Secretary stated that a reference had been made at the last an-
nual meeting of a bill introduced in the Senate December 12, 1887, for
the erection of a bronze statue of the late Professor Baird. This bill
had passed the Senate unanimously February 9, 1888, and was referred
in the House to the Committee on Library, which had not made a re-
port.

Mr. Cox stated that if the bill came up for action in the House he
had no doubt it would be favorably acted on.

The Secretary made the following remarks:

The Smithsonian contribution to the Library of Congress now con-
sists of over a quarter of a million titles, forming a collection of its
kind absolutely unequaled in the world, created mainly out of the
Smithsonian income and practically a donation to the General Govern-
ment. Further, nearly a quarter of the Smithsonian yearly income is
indirectly devoted to the increment of this great collection.

It had been hoped that this collection would have been kept in a hall
distinct from other books in the Library of Congress, but the exigen-
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XVII

cies of the demand on the Librarian have caused it not only to be
crowded into insufficient space, but in an inaccessible room, so that the
collection is not seen and in no way recalls the source of its contribu-
tion, and to the general public its very existence is unknown.

In the new Library of Congress building adequate space will pre-
sumably be provided for its preservation and increase, but if if seems
fit to the Regents that a distinct hall or halls shall be devoted to it,
and that they shall also in their construction and decoration not only
be worthy of the contents, but recall that the collection is due to the
Smithsonian fund, the following resolution is submitted :

Resolved, That since the Smithsonian deposit now numbers over
250,000 titles, and is still increasing at the cost of the Institution, it is,
in the opinion of the Regents, desirable that in the new building for
the Library of Congress sufficient provision shall be made for its
accommodation and increase in a distinet hall or halls, worthy of the
collections, and such as, while recalling to the visitor the name of
Smithson, shall provide such facilities for those consulting the volumes
as will aid in his large purpose of the diffusion of knowledge among
men.

On motion of General Meigs, the resolution was adopted.

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to the act recently
passed by Cungress (approved by the President, January 4, 1889), to
incorporate the American Historical Association, and providing that
said association shall report annually to the Secretary of the Smithson-
ian Institution its proceedings, ete., who at his discretion shall com-
municate the same to Congress, and further authorizing the Regentsof
the Institution to receive on deposit the collections, papers, etc., of the
said association.

On motion of Mr. Cuilom, it was

Resolved, That the American Historical Association be and hereby is
permitted to deposit its collections, manuscripts, books, pamphlets, and
other material for history in the Smithsonian Institution or in the Na-
tional Museum, in accordance with the provisions of the act of incor

poration, and that the conditions of said deposit shall be determined
by the Secretary, with the approval of the executive committee.

On motion of Mr. Cullom, the Board adjourned sine die.

REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS
OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

(For the year ending 30th of June, 1889.)

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Institution, the appropriations by Con-
gress for the National Museum and other purposes, and the receipts and

Congress (act of February 8, 1867) the residuary legacy of Smithson
and savings from annual income and other sources, $134,831. To this
$1,000 have been added by a bequest of James Hamilton, $500 by a

As this amount has been expended by the Smithsonian Institution
in carrying on the system of exchanges over and above the amounts
heretofore appropriated for its support by Congress, your committee
respectfully recommends that Congress be requested to make appro-
priation to re-imburse the Smithson fund.

Your committee also refers to the last report of the Secretary, which
states that up to 1880, inclusive, the Institution had paid $92,386.29
for exchanges, of which it is estimated that more than two-thirds were
on Government account, for which the Government paid nothing
whatever. Since the year 1880 the service has cost $96,065.85, of
which the Government has paid $57,500, leaving nearly $40,000 of the
cost to be borne by the Smithsonian Institution, and this exclusive of
the rent of the rooms, which represents about $3,000 a year in addition.

NORTH AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithsonian income during the year ending 30th June, 1889, all of
which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, or, in his
absence, of the assistant secretary as acting Secretary, and a certifi-
cate that the materials and services charged were applied to the pur-
poses of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the “international
exchanges,” and of the ‘National Museum,” and finds that the bal-
ances above given correspond with the certificates of the disbursing
clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as such dis:
bursing officer was accepted, and his bonds approved, by the Secretary
of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers and-journals, have been
examined and found correct.

The abstracts of expenditures and balance sheets under the appro-
priation for ‘‘ North American ethnology” have been exhibited to us;
the vouchers for the expenditures, after approval by the Director of
the Bureau of Ethnology, are paid by the disbursing clerk of said Bu-
reau, and after- approval by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion are transmitted to the accounting officers of the Treasury Depart-
ment for settlement. The disbursing officer of the Bureau is accepted
as such and his bonds approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.
The balance available tu meet outstanding liabilities on Ist July, 1889,
as reported by the disbursing clerk of the Bureau, is $13,491.22.

SPECIAL MEETING OF THE REGENTS.

WASHINGTON, D. C., November 18, 1887.

A special meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian In-
stitution was held this day at the Institution at half past 10 o’clock
A. M. |

Present, Hon. Morrison R. WAtrsE, Chief Justice of the United
States, Chancellor of the Institution; Hon. Jonn J. INGALLS, Presi-
dent of the Senate of the United States ; Hon. Justin S. MoRRILL, Hon.
SHELBY M. CuLLomM, Hon. WILLIAM L. WILSON, Prof. ASA GRAY,
Prof. HENRY COPPEE, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, Gen. MONTGOMERY
C. MEras, Prof. JAMES B. ANGELL.

The Chancellor stated that the present meeting had been called in
accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress organizing the
Institution, at the request of three of the Regents which had been
made to the Acting Secretary in the following communication :

Sik: Ata meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board of Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution, November 3, 1887, the following
preamble and resolutions were adopted :

Whereas, the death of Professor Baird, the honored Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, occurred at a time in the last summer when
from the absence of certain Regents in Europe, and from. the dispersion
of others in different parts of the country, it was found impracticable
to summon the Board of Regents in extraordinary session, that it might
take appropriate action in the premises under the immediate pressure
of that deplorable event; and

Whereas, the time bas now come when such an extraordinary meet-
ing is practicable, and is believed to be required alike by the proprie-
ties and by the possible exigencies of the situation resulting from the
lamented death of the late Secretary: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the Acting Secretary of the Institution be requested
tocall a special meeting of the Board of Regents to be held on Friday,
November 18, at 10:30 A. M.

The Chancellor read the following letter from Dr. Noah Porter, one
of the Regents :

YALE COLLEGE, November 14, 1887.

DEAR Str: I had made all necessary arrangements to be present at.
the meeting of the Regents which has been called for the 18th instant,
when I was summoned to respond to another engagement of long stand-
ing, the time for which was fixed on the same day. I regret that 1 can

not be present at Washington as it would give me very great satisfac-
tion to honor the memory of our late distinguished Seeretary for the
singular fidelity, forecast, and devotion with which he has discharged
the manifold duties of this office, and the eminent success which has
crowned his enterprising labors. Under his administration the Smith-
sonian Institution has enlarged its sphere of usefulness and activity
and has established itself most firmly in the confidence and esteem of
the American people. The direct services which the late Secretary
rendered to the wealth and welfare of the American people through
his connection with the Fish Commission and the honor which he
gained for his country abroad are too well known to need any com-
ment, while his personal simplicity and integrity are above all praise.

Very respectfully,

NOAH PORTER,
S. P. LANGLEY, Esq.,
Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Chancellor, Chief Justice Waite, then madethe following re-
marks :

GENTLEMEN OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS: It is my sad duty to
announce to you the death of Spencer Fullerton Baird, LL. D., the
Secretary of the Institution, at Wvod’s Holl, Mass., on the 19th day of
August last. Professor Baird wasappointed by the lamented Professor
Henry, while Secretary of the Institution, on the 5th of July, 1850,
under the authority of this Board, to the office of Assistant Secretary
“in the department of natural history, to take charge of the Museum,
and to render such other assistance as the Secretary may require.”
He entered at once on the performance of his duties, and until the *
death of Professor Henry, nearly 28 years afterwards, filled his place
with great ability, and to the entire satisfaction of his distinguished
chief and of the Regents.

Professor Henry died on the !3th of May, 1878, and on the 17th of
the same month Professor Baird was unanimously chosen his successor
as Secretary of the Institution. From that day until he died he was
faithful to every duty of his high office, and devoted himself untiringly
to giving effect to the will of our munificent founder by the * increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

As his death occurred when some of you were absent in Europe, and
others away in different parts of this country, it was found impracti-
cable to get an extraordinary meeting of the Board to take action upon
the deplorable event at that time. We have now met for that purpose
and I invite your special attention to the subject.

Senator Justin 8. Morrill moved that Prof.S. P. Langley be appointed
to fill the vacancy in the office of Secretary created by the death of
Professor Baird.

It having been represented that the Executive Committee had pre-
pared a minute of proceedings to be submitted to the Board, and that
paper having been called for, it was read by the chairman, Dr. J.C.
Welling:
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XXXIX

“The Executive Committee beg leave respectiully to represent that in
the preamble and resolution accompanying the call of the Acting Secre-
tary for the present extraordinary meeting of the Board of Regents, they
suppose themselves to have sufficiently set forth the reasons why this
call has been so long delayed ; the reasons which dictate the expediency
of holding an extraordinary meeting at the present time, and therefore
the objects which may properly engage the attention of the Board in
view of the proprieties and exigencies of the situation resulting from
the lamented death of the late Secretary.

Cherishing for the late Professor Baird the profound regard inspired
by his talents, by his great attainments, by his life-work in the cause
of science, and by his distinguished services to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and not doubting that this sentiment is shared by every mem-
ber of the Board, your committee have thought that it was due alike
to the memory of the departed Secretary whom we all held in high-
est honor, and to our own sense of the loss which the scientific world
im common with this Institution has sustained in his death, that we
should proceed, at the earliest practicable day, to take that appropri-
ate action in the premises which is dictated by our intimate official and
personal relations with the departed Secretary, and by a sincere desire
on our part to testify and record our heartfelt admiration of the great
and good man whose death we deplore.

With regard to any exigencies, actual or contingent, resulting from
the death of the late Secretary, it does not need to be said that first im
order and first in importance stands the electing of a Secretary. Though
the transactions had by the Board at the last annual meeting, in the
appointment of the Assistant Secretary, who is now the Acting Secretary
of the Institution, may have simplified the solution of this problem so
far as we are concerned, yet there are obvious considerations of delicacy
which, in the case of a sensitive and refined nature like that of the
eminent man in question, must preclude him from acting with official
freedom, and with a full sense of executive authority, until the mind of
the Board shall have been definitely declared with regard to the sue.
cession in this most responsible office; and in the mean time he natu-
rally shrinks from doing aught in his office which may seem to conclude
the final action of the Board in the premises.

As to any possible exigencies which may have arisen in consequence
of the multiplied engagements of the late Secretary, who, besides his
duties as the executive officer of the Smithsonian Institution, was also
charged with the direction of the U.S. National Museum, of the Bu-
reau of Ethnology, and of the U.S. Fish Commission, we beg leave to
say that certain important questions of future policy, deeply concern
ing the prosperity of the Institution and the cause of American science,
may possibly be thrust upon the Board at this juncture in a way to cali
for careful consideration, if not for immediate decision.

It is known to us all that Prof. Joseph Henry, the first Secretary and
XL JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

the organizer of the Smithsonian Institution,entertained the settled opin-
ion thatits operations“ should be mingled as littie as possible with those
of the Government ;” that the funds of the Institution, being specifically
devoted by theterms of Smithson’s bequest to a prescribed object,should
not be diverted to other objects, and that consequently the activities of
the Secretary should not be engrossed by other engagements which, from
their nature or from the administrative cares incident to their manage-
ment, might be judged to impair the distinctive singleness and highest
efficiency of the Institution in laboring for ‘‘the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” He a'so held that the necessity laid upon
the Institution of making annual appeals to Congress for the support
and extension of adjuncts not essential to the conduct of its own special
operations is a necessity which should be avoided as far as practicable
in the interests of a dignified and single-minded administration of the
Smithson trast; and hence he thought it desirable that some more defi-
nite distinction should be made between the Smithsonian Institution and
the National Museum, if on the whole it should be judged best to re-
tain them under acommon jurisdiction. His own judgment inclined in
favor of their entire separation. In the presence of additional engage-
ments so vast, multiform, and important as those involved in the con-
duct of the Fish Commission, it is obvious that these opinions of Pro-
fessor Henry would have gained an added emphasis.

The late Secretary, Professor Baird, while acquiescing in the strict
views of Professor Henry with regard to the precise terms of the Smith-
sonian bequest, and while faithfully working, within the proper sphere
of the Smithsonian Institution, on the general lines laid down by his
predecessor, did not, it is presumed, entirely share Professor Henry’s
opinions as to the reflex influence and effect exerted by the adjuncts in
question upon the normal function and legitimate fame of the Smithson-
ian Institution. Endowed with a wonderful capacity for administrative
detail, and capable of inspiring his subordinates with enthusiam in their
work and with loyalty to their official chief, he doubtless saw in these
manifold adjuncts of the Institution only so many auxiliaries to its be-
neficent design (“ the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men”),
and therefore only so many additional accessories to its usefulness and
glory.

Set as your committee are to execute the will of the Regents and not
at all to define the scope or policy of the Institution, if would obviously
be impertinent on our part to essay any prejudgments on the questions
that may be raised by the existing attitude of the Institution consid-
ered in the kind or degree of its relations to the National Museum, to
the Bureau of Ethnology, and to the Fish Commission. The former
two of these adjuncts are parts and parcel of our jurisdiction, while the
latter from its inception was placed under the responsible management
of the late Secretary, and is now under the direction of Assistant Sec-
retary Goode.
- JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XLI

But while we can not venture on any definitions of policy (all ques:
tions of policy having been left by us in abeyance), we may properly re-
call to the recollection of the Board one great leading principle which
has prevailed in the administration of the Institution from its begin.
ning down to the present day; that principle is, that the Secretary 1s
charged with plenary power in his office, and therefore with an entire
and undivided responsibility for the right and proper administration
of the Smithson trust. That trust gives to him the reason of his offi-
cial being, and it is conferred by the Regents, without restrictions of
their own, because of the confidence reposed in the ability, integrity,
and discretion of the Secretary. Hence any change of policy which
should require a division of responsibility because of a multiplicity or
heterogeneity of operations, would work an entire change in the theory
of our administration, would break up the continuity of our history,
and might seriously jeopard the efficiency of the Institution by marring
jts harmony and unity. This harmony and this unity of operations
would therefore seem to require the establishment of a permanent and
definite line of policy to be pursued by the Institution as far as pos-
sible without break and without chasm because of changes occurring
in its executive head.

It is obvious that anything like a fundamental revision and reconsti-
tution of the proper work and proper relations of the Institution re-
curring periodically at the death of each Secretary would be fraught
with serious detriment to its usefulness and to its fame. But if the
specific nature and at the same time the ensemble of its general opera-
tions can be maintained, it would seem that those operations may re-
ceive any addition or undergo any extension which shall be found
compatible with prudent and efficient administration under a single
head. + How far, therefore, the ties which now bind the Institution to
the National Museum, to the Bureau of Ethnology, and to certain sei-
entific aspects of the Fish Commission, should be tightened or loosened
is a question of expediency to be determined by a careful analysis and
a deliberate weighing of all the elements involved in the problem set
before us—that is, by considering and judging how far each and all
of these adjuncts may be made ancillary to the proper work of the
Smithsonian Institution under the conduct of a single responsible ex-
ecutive officer.

It is with these general convictions, and with the view of bringing
more definitely before you the subject-matters which would seem to
call for deliberation at this extraordinary session, that we venture tosub-
mit the following resolutions to your consideration, some of which, it
will be seen, are suggested as mere starting points for discussion :

1. Resolved, That a committee of three Regents be appointed to draft
resolutions expressive of the exalted admiration cherished by the Board
for the late Spencer F. Baird, LL. D., our gratitude for the long, faith-
ful, and abundant labors which he performed in the service of this In-
stitution, our reverence for his memory, and our profound sense of the
loss which the cause of science has sustained in his lamented death,
XLII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

2, Resolved, That this Board do now proceed at once to the election of
a Secretary to fill the vacancy created by the death of Professor Baird,
and that the rights, powers, aud duties of the Secretary thus elected,
as well as his salary and emoluments, shall be the same as those pre-
scribed by the existing regulations.

3. Resolved, That the newly appointed Secretary is hereby requested
to make report in writing at the coming annual meeting, on any changes
which may seem to him desirable in the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution considered in its relations to the National Museum, to the
Bureau of Ethnology, and to such scientific aspects of the Fish Com-
mission as he may deem germane to the proper theory of the Institu-
tion, avd which shall be capable of reduction under its wise and effi-
cient administration—that is, to consider and report how far the existing
relations between all or any of these adjuncts and the Smithsonian In-
stitution should be increased, altered, diminished, or abolished in order
the better to promote the original and organic design of the Institution
as established by Congress.

4. Resolved, That a committee of three shall be designated by the
Chair, to be composed of one Regent appointed from the Senate, one
Regent appointed from the House of Representatives, and one Regent
appointed from the States, whose duty it shall be to investigate and
consider all the questions that may be suggested by the nature or ex-
tent of the relations now subsisting between the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and anyor all of the other objects and adjuncts which are now
more or less definitely and completely under its administration, or un-
der the personal administration of its Assistant Secretary; that the said
committee, in maturing their views, be invited freely and frankly to
acquaint themselves with the opinions and judgments of the Secretary,
who, to this end, is hereby requested to communicate to the said com-
mittee, in the first instance, any recommendations which he shall sub-
mit in pursuance of the preceding resolution ; and, finally, that the said
committee be instructed to report to the Board at the annual meeting
appointed to take place on the 18th of January next, a digest of any
additional plans, policies or methods of administration which they shall
judge expedient in order to meet any adjustment of relations that shall
seem to be required by the best interests of the Institution committed
to our charge.”

The first resolution in the foregoing series was then taken up for con-
sideration, and on motion of Dr. Gray it was adopted.

Messrs. Gray, Ingalls, and Welling were appointed a committee to
draft resolutions in honor of the late Secretary, and that committee,
through its chairman, Dr. Gray, reported the following preamble and
series of resolutions :

Whereas in the dispensation of Divine Providence, the mortal life of
SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD was ended on the 19th of August last,
the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, now at the earliest practi-
cable moment assembled, desire to express and record their profound
sense of the great loss which this Institution has thereby sustained,
any which they personally have sustained, and they accordingly re-
solve—

1. That iv the lamented death of Professor Baird the Institution is
bereaved of its honored and efficient Secretary, who has faithfully and
unremittingly devoted to its service his rare administrative abilities for
thirty-seven years; that is, almost from the actual foundation of the
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XLIil

establishment, for the Jast nine years as its chief executive officer, under
whose sagacious management it has greatly prospered and widely ex-
tended its usefulness and its renown.

2. That the National Museum, of which this Institution is the admin-
istrator, and the Fish Commission, which is practically affiliated to it—
both organized and in a just Sense created by our late Secretary—are by
this bereavement deprived of the invaluable and unpaid services of their
indefatigable ofticial head.

3. That the cultivators of science, both in this country and abroad,
have to deplore the loss of a veteran and distinguished naturalist, who
was from early years a sedulous and successful investigator, whose
native gifts and whose eXperience in systematic biological work served
inno small degree to adapt him to the administrative duties which
filled the later years of his life, but whose knowledge and whose interest
in science widened and deepened as his opportunities for special investi-
gation lessened, and who accordingly used his best endeavors to pro-
mote the researches of his fellow naturalists in every part of the world.

4. That his kindly disposition, equable temper, singleness of aim,
and unsullied purity of motive, along with his facile mastery of affairs,
greatly endeared him to his subordinates, secured tohim the confidence é
and trust of those whose influence he sought for the advancement of
the interests he had at heart, and won the | high regard and warm affec-
tion of those who, like the members of this ‘Board, were Officially and
intimately associated with him.

5. That without intruding into the domain of private sorrow the Re-

gents of the Institution would respectfully offer to the family of their
late Secretary the assurance of their profound sympathy.
6. That the Regents invite the near associate of the late Secretary,
Professor Goode, to prepare a memorial of the life and services of Pro-
fessor Baird for publication in the ensuing annual report of the Institu-
tion.

The resolutions were seconded by Dr. Coppée, who made the following
remarks:

Mr. Chancellor, I rise to second the resolutions.

As IT have been to some extent associated with Professor Baird as
Regent since 1874, when I found him here as Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, to which post he was appointed in 1850, it
may be proper that I should ask your patience while I add a single
word to the eloquent tribute of just eulogium offered to his memory
in the resolutions of Professor Gray and the committee.

When the distinguished Professor Henry was called to his rest and
reward in 1878, amid tokens of grief in yonder Capitol, there was a
hearty concurrence of voices in the Board of Regents to appoint Pro-
fessor Baird to the vacant place. At that time, sir, it seemed, in con-
tradiction of the maxim of the French philosopher, that he was a neces-
sary man. His large scientific scope, his great knowledge and success
as a specialist in natural history just when that branch of science
needed particular attention to meet its expanding claims, his wonder-
ful industry, his intimate acquaintance with the system and the details
of the Institution, his thorough and brotherly sympathy with its scien-
tific workers, and, withal, his great and increasing reputation, formed;
XLIV - JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

in the view of the Regents, the strongest grounds for his appointment.
Without making comparisons, he was eminently worthy to succeed our
earlier and illustrious scientist and Secretary.

Earnest, courteous, painstaking and exact, he allowed the Institution
to suffer no detriment at his hands. It is specially significant of his
unremitting care for it, that, last year when he was suffering from nerv-
ous prostration, in his eagerness to provide for its future welfare he
asked the Board to appoint an assistant, who should aid him in his
onerous labors, and who, in the event of his permanent disability or
death, should assume the government of the Institution until the Board
of Regents could take action.

Sir, the sad necessity came far too soon. It has called us together
to-day to mourn his loss, recall his virtues and merits, and fill his
vacant place.

The Smithsonian Institution, which had but one Secretary betore
him, will in the flight of time have many. Let me conclude by express-
ing my conviction that among them there will not be a more excellent
Secretary than he, nor a nobler character than that of Spencer Fuller-
ton Baird.

The resolutions were then unanimously adopted by arising vote.

The second of the foregoing resolutions was then adopted, and im-
mediately thereupon Senator Morrill renewed the nomination of Pro-
fessor Langley as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The motion was seconded by Dr. Welling.

In rising to second the motion, Dr. Welling said that he had it in
charge from Professor Langley to make to the Board on his behalf a
certain representation which seemed to him (Professor Langley) to be
due in order that the pending question might be considered with entire -
eandor and freedom on all sides. Dr. Welling said that it was well under-
stood that Professor Langley had been nominated by the late Secretary
as an assistant secretary of the Institution because of the eminent
ability he had shown and the distinguished reputation he had already
gained as an original investigator in an important branch of physical
science. The achievements which Professor Langley had made in astro-
nomical physics were of a nature to shed luster on his name and do high
honor to American science. It would bea great loss to the cause of
science and a great loss to the best interests of this Institution if the
capacity for original research thus demonstrated by Professor Langley
should be smothered by the mere drudgery of official cares and admin-
istrative details. It might be proper to state that Professor Langley
had brought himself to entertain the proposition now pending before
the Board only after much misgiving on his own part, and after much ear-
nest remonstrance on the part of the friends who knew him best as a
scientific worker, and who feared that in accepting this office, dignified
and inviting as it is, he might be making a mistake for the interests of
science and for himself by sacrificing even higher duties and foregoing
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XLV

even higher honors than those awaiting him as director of this Insti-
tution.

Now however that the question of the succession in the office of the
Secretary had been precipitated at an earlier date than we all had ex-
pected when he was chosen an assistant secretary, Professor Langley
held that it was due to the Board and due to himself that he should
frankly state the understanding with which he had finally brought him-
self to the belief that it was his duty to accept the office of Secretary if
it should be conferred upon him by the Board. This understanding was
that while, if called to such a responsible trust, he must needs give with
all fidelity and with all conscientiousness the full measure of time,
thought, and care which shall seem to be required by the Institution
and by its adjuncts, he did not construe this obligation as precluding
the possibility of sometimes giving to himself that physical rest and
mental diversion which should come to every man whois burdened
with the discharge of an exacting office. Professor Langley had
doubtless observed that the first Secretary of the Institution, Professor
Henry, had sougit such rest and such diversion in the change of labor
brought to him by the chairmanship of the Light-House Board, and in
the performance of this function we all knew that Professor Henry had
done good work for the cause of science (as wituess his researches in
sound and in the economies of light-house illuminants), and therefore a
work which had redounded to the honor of the Smithsonian Institution.

Professor Langley had also observed, we may presume, that the late
Secretary, with the approval of this Board, had engaged in great and
useful labors connected with the Fish-Commission, and that hence in
our judgment there was no incompatibility in the pursuit by our Secre-
tary of certain labors extraneous to the immediate precinets of the In-
stitution, if they could be pursued without detriment to its best efficiency
and to the full development of its capacity for usefulness. It was in
this view that Professor Langley begged leave to represent that he, too,
might sometimes wish to find rest and refreshment in a change of labor
from the ordinary routine of official administration in connection with
the Institution, and he would naturally look for such rest and refresh-
ment in the further pursuit of his favorite scientific researches, so far,
and only so far, as that pursuit could be made consistent with his para-
mount duty to the Smithsonian Institution.

Dr. Welling then added that, speaking for himself as a member of the
Board, he felt free to express the conviction that these “ leisure labors”
would serve to enhance the title of Professor Langley to the Director-
Ship of an Institution which had for its object “ the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men;” and while the statement thus made
at the instance of Professor Langley might have seemed to be required
by an honorable frankness on his part, the Board would be likely to
find in this frankness a further ground of confidence in the high sense
of honor and duty which he would bring to the discharge of his respon-
XLVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS,

sible office. We might therefore trust with the full assurance of faith
that the Institution in his case, as in the case of his distinguished
predecessors, would be only the gainer by such intervals of rest as he
might seek in the interest of his health, and by such vicissitudes of
labor as he might seek in the interest alike of this Institution and of his
chosen studies. Such intervals of rest, orat least such variety of labor,
were especially necessary to a man who is placed under stress and pres-
Sure of heavy administrative cares, like those devolved on the Directcr
of this Institution, and the Board had in the character of Professor
Langley the best possible guaranty that he could be freely trusted to
decide all such questions of duty according to a delicate and conscien-
tious sense of right.

The Board then proceeded to ballot for the election of Secretary. Ten
votes were cast, all of which were found to be for Professor Langley,
who was thereupon declared by the Chancellor to be duly elected as
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

After some discussion upon the remaining two resolutions in the fore-
going series as reported by the executive committee—a discussion par-
ticipated in by Messrs. Morrill, Welling, Gray, Coppée, and others—
ihe resolutions were withdrawn.

Dr. Welling was appointed to inform Professor Langley of his elec-
tion, and having done so, he was introduced to the Board, and in a few
remarks expressed his acceptance of the office of Secretary with a solemn
sense of the responsibility devolved upon him, and high appreciation
of the honor which had been conferred.

Dr. Welling offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Whereas the remains of the late Prof. Spencer F. Baird have not yet
been committed to their last resting place; and

Whereas this solemn ceremonial has been postponed at the request
of members of this Board and others, that the friends of the late Secre-
tary in Congress might have the opportunity of testifying by their pres-
ence at his grave the respect in which they held him while living, and
their reverence for his memory now that he is no more: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the Secretary of the Institution, after conference with
Mrs. Baird, be requested to issue public notice of the time and place
which shall be appointed for these funeral services, and to send a spe-
cial notice to the members of the Smithsonian Establishment and of
the Board of Regents.

On motion of General Meigs it was—

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to call the annual meet-
ing of the Board for the present year at the time fixed for the funeral
of Professor Baird.

On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to purchase the oil por-
trait of Professor Baird, painted by Henry Ulke, now exhibited to the
Regents, at a cost not to exceed $300.

The Board then adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.
REPORT OF 8. P. LANGLEY,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889.

To the. Board of Regents of the Smithsonian I nstitution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present the report upon the oper-
ations of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1889,
together with the customary summary of the work performed by the
Bureau of Exchanges, the National Museum, and the Bureau of Eth-
nology.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

As the Annual Reports of the Secretary are intended to present a
history of the affairs of the Institution, it seems proper to state that by
the appointment of the Hon. Melville W. Fuller as Chief Justice of the
United States, the latter became ev officio a regent of the Institution,
and that at the annual meeting of the Board of Regents, held on the
9th of January, 1889, he was unanimously elected its chancellor.

The Hon. Levi P. Morton has become a Regent by his election as
Vice-President, the holder of that high office being ex officio a Regent
of the Institution.

The terms of Senator 8S. M. Cullom, appointed March 23, 1885, and
Senator R. L. Gibson, appointed December 10, 1887, having expired on
March 3 of the present year, those gentlemen were re-appointed by the
President of the Senate.

The Board has lost from its number by death the Hon. 8. 8S. Cox, long
connected with the Institution; but this event having occurred since the
expiration of the year which forms the subject of this report, the re-
marks called out by this great loss will be more properly made in a later
communication.

FINANCES.

[ have in my last report referred to the fact that owing to the chang-
ing value of money, the purchasing power of the Smithsonian fund, in
the language of a committee of the Regents—

‘“while nominally fixed, is growing actually less year by year, and of
less and less importance in the work it accomplishes with reference to
H. Mis, 224 if l

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the immense extension of the country since the Government accepted
the trust ;”

so that it seems most desirable that the fund should be enlarged, if only
to represent the original position of its finances relatively to those of
the country and institutions of learning, and nothing has occurred in the
course of the last year which does not rather increase than diminish the
force of such an observation. It is on the Congressional Regents that
the Institution must largely depend for making its wants known to
Congress, and with reference to the suggestion that the Smithsonian
fund should be enlarged by re-contribution from the Government as well
as from contributions from private individuals, I desire to repeat the
remark of Professor Henry, made in 1872, to the effect that the Govern-
ment, in equity, should then have paid the Institution $300,000 for the
use of the present building. This building, erected wholly out of Smith-
sonian funds, at the cost of over half a million dollars, has, with the
exception of a small portion, continued to be used rent free by the
Government ever since that time.

I recall briefly in this connection the well known facts that the will
of James Smithson was made on October 23, 1826, and that by an act
of Congress approved July 1, 1836, the bequest was accepted, while
under the act of August 10, 1846, a definite plan of organization was
adopted, and that finally, by the act of February 8, 1867, the Regents
were authorized to add to the Smithsonian fund such other sum as they
might see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the
sum of $1,000,000.

The original bequest and the sums since added are as follows:

Bequest of Smithson, 1846 ..--...----- .----+ -- 2220 eee c ee oe teen ee eee eee $515, 169. 00

Total permanent Smithsonian fund in the Treasury of the United
States, bearing interest at 6 per cent. per annum........---.---- 703, 000. 00
There may, therefore, be added to the fund nearly $300,000, on which
the Institution is entitled to receive 6 per cent. under the act of February,
1867, while it has received in bequests only the insignificant sum of
$1,500. This is in striking contrast to the liberality which is understood
to have endowed more than one American institution of learning within
this time with something like ten times the amount of the entire Smith-
sonian fund. No institution in the country, it is believed, enjoys wider
measure of public confidence or is more universally known, and it would
seem that some action might well be taken to bring these facts before
those who are seeking a trustee for the disposition of means intended
for the advancement of knowledge.
In this connection, however, it seems proper to invite the attention of
the Regents to the circumstances of the bequest of James Hamilton,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. o

who donated $1,000 to the Institution in 1874, the interest on which was
to be appropriated biennially for a contribution, paper, or lecture on a
scientific or useful subject. Your former Secretary, Prof. Joseph Henry,
in bis report for 1874, states that—

“The first,installment of interest on the Hamilton bequest has just
been received, and will be appropriated in accordance with the will of
the testator at the end of next year, and so on continually at the end of
every two years.”

And he adds—

‘A statement of the manner of spending this income will be given in
the accounts of the operations of the institution with due credit to the

donor. His name will therefore appear from time to time in the annual
reports and thus be kept in perpetual remembrance.”

Professor Henry continues, in this connection:

‘When the public shall become more familiar with the manner in
which the income of the additional bequests to the Smithsonian fund
is expended, with the permanence and security of the investment, and
with the means thus afforded of advancing science and of perpetuating
the names of the testators, we doubt not that additions to the fund in
this way will be made until it reaches the limit prescribed by law of
$1,000,000.”

Owing, perhaps, to the small amount of this bequest, the intent of
the Secretary does not appear to have been fulfilled. No contribution,
paper, or lecture seems to have ever been furnished, biennially or other-
wise, and with the exception of the exploration of certain bone caves,
mentioned in the report of the Secretary for 1876, the income has
remained unexpended.

I shall have elsewhere to speak of the great loss the Institution has
sustained in the death of Dr. J. H. Kidder, curator of exchanges; but
I refer to it here only in connection with a bequest made by him, con-
stituting the Institution one of his residuary legatees. This bequest,
the terms of which are still awaiting the consideration of the Regents,
will be more properly described, in detail, after their action upon it,
which can not well form a portion of the present report.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand of the income
from the fund was $4,809.23. The interest has been $42,180, while
from miscellaneous sources $3,760.53 have been received. The total
expenditures have been $38,992.29, leaving on July 1, 1889, $11,757.47,
a somewhat larger balance than usual, which has been retained to meet
certain delayed expenditures.

The Institution is charged by Congress with the disbursement of
sundry appropriations through the Secretary, as follows:

The vouchers for the expenditures from the appropriations are passed
upon by the executive committee of the Board of Regents with the ex-
ception of those for ethnological researches. The disbursements from
the latter appropriation are made under the direction of Major Powell.

The estimates prepared to be submitted for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1889, were as follows:

Of the first of these items, that of international exchanges, urgent rep-
resentations were made to Congress to the effect that though it had as-
sumed the charge of this, the expenditures of the Bureau (whose work
largely consists of the transportation of Government documents) con-
tinue to be met, in part, from the private fund of the Institution, but, as
will be seen, no change in this respect has been made.

The estimates prepared to be submitted for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1890, were as follows:

International exchanges.—Twenty-seven thousand and five hundred
dollars was asked for; the House committee reported $15,000; the Sen-
ate committee $20,000; and the amount finally appropriated was
15,000.

North American Ethnology.—The appropriation asked for this service
was $50,000. The House reported $40,000 ; the Senate made no change
and the amount of the appropriation remained as reported by the House.

Preservation of Collections, U. S. National Museum.—The appropria-
tion asked for this service was $160,000. The House committee reported
$135,000; the Senate committee $145,000. The amount finally appro-
priated was $140,000.

Furniture and Fixtures, U. S. National Museum.—An estimate of
$35,000 was submitted. The House committee reported $30,000; the
Senate committee also reported $30,000 and this amount was appropri-
ated.

Heating and Lighting, U. 8. National Museum.—The appropriation
asked for this purpose was $12,000. This amount was agreed to by
the House and Senate committees. There is a deficiency of $1,000 for
the purchase of coal.

Living Animals, U. S. National Museum.—An estimate of $5,000 was
submitted for this service. The House did not report the same.

Postage-Stampsand Foreign Postal-Cards, U. S. National Museum.—An
appropriation of $1,000 was asked for this service. ‘The same was
reported from the Senate favorably, where it originated, and passed
the House.

Publications, U. 8S. National Musewm.—An estimate of $15,000 was
submitted for this service. The House reported $10,000; the Senate
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

committee reported $12,000; and in conference the amount as reported
by the House was agreed upon.

In my last report I stated that it was desirable that the appropria-
tions for the Museum should be made under the direction of the Insti-
tution, and no longer under the Department of the Interior, and I gave
a correspondence with the honorable the Secretary of the Interior upon
the subject. I am happy to state that the Seeretary’s assent being
given the appropriations were transferred by Congress to the care of the
Institution, and are now disbursed under direction of the Regents by
a disbursing clerk in the Institution, whose bonds have been accepted by
the Treasury Department.

A detailed statement of the expenditures for the fiscal year 1889,
under appropriations for International Exchanges, North American
Ethnology, and the National Museum is given in the report of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

BUILDINGS.

.

It will be remembered that the Board of Regents in their meeting
January 17, 1885, recommended to Congress the erection of a new
building planned exclusively for museum purposes, and tbe steps taken
in pursuance of their instructions were laid before the Regents in my
last report, but I regret now to be unable to report any further progress.

The necessity for additional space for the storage of collections, inde-
pendent of that demanded for exhibition purposes, is constantly be-
coming greater, while the assignment by the last Congress to the Fish
Commission of the principal parts of the rooms occupied by the Mu-
seum in the Armory building has still further aggravated the crowded
condition of the Museum exhibition halls and storage rooms, and I
deem it my duty again to urge the necessity of the erection of a new
building, if only for such requirements of storage as may be inferred
from the following statements :

Since the erection of the present Museum building there have been
nearly 14,000 accessions to the Museum, chiefly by gifts, such ‘ aecces-
sions” representing frequently collections, and the collections including,
in many cases, thousands of specimens. From the year 1859 to 1880
the accessions numbered 8,475. It is thus evident that during the last
nine years the accessions have exceeded by more than 5,000 those of the
previous twenty-one years.

Among the more recent collections are several of very great extent,
such as the bequest of the late Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which con-
tains 20,000 specimens of shells, besides minerals and other objects;
the Jeffries collection of fossil and recent shells of Europe, including
40,000 specimens; the Stearns collection of mollusks, numbering 100,-
000 specimens; the Riley collection of insects, containing 150,000 speci-
mens; the Catlin collection of Indian paintings, about 500 in number ;
the collection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

transportation of which to Washington several freight-cars were re-
quired; the Shepard collection of meteorites; the Wilson collection of
archeological objects, nore than 12,000 specimens ; the Lorrillard col-
lection of Central American antiquities, and very many others nearly
as extensive.

In addition to these are the extensive collections obtained at the close
of the exhibition in Berlin, London, and New Orleans, the annually in-
creasing collections transferred to the Museum by the U.S. Geological
Survey, the U. S. Fish Commission, and the Bureau of Ethnology, be-
sides numerous contributions resulting from Government expeditions
as well as those made by officers of the Army and Navy, and other
Government officials.

The storage Sheds contain many hundreds of boxes of valuable ma-
terial which we have not room to unpack, and the great vaults under
the Smithsonian building, and many of the attic and tower rooms are
similarly crowded.

The growth of several of the most important departments in the
Museum is seriously retarded owing to the fact that no exhibition space
is available for the collections, and that there is not even storage room
where incoming material can be properly cared for.

The collection of birds, which so far as North America is concerned,
is the finest in the world, and now numbers nearly 60,000 specimens, is
very inadequately shown, and requires double the case room now avail-
able.

The collection of mollusks, which is one of the most complete in the
world, and contains nearly 470,000 specimens, is at present almost en-
tirely unprovided for.

The collection of insects, now numbering over 600,000 specimens, is
so far as North America is concerned, equally perfect, but is practically
without any exhibition space.

The same is equally true in regard to the collections of birds’ eggs
(more than 50,000 specimens), of reptiles (nearly 30,000 specimens), of
marine invertebrates (more than 515,000 specimens), of invertebrate
fossils (more than 160,000 specimens), and of fossil and recent plants
(nearly 50,000 specimens).

Many v waluale collections elsewhere than in Washington are at the
service of the Museum, but lack of space has compelled us to decline to
receive them.

It should be borne in mind that under the roofs of the Smithsonian
and the new Museum buildings are grouped together collections which,
in London, Paris, or any other of the European capitals, are provided
for in different museums, for the accommodation of which a much larger
number of equally commodious buildings is found needful.

The necessity for additional space then is constantly becoming greater,
and there is the further reason that by the action of the last Congress
the Armory building, assigned to the uses of the Museum in 1876, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ; q

for several years past occupied in part by the U. S. Fish Commission,
as a fish-hatching station, was assigned to this Commission for head-
quarters. It has been refitted as an office building, and is now almost
entirely relinquished by the Museum, four apartments on the third floor
being retained for the use of a part of the Museum taxidermists.

From the inadequate exposition of our needs just made, it will be
apparent that an extensive additional building is needed, if only for
storage, and where purposes of immediate exhibition are not in ques-
tion.

Irrespective of the construction of this proposed building, however,
I beg tourge the necessity of improving the lighting of the second floor
of the main hall of the Smithsonian building, and more particularly the
indispensability of fire-proofing the west wing, which I have already
urged upon the attention of the Regents, and concerning the latter of
which, one of their number, Senator Morrill, introduced a bill in the
Senate on June 12, 1888, which is referred to in my last report, and on
which no further action has been taken by Congress.

In regard to erections of minor importance, it may be mentioned that
it is intended to put up a small wooden building of one story, of a tem-
porary character, immediately south of the main building, as a cover
for the instruments, which at the same time will render it possible to
make certain observations pending the building of the proposed physi-
cal observatory, and this is more particularly alluded to under the fol-
lowing head of Research.

RESEARCH.

In my last report I spoke of the preparations made by the late Secre-
tary for securing an astro-physical observatory and laboratory of re-
search, and [ mentioned that through his action some friends of the
Institution had already offered to give the means for the erection of
the simple structure needed for the accommodation of such a special ob-
servatory. I added that the site would necessarily be suburban on ac-
count of the special need of seclusion and the absence of tremor in the
soil.

I have elsewhere referred to the collections of the Institution in con-
nection with the purchase by Congress of a zoological park, which it
would appear to have been the first intent of Congress to place under
the care of the Regents. It had been my hope in that case to place this
observatory somewhere in the park, but in view of the long delay which
has already arisen, and of the indefinite further delay which may occur,
I have thought it better to put a wooden structure of the simplest and
most temporary character in grounds immediately south of the Institu-
tion, although this site is quite unsuitable for a permanent building.
Such a shelter will probably be erected before the coming winter, and
will, while serving as a store-house for the apparatus, enable observa-
tions to be commenced.
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The promotion of original research has always in the history of the
Institution been regarded as one of its most important functions, and
the proper object of the personal attention of the Secretary ; and I shall
be very glad to do something in this direction on the most modest scale,
rather than incur the chance of indefinite farther delay.

In this connection I desire to say that a valuable collection of recently
constructed apparatus, most of it exactly suited to the wants of the
proposed laboratory, and which was the property of the late William
Thaw, of Pittsburgh, has been, by his wish and the consent of his ex-
ecutors, loaned to the Institution for use in this direction.

Comparatively few of the collections of the Institution or of the Museum —
have reference to the physical sciences. The apparatus collected by Pro-
fessor Henry, together with some few archaic instruments illustrating
the early history of methods of precision which I have added, are now
being placed in the south hall of the main building, and it will gratify
me to see this lead to accessions in illustration of the history of research
in all branches of science.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Smithsonian Institution has during the year enjoyed the valu-
able assistance of several persons who have expressed their willing-
ness to prosecute special researches in its behalf, or have generously
offered to allow the Museum to share in their results.

In embracing these opportunities it has been the policy of the Insti-
tution to endeavor to obtain information and, when possible, to secure
specimens, in regard to subjects in which the Museum collections
were most deficient, and thus to fill some of the most important gaps
in special collections rather than to obtain large collections of miscel-
Janeous material.

Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadelphia, visited the northern part of
Africa early in the present year, and, before going, kindly offered to make
special inquiries in regard to the civilization of the modern Arabs and
the natural history of the region, and to collect, if possible, linguistic
specimens. It was his intention to journey direct to Tangiers, thence
to Fez and Mequinez, continuing, if time permitted, as far as Mogador
and Morocco. Mr. Williams is familiar with the Arabic language,
which will greatly facilitate his investigations in that country. The re-
gion has rarely been visited by naturalists, and the Smithsonian Insti-
tution will no doubt obtain very important information, and probably
also some valuable collections. The special studies to which Mr. Will-
iams intends to devote himself are botany, geology, and archeology.
At the time of his arrival the North African flora was in flower, so that
his opportunities in the first direction were excellent. The geology
of Northern Africa is poorly represented in the National Museum, and
characteristic rocks and photographs of feature of physical geology
will be very acceptable. The subject of most importance to the Smith-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

sonian Institution, however, is the archeology of this region, and it is
to this that Mr. Williams has been requested to chiefly direct his atten-
tion. It is his intention to visit Kl] Kutel, one of the most striking
monolithic remains in Northern Africa, and other ruins of equal inter-
est. Photographs and measurements will be obtained, for which pur-
pose a photographie outfit has been furnished to Mr. Williams, who is
thoroughly competent to conduct investigations of this kind. The
Smithsonian Institution has also provided an outfit of instruments for
taking observations of temperatures and altitudes, and he has been
requested to obtain musical instruments of all kinds, as far as the lim-
ited sum of money placed at his disposal from the Museum fund will
enable him to purchase them.

News has already been received of Mr. Williams’s arrival in Africa.
He has secured a complete series of musical instruments, from the rudest
whistle to stringed instruments of skillful manufacture. In each in-
stance the native names and names of the parts have been ascertained,
the proper pitch of each string taken, and a native melody, as played
on each kind of instrument, has been noted in our musical notation.
He has also succeeded in obtaining a varied collection of objects illus-
trating the domestic life of the people.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill, of the German legation of Pekin, has for several
years made himself familiar with the customs of the natives of Thibet,
and having recently undertaken a journey through that country, will
make a special study of the ethnology of the region. He has been
supplied by the institution with a barometer and other instruments
desired by him for his journey. His previous investigations have re-
sulted in an exceedingly valuable collection of objects illustrating the
religious practices, occupations, and amusements of various peoples in
different parts of China, Thibet, Turkestan.

Dr. James Grant Bey, who some years ago established a sanitarium
in Cairo, Egypt, and attended the International Medical Congress held
in Washington in 1887, became much interested in the work of the
National Museum, and has since his return to Egypt devoted his leisure
time to special studies of the arts of the ancient Egyptians. Several
valuable collections have already been received from him.

During the summer, the Bureau of Etlinology decided to send Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin to Hoopa Reservation in California for the purpose of
studying the languages and mythology of the tribes of Indians inhabit-
ing the reservation. The Smithsonian Institution was fortunately en-
abled to secure the assistance of Mr. Curtin in investigating their arts
and industries also, and a small sum of money was placed in his hands
for the purchase of objects of Indian manufacture.

Dr. John M. Crawford, U. 8S. consui-general at St. Petersburg, has
kindly offered to allow the National Museum to participate in the results
of his ethnological researches in Russia and Finland. Dr. Crawford is
well known in the United States as a philologist and a student of Scan-
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

dinavian antiquities, and as the author of the English translation of
the Finish epic “The Kalevala.” His appointment as consul-general
at St. Petersburg was made with a special view to enable him to
carry on his studies of the traditions and antiquities of the Finish race
and related peoples. He has offered to make collections for the National
Museum, and in order to facilitate his work, the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has provided him with letters of introduction to several of its cor-
respondents in Russia and Finland. These will no doubt be of great
service to him in enabling him to carry out the object which he desires
to further.

Rey. Frederick H. Post, an Episcopal clergyman of Salem, Oregon,
has recently undertaken missionary work in Alaska, and has taken up
his residence at Anvik, on the Yukon River. He has entered into cor-
respondence with the Smithsonian Institution, and has offered to col-
lect information relating to the tribes of the Upper Yukon. He has
also proposed to make meteorological observations at Anvik. This
offer has been referred to the Signal Office. It is probable that an out-
fit of alcohol, guns, and ammunition will be sent to Mr. Post next year
to enable him to collect the mammals and birds of that region.

Lieut. J. F. Moser, commanding the U. 8. Coast Survey steamer
Bache has continued his explorations for the Museum, and has trans-
mitted a collection of fishes, mollusks, insects, and marine invertebrates
from the vicinity of Cape Sable, Florida.

Prof. O. P. Jenkins, of De Pauw University, Indiana, has made
arrangements to visit the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of col-
lecting fishes, and has expressed his intention of presenting a duplicate
series of specimens to the National Museum. The Smithsonian Institu-
tion has supplied him with seines and has furnished him with a letter
of introduction to the curator of the national museum in Honolulu.

Ensign W. L. Howard, U. S. Navy, has kindly offered to collect
zoological and ethnological material in Alaska, and has been supplied
with collecting apparatus and supplies for use in trading with the In-
dians.

A large outfit of tanks, bottles, and alcohol was supplied to Mr. W.
A. Stearns, of Cambridgeport, Mass., for use in vollecting specimens of
natural history in northern Labrador. No collections have yet been
received from him.

PUBLICATIONS.

Under an arrangement made by the late Secretary, Prof. E. D. Cope
was engaged at the time of my last report in completing and preparing
for publication an investigation upon the Reptilia and Batrachia of
North America, which has been in progress, under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution, for more than twenty years. The monograph
on the Batrachia, mentioned in my last report as having been received,
is now in type, though not yet published, but that on the Reptilia is still

delayed. I have positive assurance from Professor Cope that it will be
completed within the present year, but the expense entailed in the pub-
lication has continued to prove far greater than the late Secretary had
anticipated, and I am sorry that the expectation of its completion dur-
ing the past year has not been fulfilled.

I have referred in my last report to the demand for greater economy
in publication, and to the probability that some change would be re-
quisite in the form of the annual reports. It will be remembered ‘at
the Smithsonian Institution has three classes of publications:

The Contributions to Knowledge.

The Miscellaneous Collections.

The Annual Reports.

A brief review of the past and present condition of each of these
publications may here be made, with special reference to the latter.
For details concerning these different classes, and for the matter
actually presented under each, reference may be made to the appendix.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—The first work of original re-
search published by the Institution was the well-known treatise by Messrs.
Squier and Davis, in 1848, on Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi
Valley. This was the commencement of the quarto series entitled
‘Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” which now numbers
twenty-five volumes. This series is designed to record the results of
original research, offering positive additions to human knowledge, either
undertaken by agents of the Institution or encouraged by its assistance.
In general character these contributions correspond somewhat with
the more elaborate transactions of learned societies. From causes
briefly adverted to in my last report, original memoirs deemed worthy
of a place in this series have been much rarer in later years than in the
earlier portion of the Institution’s history.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—In 1862, a second series of pub-
lications was commenced by the Institution, in octavo form, with the
Meteorological and Physical Tables of Professor Guyot, under the title
of ‘Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.” This series embraces
papers or treatises of a more practical character than those of the Con-
tributions, including résumés of existing knowledge in special depart-
ments, systematic lists or classifications of species in the animal,
botanical, or mineral kingdoms of nature, tabular collections of natural
constants, scientific bibliographies, and other summaries, of value to
the students of physical or biological science. These collections now
number thirty-three volumes.

Among the subjects heretofore included in this series have been the
proceedings or transactions of several scientific societies of Washington
(the Philosophical, the Anthropological, and the Biological), which were
organized under the auspices of officers of the Smithsonian Institution.
To promote their usefulness the stereotyping of their several published
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

journals was undertaken by the Institution and a large extension of their
distribution was thus effected by including their re-issue in the Miscella-
neous Collections, of which series they constitute three volumes. These
societies having now severally attained a highly successful and self-sup-
porting condition of active membership, it has been thought that this
form of patronage might well be withdrawn without detriment to the
welfare of the societies and with advantage to the Institution. These
publications are accordingly no longer stereotyped by the Institution, or
included in its issues.

The Bulletins and Proceedings of the U. 8. National Museum, pub-
lished by an appropriation of Congress, have also been heretofore re-
printed by the Institution and this supplementary edition has occupied
five volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections. It has been decided in
like manner to hereafter omit these publications from the series.

Smithsonian Annual Reports—A provision of the act of Congress or-
ganizing the Smithsonian Institution (Revised Statutes, Title 73, See.
5593) requires that ‘the Board shall submit to Congress at each ses-
sion thereof a report of the operations, expenditures, and condition of
the Institution.” These annual reports have been accompanied with a
“¢ general appendix,” giving summaries of lectures, interesting extracts
from the correspondence, and accounts of the results of explorations
undertaken by the Institution or aided and promoted by it, as well as
of new discoveries in science. In the annual report for 1880 and the
following years my lamented predecessor undertook to give a more
systematic character to the history of discoveries, by engaging a num-
ber of able collaborators in various fields of knowledge, to furnish a gen-
eral summary or record of scientific progress for the year. Appropri-
ate as the scheme appears, it has not been found to work as satisfacto-
rily as is desirable, and as had been hoped for. It has seldom been
possible to collect as complete summaries as were originally contem-
plated; and the delay of publication deprives the record of much of the
freshness and interest it would otherwise possess, while in all these the
rapid increase of scientific literature demanded such a corresponding
increase in the corps of reporters and such a correlatively increasing
expenditure as the fixed Smithsonian fund was growing quite unable
to afford. It will be remembered that of this appendix there are dis-
tributed through members of Congress as many as 9,000 copies, form-
ing the larger part of the whole edition, and that it is thus incumbent
on us to observe that it reaches a large class of readers unable to follow
the work of specialists in original memoirs.

After serious consideration it has been finally determined to restrict,
if not forego, the scheme of a general annual survey of scientific litera-
ture and progress, and to recur in large part to the system of Henry
of selecting memoirs of a special interest and permanent value, which
have already appeared elsewhere and which are sufficiently untechnical
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

to be readily apprehended by readers fairly representative of the intel-
ligent and educated class among the constituents of the members of
POHSEOSS, by whom they are chiefly distributed.

If, as [have already suggested, Congress sees fit to make a small
appropriation for the editing as well as the publication of this appen-
dix, so as to enable it to include, for instance, information relative to
the progress of scientific discovery and its useful application in the
United States, such a record would be in keeping with the objects of
this Institution, and would maintain for this report the popularity and
the educational character just referred to, while promoting industrial
interests in the country...

In this connection I beg to repeat the remark that it would be de-
sirable to have the supplementary matter of the report placed under a
special clause for the avoidance of all question as to the “ necessity
and entire relation to the public business” of such information, a ques-
tion which has arisen by the construction given by the Public Printer
to the act of Congress of August 4, 1885.

Publications of the National Museum.—These publications (already
referred to as being issued by Government appropriations) comprise
two series: First, the ‘Proceedings of the National Museum,” consist-
ing of short essays giving early accounts of recent accessions, or newly
ascertained facts in natural history, and promptly issued to secure the
earliest diffusion of the information, of which series ten annual volumes
have now been issued; and secondly, the “Bulletins of the National
Museum,” consisting of more elaborate memoirs relative to the collec-
tions, such as biological monographs, taxonomic lists, ete., of which
series thirty-six numbers have been issued. These bulletins vary
greatly in size from pamphlets of fifty pages to works of many hun-
dred pages.

Publications of the Bureau of Ethnology.—The principal publication of
this Bureau is the “Annual Report.” This series consists of large royal
octavo volumes, detailing researches relative to the aborigines of North
America, handsomely printed and illustrated with numerous cuts and
lithographie plates. The fifth Annual Report has been issued during
the year, and the series may be referred to, as at the same time credita-
ble to the Government and as fitted to engage public attention by mat.
ter of an interest beyond what is ordinarily found in any Government
document,

Distribution of Smithsonian Publications.—It is manifestly impossible
for the Institution, with its fixed and limited income, to keep pace in its
issues and their distribution with the increase of popular interest in
scientific productions. The ordinary edition of 1,500 copies of each of
the Smithsonian publications which has been produced from the be-
ginning, cannot be enlarged without seriously impairing the efficiency
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

of the fund for other services ; although it wonld be a great satisfaction
to be able to supply more liberally the growing demand for the works
as published. The impracticability, however, of furnishing these to all
interested in scientific pursuits, has required the adoption of more for-
mal regulations to secure the most judicious application of the available
stock of publications. These are presented, first, to those learned socie-
ties of the first class which give to the institution in return complete sets
of their own publications; secondly, to colleges of the first class furnish-
ing catalogues of their libraries and students, and publications relative
to their organization and history; thirdly, to public libraries in this
country having 25,000 volumes; fourthly, in some cases to still smaller
libraries, especially if no other copies of the Smithsonian publications
are given in the same place and a large district would be otherwise un-
supplied; lastly, to institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion
of particular branches of knowledge, such of its publications are given
as relate to their special objects. These rules apply chiefly to distri-
bution in the United States. The number sent to foreign countries,
under somewhat different conditions, is about the same as that distrib-
uted in this country.

A small number of copies not otherwise disposed of has been usually
reserved for sale; although such returns have of course contributed
but little toward the cost of production. As an experiment (which had
been tried in the early history of the institution), I have placed a small
edition of one of our works in the hands of a large publishing house,
the well-known firm of MacMillan & Co., of London and New York.
The work selected for this purpose is the newly revised “tables of
specific gravity for solids and liquids,” by Prof. F. W. Clarke, Chemist
of the U.S. Geological Survey. This being a valuable work of refer-
ence for all practical chemists, as well as for many others, was thought
to be a very suitable subject for trial as to its commercial success. An
edition of 1,000 copies having been reserved for the regular gratuitous
distribution, 500 copies were prepared with the imprint of Messrs.
MacMillan & Co. on the title page, to be disposed of as one of their
own publications, and by their regular business methods.

Facilities afforded to others.—A few instances of assistance in the
direction of printing, etc., granted in special cases, may here be men-
tioned. The widow of Dr. Asa Gray having about 80 imperfect copies
on hand of her husband’s “ Flora of North America,” desired, in order
to complete her sets and render them available for sale, a correspond-
ing number of covies of the first part of the second volume. The re-
quest was cheerfully complied with, and Messrs. Wilson & Son, of
Cambridge, Mass., were authorized by the Regents to print the desired
small edition at the expense of the Institution.

Prof. M. W. Harrington, of Ann Arbor, Mich., made application for
the use of the stereotype plates of Professor Henry’s meteorological
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

essays (included in his published scientific writings), with a view to the
publication of a cheap popular edition of this treatise. In the belief
that such a republication would be in the interests of science and its
wider diffusion, permission to use the plates was readily granted.

A similar request was made by Dr. George H. Horn, of Philadelphia,
who, as joint author with the late Dr. John L. Le Conte of a work of 600
pages on the ‘Classification of the Coleoptera of North America” (pub-
lished by the Institution in 1883, and now out of print), desired the use
of the stereotype plates, from which to print an edition of the book.
This request was also favorably entertained, and the pres. sought
was conceded.

The Eighth International Congress of Orientalists, appointed to be
held at Stockholm and at Christiania, in September, 1889, solicited
through its officers the co-operation of the Smithsonian Institution. In
furtherance of its laudable aims the Institution undertook to print and
distribute in this country 1,000 copies of its circular of announcement
and information.

In compliance with the request of Mr. Sylvester Baxter, secretary of
the Hemenway Expedition of exploration, the privilege of the Smith-
sonian exchange system was granted for the distribution of the report
of the expedition, giving an account of its researches in the Southwest.

These various allowances are believed to be in the spirit of the Smith-
sonian foundation, and of its ancient maxim—* Co-operation, rather than
rivalry or monopoly.”

Storage of the Smithsonian Stereotype Plates.—The stereotype plates of
the Smithsonian publications now constitute a very large collection,
and as the printing of the works had been done in various cities, as
appeared most economical or convenient, a considerable portion of this
material had been stored in Boston, and especially in Philadelphia.
As the fire-proof renovation of the eastern portion of the Smithsonian
building furnished a safe and suitable depository in the basement rooms,
these plates have now all been collected within its store-rooms.

THE SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

The international exchange system was established early in the
history of the Institution, at first purely as a channel for the interchange
of scientific publications and specimens, and therefore as a direct means
for “the diffusion of knowledge,” a means which has proved to be a
great benefit to the scientific institutions of the world, and incidentally
to Congress in building up the unequalled collection of works of refer-
ence deposited in its Library.

Of late years, however, the Government, having decanien the charge
of this system, has made the Institution its agent not only for this
scientific distribution but for the much larger distribution of the publi-
cations of the United States Government abroad, and also for the re-
ceipt and transmission to the Library of Congress of the publications
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of other countries sent in return. In this twofold service it is now per-
forming an important public duty, for which such inadequate provision
is made, that in spite of the efforts for an economical and efficient ad-
ministration of this department the best interests of the Government
as well as those of the Institution are seriously suffering.

In reviewing the past year it is necessary to mention first of all the
serious loss in the death of Dr. Jerome H. Kidder, which however has
been more fully referred to elsewhere. At the date of his death, which
occurred on the 6th of April, 1889, owing to the efficient condition of
the division due to the hearty co-operation of all in it with the labors
of its lamented chief, the office was free from any parcels whatever, and
was ready to close its book accounts completely for the first time.

L regret to record, also, the death on June 17, 1889, of Mr. George Hill-
ier, Superintendent of the New York Custom-House. Mr. Hillier had for
more than thirty years attended to the transmission of Smithsonian ex-
change packages, rendering the Institution most valuable and efficient
service without compensation. In response to a request made to the
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Quackenbush, chief entry clerk of the
New York Custom-House, has been designated to receive and transmit
cases addressed to the Smithsonian Institution in future.

Dr. Kidder was succeeded as curator of exchanges by Mr. William C.
Winlock, who was appointed May 15,1889. The curator’s report to the
Secretary, containing the usual statistics for the fiscal year, will be found
in thé appendix.

In order to convey an idea of the present magnitude and character of
the exchange transactions it may be stated that during the year, 17,218
packages were mailed to correspondents in the United States and 693
boxes, containing 58,035 packages, were shipped to our agents abroad
for distribution to correspondents in nearly every civilized nation of the
earth. The total number of packages received was 75,966, of which
34,996, or nearly one-half, were governmental exchanges.* The services
ofelevent clerks and packers have been required in handling and account-
ing for this material and in conducting the extensive correspondence
that such a business involves. The societies and individuals upon the
exchange list now number 13,130.

The entire expense of “international exchanges” for the fiscal year
was $17,152.10. Of this sum $15,000 were appropriated directly by
Congress, $1,363.54 were repaid by several of the Government Depart-

*It should be noted that almost from the very beginning of the exchange system
the publications of several of the scientific bureaus of the Government were volun-
tarily transmitted by the Smithsonian Institution; but it was not officially desig-
nated for the service till 1878.

tIt is not superflnous to repeat that these are engaged in addition to the proper
personnel of the Institution, the services of whose officers are given without charge.

t The items $2,329.99, under the head of expenditures for exchanges, and $2,189.52
repayments, in the report of the executive committee, include receipts and expendi-
tures made on account of the preceding fiscal year.

ments to which appropriations had been granted for payment of freight
on publications sent abroad through the Institution, leaving «a deficit
of $788.56, which was paid from the Smithsonian fund.

With reference to this deficiency let me observe that in the history of
the Government’s connection with the exchanges three periods may be
distinguished. The first was in 1867 and 1868, when, after twenty years
of useful work in the interests of knowledge, a new duty was imposed
upon the service by acts of Congress* which established for the benefit
of the Congressional Library an international exchange of works pub-
lished by the Government and made the Smithsonian Institution the
agency for this exchange. The second was in 1878, when the Institu-
tion was distinctly recognizedt by the Department of State as the agent
of the United States in the exchange of all Government publications
(including exchanges for the benefit of Bureau libraries) and also in the
exchange between learned societies.

The Institution possessed unequalled experience and facilities for
such work, and though the new class of books brought to the exchange
department was partly foreign to its original object, the propriety of
its assuming such a service, if the Government’s interest could be pro-
moted by this experience, is evident. It certainly, however, was not to
have been anticipated that the Institution should conduct a purely ad-
ministrative work of the General Government out of its private funds,
as it appears to have done for thirteen years, from 1868 to 1881, when
the first appropriation of $3,000 was made by Congress.

In the actt of March 3, 1881, making this appropriation it appears to
have been the intent of Congress to apply the amount indifferently to
all exchanges, whether to those which it undertakes for the Library of
Congress, to those of Governmental bureaus, or to other literary and

scientific objects, thus constituting a third change* in the relations of
the Smithsonian to the Government in regard to the Exchange Bureau.

An approximate estimate of the cost of the exchange for the Library
of Congress from 1868 to 1878, together with the cost of the ‘Govern.
mental” exchange (the Congressional and Departmental) for 1879 and
1880, shows that about $20,000 were paid from the Smithsonian funds
for handling Government property alone. Regarding the whole ex-
pense of international exchanges since 1881 as a charge on the Govern-
ment, the entire amount paid out of the funds of the institution on ac-
count of the General Government is somewhat over $50,000, exclusive
of office rent and minor expenses.

In the report that [ had the honor to submit to the Board of Regents
at their last meeting the expenses and needs of the exchange depart-
ment were dwelt upon at some length, and it was stated that a revised
estimate of $27,050 had been submitted through the Secretary of the
Treasury for the purpose of meeting the expenses of contemplated im-
provements in the service during the fiscal year 1888-89. The amount
finally appropriated was $15,000, an increase of only $3,000 over the
sum appropriated for the year preceding. As I have already remarked,
in spite of efforts for an economical and efficient administration of the
department, slow transportation and free ocean freight, this was $2,-
152.10 less than the service actually cost, and the interests of both the
Government and the Institution suffer from the entire inadequacy of
the appropriation.

Although all of the Government bureaus that have occasion to trans-
mit their publications through the Institution are not provided with
funds available for defraying the cost of the service, it seems to have
been the intention of Congress that its specific appropriation for the
exchange business should be supplemented by special appropriations to
some of the bureaus and departments of the Government, so that the
charge of 5 cents per pound weight imposed by the regents in [878
might be met by them. The average amount annually repaid to the In-
stitution in this way during the past eleven years has been about $1,400,
and does not represent all the cost to the Institution which has been
made up from its private fund.

It has been repeatedly urged that this procedure, for which sufficient
reasons existed at the time of its adoption, may now be discontinued as
no longer advantageous or economical,

By the present system the cost of the service is actually larger than
appears in the specific appropriations for exchanges, and as the specia
appropriations to the different departments vary from year to year, and
are often omitted altogether, a burden which can not be accurately fore-
seen continues to be imposed upon the STN ALDSOMIUE I fund.

i Lae Gin, at w hich the United States was Fo maccnen was concluded at Brus:

official documents and of the scientifie and literary publications of the states ad-
joining thereto,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

In order to effect the change contemplated, that is, to collect in a
single item the entire appropriation for international exchanges and
at the same time to make allowance for a needed compensation to the
ocean steam-ship companies for freight and for like necessary expenses,
tending to secure to the United States a return of many times what
they now receive from foreign governments, with a prompt delivery,
an estimate of $27,500 was submitted for the fiscal year 1889-90.

It should be premised that only about one-third of the Government’s
publications are actually received from the office of the Public Printer
and elsewhere for transmission abroad, and that while special applica-
tion on our part might call out the remainder, we can not undertake to
do this while only partly paid the actual outlay for the portion we
carry already, while a sufficient appropriation to justify the employ-
ment of a special exchange agent in Europe, as has been frequently
and earnestly recommended by the Librarian of Congress, would bring
back in return probably about eight times what we now receive. Ac-
cordingly, in the subjoined estimate of what could be done if Con-
gress paid the actual cost of efficient service (the services of the officers
of this Institution being given without charge), more packages appear
under the new plan than under the old.

Statement of exchanges during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1889, together
with estimates for proposed new departure.

No increase, however, over the amount appropriated for 1887~88
($15,500) was granted, and it is probable that the deficiency for the
coming year will be at least $2,000.

Recurring now to one of the effects of the insufficient appropriations
the writer repeats that there are too many and too great delays in the
transit of packages sent by international exchanges. These delays do
not occur in the office at Washington, nor in those of the agents of the
Institution at London and Leipzig. They are due, broadly speaking, to
the fact just stated, that the Institution has not the means to pay for
rapid transit on land or sea, and that for what it obtains on the latter
it is dependent upon the courtesy of several ocean steam-ship com-
panies, with the natural result that the free freight is often delayed to
make room for that which is paid for. A subordinate cause, however,
lies in the apathy or indifference, or possible insufficient clerical force,
of most of the foreign exchange bureaus.

The employés of the bureau are paid much lower salaries than simi-
lar services command in other branches of the public service, and the
Government pays no rent for the rooms in which they labor, in which
even the office furniture forms a part of the charge on the private funds
of this Institution.

The convention between the United States of America, Belgium,
Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, and Switzerland for the interna-
tional exchange of official documents and scientific and literary publica-
tions, as well as the convention between the same countries (excepting
Switzerland) for ‘‘ the immediate exchange of the official journals,. par-
liamentary annals, and documents,” was concluded at Brussels March
15, 1886, ratification advised by the Senate June 18, 1888, ratified by
the President July 19, 1888, ratifications exchanged January 14, 1889,
and proclaimed January 15, 1889, and since that date formal notifica-
tion has been received of the adhesion to both conventions of the Gov-
ernment of Uruguay. The full texts of these conventions were given
in the Curator’s report for last year.

The adhesion of the United States to the first convention involves no
new departure in the exchange service from the methods of previous
years; but for the fulfillment of the obligations incurred by the second
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

convention—the immediate exchange of official journals—an appropria-
tion of about $2,000 to cover the necessary postage and additional cler-
ical assistance is required; and provision should be made for the prompt
delivery to the exchange office of the documents referred to.

This sum of $2,000 was estimated in reply to an inquiry made by the
Secretary of State, dated February 12, 1889, as to the ability of the
Smithsonian Institution to execute all of the provisions of the two con-
ventions without further legislation by Congress, and the estimate was
duly transmitted by the Secretary of State in a letter to the President
of the Senate, but no appropriation was made.

As heretofore, the Institution is greatly indebted to the lines of ocean
steamers between the United States and other countries, and especial
acknowledgment is due to the agencies of the fellowing companies for
the continuation of many favors in the free transportation of interna-
tional exchange packages :

LIBRARY

I may best preface what I have to say about the library by a repeti-
tion of some introductory remarks in my previous report:
“Ohiefly through its exchange system, the Smithsonian had in 1865

accumulated about forty thousand volumes, largely publications of
learned societies, containing the record of the actual progress of the
2? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

world in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of
the human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of at
least every branch of positive science since the days of revival of let-
ters until the present time.*

“These books, in many cases presents from old Kuropean libraries
and not to be obtained by purchase, formed even then one of the best
collections of the kind in the world.

‘The danger incurred from the fire that year, and the fact that the
ereater portion of these volumes, being unbound and crowded into in-
sufficient space, could not be readily consulted, while the expense to be
incurred for this binding, enlarged room, and other purposes connected
with their use threatened to grow beyond the means of the Institution,
appear to have been the moving causes which determined the Regents
to accept an arrangement by which Congress was to place the Smith-
sonian Library with its own in the Capitol, subject to the right of the
Regents to withdraw the books on paying the charges of binding, ete.
Owing to the same causes (which have affected the Library of Con-
gress itself) these principal conditions, except as regards their custody
in a fire-proof building, have never been fulfilled.

“The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though they
have now accumulated from 40,000 to fully 250,000 volumes and parts
of volumes, and form without doubt the most valuable collection of
the kind in existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more
crowded and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer.
It is hardly necessary to add that these facts are deplored by no one
more than by the present efficient Librarian of Congress.”

At the last meeting of the Board, the Regents passed the following
resolution :

“ Resolved, That, since the Smithsonian deposit now numbers over
250,000 titles, and is still increasing, at the cost of the Institution, it
is, in the opinion of the Regents, desirable that in the new building
for the Library of Congress, sufficient provision shall be made for its
accommodation and inerease in a distinct hall or halls, worthy of the
collections, and such as, while recalling to the visitor the name of
Smithson, shall provide such facilities for those consulting the volumes
as will aid in his large purpose of the diffusion of knowledge among
men.”

I have brought this resolution of the Regents to the attention of the
present Librarian of Congress and to that of the Chief of Engineers,
the officer in charge of the new building. 1 learn from the latter offi-
cial that, owing to the length of time occupied in the construction, it
will probably be from six to eight years before any effect can be given
to this resolution ; and, in the mean time, with the overcrowded condi-
tion of the present quarters of the Library, the chests sent up from the
Institution still often continue to lie unopened, so that their contents
are inaccessible.

Owing to this overcrowding and, as it is understood, to insufficient
clerical aid in the Capitol Library, this noble collection, the product of
thirty years’ accumulation from the fund of Smithson, is, if not alto-
gether lost to science and learning, at any rate so impaired in its use-

* See Smithsonian Report of 1867.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

fulness that it can not be assumed that any series of learned transac-
tions is now complete or that any stude nt can any longer find what he
seeks in what was once provided for his aid. I beg to recommend this
regrettable state of things to the notice of the Congressional Regents.
The present sad condition must, from the nature of the case, grow
yearly still worse under the present urangement ; and it seems certain
that, by the time the new building is ready for the books, the entire
collection will have its value so impaired as to be pecuniarily and oth-
erwise of little value in comparison with the original cost. The only
remedy still appli¢able would seem to lie in providing temporary quar-
ters for the collection under the care of the Librarian of Congress, but
outside of the overcrowded quarters in the Capitol.

The labor of recording and ecarivg for the acéessions to the library
has been carried on as during the last fiscal year, with this exception,
that, the work being now thoroughly organized, it has been practicable
to dispense with the services of one of the three clerks previously em-
ployed in this department.

The construction of additional cases in the reading-room has given
increased facilities for the display of periodicals, and the number. of
serials now at the disposai of readers has arisen from 265 (as at the
time of my last report) to 432. The reading-room is well used by those
classes of readers for whom it was designed.

The most important operation in connection with the library during
the year has been the commencement of the work of carrying out the
plan for increasing the library by systematic exchanges, which was
originated soon after I entered on my duties as Assistant Secretary, at
the desire of Secretary Baird.

Realizing that there must be many scientific and technical period-
icals of value, especially in branches of science not directly related to
the work carried on at the Institution, which were not known in our
library, and recognizing the fact that many new publications have come
into existence since the last systematic attempt to procure full returns
for the publications distributed by the Institution, I addressed circulars

three hundred gentlemen in this country who are noted for their
eminence in the different branches of knowledge, desiring them to
furnish me with lists of the scientific periodicals which were of value
to them in their special fields of investigation.*

In reply to these circulars, 174 voluminous lists were received, and
these I caused to be carefully collated. The result of this collation is a
list of 3,600 titles, embracing, as it is believed, nearly if not quite all
periodical literature of importance in the various branches of knowledge,
exclusive of belles-lettres and the art of medicine.

In order, however, that this list should be of any practical service to
the Institution, itis first necessary to learn which of these publications
the Institution may already possess, either in isa Tasos or imperfect

* Copies of pies circulars are to be fone in Appendix 4 to my report for 1887-’83,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

files. To ascertain this, each title in the list must be laboriously com-
pared with the records of the library, running back frequently for
many years. Again, should a learned society, publishing transactions,
or the publishers of a journal mentioned in this list, be found to have
received Smithsonian publications without making any adequate return,
the records of the distribution of publications must be searched, in order
to find the exact amount of publications furnished, that upon this the
Institution may base its demand for a return.

It will be seen that the publications in question fall naturally into
four classes.

(1) Journals which receive the Smithsonian publications, and which
are not to be found in the library of the Institution.

(2) Journals which receive the Smithsonian publications, but which
make either no return or an inadequate return for these.

(3) Journals which regularly exchange with the Institution, but of
which the files in the library are for any reason defective.

(4) Journals which regularly exchange with the Institution, and of
which the library possesses a complete file.

When each of the 3,600 titles has been assigned to its proper place
in one of these four classes, a letter must be written to each one of the
journals belonging to the first three classes, as follows: To the first ciass,
offering to exchange; to the second, calling attention to the fact that
the Institution has received no adequate returns for its favors, and to
the third, asking for the volumes or parts of volumes required to com-
plete the files.

It will thus be evident that a work of no small magnitude remained ~
to be performed after the list of journals was prepared. A careful esti-
mate showed that it would require the entire time of a competent clerk
for at least tweive months to perform the necessary routine work. As,
however, the Institution was not in a position to employ an extra clerk
for work which would be so largely for the benefit of the Library of
Congress, the matter was allowed to rest here.

The desirability of the plan, however, commended itself so strongly
to me that I could not willingly see it given up and the large amount
of labor already expended remain unfruitful. Accordingly, towards
the latter part of the past fiscal year, I presented the matter to Mr. A.
R. Spofford, the Librarian of Congress, who, recognizing the advantages
that would accrue to that Library from carrying out the plan, consented
to defray the expense of the necessary clerical work from his own ap-
propriations. The work was accordingly begun on June 1, 1889, and
will be carried on continuously under the immediate supervision of the
librarian, Mr. John Murdoch.

It is estimated that of the 3,600 titles under consideration, at least
one-half, or 1,800, will prove to. be new and desirable accessions to the
library, while the work done in endeavoring to complete broken series
must prove to be of great value.

THE DEPARTMENT OF LIViNG ANIMALS.

The collection of the departmeut of living animals has increased dur-
ing the year (almost wholly by donations) to such an extent as to quite
overcrowd its accommodations, and render if necessary to resolutely
check its growth, while the degree of interest manifested in this small
display has been surprising. This has been shown not only by the
residents of Washington, and visitors to the city, who form the daily
crowd of visitors, but many residents of remote States and Territories
have testified their interest by sending valuable gifts to the collee-
tion.

Besides these, many valuable gifts of quadrupeds and birds have
been received from United States Army officers in Texas. A most val-
uable donation received during the year came from the Hon. W. F.
Cody (Buffalo Bill), of North Platte, Nebr., and consisted of three fine
American elks, two males and a female.

Dr. V. T. MeGillyeuddy, of Rapid City, Dak., offered to deposit in
the collection four American bisons which have been in his possession
for several years. The conditions of the offer were considered suf-
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ficiently liberal to justify its acceptance, and accordingly Mr. George
H. Hedley, of Medina, N. Y., was requested to proceed to Rapid City,
where he received the animals and arrived in Washington with them
in good condition. Being fine specimens they have naturally attracted
much attention.

The overcrowded condition of the temporary cages and yards con-
taining the larger animals has caused extreme trouble, not only to pro-
vide properly for the shelter and comfort of the specimens, but to keep
them from either killing or injuring each other. Only with larger space
and better facilities will it be possible to so care for these animals,
and many others like them, that they will not only be a stock from
which to replenish their races, so rapidly vanishing from the continent,
but a source of constant instruction and recreation for the people.

The department of living animals has served an important purpose
jn aiding to bring about the establishment by Congress of a National
Zoological Park, for the public interest manifested in the collection,
forcibly emphasized the general desire and need for such an institution
founded on a liberal scale. During the period when the Zoological
Park proposition was before the Fiftieth Congress, the Secretary con-
sidered that the curator of this department, Mr. Hornaday, could not
render more important service than by explaining to Members the de-
tails of the plan proposed, and he was accordingly directed to devote
a portion of his time to that duty.

The actual accommodations provided for the living animals are
necessarily of the most temporary character, and do not in the slightest
degree indicate the proper construction of permanent improvements of
this kind in a first-class zoological garden. At present a large num-
ber of living quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles are crowded together in
one small and ill-ventilated building heated by steam, which, during
exhibition hours, is usually filled with visitors to an uncomfortable ex-
tent. It will be a great boon to the public and to the animals com-
posing the collection as well, when the latter can be transferred to the
Zoological Park and provided with suitable accommodations. Under
the circumstances it is very desirable that this should be accomplished
at the earliest date possible.

The total number of living specimens received during the year was
271, of which 126 were gifts, 37 were deposited, and 8 purchased. The
final catalogue entry on June 30, 1889, was 341, which represents the
total number of specimens received since the collection was begun. In
spite of the disadvantages the curator and his two assistants have la-
bored under in the care of this collection, it is gratifying to be able to
report that during the year the losses by death have been almost wholly
confined to the small and least valuable animals; and, with the excep-
tion of an antelope which was presented by Senator Stanford and died
before it had time to recover from the effects of its long journey, all the
large and most valuable specimens are alive and in good health,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. nay |

it is well to direct attention to the fact that Congress has as yet made
no special appropriation for the care of these animals, which, with their
food, represents a considerable sum, ill spared from the limited appro-
priation at the disposal of the Secretary for the increase and preserva-
tion of the collections, on which so many other pressing demands are

made.
ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

In my previous report I stated that a bill had been introdueed by
Senator Beck to create, under the care of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, a zoological garden on Rock Creek, where these animals
might not only form the subject of study, but be expected to increase
aS they do not in ordinary captivity ; and I gave the amendment to the
sundry civil appropriation bill, reported by Senator Morrill, which
was substantially the same as the bill of Senator Beck.

For reasons which may be found in my letter to the chairman of the
Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, quoted later, I gave much
time and labor in the interests of this measure, at first without success,
the House Committee on Appropriations having reported its non-conecur-
rence in the Zoological Park amendment, and, after along debate, which
occupied the attention of the House through a considerable portion of
the 12th of September, 1888, the motion to concur was defeated. In
the subsequent conference on the sundry civil bill, the Senate con-
ferees agreed that the amendment should be stricken out, so that the
bill was lost.

In pursuance of what seemed to me a public duty, I did not accept
this defeat of the bill as final, but brought the matter again before the
attention of Congress.

On the 18th of January, 1889, at the request of the Hon. S. Dibble,
I addressed a letter to him as chairman of the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, to which had been referred a bill of the House,
introduced by the Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, of similar purport to
that introduced in the Senate. This letter the committee made the basis
of its recommendation for the passage of the bill in the following words:

REPORT to accompany bill H. R. 11810,

The Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, to which was re-
ferred the bill (H. R. 11810) “for the establishment of a Zoological
Park in the District of Columbia,” having had the same under consid-
eration, respectfully submits the following report:

Appended hereto is a letter of Prof. 8S. P. Langley, Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, portraying the necessity of such a park and
the advantages to be derived from its establishment; and, for reasons
therein set forth, your committee respectfully recommends the passage
of the bill.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C., January 18, 1889.

My Dear Sir: I write what follows in accordance with the sugges-
tion of your yesterday’s letter, intending it for your consideration and
that of the committee.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

From all parts of the country, for many years, presents of live ani-
mals have been made to the Government through the Smithsonian In-
stitution or the Museum; but the absence of any appropriation for their
care has led to their being sent away (though most reluctantly) to in-
crease the collections of the zoological parks in Philadelphia, New York,
London, and other cities. It should be better known than it is that
everywhere through the country there is a disposition on the part of
private individuals to give to the Government in this way, and without
any expectation of return, remarkable specimens, which the donor (very
commonly a poor man) sometimes refuses advantageous pecuniary offers
for, and it seems hard to decline gifts made in such a spirit, or, accept-
ing them, to give them away again.

But little over a year ago I gave instructions that these live speci-
mens should be retained temporarily, as an experiment, and although a
very few have been purchased, the collection, which is a subject of so
much local popular interest, has been thus formed, substantially by gift,
within perhaps fifteen months, and this though many proffers have been
declined for want of means to care for them. 1am persuaded that, if
it were generally known that the Government would receive and care
for such gifts, within a very few years the finest collection of American
animals in the world might be made here in this way, with compara-
tively no expenditure for purchase.

Among the many interested in the incipient collection was Senator
Beck, whose bill for the formation of a zoological park was brought
before the Senate on April 23, 1888. The writer directed the Senator’s
attention to the fact that a piece of ground singularly suitable, by the
variety of its features, to the provision for the wants of all the different
kinds of animals, existed in tho picturesque valley of Rock Creek in
the part nearest to the city. Here not only the wild goat, the mountain
sheep and their congeners would find the rocky cliffs which are their
natural home, but the beavers brooks in which to build their dams; the
buffalo places of seclusion in which to breed and replenish their dying
race; aquatic birds and beasts their natural home, and in general all
animals would be provided for on a site almost incomparably better
than any now used for this purpose in any other capital in the world.

With this is the pre-eminently important consideration that the imme-
diate neighborhood to the city would make it accessible not only to the
rich, but to the poor, and therefore a place of recreation to the great
mass of the residents, as well as to the hundreds of thousands of citi-
zens from all parts of the country who now annually visit the eapital.

It may be added that, so far as is known to the writer, all those in-
terested in the desirable but larger plan fora public park along the
whole Rock Creek region—that is to say, all those acquainted with the
beauties and advantages of the site—regard the establishment of the pro-
posed zoological park there with favor. It is very difficult for any one
who has not visited the region to understand its singularly attractive
character, due to the good fortune which has preserved its picturesque
features intact urtil now, although the growing city is sweeping around
and enveloping it.

The Smithsonian Institution has not customarily received with favor
the propositions continually made it to place different local or national
interests under its charge, but the very special reasons which seem in
this case to enable it to at once secure a home and city of refuge for the
vanishing races of the continent, and a place for the health and recrea-
tion of the inhabitants of the city, and citizens of the United States,
together with an opportunity for the carrying out an enterprise of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

national scientific value, and the formation of what, as regards its site,
at least, is. the finest zoological garden in existence—all these consider-
ations have moved it to see in this an opportunity to carry out its legit-
imate work, ‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men. ”

W hen, therefore, Senator Beck made ithe understanding that the Smith-
sonian Institution’ would accept the charge of such a park, the primary
condition on which he would undertake to recommend it to Congress,
the Secretary felt authorized to say that he believed it propable that
the proposition would be favorably viewed by the regents, and, the
matter once brought before Congress, he has not disguised his own
interest in the success of the measure.

The bill, brought in by Mr. Breckinridge in the House (and by Sen-
ator Morrill in the Senate), appropriates: 3200,000 for the purchase of
not less than 100 acres of land. The land actually most desired for the
zoological park covers about 120 acres, being precisely that portion of
the Kock Creek Valley which will be soonest destroyed, as regards its
picturesque and attractive features, by the laying out of streets and
lots. Nevertheless, and largely owing to the very fact that the pict-
uresqueness of the locality implies the existence of rocks, precipices,
and valleys, which it would cost much to level and fill in, this land ean
still be obtained at rates which, considering its neighborhood to the
city, are remarkably cheap. The most thorough examination that I
have been able to make, the testimony of various real-estate experts
and others, have satisfied me that the purchase may and will be com-
pleted for somewhat less than the sum named in the appropriation, even
leaving a small margin for the erection of a preliminary shelter for the
animals. .

I beg most respectfully to urge upon the attention of the committee
the fact that itis at once the strength and weakness of this measure
that, so far as is known, it is an entirely disinterested one, the real-
estate holders in the vicinity being generally indifferent or opposed to
it, for reasons which can be explained, if desired, and that it is being
thus pressed upon Congress by those who have the measure at heart,
because anything that is done must be done soon. It is probable that
within a year or two more, the good fortune which has kept this singu-
larly interesting spot intact, while the growing city is encircling it, will
protect it no longer. It is not the mere space on the ap which is to
be secured, but natural advantages which have no relation to the nunm-
ber of acres, and which can not “be restored if once destr oyed, since it
is not in the power of Congress itself by any expenditure of money to
recreate a rock or a tree.

I am, very respectfully, yours,
S. P. LANGLEY,

Hon. SAMUEL DIBBLE, Secretary.

House of Representatives.

It appears, however, that this recommendation could not be brought
to the consideration of Congress in season for action, and at nearly the
same time Senator Edmunds introduced an amendment to the District
bill. There were at this time two measures being pressed upon the
attention of Congress, one for the creation of a national park, inelud-
ing a thousand or more acres upon Rock Creek, extending far beyond
the limits of the proposed zoological park, and requiring a large ex-
penditure not for buildings but for lands, a measure with which the
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Smithsonian Institution was not concerned; the other a much more
limited scheme for the zoological park, which latter it was understood
in Congress was to be placed under the Smithsonian Institution.

Under these circumstances the honorable Mr. Edmunds introduced
an amendment to the District of Columbia bill, as follows :

AMENDMENT intended to be proposed by Mr. Edmunds to the bill (H. R. 11651)

making appropriations to provide for the expenses of the government of the District

of Columbia for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety,
and for other purposes, viz: Insert the following:

‘“‘ For the establishment of a zoological park in the District of Colum-
bia, two hundred thousand dollars, to be expended under and in accord-
ance with the provisions following, that is to say:

“ That, in order to establish a zoological park in the District of Co-
lumbia, for the advancement of science and the instruction and recrea-
tion of the people, a commission shall be constituted, composed of three
persons, namely: The Secretary of the Interior, the president of the
board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, which shall be known and designated as
the commission for the establishment of a zoological park.

‘¢That the said commission is hereby authorized and directed to make
an inspection of the country along Rock Creek, between Massachusetts
avenue extended and where said creek is crossed by the road leading
west from Brightwood crosses said creek, and to select from that dis-
trict of country such a tract of land, of not less than one hundred acres,
which shall include a section of the creek, as said commission shall
deem to be suitable and appropriate for a zoological park.

‘That the said commission shall cause to be made a careful map of
said zoological park, showing the location, quantity, and character of
each parcel of private property to be taken for such purpose, with the
names of the respective owners inscribed thereon, and the said map
shall be filed and recorded in the public records of the District of Co-
lumbia; and from and after that date the several tracts and parcels of
land embraced in such zoological park shall be held as condemned for
public uses, subject to the payment of just compensation, to be deter-
mined by the said commission and approved by the President of the
United States, provided that such compensation be accepted by the
owner or owners of the several parcels of land.

‘* That if the said commission shall be unable to purchase any portion
of the land so selected and condemned within thirty days after such
condemnation, by agreement with the respective owners, at the price
approved by the President of the United States, it shall, at the expira-
tion of such period of thirty days, make application to the supreme
court of the District of Columbia, by petition, at a general or special
term, for an assessment of the value of such land, and said petition
shall contain a particular description of the proper ty selected and con-
demned, with the name of the owner or owners thereof, and his, her, or
their residences, as far as the same can be ascertained, together with a
copy of the recorded map of the park; and the said’ court is hereby
authorized and required, upon such application, without delay, to notify
the owners and occupants of the land and to ascertain and assess the

value of the land so selected and condemned by appointing three com-
missioners to appraise the value or values thereof, and to return the
appraisement to the court; and when the values of such land are thus
ascertained, and the President shall deem the same reasonable, said
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 31

values shall be paid to the owner or owners, and the United States
shall be deemed to have a valid title to said lands.

“That the said commission is hereby authorized to call upon the
Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey or the Director of the
Geological Survey to make such surveys as may be necessary to carry
into effect the provisions of this section; and the said officers are
hereby authorized and required to make such surveys under the direc-
tion of said commission.”

The amendment of Senator Edmunds was understood to be offered
in a spirit entirely f riendly to the interests of this Institution, but it
differs from that reported from the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, in omitting the name of the Regents, in placing the appro-
priation under those for the District, in removing from the Commis-
sion the power to lay out the land, aud in extending the limits within
which they had choice, to the military road, in this, as in other respects,
resembling the limits of the larger scheme of the national park, as
generally proposed. Onthe 28th of February the Edmunds amendment
passed substantially as above given, and by the President’s approval
of the District bill, became a law on Mareh 2.*

In view of the fact that the zoological park will probably in any case
be the ultimate place of deposit for the living collections now under
the charge of the Regents, and that their secretary is named as one of
the commissioners for effecting the purchase, it seems proper to add a
brief statement of the work done by the commission, which, after per-
sonally and carefully inspecting the whole course of the stream from
Massachusetts avenue to Military road, about 4 miles above the city,
found no district so desirable for the single purpose of a zoological
park as that lying between Woodley Lane and Klingle Bridge, and des-
ignated in the original bill of Senator Morrill; and the commissioners
have proceeded to condemn a tract of 166 acres of the remarkably varied
and picturesque country whose character is described in the secretary’s
letter to the chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds already cited.

The condemnation is not complete without the President’s approval,
which had not been given at the date of the completion of the fiscal

“Extracts from the Congressional Record. Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, states,
““T append the report of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds that the
record may show the exact object in view. There is absolute protection from job-
bery in the fact that this isto be under the supervision of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution.” Mr. Dibble says in the same debate, ‘‘We are proud of the Smithsonian,
and the Smithsonian has already, by gift, not purchase, the nucleus of a collection,
and Tam informed by the Secretary of the Smithsonian that this place furnishes the
right kind of location for the propagation and perpetuation of these rapidly disap-
pearing species of American animals, while at the same time it will serve the pur-
poses of a public park.” Mr. Dibble continued, ‘I am informed that the inquiries,
estimates, and offers indicate that the 120 acres which is included in the design now
in front of the reporter’s desk [referring to a large map showing that part of the
creek between Woodley Lane and Klingle road, which the Morrill bill placed under
the caré of the Regents] can be purchased for something less than $200,000, etc.”
oD REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

year, but I may be allowed to so far anticipate a statement properly
belonging to a later report as to say that this approval has since been
given, and that the land will almost undoubtedly become the property
of the Government. The commission has no power to lay out the land,
and has no instruction from Congress as to its ultimate destination,
owing, it may well be supposed, to the general supposition in the House
that the bill as voted contained a clause placing it under the care of the
Smithsonian Institution.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The Statue to Professor Baird.—In recognition of the distinguished
services of the late Professor Baird, a bill was introduced in the Senate
of the United States, and passed by that body February 10, 1888,
making an appropriation for the erection of a bronze statue to com-
memorate his merits. This bill was referred, in the House of Represen-
tatives, to the Committee on the Library, but was not reported. It is
hoped that this important subject will, during the coming session, re-
ceive the attention which it merits. An appropriation of $25,000 was
made by Congress for the benefit of the widow of the late Secretary,
whose life had been so unselfishly devoted to the service of the nation.

Art Collections.—I alluded in a previous report to the fact that a very
valuable collection of art objects had been promised to the Smithsonian
Institution. The intending donor is understood to contemplate the
transfer of the collection at no very remote period, the principal condi-
tion being that the Institution shall provide a suitable fire-proof build-
ing for it.

Upon the representations of the agent of the Institution in Europe, as
to the value of the collection and as to the desire of its owner to see
your Secretary in order to arrange for the formal transfer, the writer
made a brief visit to France last July, for the purpose of such confer-
ence and arrangement, but illness on the owner’s part has delayed ac-
tion, so that the Secretary is not able, as he had hoped to be, to lay the
matter more fully before the Regents at their present meeting.

Assignment of rooms for scientific work.—During the past year the
use of rooms in the Smithsonian building has been continued to the
Coast and Geodetic Survey for pendulum experiments, and a room has
been assigned to the use of the Zoological Park Commission.

Toner lecture fund.—The Secretary of the Institution is ex officio
chairman of the board of trustees. The fund, consisting partly of
Washington real estate and partly of Government bonds, has an esti-
mated value of about $3,000. A lecture was delivered on May 29, in
the hall of the Museum, by Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia, on “A
Clinical Study of the Skull,” the first delivered under this fund for sey:
eral years,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

Grants and subscriptions.—In accordance with the precedents estab-
lished by your first Secretary for encouraging meritorious scientific en-
terprises, undertaken without view to pecuniary gain, a subscription of
twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal, edited by Dr. B. A. Gould,
has been continued.

Privilege of the floor of the House of Representatives—Owing to the
lamented death of the Hon. S.S. Cox, no further action appears to have
been taken by the House in reference to a bill introduced by him to con-
fer the privilege of the floor on the Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitution.

Smithsonian grounds.—At the request of the Director of the Geologi-
cal Survey, permission was granted to place stones for a base line 300
feet on B street, south, to be used as a standard of comparison for tape
lines.

American Historical Association.—Reference was made in the last re-
port to a bill introduced in the Senate to incorporate the Historical As-
sociation and to connect it with the Smithsonian [nstitution. Congress
has since passed the act organizing the association.

Stereotyping.—All the stereotype plates belonging to the Institution
have been brought from Philadelphia to Washington and stored in the
basement of the building.

I have elsewhere alluded to the fact that the practice of stereotyping
the bulletins and proceedings of the Washington scientific societies Las
been discontinued.

Temporary shed.—I have also elsewhere alluded to the purpose of
putting up in the Smithsonian grounds a temporary shelter for instru-
ments and apparatus, which may at the same time permit of some astro-
physical observations being made. This, however, is only a temporary
expedient, and if the Regents ever sanction the erection of an observa-
tory for this purpose it will be necessary to place it in some very quiet
locality far removed from all tremor. Such a locality exists in the new
zoological park, but while *he action of Congress in regard to the pur-
chase of the latter was still uncertain I addressed a letter to the honor-
able the Secretary of War, asking permission in case it were found de-
sirable to occupy a vacant tract of land in the southern portion of the
cemetery at Arlington for this purpose. His assent was given in the
following letter:

WAR DEPARTMENT,
Washington City, January 9, 1889.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 18th ultimo, requesting that the Smithsonian Institution be author-
ized to occupy a site in the Arlington national cemetery, as indicated
in a memorandum and plat inclosed by you, for the purposes of an
astro-physical laboratory. aa

H, Mis. 2243

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

In reply I beg to advise you that there is no objection to the occupa-
tion, in the manner stated, of a piece of ground not exceeding 2 acres,
indicated on a plat which may be examined in the office of the Quarter-
master-General, provided that the ground in question be vacated
whenever it is required by this Department.

Very respectfully,
Wm. C. ENDICOT?,
Secretary of War.
Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary Snrithsonian Institution.

The plat in question shows the location of the lot near the center and
highest part of the unoccupied wooded ridge, near the colored soldiers’
portion of the cemetery. The site, however, is so distant that I should
not propose to occupy it while any better could be procured.

Reception.—I have alluded in my previous report to the habit of the
first Secretary of giving receptions from time to time in the rooms of
the Institution and to the fact that though these rooms are now de-
voted to official purposes, the writer, desiring to maintain the tradi-
tions of this hospitality, had used them once for a similar purpose. He
has again employed them in this year on the 18th of April for a recep-
tion where it was sought to unite the old and new friends of the Insti-
tution.

Correspondence.—The Institution receives annually inquiries from all
parts of the country for information on topics often most incongruous,
but usually connected with science, which are submitted to the Secre-
tary. None of these inquiries is left unanswered, and the burden of
this correspondence is very considerable. Ithas always been regarded,
however, as incumbent on the Institution to reply to them as a part of
its function in the distribution of knowledge, and a good deal of labor
which does not appear, continues to be devoted to this end.

U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The main features of the work of the National Museum are briefly
referred to in this place. They are fully described elsewhere, in the
separate volume forming the report of Dr. Goode, Assistant Secretary
in charge of the Museum, and the Curators of its several departments.

Classified service of the Museum.—In response to a resolution of the
Senate asking for a‘ schedule of the classified service of the officers and
employés of the National Museum,” a letter was addressed by me on
March 2 to Hon. John J. Ingalls, President pro tempore of the Senate,
transmitting a schedule which upon very careful deliberation repre-
sents the actual necessities of the service.

This schedule and the letter of transmittal were printed as miscel-
laneous document No, 92, Fiftieth Congress, second session, and are
here re-printed: "
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

LETTER of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in reference to Senate reso-
lution of October 8, 1888, asking for ‘fa schedule of the classified service of the
officers and employés of the National Museum.”

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
March 2, 1889.

Sir: In response to the Senate resolution asking for ‘a Sclrodate of
the classified service of the officers and employés of the National Mu-
seum,” I have the honor to transmit the accompanying schedule, which
represents the present actual necessities of the service.

The service for the fiscal year of 1887~88 was reported upon in a let-
ter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, dated December
1, 1888 (H. R. Mis. Doc. No. 55, Fiftieth Congress, second session).

In this the aggregate expenditures for service were shown to have
been $122,750.47, of which sum $97,493.32 was paid from the appro-
priation for preservation of collections, $19.203.79 from that for fur-
niture and fixtures, and $6,053.36 from that for heacing, lighting, and
electrical and telephonic service.

A schedule of the number of persons employed in the various depart-
ments of the Museum was also given in this letter (pages 4, 9, 11).
This schedule should, however, be regarded only as an approximate
one, since many of the employés were actually engaged only a part of
the year, and others were temporarily transferred to the pay-rolls of
the Cineinnati Exhibition and were engaged in special work in connec-
tion with that exhibition.

It is estimated that the aggregate expenditures for services for the
present fiscal year (1888~89) will be $129,710, of which amount $103,000
will be paid from the appropriation for preservation of collections,
$20, 000 from that for furniture and fixtures, and $5,710 from that for
heating , lighting, and electrical and telephone service.

In the schedule herewith transmitted it is shown that for the proper
working of the Museum the amount required for services would be as
follows:

The increase in the total expenditure, as indicated, is due partly to
the addition of a number of officers to the scientific staff, and also to
the necessity for a few additional clerks, and a considerable number of
watchmen, laborers, cleaners, and messengers, whose services are essen-
tial to the safety of the collections, as well as to provide for the clean-
liness and proper care of the buildings and for the comfort of visitors.

The rates of pay indicated are in most cases considerably lower than
are customarily allowed for a similar service in the Executive Depart-
ments.

In the schedule now presented, expenditure for services only is taken
into consideration,
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

No attempt has been made to present the needs of the Museum in
regard to the purchase or collecting of specimens, the purchase of gen-
eral supplies, preservatives, materials for mounting and installing col-
lections, books, exhibition cases, furniture, fuel, and gas, the mainte-
nance of the heating and lighting appliances, freight and cartage, trav-
elling expenses of collectors and agents, ete.

For these various purposes the expenditure in the last fiscal year
amounted to $45,249.53, and that for the present fiscal year will, it is
estimated, amount to about $48,000, asum very inadequate to the needs
of the service.

It does not include the expenditures for printing the labels and blanks
and proceedings and bulletins of the Museum, for which the appropri-
ation for many years past has been $10,000, and for which I have asked
$15,000 for the coming fiscal year.

I must not omit to call your attention to the fact that, owing to the
peculiar constitution of the Museum as a scientific establishment, it has
hitherto been possible to secure a special economy, owing to the fact
that its officers and employés are not scheduled as in the Executive De-
partments.

In thus presenting, in obedience to the request of the Senate, a sched-
ule of a durable organization of the service, | wish to remark, emphati-
cally, that there are pressing needs in other directions—needs that merit
the serious consideration of Congress, in order that the National Mu-
seum may be enabled to maintain a satisfactory position in comparison
with those of European nations.

I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,
S. P. LANGLEY,

Hon. JOHN J. INGALLS, Secretary.

President, pro tempore, of the Senate.

In presenting these schedules to Congress I have shown what would
be the cost of the administration of the Museum, in respect to salaries
alone, if it were organized after the manner of the Executive Depart-
ments of the Government.

The salary list alone amounts to $199,121, and the amount expended
in the previous fiscal year for other purposes was $45,000, a sum which
might most advantageously be doubled.

Iam not prepared at present to recommend the adoption of such a
schedule of classified service, since I am of the opinion that the Museum
at the present time has greater need of money to be used in the acqui-
sition of new material by purchase and exploration. The opportunities
for making collections are yearly growing less, and many things which
ean now be done at trifling expense will in a few years be imprac-
ticable.

ee ee ee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oo

The system of appropriation for specific objects, without designating
the number of employés or the amounts of their salaries, has in the
past been found to be economical and efficient, and although the neces-
sity of the change to a classified service may arise at some later time,
I trust that if may be deferred for the present.

The amount asked for in the estimates for the fiseal year of 1891-92,
for the “ preservation of collections,” is intended to provide for a certain
amount of increase of the collections, and also to provide for the pay-
ment of certain salaries.

Increase of the collections.—At the close of the fiscal year (June 30,
1889) a very careful estimate showed that the collections were sixteen
times as great in number of specimens as in the year 1882. I desire to
call your attention especially to the statements bearing upon this point.

The Museum, as I have already said, is growing as it is fitting that
the National Museum of a great country should grow, and it is not only
necessary to care for what is already here, but to provide for the recep-
tion and display of the great collections which will unquestionably be
received in the immediate future.

The extent and character of the accessions during the year.is shown
in the appended table, from which it appears that the total number of
specimens in the Museum is now not far from 3,000,000 :

Catalogue entries.—The number of entries made in the catalogues of
the various departments in the Museum during the year has been
23,171.

The registrar states that 16,625 boxes and packages* have been re.
ceived during the year and entered upon the transportation records
of the Smithsonian Institution. Of this number 2,182 contained speci-
mens for the Museum.

PRINCIPAL ACCESSIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

Among the collections received during the year, those from the U.S.
Geological Survey and the Bureau of Ethnology are especially note-
worthy. The material transferred by the U.S. Fish Commission to the
National Museum included two very valuable collections made by the
steamer Albatross during the voyage from Washington to San Fran-
cisco and while cruising off the coast of Alaska.

The accessions received during the year from general sources are
fully up to the standard of previous years. Among the most important
are the following :

Ethnological.—Collections from Dr. James Grant Bey, of Cairo, Egypt,
and from Mr. W. W. Rockhill, formerly connected with the German
legation in Pekin, the former collection from Egypt, the latter illus-
trative of the religious practices, occupations, and amusements of vari-
ous peoples in different parts of China, Thibet, and Turkestan; a col-
lection of oriental seals from Mrs. Anna Randall Diehl, of New York
City; casts of Assyrian and Egyptian objects obtained by Prof. Paul
Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University.

The valuable co-operation of the Bureau of Ethnology is evidenced
in the transmission of a large and interesting collection of pottery,
stone implements, woven fabrics, shells, beans, etc., collected by Major
J. W. Powell, Arthur P. Davis, Gerard Fowke, Dr. E. Boban, Dr. H. C.
Yarrow, James Stevenson, Dr. J. 8. Taylor, C. C. Jones, James D. Mid-
dleton, General G. P. Thruston, James P. Tilton, H. P. Hamilton, Victor
Mindeleff, H. W. Henshaw, G. H. Hurlbut, W. W. Adams, De L. W. Gill,
William A. Hakes, W. H. Holmes, and Charles L. R. Wheeler. This col-
lection was the result of personal research in the following localities:
Mexico, Peru, New Mexico, Wisconsin, California, Arizona, Alabama,
Georgia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Massachusetts, New York, and Vir-
ginia.

Archeological.—Collection of aboriginal pottery from Lake Apopka,
Florida, contributed by Dr. Featherstonehaugh, and a collection of simi-
lar material from Perdido Bay, Alabama, presented by Mr. F. H. Par-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

the most valuable collectious received during the year were obtained
through the co-operation of Government officials, and are referred to at
length in the report on the Museum for this year.

Co-operation of Departments and Bureaus of the Government.—The Mu-
seum has received, as in past years, many valuable contributions from
United State consuls, officers of the Army and the Navy, and through
the co-operation of the Departments and Bureaus of the Government.

Through the courtesy of the Department of State the work of col-
lectors in foreign countries has been greatly facilitated. The Secretary
of the Treasury has issued several permits for the free entry of Museum
material.

The Secretary of Agriculture has expressed his w'llingness to co-
operate with the National Museum in the matter of making a forestry
exhibit, and Dr. B. E, Fernow has been appointed honorary curator of
the collection.

By direction of the Postmaster-Generai the Superintendent of the
Dead Letter Office has been instructed to inform the Museum of the
receipt in his office of specimens which might be of value for addition
to the collections.

The Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has, as in pre-
vious years, aided our work in many ways.

Photographic exhibit—A collection intended to show the uses of
photography was prepared by Mr. T. W. Smillie, of the National Mu-
seum, for exhibition at the Cincinnati Exposition. This collection in-
cluded valuable contributions of photographs from Prof. EB. C. Picker-
ing, of Harvard University, Mr. J. W. Osborne, of Washington, and
froin several officers connected with the Government service, notably
the Light-House Board, the Army Medical Museum, and the proving
ground at Annapolis. At the close of the Exposition this collection
was returned to the Museum, and is now being prepared, in connection
with additional material which has since been received, for permanent
exhibition. It is intended that the scope of this exhibit shall be en-
larged so as to take the form of a historical collection in which shal]
be shown examples of every photographie process that has been in-
vented, together with the appliances used, beginning with the photo-
graph of the solar spectrum as made by Sheele in 1777. Considerable
material has been already gathered which will be incorporated in this
collection. ‘The first camera made in the United States has been ac-
quired by purchase, <A stereoscope containing daguerreotypes and
transparencies by the old albumen process on glass has been presented
by Mrs. E. J. Stone. The Scoville Manufacturing Company of New
York has presented a series of cameras showing the latest improve-
ments, and from the Eastman Dry Plate Company, of Rochester, N. Y.,
A6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

has been received a Kodak camera, together with a’series of enlarged
photographs illustrating its use.

Distribution of duplicate specimens.—Duplicate specimens, to the num-
ver of 11,382, were distributed during the year among museums, colleges,
and individuals. The following table shows the character and extent of
these distributions :

The decrease in the number of specimens thus given away, as com-
pared with last year, is accounted for by the fact that only 2,072 speci-
meus of marine invertebrates have been distributed this year, while
last year 24,750 specimens of this class were presented to applicants.
Eliminating this class of specimens, the number distributed this year is
double that oflast year. The number of requests for duplicate specimens
increase yearly. It is boped that in the future it may be possible for the
Museum to extend its usefulness in this important part of the work.
The material now available for distribution is quite Inadequate to supply
thedemand. The curators of mineralogy and of geology obtained a large
quantity of material during the past summer for this special purpose.
As soon as it has been classified and arranged into sets, an endeavor
will be made to fill the many applications for mineralogical and litho-
logical material now awaiting action. The matter of making up sets of
duplicate bird-skins is now receiving careful attention, there being
much of such material available for distribution.

Labels.—During the year, 3,991 labels were printed, chiefly for use in
the departments of metallurgy, materia medica, and birds.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

Aceessions to the library.—The number of publications added to the
library during the year is 6,052, of which 618 are volumes of more than
100 pages, 903 are pamphlets, 4,345 are parts of regular serial:, and 158
charts. The most important accession was the gift by the heirs of the
late Dr. Isaac Lea, consisting of 137 volumes, 276 “ parts,” and 693
pamphlets, and including a nearly complete series of the “ Proceedings
of the Zoological Society of London.” There are now nineteen sectional
libraries attached to the several curatorships in the Museum.

Publications of the Museum.—The issue of Museum publications during
the year has been unusually small, owing to the pressure of Congres-
sional work at the Printing Office during the long Congressional session
of 1888, which caused the Museum work to be set aside. A number of
special publications are partially completed, and will be issued soon
after the beginning of the next fiscal year.

During the year volume 10 of Proceedings of the U. S. National
Museum (1887) was issued. This contains vill + 771 pages and 39
plates. It includes 78 papers by 26 authors, 10 of whom are officers of
the Museum. Nearly three-fourths of the papers relate to birds and
fishes. In the appendix is printed a catalogue of the exhibit prepared
by Mr. 8. R. Koehler, in charge of the section of graphic arts, for the
Ohio Valley Centenial Exposition. Special papers were prepared by
the curators of several departments, in connection with the exhibits for
‘this exposition, which will be reprinted in Section ITI of the Museum
report for the present year.

Bulletin 33 of the United States National Museum, “A catalogue of
minerals and their synomyms alphabetically arranged for the use of
museums” by Prof. T. Egleston, Ph. D., of Columbia College, was issued
in May. This volume contains a complete catalogue of the names of
minerals and their synonyms, and will be of much value to students
of mineralogy and others interested in this science.

The assistant secretary in charge of the Museum has submitted a
statement reviewing the history of the publications of the Museum, and
making certain suggestions with a view to increasing the extent of the
editions and to the establishment of a systematic method of distribu-
tion. From this statement I quote the following remarks and recom-
mendations relating to the Proceedings and Bulletin:

“The Proceedings was established for the purpose of securing prompt
publication of the discoveries in the Museum. In order to secure this
object the printing has been done, signature by signature, as fast as mat-
ter was prepared. A certain number of signatures has always been dis-
tributed, as soon as published, to scientific institutions and specialists.

The number of sets of signatures thus distributed has been in the neigh-
borhood of 200.

« This method of publication has seemed to be to some extent waste-
ful, and it is thought that equally good results may be secured by dis-
tributing a certain number of the advance copies in the form of authors’
extras. In making arrangements for the printing of Volume XII it
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was decided that out of the edition of 1,200 copies, 100 should be de-
livered in signatures as fast as printed, and 300 in extras or reprints,
in paper covers, of which 50 are to be given to the authors and the
remainder distributed to specialists in the various departments to which
the papers relate, who are not otherwise provided with the publica-
tion; while the 800 remaining volumes are to be bound previous to dis-
tribution.

‘¢In special instances, where a given paper in the Proceedings is be-
lieved to possess great general interest, it has been customary to print
a considerable number of extra copies.

‘‘The publication of the Proceedings and the Bulletin was at first
paid for from the printing fund of the Interior Department, with which
the Museum was at that time in close relations in respect to financial
matters. Subsequently it was paid for from the fund for the printing
of Museum labels, estimates for which were annually submitted by the
Secretary of the Institution. The amount asked for was usu ‘lly $10,000.
In the Book of Estimates the Museum appeared as asking a certain sum
for printing, though the money was actually included in the gross sum
allotted to the Interior Department as a printing fund.

‘In 1882,a separate appropriation was made for the first time, in
these words: ‘For the National Museum, for printing labels and blanks
and for the Bulletins and annual volumes of the Proceedings of the
Museum, ten thousand dollars,’

‘In 1888 the appropriation for the fiscal year 1888-9 was made in the
same words, but was not included, as heretofore, in the appropriations
for the Department of the Interior.

‘¢The edition of the earlier volumes of the Proceedings and Bulletins
was usually only 1,000, of which a portion was distributed by the De-
partment of the Interior and a portion by the Museum. The number
received by the Museum being sometimes 500 and sometimes as few as
250. The edition placed at the disposal of the Museum being so small,
and withal so uncertain as to extent, the distribution was always of
necessity informal, and no effort was made to supply a regular list
of institutions and specialists. A considerable number was expended
in the work of the Museum, and the remainder were sent to corres-
pondents of the Museum in exchange for publications, for specimens,
and incidentally to such institutions as might apply for copies, as well
as to individuals, especially students who made it evident that they
were in a position to make good use of the books.

‘¢ Formal publication was undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution,
it being the intention that the first cost of composition and electrotyping
having been provided for by the special Congressional appropriation,
the Smithsonian Institution should avail itself of the electrotype plates
and use them in making up certain volumes of the Miscellaneous Col-
lections. The papers published in the Proceedings and Bulletins of
the Museum were of precisely the same character which, since 1862,
had made up the great majority of the most important papers in
the Miscellaneovs Collections. The Institution undertook to print
an edition of 1,200 copies in the form of volumes of the Miscellaneous
Collections and to distribute them to the principal libraries of the
world. This was, at the time, regarded as advantageous, since the
cost of composition and electrotyping made up at least two-thirds of
the cost of the edition of 1,200, while the miscellaueous distribution,
for which the Institution, in the case of similar publications printed
at its own expense, had been accustomed to provide, was now already
arranged for out of the preliminary issue of several hundred copies
paid tor from the Museum fund. —
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

“The first four volumes of the Proceedings and the first sixteen num-
bers of the Bulletin were published in this manner.

“Since 1883 no publication of the Bulletins has been made, and none
has been made in the case of the Proceedings since 1882.

“There remain unpublished eleven volumes of the Proceedings and
twenty-one numbers of the Bulletin—in all, enough to make ten thick
volumes of the Miscellaneous Collections. Possibly, by condensation
and omissions, the number might be reduced to nine volumes. If the
Institution were to undertake to print the edition of 1,000 now cus-
tomary in the case of the Miscellaneous Collections, the cost would be
not Jess than $9,000. The same amount expended by the Institution in
printing fresh matter would probably not produce more than one and
one half volumes, or at most two volumes, of Miscellaneous Collections.

“The Institution is possibly under obligations to provide for the pub-
lication of these papers, since in the advertisement to each volume of
the Bulletin as late as 1887 (Bulletin 33) appears the statement that
‘from time to time the publications of the Museum which have been
issued separately are combined together and issued as volumes of the
Miscellaneous Collections.’

“Asa matter of fact, however, the publication of an edition of 1,000
copies by the Smithsonian Institution would not really meet the neces-
sities of the case, since it would leave unsupplied a very large number
of libraries quite as deserving as those already on the distribution
list.”

It seems, in view of all these facts, that it is not desirable that
the Institution showld undertake hereafter the publication of the Mu-
seum Bulletin and Proceedings, since it is evident that these will in-
crease in bulk from year to year, and that the demand upon the Insti-
tution would very soon become too burdensome. Dr. Goode suggests
that Congress be requested to increase the appropriation for the Mu-
seum printing to $18,000 in order that an edition of 2,000 copies may be
printed in addition to the customary number. If this arrangement
should be carried out, the Smithsonian Institution would be relieved of
the responsibility of providing for the publication of these documents.
The issue of the enlarged edition would commence with volume 13 of
the Proceedings and with Bulletin 40 or 41. In considering the question
of publishing back volumes of t he Proceedings and Bulletin, Dr. Goode
remarks:

‘* When we come to the question of the publication of the back vol-
umes, volumes 1 to 4 of the Proceedings and Bulletins 1 to 16 may be
regarded as published, although not to the extent to which it would seem
desirable in the way of supplying local institutions. Of the following,
we have in hand enough to make a very fair distribution, viz: Proceed-
ings, volumes 10 and 11 and Bulletins No. 33 to 37. Of volumes 5 to 9
of Proceedings and of Bulletins 17 to 32, however, no systematic publi-
cation can be made without the printing of an additional number of
copies.

Students.—In accordance with the policy of past years, free access to
the coltections has been granted to students in the various branches of

natural history, and in many instances specimens have been lent to
specialists for comparison and study. Instruction in taxidermy has
been given to several applicants. Two of these intend to apply the
knowledge thus acquired in making collections for the Museum, namely,
Lieut. E. H. Taunt, United States consular agent to the Congo, and
Mr. Harry Perry, who expects to spend several years in Honduras.
Mr. T. W. Smillie has given instruction in photography to the follow-
ing persons: Lieut. KE. H. Taunt, Mr. W. H. Perry, Mr. Barton Bean,
Mr. Howard, Prof. Daish, and Miss Frances Bb. Johnston.

Special researches.—The special researches of the curators are re-
ferred to at length in the report of the National Museum. I may
say, in this connection, that the time which those officers are able to
devote to work of this kind is very limited, owing to the large amount
of mechanical and routine work to which, in the absence of necessary
assistance, it is necessary for them to give their personal attention.

Meetings and lectwres.—The use of the lecture hall has been granted
for lectures and meetings of scientific societies, as follows: The Na-
tional Dental Association met on July 24, 25, and 26. On the evening
of September 20 was held one of the meetings of the Medical Congress.
The American Ornithologists’ Union held its sixth congress on Novem-
ber 13, 14, and 15. A meeting of the Department of Superintendence
of the National Educational Association was held on March 6, 7, and 8.
.The National Academy of Sciences held its meetings on April 16, 17,
and 18. The Council of the American Geological Society and the Ameri-
can Committee of the International Geological Congress held business
meetings on April 19. The American Historical Association held its
fifth meeting in Washington during Christmas week; the evening ses-
sions being held at the Columbia University, the morning sessions at
the Museum.

In the Toner course Dr. Harrison Allen delivered a lecture on May
29 entitled “Clinical Study of the Skull undertaken in connection with
the Morbid Condition of the Jaws and Nasal Chambers.”

The usual course of Saturday lectures, ten in number, beginning
March 9 and ending May 11, was delivered under the direction of the
oint committee of the scientific societies of Washington.

The usual courtesies have been extended to museums and other pub-
lic institutions by the gift and loan of drawings and photographs of
specimens and copies of Museum labels.

Visitors.—The number of visitors to the Museum building is constantly
increasing. The register shows that a total number of 374,843 persons
visited the Museum during the year. This exceeds the number for last
year by 125,818, and shows an increase of more than 50 per cent. The
visitors to the Smithsonian building numbered 149,618, an increase of
46,177 over last year. ‘On March 5, owing to the crowds of visitors to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Hl

the city attending the Inauguration cermonies, no less than 86,107 per-
sons visited the Smithsonian and Museum buildings.

Personnel.—During the year a department of forestry has been estab-
lished, and with the consent of the Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. B. E.
Fernow, chief of the forestry division of the Department of Agriculture,
has been appointed its curator.

Dr. George Vasey, of the Department of Agriculture, has been ap-
pointed curator of botany, and in that capacity controls the botanical
collections in the National Museum and in the Department of Agri-
culture. Prof. Paul Haupt, curator of Oriental antiquities in the Na-
tional Museum, was designated as the representative of the Smithsonian
Institution at the Eighth International Congress of Orientalists, to meet
in Stockholm and Christiania in September. Prof. Otis T. Mason was
instructed to proceed to Europe to visit the principal ethnological mu-
seums of France, Germany, Denmark, and England, for the purpose of
making arrangements for the increase of the collections at the U.S.
National Museum, and incidentally, through the study of methods of
installation, of providing for the more effectual preservation and utiliza-
tion of these collections. Mr. Thomas Wilson was directed to proceed to
Europe to visit the principal museums of France, England, and Dublin
for the purpose of studying the methods of installation employed by
the European museums.

On August 13, Mr. Silas Stearns, of Pensacola, Fla., who for many
years has been a correspondent of the Smithsonian Institution, and has
made important collections of fishes in the Gulf of Mexico, died at
Asheville, N. C.

Explorations.—During the summer of 1888, Mr. George P. Merrill,
curator of geology, made a collecting trip to North Carolina, Pennsyl-
vania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine.
Large collections of rocks were obtained for the Museum. Mr. Thomas
Wilson, curator of prehistoric anthropology, visited mounds in Ohio,
and made interesting collections. Ensign W. L. Howard, U.S. Navy,
who, acting under orders from the Navy Department, sailed for Kotze-
bue Sound in May last, is making collections in Alaska for the National
Museum. Prof. O. P. Jenkins, of De Pauw University, Indiana, is vis-
iting the Hawaiian Islands for the purpose of collecting fishes. A series
of his specimens has been promised for the National Museum. In
Augast Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, of the U. 8S. Geoglogical Survey, visited
some of the Western States and Territories partly with a view to
making collections of minerals. These will eventually be incorporated
with the Museum collections.

Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States.—The act
of Congress directing the Executive Departments of the Government,
the Department of Agriculture, and the Smithsonian Institution (includ-

ing the National Museum and the U. S. Commission of Fish and Fisheries)
to participate in the Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and
Central States, to be held in Cincinnati from July 4 to October 27, 1888,
passed both houses of Congress and received the approval of the Presi-
dent on May 28. In addition to this, a joint resolution was adopted
in which the true intent of the act was declared, with a view to cor-
recting certain misapprehensions which had arisen in regard to the
objects for which the money appropriated by Congress in connection
with this exhibition could be legally expended. This joint resolution
was approved by the President on July 16. <A copy of the act and of
the joint resolution will be found in the report of the assistant secre-
tary for 1889, wherein is also published a full account of the exhibit
prepared under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution in accord-
ance with the terms of the act referred to. Of the $50,000 appropriated
for the Smithsonian Institution $10,000 was set apart for the U.S.
Fish Commission. About 42,000 square feet of exhibition space were
reserved for the Government exhibits, 12,000 square feet being devoted
to that of the Smithsonian Institution. The assistant secretary was
on May 29 appointed representative of the Smithsonian Institution,
and active operations for the preparation of a creditable display were
immediately commenced. It was unfortunate that only a little more
than a month intervened between the passage of the act and the open-
ing of the exhibition. The Smithsonian Institution has, however, had
a varied experience in preparing exhibits at a short notice. The first
car-load of exhibits left for Cincinnati on June 22, and the last of the
twelve car-loads which were sent was shipped on July 12. The follow-
ing departments of the National Museum were represented at the exhi-
bition, the number of square feet assigned to each being also given :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

In addition to this a special exhibit was prepared by the Bureau of
Ethnology, Maj. J. W. Powell, Director, to which 1,425 square feet were
assigned. The total number of visitors to the exhibition was 1,055,276.

Dr. Goode was unable, on account of other duties, to personally attend
the exhibition, and Mr. R. E. Earll was placed in charge of the exhibit.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in connection with the ex-
penditure of the funds appropriated by Congress for the work of pre-
paring exhibits, owing to the decisions of the special auditor appointed
to audit the exposition accounts. His objections were in every instance
finally withdrawn, and all vouchers have now, after protracted delays,
been approved by that official. An extraordinary number of points of
a trivial nature were raised, which necessitated the writing of as numer-
ous letters to answer questions which had not previously been under-
stood to come within the province of an auditor. In view of this ex-
perience it is urged that should Congress at any time direct the Smith-
sonian Institution to participate in future expositions, the law be so
framed as to require the appointment of an auditing officer who is
familiar with the demands of exhibition work. If, however, this be im-
practicable, it seems proper that the responsibility of selecting and
deciding as to what should be the character of the exhibits should be
left entirely to the judgment of the various Departments, the auditor’s
work being limited to the examination of the accounts, which should of
course be sufficiently detailed to prevent errors. Another cause of de-
lay in settling the exhibition accounts was due to the fact that the
disbursing officer was stationed at Newport, Ky., instead of Washing-
ton, where by far the greater part of the bills were contracted. The
paymaster drew checks upon the Cincinnati depository only, and this
method appeared to be unjust, since it obliged employés to wait several
days before receiving payment, and in addition to lose some part of their
money, owing to the refusal of the Treasury Departmezt in Washington
to honor the checks. The only alternative for them was to present the
checks to local banks, paying the usual discount rates.

Marietta Centennial Exposition.— By an Executive order, dated July
11, 1888, permission was granted to the heads of the departments rep-
resented at the Cincinnati Exhibition to send to the Centennial Expo-
sition at Marietta, Ohio, such objects as could be conveniently spared
either from the exhibits at Cincinnati or direct from Washington. In
accordance with this order an exhibit was prepared under the direction
of the assistant secretary. Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the Museum,
was appointed by him as his representative. Since only one day inter-
vened in this instance between the issuing of the Executive order and
the opening of the exhibition there was no time to be lost. An exhibit,
with a total weight of 7,527 pounds, was prepared and installed at
Marietta before the opening of the exhibition. The exhibit included
specimens selected from the Haida collection of ethnological objects,
lithographs of the game fishes of the United States, a series of medals,
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

photographs of public buildings in Washington, a collection of auto-
types, and a series of specimens illustrating the composition of the
human body. In addition to these a collection of models, engravings,
and paintings illustrative of the methods of transportation adopted by
the early settlers in America was selected by Mr. J. E. Watkins from
the exhibit of the department of transportation at the Cincinnati Ex-
hibition and forwarded to Marietta.

The organization of the Government Board which was charged with
preparations for the Philadelphia Exhibition was so far superior to that
of those more recently formed, that it would seem desirable that the
plan in favor at that time should be followed as far as possible should
similar work be decided upon in connection with future exhibitions.

I regret the growing tendency to withdraw for special expositions a
considerable portion of some of the most valuable parts of the collee-
tion. The Museum is now approaching a final arrangement in classifi-
cation, and the objections to this are therefore much stronger now than
some years ago when the condition of the collections was more unsettled.
The preparation for an exposition seriously impairs the work of the
Museum, while considerable damage invariably results to the collec-
tions, and often in such a degree that.it requires much time and ex-
pense to restore them. The managers of local expositions are no longer
satisfied to accept the specimens which can be most conveniently
spared, but are always anxious to have the most valuable and costly
objects. Temporary exposition buildings are never made fire-proof,
and the time is sure to come, if the present practice prevails, when
some exhibition building containing Government collections to the value
of hundreds of thousands of dollars will be destroyed. The experi-
ence of the Mexican Government in its participation at the New Orleans
Exposition, and of the Government of New South Wales in 1883, may
be cited as warnings. If, however, Congress should order in future
our participation in expositions, I would especially urge that provision
for the work be made at least six months before the date of opening.
In each instance in the past the notice has always been extremely
short, usually only a few weeks, and in one or two cases less than a
week.

I am also disposed to lay stress upon the necessity of liberal appro-
priations, which should be made with the understanding that new ma-
terial may be obtained, which shall not only replace that which has been
lost in past exhibitions, but shall enrich the Museum collections for
home use and for use in future exhibition work. If this necessity is
not recognized, the result will be that in a few years the Museum will
be greatly impoverished, not only by the destruction of material, but
also by the dissipation of the energy of its staff, which, being applied
to temporary purposes in this way, is taken away from its legitimate
work. It would indeed seem only fair that a distraction of this kind,
which affects in large degree every ofticer and employé, should be com-

pensated for by the opportunity to purchase new material which will
remain permanently the property of the Government and increase the
usefulness of the governmental Museum work.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnologic researches among the North American Indians were con-
tinued, under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in compli-
ance with acts of Congress, during the year 1888~’89. Maj. J. W. Pow-
ell, as director of the work, has furnished the following account of
operations:

A report upon the work of the year is most conveniently given under
two general heads, viz., field work and office work.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations -
and (2) general field studies, the latter being directed chiefly to arch-
ology, linguistics, and pictography.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the east-
ern United States was, as in former years, under the superintendence
of Prof. Cyrus Thomas. The efforts of the division were chiefly con-
fined to the examination of material already collected, and to the ar-
rangement and preparation for publication of the data in hand. Field
work received much less attention, therefore, than in previous years,
and was mainly directed to such investigations as were necessary to
elucidate doubtful points, and to the examination and surveys of im-
portant works which had not before received adequate attention.

The only assistants whose engagements embraced the entire year
were Mr. James D. Middleton and Mr. Henry L. Reynolds. Mr. Gerard
Fowke, one of the regular assistants, closed his connection with the
division at the end of the second month. Mr. John W. Emmert was
engaged as a temporary assistant for a few months.

During the short time he remained with the division, Mr. Fowke was
engaged in exploring certain mounds in the Scioto Valley, Ohio, a field
to which Messrs. Squier and Davis had devoted much attention. The
re-examination of this field was for the purpose of investigating certain
typical mounds which had not been thoroughly examined by those
explorers.

Mr. Middleton was employed from July to the latter part of October
in the exploration of mounds and other ancient works in Calhoun
County, Ill., a territory to which special interest attaches because it
seems to be on the border line of different archieologice districts. From
October until some time in December he was engaged at Washington
in preparing: plats of Ohio earth-works. During the next month he
made re-surveys of some of the more important inclosures in Ohio, after
which he continued work in the office at Washington until the latter
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

part of March, when he was sent to Tennessee to examine certain mound
groups, and to determine, so far as possible, the exact locations of the
old Cheroki ‘‘ Over-hill towns.” The result of this last-mentioned in-
vestigation was one of the most valuable of the year, as it indicated
that each of these ‘“ Over-hill towns” was, with possibly one unimpor-
tant exception, in the locality of a mound group.

Near the close of October Mr. Reynolds, having already examined
the inclosures of the northern, eastern, and western sections of the
mound region, was sent to Ohio and West Virginia to study the differ-
ent types found there, with reference to the chapters he is preparing
on the various forms of inclosures of the United States. While thus
engaged he explored a large mound connected with one of the typical
works in Paint Creek Valley, obtaining unexpected and important
results. The construction of this tumulus was found to be quite dif-
ferent from most of those of the same section examined by Messrs.
Squier and Davis.

Mr. Emmert devoted the few months he was employed to the suc-
cessful exploration of mounds in eastern Tennessee. Some important
discoveries were made, and additional interesting facts were ascertained
in regard to the customs of the mound builders of that section.

General field studies.—Early in the month of July Col. Garrick Mal-
lery proceeded to Maine, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, to con-
tinue investigation into the pictographs of the Abnaki and Micmac
Indians, which had been commenced in 1888. He first visited rocks on
the main-land, near Machiasport, and on Hog Island, in Holmes Bay, a
part of Machias Bay. In both localities pecked petroglyphs were
found, accurate copies of which were taken. Some of them had not
before been reported. They were probably of Abnaki origin, either of
the Penobscot or the Passamaquoddy divisions, the rocks lying on the
line of water communication between those divisions. From there he
proceeded to Kejemkoojik Lake, on the border of Queen’s and Annap-
olis counties, Nova Scotia, and resumed the work of drawing and trae-
ing the large number of petroglyphs found during the previous summer.
Perfect copies were obtained of so many of them as are amply suffi-
cient for study and comparison. These petroglyphs were etched and
were made by Miemacs. The country of the Malecites, on the St.
John’s River, New Brunswick, was next visited. No petroglyphs were
discovered, but a considerable amount of information upon the old
system of pictographs on birch bark and its use was obtained. Ilus-
trative specimens were secured, together with myths and legends as-
sisting in the elucidation of some of the pictographs which had been
obtained elsewhere.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman proceeded in July to visit the Red Lake and White
Earth Indian reservations in Minnesota. At Red Lake he obtained
copies of birch-bark records pertaining to the Midewiwin or Grand Medi-

cine Society of the Ojibwa, an order of shamans or priests professing the
power of prophesy, the cure of disease, and the ability to confer success
in the chase. The introductory portion of the ritual of this society per-
tains particularly to the Ojibwa ideas of creation. At the same place
several mnemonic charts were secured, consisting of birch-bark records
of hunting expeditions, battles with neighboring tribes ot Indians, maps,
and songs. He also investigates the former and present practice of
tattooing, and the Ojibwa works of art in colors, beads, and quills.

At White Earth Reservation two distinct charts of the Grand Medi-
cine Society were obtained, together with full explanations by two of
the chief midé or shamans, one of whom was the only fourth-degree
priest in either of the reservations. Although a considerable amount
of difference between these three charts is apparent, the principles are
common to them all as well as the general course of the initiation of
candidates. Aninteresting fact appears in the survival of archaic forms
in the charts and ritual, seemingly indicating a considerable antiquity.
A large number of mnemonic songs was also obtained at this reservation.
In addition to much of the ritual, secured directly from the priests, in
the original language, translations of the songs were also recorded in
musical notation. After the completion of his labors at the above reser-
vations, Dr. Hoffman proceeded to Pipestone, Minn., to secure copies
of pictographs reported to oceur.upon the cliffs of that well-known
locality. The reports of the great number of petroglyphs were found
to have been greatly exaggerated, though a number of what appeared
to be personal names were found on the rocks. He then returned to
St. Paul, Minn., to search the records of the library of the Minnesota
Historical Society for copies of pictographs reported to have been made
near La Pointe, Wis. Little information was gathered, although it is
well known that such records existed upon conspicuous cliffs and rocks
near Lake Superior at and in the vicinity of Bayfield and Ashland.

Dr. Hoftman afterwards made a personal examination of the “ pic-
tured cave” 8 miles northeast ef La Crosse, Wis., to obtain copies of
the various characters occurring there. These are rapidly being de-
stroyed by the disintegration of the rock. The colors employed in de-
lineating the various figures consisted of dark red and black. The fig-
ures represented deer, human beings, and various animals and forms
not now distinguishable.

Mr. H. W. Henshaw spent the months of August, September, and
October on the Pacific coast, engaged in the collection of vocabularies
of certain Indian languages, with a view to their study and classifica-
tion. The Umatilla Reservation in Oregon was first visited with the
object of obtaining a comprehensive vocabulary of the Cayuse. Though
there are about four hundred of these Indians on the reservation prob-
ably not more than six speak the Cayuse tongue. The Cayuse have
extensively intermarried with the Umatilla, and now speak the language
of the latter, or that of the Nez Pereé. An excellent Cayuse vocabulary
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was obtained, and at the same time the opportunity was embraced to
secure vocabularies of the Umatilla and the Nez Percé languages. His
next objective point was the neighborhood of the San Rafael Mission,
Marin County, Cal., the hope being entertained that here would be
found some ofthe Indians formerly gathered at the mission. He learned
that there were no Indians at or near San Rafael, but subsequently
found some half dozen on the shores of Tomales Bay, to the north.
From one of these a good vocabulary was collected, and, as was ex-
pected, was subsequently found to be related to the Moquelumnan fam-
ily of the interior, to the southeast of San Francisco Bay. Later the
missions of Santa Cruz and Monterey were visited. At these points
there still remain a few old Indians who retain a certain command of
their own language, though Spanish forms their ordinary means of in-
tercourse. The vocabularies obtained are sufficient to prove, beyond
any reasonable doubt, that there were two linguistic families instead of
one, as had been formerly supposed, in the country above referred to.
A still more important discovery was made by Mr. Henshaw at Monte-
rey, Where an old woman was found who succeeded in calling to mind
more than one hundred words and short phrases of the Esselen lan-
guage, formerly spoken near Monterey, but less than forty words of
which had been previously known. Near the town of Cayueas, to the
south, an aged, blind Indian was visited who was able to add somewhat
to the stock of Esselen words obtained at Monterey, and to give besides
valuable information concerning the original home of this tribe. As a
result of the study of this material, Mr. Henshaw determines the Es-
selen to be a distinct linguistic family, a conclusion first drawn by Mr.
Curtin, from a study of the vocabularies collected by Galiano and Lam-
anon in the 18th century. The territory occupied by the tribe and lin-
guistic family lies coastwise, southof Monterey Bay, as far as the Santa
Lucia Mountain.

On July 5 Mr. James Mooney started on a second trip to the Cheroki
Nation in North Carolina, returning November 14, after an absence of
about four months. During this time he made considerable additions
to the linguistic material already obtained by him, and was able to
demonstrate the former existence of a fourth, and perhaps even of a
fifth, well-marked Cheroki dialect in addition to the upper, lower, and
middle dialects already known. The invention of a Cheroki syllabary,
which was adapted to the sounds of the upper dialect, has tended to
make that the universal dialect. A number of myths were collected,
together with a large amount of miscellaneous material relating to the
Cheroki tribe, and the great tribal game of ball play, with its attendant
ceremonies of dancing, conjuring, scratching the bodies of the players,
and going to water, was witnessed. A camera was utilized to secure
characteristic pictures of the players. Special attention was given to
the subject of Indian medicine, theoretic, ceremonial, and therapeutic.
The most noted doctors of the tribe were employed as informants, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 59

nearly five hundred specimens of medicinal and food plants were col-
lected and their Indian names and uses ascertained. The general result
of this investigation shows that the medical and botanical knowledge
of the Indians has been greatly overrated. A study was made of Cher-
oki personal names, about five hundred of which were translated,
being all the names of Indian origin now existing. The most impor-
tant results of Mr. Mooney’s investigation were the discovery of a large
number of manuscripts containing the sacred formule of the tribe,
written in Cheroki characters by the shamans for their own secret use,
and jealously guarded from the knowledge of all but the initiated. The
existence of such manuscripts had been discovered during a previous
visit in 1887, and a number had been procured. This discovery of gen-
uine aboriginal material, written in an Indian language by shamans for
their own use, is believed to be unique in the history of aboriginal
investigation, and was only made possible through the invention of the
Cheroki syllabary by Sequoia in 1821. Every effort was made by Mr.
Mooney to obtain all the manuscripts possible, with the result of secur-
ing nearly ali such material in the possession of the tribe. The whole
number of formule obtained is about six hundred. They consist of
prayers and sacred songs, explanations of ceremonies, directions for
medical treatment, and underlying theories. They relate to medicine,
love, war, hunting, fishing, seif-protection, witchcraft, agriculture, the
ball play, etc., thus forming a complete exposition of an aboriginal re-
ligion as set forth by its priests in the language of the tribe.

Early in October Mr. Jeremiah Curtin left Washington for the Pacific
Coast. During the remainder of the year he was occupied in Shasta
and Humboldt Counties, Cal., in collecting vocabularies and data con-
nected with the Indian system of medicine. This work was continued
in different parts of Humboldt and Siskiyou Counties until June 30,
1889. Large collections of linguistic and other data were gathered and
myths were secured, which show that the whole system of medicine of
these Indians and the ministration of remedies originated in and is
limited to sorcery practices.

The field of work of Mr. Albert 8. Gatschet during the year was of
limited duration. It had been ascertained that Mrs. Alice M. Oliver,
now in Lynn, Mass., formerly lived on Trespalacios Bay, Texas, near
the homes of the Karankawa, and Mr. Gatschet visited Lynn with a view
of securing as complete a vocabulary as possible of their extinet lan-
guage. Mrs. Oliver was able to recall about one hundred and sixty
terms of the language, together with some phrases and sentences. She
also furnished many valuable details regarding the ethnography of the
tribe. Ten days were spent in this work.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied in field work from August 1 to No-
vember 8, as follows: From the Ist of August to September 20 he was
on the Tuscarora Reserve, in Niagara County, in which locality fifty-
five legends and myths were collectkd. A Penobscot vocabulary was
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

also obtained here, together with other linguistic material. From Sep-
tember 20 to November 8 Mr. Hewitt visited the Grand River Reserve,
where a large amount of text was obtained, together with notes and
other linguistic material.

Dr. Franz Boas was employed from February to April in preparing
for convenient use a series of vocabularies of the several Salish divisions,
previously collected by him in British Columbia.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff left Washington on October 23 for St. John’s,
Ariz., where he examined the Hubbell collection of ancient pottery and
secured a series of photographs and colored drawings of the more im-
portant specimens. Thence he went to Zuni and obtained drawings of
interior details of dwellings and other data necessary for the comple-
tion of his studies of the architecture of this pueblo. He returned to
Washington December 7.

Mr. A. M. Stephen continued work among the Tusayan pueblos un-
der the direction of Mr. Victor Mindeleft. He added much to our
knowledge of the traditionary history of Tusayan, and has made an
extensive study of the house-lore and records of house-building cere-
monials. He furnished also a full nomenclature of Tusayan architect-
ural terms as applied to the various details of terraced house construc-
tion, with etymologies. He secured from the Navajo much useful in-
formation of the ceremonial connected with the construction of their
conical lodges, or ‘ hogans,” supplementing the more purely architect-
ural records of their construction previously collected by Mr. Minde-
leff. As opportunity occurred he gathered small, typical collections of
baskets and other textile fabrics illustrative of the successive stages of
their manufacture, including specimens of raw materials and detailed
descriptions of the dyes used. These collections are intended to include
also the principal patterns in use at the present time, with the native
explanations of their significance.

OFFICE WORK.

Director Powell has devoted much time during the year to tie final
preparation of the paper to accompany the map of the linguistic fami-
lies of North America north of Mexico, the scope of which has been
alluded to in previous years. The report and map are now practically
completed, and will appear in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau,
soon to go to press.

Mr. Henshaw was chiefly occupied with the administrative duties of
the office, which have been placed in his charge by the Director, and
with the completion of the linguistic map, which is now ready for the
engraver.

Col. Garrick Mallery, after his return from the field work elsewhere
mentioned, was engaged in the elaboration of the new information ob-
tained and in farther continued study of, and correspondence relating
to, sign language and pictography.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

Dr. W. J. Hoffman continued the arrangement and classification of
material embracing the subjects of pictography and gesture language
of the North American Indians, but more particularly of the date and
sketches secured by him during previous field seasons.

While Mr. J. Owen Dorsey did no field work during the year, he de-
voted much of the time to original investigations. Samuel Fremont,
an Omaha Indian, came to Washington in October, 1888, and until
February, 1889, assisted Mr. Dorsey in the revision of the entries for
the @egiha-English Dictionary. A similar work was undertaken by Lit-
tle Standing Buffalo, a Ponea Indian from the Indian Territory, in April
and May, 1889. The summary of Mr. Dorsey’s office work is as follows:
He completed the entries for the @egiha-English Dictionary, and a list
of Ponca, Omaha, and Winnebago personal names was made. He
translated from the Teton dialect of the Dakota all the material of the
Bushotter collection in the Bureau of Ethnology, and prepared there-
from a paper on Teton folk-lore. He also prepared a brief paper on
the camping circles of Siouan tribes, and in addition furnished an ar-
ticle on the modes of predication in the Athapascan dialects of Oregon
and in several dialects of the Siouan family. He also edited the man-
uscript of the Dakota grammar, texts, and ethnography, written by
the late Rev. Dr. 8S. R. Riggs. This will soon be published as Part 1,
Volume VII, Contributions to North American Ethnology. In May,
1889, he began an extensive paper on Indian personal names, based on
material obtained by himself in the field, to contain names of the fol-
lowing tribes: Omaha and Ponka, Kansa, Osage, Kwapa, Iowa, Oto
and Missouri, and Winnebago.

Mr. Atbert 8. Gatschet’s office work was almost entirely restricted to
the composition and completion of his Grammar of the Klamath Lan-
guage of Oregon, with the necessary appendices. The grammar and
dictionary are now printed and will soon be published. The ethnog-
raphy will follow.

During the year Mr. Jeremiah Curtin arranged and copied myths of
various Indian families, and also transcribed Wasco, Sahaptin, and
Yana vocabularies previously collected.

On his return from the Cheroki reservation in 1888, Mr. James
Mooney began at once to translate a number of the prayers and sacred
songs obtained from the shamans during his visit. The result of this
work will appear in a paper in the seventh annual report of the bureau
entitled ‘*Sacred formulas of the Cheroki.” Considerable time was
devoted also to the elaboration of the botanic and linguistic notes ob-
tained in the field. In the spring of 1889 he began the collection of
material for a monograph on the aborigines of the Middle Atlantic
slope, with special reference to the Powhatan tribes of Virginia. Asa
preliminary, about one thousand circulars, requesting information in
regard to local names, antiquities, and surviving Indians, were distrib-
uted throughout Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and northeastern Car-
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

olina. The information thus obtained affords an excellent basis for
future work in this direction.

From July 1 to August 1, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in ar-
ranging alphabetically the recorded words of the Tuscarora-English
dictionary mentioned in former reports, and in the study of adjective
word-forms to determine the variety and kind of the Tuscarora moods
and tenses. After his return from the field, Mr. Hewitt recorded
and tabulated ail the forms of the personal pronouns employed in the
Tuscarora language. Studies were also prosecuted to develop the
predicative function in the Tuscarora speech. All the terms of con-
sanguinity and affinity as now used among the Tuscarora were recorded
and tabulated. Literal translations of many myths collected in the
fields were made, and free translations added to four of them. In all
of these studies linguistic notes were made relating to etymology, pho-
nesis, and verbal change.
~ Mr. James C. Pilling has, as usual, given all the time he could spare
from his executive duties to the preparation of bibliographies of North
American languages. The Bibliography of the Iroquoian Languages
was completed early in the fiscal year and the edition was issued in
February last. In the mean time a Bibliography of the Muskhogean
Languages has been compiled, the manuscript of which was sent to the
printer January 8, 1889, the first proof received Febuary 9, and proof-
reading completed early in June. ‘The edition, however, was not de-
livered during the fiscal year. Early in March, 1889, Mr. Pilling made~
a trip to Philadelphia to inspect the linguistic material, particularly the
manuscripts, belonging to the American Philosophical Society. The
library authorities gave him every facility, and much new material was
secured. In June Mr. Pilling made a somewhat extended trip through
New England States and into Canada, visiting the Astor, Lenox, and
the Historical Society libraries in New York; the libraries of the Athe-
neum, Public, Massachusetts Historical Society, and the American
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, in Boston; that of Har-
vard University, in Cambridge ; the American Antiquarian Society, in
Worcester, and the private library of Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, in
Hartford. In Canada he visited the library of Laval University, and
the private library of Mr. P. Gagnon, in Quebec, of St. Mary’s College
and Jacques Cartier School, in Montreal, and various missions along
the St. Lawrence River, with a view of inspecting the manuscripts left
by the early missionaries. In addition to these he visited many smaller
institutions, private libraries, and publishing houses, and the result of
the whole trip was the accumulation of much new material for insertion
in the Algonquian bibliography. It is thought that the manuscript for
this publication will be in shape to send to the printer before the close
of the year 1889.

Mr. W. H. Holmes has continued to edit the illustrations for the Bu-
reau publications, and has besides engaged actively in his studies of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

aboriginal archeology. He has completed papers upon the pottery of
the Potomac Valley and upon the objects of shell collected by the Bureau
during the last eight years, and he has others in preparation. As cura-
tor of Bureau collections he makes the following statement of accessions
for the year: From Dr. Cyrus Thomas and his immediate assistants
working in the mound region of the Mississippi Valley and contiguous
portions of the Atlantic slope, the Bureau has received one hundred
and forty-six specimens, including articles of clay, stone, shell, and
bone. Mr. Victor Mindeleff obtained sixteen specimens of pottery from
the Pueblo country. Other collections by members of the Bureau and
of the Geological Survey are as follows: Shell beads and pendents
(modern) from San Buenaventura, Cal., by H. W. Henshaw. Fragments
of pottery and other articles from the vicinity of the Cheroki agency,
N. C., by James Mooney. A large grooved hammer from the bluff at
Three Forks, Mont., by Dr. A.C. Peale. <A large series of rude stone,
implements from ee District of Columbia, by DeLancey W. Gill.
Donations have been received as follows: An important series of earthen
vases from a mound on Perdido Bay, Ala., by F. H. Parsons. Ancient
pueblo vases from southwestern Colorado, by William M. Davidson.
A series of spurious earthen vessels, manufactured by unknown persons
in eastern Iowa, by C. C. Jones, of Augusta, Ga. Fragments of pot-
tery, ete., from Romney, W. Va., by G. H. Johnson. Fragments of a
steatite pot from Ledyard, Conn., by G. L. Fancher. A series of
stone tools, earthen vessels, etc., from a mound on Lake Apopka, Fla.,
by Thomas Featherstonhaugh. Fragments of gilded earthenware and
photographs of antiquities from Mexico, by F. Plancarte. Fragments
of gold ornaments from Costa Rica, by Anastasio Alfaro. Loans of im-
portant specimens have been received as follows: Articles of clay from
a mound on Perdido Bay, Ala., by Mrs. A. T. Mosman. Articles of
clay from the last mentioned locality, by A. B. Simons. Pottery from
the Potomac Valley, by W. Hallett Phillips, by 8. V. Proudfit, and by
H. L. Reynolds. Articles of gold and gold-copper alloy from Costa
Rica, by Anastasio Alfaro, secretary of the National Museum at San
José.

Prof. Cyrus Thomas was chiefly occupied during the year in the prepa-
ration of the second and third volumes of his reports upon the mounds.
It is probable that these will be finished during the present fiscal year.
He also prepared a bulletin on the Circular, Square, and Octagonal
Earth-works of Ohio, with a view of giving a summary of a recent sur-
vey by the mound division of the principal works of the above character
in southern Ohio. <A second bulletin was completed, entitled “The
Problem of the Ohio Mounds,” in which he presented evidence to show
that the ancient works of the State are due to Indians of several differ-
ent tribes, and that some, at least, of the typical works were built bv
the ancestors of the modern Cheroki.

Since his return from the field, Mr. H. L. Reynolds has been engaged
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in the preparation of a general map of the United States, showing the
area of the mounds and the relative frequency of their occurrence. He
has since assisted Professor Thomas in the preparation of the monograph
upon the inclosures.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff, assisted by Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, has been
engaged in preparing for publication a “Study of Pueblo Architecture”
as illustrated in the provinces of Tusayan and Cibola, material for which
he has been engaged in collecting for a number of years. This report
is now completed, and will appear in the Seventh Annual Report of -
the Bureau.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff and the
force of the modelling room completed the bureau exhibit for the Cin-
cinnati Exposition, and during the early part of the year Mr. Mindeleff
was at Cincinnati in charge of the same. Owing to restricted space
the exhibit was limited to the Pueblo culture group, but this was illus-
trated as fully as the time would permit. The exhibit covered about
1,200 feet of floor space as well as a large amount of wall space, and
consisted of models of pueblo and cliff ruins; models of inhabited
pueblos, ancient and modern pottery, examples of weaving, basketry,
etc., a representative series of implements of war, the chase, agriculture,
and the household, manikins illustrating costumes, and a series of
large photographs illustrative of aboriginal architecture of the pueblo
region, and of many phases of pueblo life. Upon Mr. Mindeleff’s re-
turn from Cincinnati he resumed assistance to Mr. Victor Mindeleff
upon a report on pueblo architecture, and the close of the fiscal year
saw the two chapters which had been assigned him completed. They
consist of a review of the literature on the pueblo region and a sum-
mary of the traditions of the Tusayan group from material collected by
Mr. A. M. Stephen. Work was also continued on the duplicate series
of models, and twelve were advanced to various stages of completion.
Some time was devoted to repairing original models which had been
exhibited at Cincinnati and other expositions, and also to experiments
in casting in paper, in order to find a suitable paper for use in large
models. The experiments were successful.

Mr. J. K. Hillers has continued the collection of photographs of prom-
inent Indians, in both full-face and profile, by which method all the fa-
cial characteristics are exhibited to the best advantage. In nearly every
instance a record has been preserved of the sitter’s status in the tribe,
the age, biographic notes of interest, and in case of mixed bloods the
degree of intermixture of blood. The total number of photographs ob-
tained during the year is 27, distributed among the following tribes,
viz: Sae and Fox, 5; Dakota, 6; Omaha, 6, and mixed-bloods (Creeks),

NECROLOGY.
JEROME H. KIDDER.

Dr. Jerome H. Kidder was born in Baltimore County, Md., on the
26th of October, 1842, and graduated in 1862 at Harvard, where he
is Still remembered as foremost in the gymnasium as well as on his class-
rolls. He immediately then tendered his services for the war, and was
placed in charge of the sea island plantations near Beaufort, S. C.,
where he contracted yellow fever, and was invalided home early in
1863; but upon recovery enlisted in the Tenth Maryland Infantry, in
which he served as private and non-commissioned officer until the fol-
lowing year, when he was selected to be medical cadet, and in that ca-
pacity was employed in the military hospitals near the capital. During
this time he was prosecuting the study of medicine, and in 1866 re-
ceived from the University of Maryland the degree of M.D. In the
same year he was commissioned an assistant surgeon in the U.S. Navy,
becoming full surgeon in 1876.

Dr. Kidder’s first duty was at Japan, where he quickly acquired the
language of the country, and in other ways established the reputation
which attached to him throughout his career for his “capacity for takin’
pains.” While on this foreign service he was decorated by the King of
Portugal in recognition of services toa distressed vessel of His Majesty’s
navy.

Dr. Kidder took part in observing the transit of Venus at Kerguelen
Island, in 1874, as surgeon and naturalist of the expedition, and the ex-
cellent results of his scientific labors and researches therewith will be
found described in the Bulletins of the U.S. National Museum. After
the return of this expedition, Dr. Kidder arranged his specimens and
collections in the Smithsonian Institution, and commenced those kindly
and intimate relations with it which continued through his after life,
with the regard of all his associates there.

In 1878 Surgeon Kidder married, at Constantinople, Annie Mary,
daughter of the Hon. Horace Maynard, minister of the United States
to Turkey, and in 1884, having inherited an adequate fortune, he re-
signed his commission and established his home in Washington, and
here organized the bacteriological laboratory in connection with the
Navy Museum of Hygiene, and also made a sanitary survey of the site
proposed for the new Naval Observatory, while later he was appointed
chemist of the U. 8. Fish Commission, and in that capacity became one
of the most trusted advisers of Professor Baird. His laboratory was
in the Smithsonian building, and under the direction of the Secretary
of the Institution he made, at the request of Congress, an exhaustive
study of the ventilation of the Capitol and of the air in the Senate
chambers and the hallof the House, and submitted an extended report
or the use of the committees engaged upon the sanitary reform of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

building. In 1887, after the death of Commissioner Baird, he served for
a time as Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries, under Commissioner
Goode. While connected with the Fish Commission he carried on a
successful series of experiments to solve the problems relative to the
temperature of living fishes, which have been made public through the
reports of the Fish Commission. Besides the reports just referred to,
Dr. Kidder contributed valuable papers to various professional and
educational publications, and held for years a place on the literary staff
of the New York World, and maintained membership in many learned
societies. He was one of the founders of the Cosmos Club, and among
the organizers of the Harvard Club in Washington, and a prominent
member in the Masonic fraternity.

In 1888 Dr. Kidder accepted from the present Secretary the ap-
pointment of curator of laboratory and exchanges. His pleasant past
relations to the Institution, and the esteem in which he was held
by those connected with it, made the closer connection thus estab-
lished agreeable to all; and the writer can not speak in too warm
terms of the character of Dr. Kidder as shown in their business rela-
tions. His liberal education and views, served by the “capacity for
taking pains” already referred to, were all under the control of the
most conscientious regard for duty, and made him a valued administra-
tor of the department under his charge. He knew how to maintain, to-
gether with exact order, the kindliest relations with all employed in it,
who, it is safe to say, remember him with an affection and regard due
to his excellent personal qualities, an affection and regard which the
writer profoundly shares. Just in his best work, in his fullest physical
vigor, Dr. Kidder was stricken with pneumonia, and died after a brief
illness on the 8th of April, 1889.

His attachment to this Institution, which had always been of the
peculiarly intimate character, was also shown in a bequest of which I
shall elsewhere have to speak.

In conclusion, I can not but add to the statement of this great
deprivation to the Institution an expression of my sense of personal
loss in the parting with a friend who, in every relation of life, was
aman as honorable and worthy of trust as any I have ever known.

JAMES STEVENSON.

In recording the death of Mr. James Stevenson, which occurred on
the 25th of last July, I have to announce the loss of one of the most
valuable as well as one of the oldest and most active collaborators of
this Institution.

Mr. Stevenson was born in Maysville, Ky., in 1840, and while still
little more than a boy, in the spring of 1857, ascended the Missouri
River with the Warren Expedition; and from that time, with the ex-
ception of the interval caused by his acceptable services in the civil war,
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

he annually and regularly visited the Rocky Mountain region, first un-
der the auspices of the United States Exploring Expeditions of Warren
and Reynolds, and latterly under that of the U.S. Geological Survey,
of which he became the executive officer when that organization first
took form, a position in which he remained up to the time of his death.
His capacity and integrity were valued not only by the officials of the
Survey, which he did so much in connection with, but by those of this
Institution, for which during thirty years he gathered in remote regions
specimens of natural history, geology, and ethnology, which are per-
manent testimonials of his enterprise and his industry.

During the season of 1885 he was engaged in making an extended
search amoug the pueblos in the Moquis and Navajo districts of New
Mexico, and in this elevated country he was stricken by the dreaded
disease which lurks there. I met him in this region in 1887, when he
was already aroused, though too late, to a sense of his danger, and am
glad to recollect the circumstances of an acquaintance that associated
him with the regions of the West, in which so much of his life had been
passed, where so much valuable work was done, and where I had an
opportunity to learn something of his fertility of resource in emergency
and in the intimacy of camp life, of the amiable traits of his private
character.

Mr. Stevenson’s work was a double one, for he was equally at home
in cities, and especially in Washington, where he was extensively known
among members of Congress, and where the general confidence reposed
in him by them was a deserved tribute not merely to his skill but to
his personal integrity.

Respectfully submitted.
S. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR.
SMITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

A memoir presented by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, of Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology on the ‘‘ Genesis of the Arietide,” and recommended by Messrs. Alexander
Agassiz, Charles A. White, and William H. Dall, was accepted for publication in the
series of Contributions to Knowledge, in February last (1889). In order that the print-
ing of the memoir might be under the convenient revision of the author, the work was
placed in the hands of John Wilson & Son, of Cambridge, Mass. The printing of the
treatise is well advanced, and it will probably be completed and distributed during
the present year. It will form a volume of about 230 quarto pages, illustrated by 35
figures and 14 plates.

Two other publications of the year in the quarto size should be mentioned here, al-
though not intended to be included in the collected volumes of the Contributions.
No. 671 of the Smithsonian list is ‘‘ Natural History Illustrations prepared under the
direction of Louis Agassiz, 1849. The Anatomy of Astrangia Danae. Six litho-
graphs from drawings by A. Sonrel. Explanation of the plates by J. Walter
Fewkes.” This issue represents merely a fragment of a memoir undertaken forty
years ago by the eminent naturalist, Louis Agassiz, on material collected by him
during his first dredging excursion in one of the steamers of the U. S. Coast Survey.
This memoir, postponed by other occupations, was never completed, and even the
original notes are no longer to be found. But the excellence of the drawings made
under his direction from living specimens seems to warrant their publication, even
at this late day. The text descriptive of the six plates, by Mr. Fewkes, oecupies 20
quarto pages.

672. ‘‘ Natural History Illustrations prepared under the direction of Louis Agassiz
and Spencer I. Baird, 1849. Six lithographs from drawings by A. Sonrel. Expla-
nation of the plates by David Starr Jordan.” This, like the preceding, represents
merely a fragment of a memoir projected by the joint labors of the two distinguished
ichthyologists, and in like manner laid aside under the pressure of more immediate
duties. The text explanatory of the six plates is comprised in 12 quarto pages.
Were these two brochures more recent and more extended they would well deserve a
place in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.

SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

Taking the various publications for the past year belonging to this series in the
order in which they stand in the Smithsonian list, the first is:

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES FOR THE
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1889.

WASHINGTON, D. C., November 20, 1889.

Sir: [ have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the ex-
change bureau for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889. During the greater part of
this time the bureau was under the charge of the late Dr. Jerome H. Kidder, whose
able administration has contributed largely to its present efficiency. At the date of
his death, April 6, 1889, Mr. Boehmer, upon whom the care of the office immediately
devolved, reported that the exchange department, for the first time in its history, had
disposed of all packages received, and was prepared to close its book accounts.

In continuation of the statistics usually presented, the following table exhibits in
detail the exchange transactions for each month of the fiscal year:

The small increase in the number of packages (859) received during 1838~’89 as
compared with the preceding fiscal years, though offset by the large increase in weight
(30,298 pounds), isaccounted for by the fact that a number of regular shipments from
Government bureaus were delayed beyond the close of the fiscal year.

EXPENSE.

From an examination of the books of the disbursing officer it appears that the
actual cost of the exchange service for the year has been $17,152.10, divided as fol-
lows:

of the Smithsonian Institution,” $1,363.54* were repaid to the Institution by Govern-
meut Departments to which specitic appropriations had been granted for this pur-
pose, leaving a deficit of $788.56, which was paid from the Smithsonian fund.

Although all of the Government bureaus that have occasion to transmit their
publications through the Institution are not provided with funds available for de-
fraying the cost of the service, it seems to have been the intention of Congress that
its specific appropriation for the exchange business should be supplemented by special
appropriations to some of the bureaus and departments of the Government, so that
the charge of 5 cents per pound weight imposed by the regents in 1878 might be met
by them, The average amount annually repaid to the Institution in this way during
the past eleven years has been about $1,400.

Dr. Kidder strongly recommended, and I beg to renew his recommendation, that
this procedure, for which sufficient reasons existed at the time of its adoptién, may
now be discontinued as no longer advantageous or economical. By the present
system the cost of the service is actually larger than appears in the specific appro-
priations for exchanges, ae as the special appropriations to the different Depart-
ments vary from year to year and are often omitted altogether, a burden which can
not be accurately ieee, is imposed upon the Smithsonian fund.

In order to effect the change contemplated—that is, to collect in a single item the
entire appropriation for international exchanges, and at the same time to make
allowance for a proper compensation to the ocean steam-ship companies for freight,
and to bring the schedule of salaries more nearly up to the standard established for
. the classified service of the Government—an estimate of $27,500 was submitted for
the fiscal year 1889-’90.

This sum would then have been divided somewhat as follows:

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, ETC.

The convention between the United States of America, Belgium, Brazil, Italy,
Portugal, Servia, Spain, and Switzerland for the international exchange of official
documents and scientific and literary publications, as well as the convention between
the same countries (excepting Switzerland), for the ‘‘ immediate exchange of the offi-
cial journals, parliamentary annals and documents,” was ratified by the President of
the United States on July 19, 1888, but final ratifications were not exchanged by the
representatives of the contracting powers until January 14, 1889. The convention
was proclaimed on January 25, the day following, and since that date formal notifi-
cation has been received of the adhesion to both conventions of the Government of
Uruguay. The full text of these conventions was given in the Curator’s report for
last year.

The adhesion of the United States to the first of these conventions involves no new
departure in the exchange service from the methods of previous years; but for the
fulfillment of the obligations incurred by the second convention—the immediate ex-
change of official journals—an appropriation of about $2,000 to cover the necessary
postage and additional clerical assistance is required, and provision should be made
for the prompt delivery to the exchange office of the documents referred to.

This sum of $2,000 was estimated in reply to an inquiry made by the Secretary of
State, dated February 12, 1889, as to the ability of the Smithsonian Institution to
execute all of the provisious of the two conventions without further legislation by
Congress, and the estimate was duly submitted by the Secretary of State in a letter
to the President of the Senate, but no appropriation was made.

While the United States is thus bound by formal agreement to an exchange of its
official publications with but eight countries, a full set of all publications received
from the Government Printer is transmitted to forty-one countries upon the basis of
mutual agreement.

A complete list of the official depositories for publications sent abroad during the
fiscal year, in accordance with the act of Congress of July 25, 1868, with a statement
of the number of packages sent and received from each of the countries repre-
sented, is contained in the annexed table:

78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The utter inadequacy of the return received by the United States, 6,442 volumes and
pamphlets for 22,673 sent out, is but a repetition of the experience of previous years,
and hax been dwelt upon at length in former reports. The Austrian Government
forms a notable exception to the general apathy of foreign nations in the matter,
having transmitted 4,426 volumes, including complete and very valuable sets of Par-
limentary Proceedings; and itishoped that negotiations now in progress will resalt, in
the near future, in a more equitable and satisfactory exchange with other uations,
more especially with England and Germany.

If a complete account of all ‘‘ governmental” exchange business carried by the
Smithsonian Institution is made, that is, if all publications sent or received by the
Government and its bureaus are included, it appears that 9,325 packages were re-
ceived and forwarded to United States Government Departments, including the
Library of Congress, while 25,671 weresent abroad through the exchange service froin
the same Departments. The apportionment among the different countries is shown
below:

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

While a marked improvement appears to have taken place in the exchange serv-
ice during the past few years, still further improvements are no doubt desirable and
possible. The plan adopted by Dr. Kidder of following up promptly and diligently
all complaints, or failures of packages to reach their destinations, has produced ex-
cellent results. The delays due to the fact that the Smithsonian Institution is de-
pendent upon the generosity and public spirit of most of the ocean steam-ship lines
fot the free transportation of its exchange boxes will be provided against, if the ap-
propriation asked for is granted by Congress. The delays which occur in some of
the foreign bureaus, due to indifference or to insufficieut clerical force, are at pres-
ent beyond the control of the Institution. Where regularly paid agencies have been
established, as in London and Leipzig, this cause of embarrassment to the service no
longer exists, and all packages are transmitted with promptness.

Still another difficulty arises from an inadequate or erroneous address upon the
packages, rendering it necessary for the agent to hold them until the error or omis-
sion can be corrected by correspondence. Increased attention to this point on the
part of those who have occasion to send publications through the exchange service
will assist materially in decreasing the number of delayed transmissions,

An important need of the exchange bureau is a more complete index to the early
records, but with the present clerical force this additional work can not be effect-
ually undertaken.

I take pleasure in bearing witness to the faithfulness and efficiency of the em-
ployés of the bureau, and to the prompt attention to the interests of the Institution
of its foreign agents, Messrs. William Wesley & Son, at London, and ‘Dr. Felix Flii-
gel, at Leipzig.

The employés of the bureau receive much lower salaries than those established for
similar grades of work by the classified lists of the Government Departments, and
it is manifestly to the interest of the service to be able to retain, by reasonable ex-
pectation of promotion, men who have acquired pecuiiar and valuable experience
in the exchange transactions.

Grateful acknowledgments are due the following transportation companies and
firms for their continued liberality in granting free freight on exchange parcels and
boxes:

Allan Steam-ship Company (A. Schumacher & Co., agents), Baltimore.
Anchor Steam-ship Line (Henderson & Brother, agents), New York.

ADVERTISEMENT.

; °

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; occasional reports of the investigations
made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general charac-
ter or on special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the
purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly
to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers not published in
the “ Smithsonian Contributions” or in the ‘“* Miscellaneous Collections”
as may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous corre-
spondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from avery early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law, with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part ofits history, been
carried out largely by the publication ot such papers as would possess
an interest to all attracted by scientific progress, so that the appendices
of the annual reports, during the years down to 1880, have been almost
wholly so occupied. ; .

In 1880, the Secretary , induced in part by the discontinuation of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi-
nent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor-
ology, physies, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and anthropol-
ogy. Other subjects which might properly have been ineluded, such as
those of terrestrial physics, hydrography, microscopy, ete., as well as
the more practical topics of generai technology, were omitted, both for
want of time and want of space, so that from the outset the impractica-
bility of a review of the whole field was recognized.

It has already been mentioned in the annual report for 1888 that these
latter provisions seemed justified by further experience until in 1886,
the incompleteness of the special record, the disecouragements from the
increasing delays encountered in the printing of these summaries, the
recent multiplication by private enterprise of special books and periodi-

87
88 ADVERTISEMENT.

cals devoted to critical summaries, and other considerations, induced a
temporary suspension of the project; while it was added that with every
effort to secure prompt attention to the more important details of the
survey of the annual progress of scientific discovery, experience has
shown that it is impracticable to obtain all the desired reports in each
department within the time prescribed, that the plan attempted of
bringing up the deficiencies in subsequent reports has not proved en-
tirely satisfactory, and that in view of these delays, of the ever-increas-
ing range of complexity of the subjects to be treated, and of other con-
siderations, it is probable that it may be thought advisable to revert to
the accustomed, and, it is believed, more widely acceptable plan of pub-
lishing yearly papers selected with a principal view to their general
scientific interest, rather than to attempt the continuation of summaries
chiefly of importance to the professional student.

The earlier established plan of the annual reports is followed in this
volume, though not to the exclusion of such summaries as may be con-
nected with the recognized fields of labor of the Institution.

I.—THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
(Physico-Mathematical Class.)

The Royal Academy of Sciences was established in 1701 by King
Frederick I, upon the solicitation of Leibnitz and received the name
“Royal Society of Sciences ;” the word Academy was substituted in
1744 on occasion of the reorganization of the society under Frederick
the Great. The statutes, approved by royal decree of March 28, 1881,
explain the object and composition of the society as follows: ;

The Academy of Sciences is a society of scientists whose object it is to
promote science without being required to adhere to any plan of instrue-
tion. It comprises four classes of members, but in a more limited sense
it is formed by the whole body of regular members, who, under the
direction of the secretaries attend to the affairs of the entire academy.

The Academy possesses the rights of a privileged corporation, has its
own Seal, owns its premises, has its own funds and aregular, guaranteed
income which it dispenses according to the adopted rules.

For the conduct of some of its affairs the Academy has formed two
sections: the physico-mathematical and the philosophical-historical
class. (Formerly four classes existed, but since 1830 they became
united into two.)

Each section manages its own affairs. No difference of importance
exists as regards the two sections.

The membership is formed of: (1) regular members, (2) foreign mem-
bers, (3) honorary members, (4) corresponding members. ‘The honorary
members are not assigned to any special sections; all other members
are assigned to the respective sections and can belong only to that
section.

The seniority of ordinary and foreign members is regulated by the
time of their election.

90 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

To ordinary membership only such persons are eligible as are residents
of Berlin or live in places the connection of which with the national
capital permits them to take part in their regular academic duties.
Any such member removing to a place not provided for in the above is
transferred to the number of honorary members.

Each class may have twenty-seven regular members. A number of
these places is intended for certain specified branches of science; for
the remaining places all scientists whose activity lies within that speci-
fied section may become eligible.

Vacancies among specialists may be left open, yet, the advantage of
the academy requires all possible competition. In that case the class has
to decide whether any of its members may be selected for the purpose.
Applications for these places can emanate only from regular members.

A proposed class election is to be communicated to the presiding sec-
retary of the academy and then considered by the entire academy at its
next regular session when the candidate is elected by ballot.

The result of the election is to be communicated to the minister who
obtains the king’s approval.

If ascientist, non-resident of Berlin or of any of the places allowed
for, receives the election of regular member he is required to remove to
Berlin within six months of the date of his confirmation—which time
may be increased in special cases. If he fails to comply with this rule
he is enrolled among the honorary members.

The regular members are both permitted and required to share the
labors of the Academy ; they have a seat and a vote both in the general
Academy and in the class, and are permitted to attend the meetings of
either of the classes.

A member of twenty-five years standing or having reached the age
of seventy may be relieved from lecturing or speaking.

The regular members are entitled to all privileges of the royal insti-
tutions and collections. They are furthermore privileged to lecture at
any university of the Prussian domain and enjoy equal rights with the
professors in accordance with regulations to which they are also bound
with regard to the lectures.

With regard to salaries the following regulations are in force:

(1) Each of the fifty-four regular members of the Academy receive an
annual salary of 900 mark ($225.).

(2) Separate salaries, additional to the above 900 mark are given to
two regular members of the physico-mathematical class, of which one
has to be a botanist and the other a chemist, and to two regular mem-
bers of the philosophic-historical class, who are required to be phi-
lologists or historians. The salary of the chemist also includes the
official dwelling in the buiiding of the academy and the use, for scientific
purposes, of any available room in the building not otherwise occupied.
The payment of such a salary is made for special services required in
the conduct of a certain office or professorship, or in the direction of a
scientific institute.

(3) A special salary for special duties may be given by vote of the
academy for such a time as may be required in the performance of
special duties. The pensioning of the salaried officials is optional.

(4) The two salaries may be granted at once at the time of election,
provided the proposition is made at the time of election of the candi-
date. This requires the sanction of the minister.

(5) The widow or, in her absence, the children of a deceased member
continue to draw the salary of their husband or father for the term of
one year, commencing with the day of his death.

Foreign (or non-resident) members are such as do not reside at Berlin
or at one of the places provided for in the statutes. Of these each class
has ten. The Academy is not required to fill vacancies in this number.
The non-resident members enjoy all the rights of the regular members,
and in case of any visit to Berlin, and upon notification of the fact to
the general secretary, they receive invitations to the meeting, ete., the
same as the regular members.

Honorary membership may be extended to such resident scientists
as are prevented from fulfilling the obligations of regular membership ;
it may further be extended to non-resident and foreign scientists who
have excelled in scientific pursuits and insome way have given evidence
of their interest in the welfare of the Academy. There is no limit to
the number of honorary members.

The honorary members are entitled to participate in the meetings of
the Academy of which they are, in each case, informed by invitation.
They are at liberty to make scientific communications and to take part
in the deliberations of business affairs.

The corresponding members are composed of scientists, non-residents
of Berlin. They retain the corresponding membership in the event of
their locating at Berlin. Each class offers one hundred places for eor-
responding members.

The corresponding members are entitled to take part in the publie
and other meetings of the Academy and of the class to which they, re-
spectively, have been assigned and to make scientific communications.
They are also permitted to be present at business meetings, but have
no vote in the same.

The business of the Academy is conducted by four permanent secre-
taries, of which each class furnishes two.

The secretaries are elected for life and draw a salary of 1,800 mark
annually, which amount is also paid to the surviving widow or orphans
for the period of one year succeeding the death of the incumbent.

The secretaries range according to the seniority of their election.

Each of the secretaries carries a seal.

Hach of the two classes elect their secretaries out of their own mem-
bers and in secret session. The election has to receive the King’s sane-
tion.
92 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

It is the duty of the secretaries to conduct the business of the Acad-
emy and to execute its orders. The manner of arranging the duties
among their number is left to their discretion.

In the presidency and the duties of that office and in the conduct of
the affairs of the general Academy, the secretaries change successively
every four monthsin accordance with their seniority, unless they arrange
among themselves for some other method of succession. In case of en-
forced absence of the presiding secretary the last secretary has to take
his place. All four secretaries being unavoidably detained from pre-
siding, the senior of the ordinary members assumes the office.

The business secretary is styled the presiding secretary; he carries
the great seal of the Academy and supervises the officials and clerks of
the Academy. He calls the extraordinary meetings of the members
and the meetings of the secretaries; he issues the invitations and pre-
sides at all meetings; in case of a tie his vote is decisive; he signs the
protocols and arranges for the execution of the various resolutions. He
has charge of the correspondence of the Academy, opens all communica-
tions, submits them and then takes charge of further action. He is re-
sponsible for the observance of the statutes, and for that purpose com-
municates directly with the minister. In submitting his charge of four
months he has to surrender to his successor a complete inventory made
in the presence of the archivist.

The presiding secretary, or his substitute, is the only person per-
mitted to institute legal proceedings in the name of the Academy, for
which purpose he may receive special identification on the part of the
ministry. Money may be paid to the cashier of the ministry.

Within the classes of the Academy the respective secretaries assume
the presidency and the execution of all business affairs for the term of
from four to four months.

The regular salaried officials of the Academy—at present an archivist,
one clerk, one door-keeper and one messenger—are appointed for life or
any specified term in general session and by recommendation of the col-
lege of secretaries. The appointments have to receive the approval of
the ministry.

The following rules are in force regarding meetings, labors, and pub-
lications :

The members participate in the meetings according to the rights of
their respective grade. Others, not members, may be permitted to at-
tend the scientific meetings ; they have to be recommended by a mem-
ber and introduced to the presiding secretary.

The meetings of the Academy are held every Thursday and alternate
with those of the entire Academy and by those of the classes.

At each regular meeting a scientific paper is to be read by one of the
regular members, at the expiration of which other members are permitted
to make scientific communications or in any way to introduce scientific
objects.

The general Academy is empowered to submit questions to the secre-

ae sone
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 93

tary of the respective classes for action or report; or a special commis-
sion or commissioner may be appointed for report on some scientific or
business question ; the appointment of such commission is made by or-
dinary election, or, if required, by secret ballot.

The general Academy holds three public meetings annually ; the one
on July 1 in memory of Leibnitz, its first president, a second one on
January 24in commemoration of the birth of Frederick LI, the re-organ-
izer of the Academy, and the third on the birth-day of the reigning King.
If these days do not fall upon Thursday, the succeeding Thursday is set
aside for such public meeting.

The secretaries alternate in the conduct of the presidency on these
special occasions, and the presiding officer is required either to make
mention of the occasion by a few introductory remarks or to read a
special paper on the subject.

In the meetings held in memory of Leibnitz, regular members, elected
during the year, make their first speech or deliver their first lecture,
each being responded to by one of the secretaries. Hulogies of de-
ceased members are read during the course of the meeting. The busi-
ness of the public meeting consists of the announcement of prizes, the
reading of annual reports on the changes in the personnel, and of other
papers explanatory to the works and results of the scientific enterprises
or foundations connected with the Academy. Papers read in regular
Session may, upon consent of the Academy, be read again in these pub-
lic meetings.

In accordance with the intention of its foundation, it is the duty of
the Academy to render assistance to the scientific enterprises of its
members or scientists generally which require combined activity of sev-
eral scientists, or which, on account of their compass or expense, would
require the assistance of the Academy. A further duty of the Academy
requires it to manage foundations of a strict scientific character, and to
encourage or reward, by the giving of prizes, investigations, or researches
in certain defined directions.

The Academy publishes “ Sitzungsberichte” and ‘ Denkschriften,”
the editing of which devolves upon the college of secretaries, subject
to regulations adopted by the entire Academy. The members receive
copies, beginning with the year of their admission.

Explicit permission of the Academy or one of its classes is absolutely
required for the publication in the academic proceedings of any scien-
tific paper. The request for publication must be accompanied by the
ready manuscript, and the proposition may be voted on at once. Ifthe
expense or any other important point should require a further consid-
eration a commission may be appointed for the purpose, or the subject
may be referred to the board of secretaries or to one of the classes of
the Academy.

Upon the request of one of the members present the acceptance for
publication of any paper or any proceeding connected therewith may
be voted on by secret ballot.

The regular annual revenues of the Academy consist of (1) The income
from its own endowments; (2) dotation of 62,229 mark ($15,587) given
as an annual revenue in place of the endowment of King Frederick
William I{I (Royal decree of August 16, 1809); (3) assistance by the
government; (4) its own profits.

The expenditures are: (1) Payment of salaries and remunerations ;
(2) prizes, publications of the Academy, care and increase of the library,
all rendered domestic expenses required, including heating, lighting,
and repairs; (3) for scientific purposes. With regard to these all pos-
sible equality should be secured for each of the two classes.

Any surplus may be added to the income for the coming year or added

The funds available during the years 1886-’87 amounted to 208,982 |
mark ($52,245.)

The scientific proportion was 194,695 mark ($48,674), of which the
following disbursements were made: (1) Salaries, 111,600 mark
($27,900); (2) real expenses, 83,095 mark ($20,774,) as follows: (a) Publi-
cation of Abhandlungen und Sitzungsbericihte, 22,800 mark ($5,950),

academic prize of 5,000 mark ($1,250), and in intervals of twelve,

twelve, and two years, respectively, the prizes of 2,000 mark ($500) on

account of the Eller legacy, 2,000 mark ($500) on account of the Co-

thenius legacy, and 1,800 mark ($450) on account of the Steiner legacy.

The physico-mathematical class has the benefit of the interest re-

sulting from the ‘‘ Humboldt Stiftung fiir Naturforschung und Reisen.”

This endowment, founded by collections after the death of Alexander von

Humboldt, received the royal sanction by decree of December 19, 1860;

its management rests in the hands of a special curatorship, and is in-

tended to assist prominent talent of all nations in the direction pursued

by Alexander von Humboldt himself and to give pecuniary assistance to

workers on natural sciences and in the execution of expeditions,

The following enterprises have been assisted thus far from the inter-

est of the capital to the amounts specified in each case :

Journey of Dr, Reinhold Hensel to the La Plata regions for the purpose of collecting
fossil remains (1863-1865, and publication in 1867), 30,657 mark ($7,664).

Expedition of Dr. Georg Schweimfurth for the botanical exploration of the south-
western Nile regions (1868-1871), 33,600 mark ($8,400).

Il.—THE ROYAL FREDERICK WILLIAM’S UNIVERSITY.

The document establishing the University was executed by King
Frederick William III, at Konigsberg, in Prussia, on the 16th of Au-
gust, 1809.

By the treaty of Tilsit, on July 9, 1807, Prussia had been deprived of
a considerable portion of its domain and the territory of the King
restricted to about 5,000,000 inhabitants.

By a short but impressive proclamation of July 24, 1807, the King
relieved his subjects beyond the river Elbe from fealty. In that procla-
mation he says: “ Inhabitants of those beloved and trusted provinces,
realms, and towns, you are well acquainted with my views and with the
events of the last year. My army was. conquered and peace had to
96 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

be concluded under the best possible conditions. The tie of 1ove and
confidence of centuries is to be severed. Fate decided, and the father
separates himself from his children, but no fate, no power may extin-
guish your memory in my heart.” Strong and sincere, too, was the love
of the inhabitants of those surrendered provinces for their king. Deep
was the sorrow in Halle and among the members of the university
which Napoleon had dissolved on the 20th of October, 1806. A deputa-
tion, consisting of Schmalz and Froriep was sent to Memel, and in their
name and that of their colleagues requested the King, in a petition of
August 22, 1307, to consider the establishment of a scientific institution
at Berlin. Hufeland, present in Memel, supported the wishes of the
delegation.

On September 4, 1807, the King issued an order to Privy Councillor
Beyme to the effect that, in view of the loss by the state of the Uni-
versity of Halle owing to the surrender of the domain west of the
river Elbe, one of the most important and perfect educational establish-
ments had ceased to exist and that it should be one of the first duties
of the government, in the consideration of a reorganization of the state,
to provide for the erection of some such establishment in the best pos-
sible manner; that the universities at Frankfort and Konigsberg were
not adapted to compensate for the loss, the former on account of the
insufficiency of local auxiliary means and the latter on account of its
great distance from the national capital; that Berlin, however, com-
bined all the means adapted for such an educationalestablishment with
the least possible expense and with the greatest possible advantage
for its usefulness. In view of these facts the establishment at Berlin of
such an institution in connection with the existing Academy of Sciences
was decided upon. All the funds which had formerly been devoted to
the support of the university at Halle were to be employed for the pur-
pose, and Privy Councillor Beyme was instructed to secure for the
new university the services of the prominent professors of Halle before
other chances were offered to and accepted by them.

Frederick the Great, in his endeavors to re-model and re-organize the
state, was not in position to do much towards universities ; he was sat-
isfied with having restored the proper rank to the highest representative
of science, and only occasionally he alluded to the need of high schools.
On April 7, 1784, he wrote to Frankfort that “the students should re-
ceive such instructions as to enable each of them to learn something
useful so as to be enabled to render efficient service to state or church,
since he thought more of this than of any formalities.” All other care
he left to his minister, von Zedlitz, who himself had become a pupil of
the great Kant. The two universities, Kénigsberg and Halle, received
prompt attention; Forster and Wolff had been appointed, and the neces-
sity of a fixed plan of instruction had repeatedly been pointed out. This
being most noticeable in the study of law, a regular schedule was pre-
pared in 1771. In 1787 the higher educational council teok the place

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. on

of the board of curators of universities. The “General Laws for the
Royal Prussian Universities, February 23, 1796,” provide that applica-
tions for public positions can be entertained only of persons who have
graduated from the university.

On January 8, 1805, Minister von Massow submitted his report on a
suitable arrangement of the universities, in the preface of which he
says: “Ithas long been a recognized fact that the universities, considered
as establishments of education or at least of instruction, should be im-
proved and arranged in a way conforming to their principal object. In
order to realize such project and to remedy the abnormal conditions,
remnants of gray antiquity, two principal obstacles have to be over-
come, namely, the dominant character of the scientific man in his one-
sidedness (partiality), and the want of funds ; the improvement of their
own financial condition will have to be the means to overcome their
obstinacy.”

A number of reformatory orders were issued during the following
years: A royal order of April 7, 1804, fixed the academic term at three
years. This was made public by circular letter of October 12, 1804, of
the minister of justice, who adds that the candidates for promotion
could be examined only upon proof of their having completed the pre-
scribed course of studies. A further order of November 27, imposes
that condition on all aliens or foreigners, who were applicants for pos-
itions requiring academic education.

The want of sufficient means too was a source of great complications.
The amounts which, at the time of the establishment of the universities,
had been ample, now barely covered the most urgent necessaries; the
budgets were insufficient to permit even an approach towards securing
the requirements demanded by progressing science. Since the equip-
ment of Halle the grants, by the State, to all universities had been but
very small, Frederick William II, during the eleven years of his reign,
having been able to spare but 12,270 thaler ($10,200,) for the combined
needs of all the universities, and their number having increased to nine
in 1802 the vital question of their existence demanded an early settle
ment.

A commission appointed for the purpose, decided on the abolishment
of a portion of the antiquated establishments. Frankfort’s income was
increased from 12,846 to 15,314 thaler ($9,635 to $11,485); Erlangen
from 30,000 to 57,768 florins ($12,857 to $24,757); Halle from 18,116 to
36,113 thaler ($13,587 to $27,085). Means of instruction were provided
and collections purchased for Frankfort and K6énigsberg. Halle was
enriched by the appointment of professors of repute, and the salaries
were increased by allowances from the royal treasury. In 1805 the
number of students had increased at Frankfort to 307, Konigsberg to
300, and at Halle to 944.

The surrender required by the treaty of Tilsit of the Halle University,
notwithstanding the oppressed condition of the State, demanded im-

mediate action with regard to the establishment of a new university
which could then be commenced in conformity with the experiences
gained by the long-continued inquiries into an improved orgauization.

Although it can not beestablished by documentary evidence, it is suf-
ficiently well known that long before the unfortunate events of 1806
the cabinet of Frederick William III had already considered the ad-
visability of founding a university at Berlin. Privy Councilor Beyme
therefore was well informed on the subject when in 1807 he was re-
quested to formulate plans for the establishment and organization of
a university at the capital of the Kingdom. It may even be positively
asserted that it was Beyme himself with whom the project originated.

He was deeply interested in universities; he was an adherent and
friend of Fichte; he had induced the King to grant him asylum at Ber-
lin; he was instrumental in having him appointed at Erlangen, and was
responsible for the appointments of Schleiermacher and Steffens to Halle

Ata large number of scientific institutions, established at an earlier
day—the Academy, the Military Academy for Officers, the Artillery
and Engineers’ School, the Military Cadet Establishment, the Mining
School, etc.—scientifically educated teachers were employed. The
science of medicine was the best provided for., The ‘ Collegium medico-
chirurgicum” represented a medical faculty for the education of young
army physicians. In 1806 the staff of that establishment was formed
by twenty professors (eighteen regular and two assistant).

Since Frederick’s time lectures were held on other scientific subjects
for purposes of practical instructions ; thus, on law and legal proceed-
ings in the department of justice, and in forestry and technology by the
general directory. TheAcademy of Arts instituted courses of lectures
for the development of the artistic taste. There were high schools con-
ducted by teachers of repute, some of them members of the Academy.
Since however an intermediate step was wanting between the two,
greater demands were made on both teachers and pupils which elevated
them almost to the dignity of an university. There were further, the
library, the botanical garden, the observatory, the natural history col-
lection of the academy, the collections of the mining and smelting de-
partment, the anatomical theater, the collection of physical, astronom-
ical, and chirurgical apparatus, the royal and the academic coin collec-
tions and the picture gallery in the royal castle.

Since the beginning of the reign of Frederick William ITI additions had
been made to the number of the existing older establishments. In 1798
the Eschke Institute for Geaf-mutes was enlarged from means furnished
by the royal treasury; in 1799 the Academy for Architects was founded
and the military establishment enlarged; in 1805 attempts were made for
the improvement of military education, and lectures were instituted for
artisans. In 1804 the academy for young officers was founded, in 1805
the statistical bureau, and in 1806 the Institute for the Blind and the
Agricultural Institute. All branches of knowledge were eared for,

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 39

Soon after Fichte’s appointment Jena furnished a second cclebrated
teacher. In 1800 Hufeland was appointed professor and director of
the “Collegium medico-chirurgicum.” The academy elected him to
membership; the medical affairs were intrusted to him, and in his posi-
tion as physician to the King opportunities were not wanting which
enabled him to render decisions on scientific questions.

For the improvement in agricultural knowledge Thaer was called in
1804, and he at once prepared for the establishment of his ‘‘ Agricult-
ural Institute.”

Alexander von Humboldt, upon the return from his expedition around
the world, on September 3, 1804, declared his intentions to enter the
services of the state. It was about this time that Beyme expected to
organize the new establishment. The programme of Gottingen—or
rather thespirit of the programme freed from all abuses,—a general scien-
tific educational establishment, was his plan for the Berlin University.

Owing to the threatening conditions, however, the project was not
consummated. Soon crushing blows demoralized the state ; on October
27, 1806, Napoleon entered the city of Frederick the Great. .

After the treaty of Tilsit, when the King and his council prepared the
organization of the great reform, the plan for the new university formed
one of the points under consideration and this gave rise to a multitude
of opinions, objections, and deliberations.

During all these deliberations the patriotism and the scientific zeal
of the professors who had already received their commissions, had been
demonsrated ; they had entered on their course of lectures. The Uni-
versity existed, although not by official recognition. It was formed
by the four professors: Schleiermacher, Schmalz, Fichte, and Wolf,
each of whom represented a faculty.

On December 3, 1808,the French evacuated Berlin. Among the changes
which took place in the national administration was the appointment of
Wilhelm von Humboldt to take charge of the public instruction.

In April, 1809, Humboldt left for K6nigsberg in order to personally
urge before the King a final determination. A building became neces-
sary, both in order to enable the professors to appear as public teachers
and to secure an appreciation of the scheme by the inhabitants. The
palace of Prince Henry had been repeatedly suggested for the purpose.
Frederick the Great had constructed it during the years 1754-1764, and
by death it had reverted to the crown. Trederick William III gave
favorable consideration to Humboldt’s wishes and donated the palace
“for all time to come.”

Greater difficulties appear to have presented themselves in obtaining
security for the required means. Hufeland in 1807 already had shown
the desirability of endowment by real estate; Humboldt shared his
views and endeavored to gain the annual means by obtaining donation
in the form of private domain belonging to the crown. In his memorial
on the subject, of July 24, 1809, Humboldt says: “It may appear
100 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

strange that the section of public instruction at the present moment of
time ventures to advocate a plan, the execution of whith would lead
one to the supposition of quieter and happier days.” He continues by
saying that only such high educational establishments as the Berlin
University is intended to be, can exert an external influence, and that
by such a foundation the King would be instrumental in combining with
him firmly everyone throughout Germany interested in education and
enlightenment; he would instill new zeal for the rejuvenation of his
realm and offer to German science a never-hoped-for asylum at a time
when part of Germany had been destroyed by war and another part
was governed over by a stranger. Thus the patriotic ideal became
prominent in the plan for the foundation of the new university.

Wilhelm von Humboldt finally recommended formally its foundation
at Berlin, to bear the time-honored name of University, since the nature
of things requires a division of scientific institutes into schools, univer-
sities, and academies. He asked in the name of the University for a
fund of 60,000 thaler, ($45,000, ) and for the two academies—the Academy
of Sciences and the Academy of Arts—a fund of 4,000 thaler ($3,000)
additional to their present means.

By order of August 16, 1809, the King proclaimed that he considered
the plan for higher education within and without the limits of the realm
of such importance as to prohibit any further delay in the foundation
of a University at Berlin which should be endowed with the privilege
to confer academic honors.

An annual amount of 150,000 thaler ($112,500,) was granted to all the
scientific establishments at Berlin, and the palace of the late Prince
Henry deeded under the name of the “‘ University building.”

At the time of financial trouble the establishment of a new univer-
sity presented a grave economic problem. The King however did not
withhold his private fortune to aid the state or the people. The gold
plate was withdrawn from the royal tables and coined and the remains
were sold.

At last the stage for the settlement of the question of internal ad-
ministration was reached. A royal decree of May 30, 1810, appointed
a commission for the purpose.

The appointment of professors continued at salaries averaging be-
tween 1,200 to 1,500 thaler ($900 to $1,125), with from 200 to 500 thaler
($150 to $375) added for travelling expenses.

On September 22, 1810, the section of public instruction submitted
to the King its tinal report, in which it was stated that ‘‘Thus this
important institute has been opened in accordance with the will of your
Majesty, and the section recognizes with respectful thanks the pow-
erful protection and grateful privileges accorded the university to
which alone it owes its rapid and healthy establishment. For among ail
the renowned universities of Kurope there is not one possessed of such
“a number of tried teachers, with such scientific means, and with such
splendor in building.”

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 101

Indeed, it was an important moment when the section submitted
the first programme of the lectures which contained such celebrated
names. It was the often-promised seed which at last was being sown.

The staff was formed of fifty-eight teachers, of which twenty-four
were regular professors, nine secondary professors, fourteen private
lecturers, Six members of the academy, and five teachers of modern
languages. One hundred and sixteen courses of lectures were an-
nounced, of which the theological faculty had ten, the medical thirty-
four, philosophical sixty-two, and the faculty of law ten.

The general specialties of science were pretty well represented; the
introduction of German antiquity as a subject for historic philological
study was new. MHeindorf, in his introductory address, impressively
urged on the students the expectations held of them, for the improve-
ment of the newly created university.

By order of September 28, Schmalz was nominated rector, and
Schleiermacher, Biener, Hufeland, and Fichte, deans. On October 1 the
section requested the rector to begin matriculations, and on October
6 this act was performed on six students.

On October 10,1810, upon the invitation of the rector, the first as-
sembly took place, at the university building, consisting of sixteen pro-
fessors. It was opened by the rector with an address; in place of oath
of office he bound the professors to this duty by pressure of hand, where-
upon the senate of the university was declared constituted.

The senate ruled that each faculty should conter honors upon the
graduates, and that the use of the lecture-rooms was to be arranged ac-
cording to a compensating table. The lectures were set to begin on
October 19, to which general rule, however, exceptions were permitted,
thus Hufeland commenced his lectures and the instructions at the poli-
clinical institute on the 15th, Griife on the same day, Fichte on the
21st of October, while a few did not commence until the beginning of
November.

As an external mark of distinetion the following epigram was pro-
posed by Wolf:

‘“ Universitati Litterarie Fridericus Guilelmus III rex. A. CIptocce
vit.” It was recommended by Battemann and sanctioned by the
King.

A change in the administration occurred at about the time of the open-
ing of theuniversity. By decree of November 20, 1810, a new presi-
dent was appointed for the department of public instruction, and the
decree was communicated to all German universities. The acts of the
Berlin University begin with it. It stated: “You will be convinced
yourself of the importance which the department of worship and public
instruction now intrusted to your keeping exerts upon the welfare of
the state and its inhabitants, even upon that of humanity. The object
which the section of worship must always have in view is the advance-
ment of true religiousness without compulsion or mysterious fanatism,
102 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

and liberty of consience and toleration without public offense. In its
position as leading oftice it should direct its efforts toward enabling all
classes to obtain a thorough training in science and general knowledge,
and to disseminate clear conception and such opinions as tend to create
usefulness in practical life, true patriotism, obedience to and confidence
in the Government and the constitution. Most especially however it
should guard against the introduction, into science, of the spirit of ex-
clusiveness, which is nowhere more reprehensible than in objects pertain-
ing to human knowledge.”

The winter term of 181213 began under increasing excitement. The
first news of the destruction, in Russia, of the French army, reduced
the number of participants to the lectures. Teachers and pupils were
seized by irresistible desire to regain the fatherland and its most holy
possessions.

On February 3, the King called his people to arms; the word had been
given and all restraint ceased ; the lectures were abandoned, many pro-
fessors dismissing their pupils with impressive words. On March 28,
Schleiermacher read from the pulpit the King’s “call to arms.”

Quiet again reigned in the halls of learning ; as far as the excitement
permitted, the remainder re-commenced their labors. In the bulletin
of March 18, the rector announced, that notwithstanding the small num-
ber of students remaining—most of them being foreigners—the lectures
interrupted during the exciting days would be resumed in the coming
summer, Only fifteen professors resumed their lectures.

Upon the re-entry at Berlin, on March 31, 1814, of the returning vic-
tors, the thought at once was expressed to erect a monument to the
memory of those who had perished for the good of the country. On
July 16, the senate resolved to engrave their names upon a monument
to be erected in the large hall.

The University however gave a further proof of its appreciation and
eratitude, by conferring the honorary doctor title upon the following:

Hardenberg—patrie in discrimine posit sospitatorum felicissimum ;
Bliicher—Germanice libertatis vindicem acessimum, glorie Borussice
recuperatorum in victum, felicem, immortatum, Tauenzien, York, Kleist,
Biilow,—victoriis, preeclarissimis de patrisimmortaliter meritos, German-
ormum libertatis vindices; Gneisenau—consiliis sapientissimis, promp-
tissimis, saluberissimis in procliorum discrimine de patria immortaliter
meritum, Germanorum libertatis vindicem.

On February 9, 1815, the anniversary of the war-like action of the
students had been celebrated, and on April 7 the King called to arms
again. A second hot and bloody summer followed and for a second
time Paris surrendered.

During the Franco-Prussian war of 1870~71, eight hundred students
and professors joined the army, and of this number thirty-eight stu-
dents and one private lecturer lost their lives. On August 3, 1875, the
rector unveiled a tablet erected to the memory of the brave young men.

The oration of Prof. Dr. Mittermaier, of Heidelberg, delivered in the
name of the representatives of the German and Swiss Universities on
October 15, 1860, the fiftieth anniversary of the Berlin Alma Mater
bears witness to the fact that its scientific development fully realized
the expectations expressed in the reseript of November 23, 1810.

The University preserves a grateful memory to all who principally
contributed to its developments. Thus the birthday of King Frederick
William II] and of the reigning King are celebrated by orations.

In addition to the busts of Kings Frederick William III and IV busts
of thirty-three rectors and professors adora the aula.

As regards the organization of the University the propositions of
Schleiermacher were adopted- The faculties of the present day were
considered the fundamental columus of the structure. His memorial
with regard to the organization of the theological faculty served as :
basis for the others.

On December 28, 1810, the regulation of the academic jurisdiction was
issued as fundamental law for all Prussian Universities. As a means
of protection, the Department of Instruction, on February 8, 1811, is-
sued to the students a “ecard of recognition.” On February 20,1811, ree-
tor and senate informed all universities of the opening and joined the
union. The present statutes were sanctioned by the King on October
31, 1816, and delivered on April 26, 1517.

Based on these statutes a later order of January 29, 1858, gave spe-
cial statutes to each of the faculties. Those of the medical and philo-
sophical faculties have repeatedly been altered since.

The decrees of 1819 and 1834, based on the resolutions of the German
Parliament, had originated under influences of principles and conditions
which in consequence of the political movement of 1848 had experienced
such modifications as to induce the Government to relieve the Prussian
universities from the unjust suspicion expressed in those decrees and to
return to them the independence required for the development of an
active corporate life.

Upon request the universities furnished reports as to a comfortable
change with regard to academic jurisdiction and discipline.

On October 29, 1879, a law was promulgated relating to the question
of jurisdiction and discipline at the national universities.

At the opening of the University fifty-eight professors were appointed;
during the summer term of 1886 their number had increased to two
hundred and gighty-three, distributed among the faculties as follows :
Theology, seventeen; law, twenty-two; medicine, one hundred and two ;
philosophy, one hundred and forty-two.

The salaries for the regular professors range between 3,000 ($750) and
12,000 mark ($3,000) annually, and for the secondary professors from
900 to 4,800 mark ($225 to $1,200.)

An almost regular increase has been noticed in the number of stu-
dents. It may suffice here to state that while for the winter term of
104. THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

1810 one hundred and ninety-eight students were received at the
University (and for the summer term twenty-nine), the number of
matriculations for the corresponding terms of 1886 were two thousand
one hundred and sixty-seven, and one thousand and seventy-one, respect-
ively.

Notwithstanding the comparatively short period of its existence, the
University has already become the recipient of many rich bequests for
the benefit of worthy and needy students.

In order to promote diligence among the students prize questions are
propounded annually in accordance with the following ministerial regu-
lations :

REGULATION OF SEPTEMBER 16, 1824, WITH REGARD TO PRIZE QUESTIONS.

(1) The faculties of the Royal University are to publish annually
prize questions for solution by the students.

(2) These prize questions are to relate to strictly scientific subjects,
and, although the fundamental knowledge may have become known in
the academic lectures, they must be of such a character as to demand
thorough study and independent research in order to show, in the
answers, the amount of education received and the individual judgment.

(3) One prize question each is to be published annually by the theo-
logical, juristical, and medical faculties, and two by the philosophical
faculty, the latter alternating from year to year between one general
philosophical and one historical, against one philologhical and one
mathematical or physical.

(4) Hach faculty selects its own questions alternately from its various
branches. The member to whose specialty the question belongs is the
privileged questioner. The proposition has to be made in writing and
be submitted to the faculty in regular session on the 20th July, and is
accepted with two-thirds majority.

(5) All prize questions are published annually, on the birthday of
the King, by means of a Latin programme.

(6) Only students of the Berlin University are admitted to competi-
tion, and the essay has to be written in Latin.

(7) Nine months are allowed for the essay, viz, from August 3 of one
year to May 3 of the following year.

(8) The replies have to be delivered to the University secretary in
sealed envelopes and addressed to the respective faculty. Each essay is
to contain a sealed slip bearing on its inside the name of the writer and
on the outside the motto which has to be written in the essay under-
neath the title. These essays have to be delivered to the faculty un-
opened. Before a decision can be made it is necessary that the essays
circulate among all members of the faculty ; the member who has pro-
pounded the question then has to make an explicit report of all the es-
says and submit the same to the faculty at the latest on the 20th of July,
when the papers will be discussed as to their merits. Every regular

ei

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 105

professor is required to be present at that meeting or to make a satis-
factory excuse. The majority decides as to the award.

(9) A number of essays of insufficient value having been received
only by any faculty, it retains the award until the year following, when
two questions will be propounded. In the case of unsatisfactory results
to the second issue, the ministry reserves the right for future action.

(10) The prize consists of a gold medal in the value of 25 dueats
($60).

(11) The festive proclamation of all the prizes takes place on August
3, the birthday of the King, following immediately upon the oration.
The public speaker of the University is required to announce, in brief,
the decisions of the faculty of each of the essays. Thereupon the en-
velope containing the motto of the victorious student is opened and
read, together with the name of the essayist.

(12) The envelopes containing the names of the unsuccessful candi-
dates are not opened, but may be withdrawn from the secretary, together
with the essay. The crowned essay is also returned to the writer after a
copy has been made of it for the archives of the University, and may
be published by the author for his own benefit.

The same rules are adopted with regard to the municipal prizes, of
which one to the value of 225 mark ($56) is placed at the disposal of
each faculty. The prizes were founded, together with stipend, on occa-
asion of the fiftieth anniversary of the University.

Statistics of prize questions for the years 1825-1885 show the fol-
lowing results: 537 questions were propounded during the past sixty
years; 779 essays have been submitted, and of these 292, 37.5 per cent.
have received the prize ; 25, 3.2 per cent., the second reward ; and 108,
13.9 per cent., public acknowledgment. With regard to the distribu-
tion by faculties the following result is shown:

Institutes connected with the University.

The University Library.—The first impulse towards establishing an
independent library for the University was given in 1829, both by the
rector and the senate of the University and by the chief librarian of the
Royal Library, Prof. Dr. Wicken. In areport to the proper department
of the Government it was stated that the Royal Library had become in-
sufficient for the wants of the professors and students of the University,
and that for those a separate library had become necessary. The es-
tablishment of such a library was then decided by royal decree of Feb-
ruary 20, 1831.

The resources of the library were at first very moderate, and consisted
of 500 thaler ($375), collected from the students; furthermore, it was
decided that each doctor upon promotion, each private lecturer upon
his qualification, and each professor upon receiving his appointment,
was to pay 5 thaler ($3.75) towards the support of the library. For its
location some rooms were allotted in the Royal Library. The chief
librarian of the Royal Library was designated as principal librarian,
and two officials given him for the performance of the administrative
work.

The establishment prospered, notwithstanding the many difficulties
presenting themselves. The moderate means were carefully invested
in suitable books, and the library further increased by many donations
and by the compulsory additions exacted from the publishing houses
of the palatinate Brandenburg.

The library lends books for home perusal and is also used as a read-
ing-room.

For the lending of books the library is open daily from 9 A. M. to 2
P. M.; on Saturdays, only to 1 p.m. The reading-room is open daily
from 9 A. M.to 7 P.M.; on Saturdays to 1 P.M. only. During the sum-
mer vacations the library is open from 11 A. M. to 1 P. M., but the read-
ing-room remains closed.

The budget of the library, exclusive of salaries, is put at 10,500
mark ($2,625) for books and binding, and 4,300 ($1,075) for incidentals.

The personnel consists of a librarian, three custodians, two assist-
ants, two auxiliary helpers, two library messengers, and one porter.

The Mathematical Seminary.—The first “seminary aet,” the request for
the establishment of a mathematical seminary, originated on April 6,
1860, and is worded as follows:

“In the mathematical sciences more than in any other branch of sci-
ence it is necessary that not alone the substance of the lecture is under-
stood, but that the students, and especially the more advanced, should
have an opportunity for instruction in the application of the object of
their studies. For that purpose the establishment of a mathematical
seminary in connection with the University appears to present the best
solution. In the opinion of the petitioners such a mathematical scien-

tific seminary would tend to promote the mathematical education of
the students and exert a greatand favorable influence upon their prac-
tical training as teachers.”

An annual appropriation of 500 thaler ($575) was requested for the
support of the seminary, of which sum one-half was to be devoted to
the acquisition of a special library and the other half to prizes.

On April 23, 1861, the ministry authorized the announcement of sem-
inary exercises under certain provisional regulations, and the sum of
250 thaler ($187.50) was allowed for the purchase of books. On April
26, 1861, the students were invited to participate. The alphabetical
list of the members of the first mathematical seminary is dated. May 5,
1861. 3
On October 15, 1861, the draft of regulations for the mathematical
seminary was submitted to the University and accepted October 7,
1864.

The regulations of October 7, 1864, are as follows:

(1) The mathematical seminary is a public institute established in
connection with the University and has for its object the instruction of
such students of mathematical sciences as have already obtained a cer-
tain degree of proficiency by aiding them in the independent applica-
tion and by affording them literary assistance, thus enabling them later
on to promote and increase mathematical studies.

(2) The minister of education has the appointment of two professors
of the philosophical faculty to supervise the exercises of the students.

(5) Only those matriculated students can be admitted as ordinary
members who devote themselves especially to the study of mathematics
and have been engaged in that study for at least one year at some uni-
versity. Foreigners are eligible on the same conditions.

(4) The admission is granted upon the presentation to the director
of a discourse and an essay, the examination of which will prove
whether the applicant possesses sufficient knowledge and interest to
advantageously partake of the privilege. The essay may be omitted
upon special occasions in which the director’s testimonial is sufficient
guaranty for the efficiency of the applicant.

(5) The number of ordinary members is limited to twelve. The di-
rectors, however, are empowered to exceed that number by the appoint-
ment, as extraordinary members, of a few students possessing the neces-
sary requirements for admission.

(6) Any remiss member may, after having been cautioned and admon-
ished by the director, be excluded from attending the seminary.

(7) The meetings of the seminary take place weekly, at such a time
as will permit its extension to two hours or more.

(8) The scientific exercises of the seminary are both oral and in writ-
ing. The oral exercises consist in the free discussion of known mathe-
matical problems or of questions propounded by the director, or, at times,
by some of the students, and in addresses by the students on the results
108 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

of their own experiments or on the results of their studies. The exer-
cises in writing consist in the execution of problems given by the di-
rector, and are arranged in such succession that they will cover the
entire field of mathematics, and combined, tend to its better understand-
ing, and also in the preparation of larger essays or demonstrations, the
subjects of which are given by the director or are selected by the
students themselves. The board of directors examine and judge these
essays.

(9) The students who excel in both oral and other exercises are—
toward the close of each course—to be reported to the minister of edu-
cation with recommendations for the prizes set apart for the purpose.
These semi-annual reports contain also a statement of the exercises held
and the general state of the seminary.

(10) A library of the best and most useful mathematical works is to
be maintained for the free use of the students and for use in the meet-
ings of the seminary.

The annual appropriation for the seminary, since April 25, 1864, has
been 1,200 mark ($300), of which 750 mark ($187.50) are expended
for the library and 450 ($112.50) for prizes. The latter however were
established by order of March 14, 1884,

The Observatory and Computation Institute.—The first impulse for the
establishment of the Beriin Observatory was given toward the end of
the seventeenth century by the acceptance, on the part of the Protest-
ant powers of Germany, of the Gregorian calendar. King Frederick
I, in order to emancipate the country from foreign researches and labors
which had largely entered into consideration on important occasions,
resolved to utilize this change which affected all domestic affairs, by
establishing an observatory and a society of sciences. He therefore
ordered the erection of a square tower, 84 feet high and 40 feet a side,
the second floor of which was to be reserved for the society of sciences,
while the third floor was to be utilized by the astronomer of the society
for purposes of observation. The building was dedicated on January
19. 1G 11

The first astronomer of the society, Gottlieb Kireh, had been ap-
pointed in July, 1700, but he died (July 25, 1710) before the completion
of the building.

On October 15, 1828, King Frederick William III granted a request
of Alexander von Humbold for the purchase of a Fraunhofer refractor.
The instrument was received in March, 1829, but remained in the pack-
ing cases.

On August 10, 1850, permission was given for the purchase of a site
for a new observatory which was to be located in sufficiently close prox-
imity to the academy and the university to enable employés of the ob-
servatory to continue their connection with those establishments. The
building was completed in 1835.

EE
THE NATIONAL ‘SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN, 109

In 1868 a new meridian circle by Pistor and Martius was purchased ;
in 1869 a hermetically sealed pendalum clock by I*. Tiede and in 1879 a
universal transit by C. Bamberg.

The publication of the ‘“ Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch,” which
had been under the care of the director of the observatory, was in 1874
transferred to a special division of the observatory, known by the name
of * Astronomisches Rechen-Institut” (Astronomical Computation In-
stitute).

The Computation Institute, in addition to its regular staff, gives employ-
ment to five regular and to a varying number of temporary assistants.

The Institute also contains rooms for the exercises of the Univer-
sity Seminary for the instruction, in scientific calculation, of a number
of students.

The budget of the observatory for regular expenses is fixed at 11,340
mark ($2,835), and that of the Computing Institute at 8,800 mark
($2,200), to which for the latter are added 15,000 mark ($3,750), to be
used in the publication of the ‘“ Astronomisches Jahrbuch,” together
with the compensation of any computers required for the same.

In close connection with the “Astronomisches Jahrbuch,” the publiea-
tion of which was begun in 1772 by order of the Royal Academy (and
the one hundred and thirteenth annual volume of which has just been
published), the observatory, since its reconstruction in 1835, has em-
ployed itself prineipally with the determination of positions of fixed
stars, planets, and comets.

The results of these observations are published partly in five folio
volumes, entitled “ Beobachtungen der kéniglichen Sternwarte zu Ber-
lin,” and partly in the “ Astronomische Nachrichten.”

Five planets belonging to the group between Mars and Jupiter and
thirteen comets have been discovered at the observatory.

A remarkable fact is to be recorded in the annals of the observatory
in that the planet Neptune, the existence of which had been surmised
by Bessel in 1823 from some inexplicable irregularities in the motion of
Uranus, and the location of which had been calculated by Le Verrier
and Adams on the basis of these disturbances was really discovered in
the calculated place on September 23, 1846, by Galle, with the aid of
the Fraunhofer refractor.

The Meteorological Institute.—-This Institute owes its existence to the
exertions of Alexander von Humboldt, as a result of which, the King
by order of October 17, 1847, caused its establishment under the direc-
tion of the Royal Statistical Bureau, of which it formed an independent
scientific division until Mareh 31, 1886.

Negotiations for the re-organization of the meteorological bureau pend-
ing for ten years at last terminated in the spring of 1885, and Dr. von
Bezold, professor at the technical high school at Munich, who had been
induced to accept the newly created chair of meteorology at the Berlin
University, was appointed director of the Meteorological Institute,
110 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The Institute is to be regarded as a central point for the collection,
computation, and publication of meteorological stations of North Ger-
many, the meteorological systems of Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, Hesse,
the Saxon states and other smaller states having combined with it.

The system represents the following arrangemént of stations :

(a) One hundred and thirty stations of Class 11, that is, such stations
making three observations daily of all the instruments.

(b) Fifty stations of Class IIT, at which a limited number of instru-
ments is observed twice daily.

(c) Highty rain-fall stations.

At present a plan is under consideration for the incorporation in the
system of the stations (about one hundred and fifty) of the ‘ Society
for Agricultural Meteorology in the province of Saxony and in the Uck-
ermark,” and of the stations of the “Agricultural Central Association
of Lithunia and Masuren.”

Theappropriation for the Institute for the administrative year 188687
amounted to 73,060 mark ($18,265), of which 32,560 ($8,140) were in-
tended for salaries of officials, assistants, and computors, 21,000 mark
($5,250), for the payment of observers on stations, and 19,500 mark
($4,875) for other expenses. For architectural changes within the
rooms occupied, and for the purchase of instruments, 44,000 mark
($11,000) were allowed by special act and further amounts promised
during the coming year.

The Physical Institute-—Upon the extensive space lying between the
Neue Wilhelmstrasse, Schlachtgasse, Dorotheenstrasse and river Spree
two large buildings are located, each of 108 meter frontage, of which
the one along the Dorotheenstrasse has been fitted up for the Physio-
logical and Pharmacological Institutes, while that facing the Spree is
occupied by the Physical and the Second Chemical Institutes, all being
provided with the required directorial dwellings.

The total cost of the entire structures is 4,500,000 mark ($1,125,000),
of which 200,000 ($50,000) were paid for the foundations of the Physi-
ological Institute, 310,000 ($77,500) for that of the Physical Institute,
120,000 ($30,000) for that of the Pharmacalogical Institute, 110,000
($27,500) for that of the Chemical Institute and 60,000 ($15,000) for
those of the dwelling houses, representing 800,0°0 mark ($200,000),
or almost one-fifth of the entire cost of construction.

Until the year 1833 the University did not possess any proper col-
lection of physical apparatus, though a few instruments employed in the
course of lectures by professors had been purchased and placed in the
hands of professors using them for scientific investigation. It is true
that the University had allowed 500 thaler ($375) annually for in-
creasing the collection of physical apparatus, yet the money was gen-
erally employed for other purposes. ‘The want of proper apparatus be-
came apparent when Professor Magnus, the late director of the col-

lections, desired to employ a number of them in illustrating some phys-
ical lectures. On that occasion Baron von Altenstein, the minister of
instruction, proposed to professor Magnus to purchase the required in-
struments from his own means and suggested a repayment by the
state, of 500 thaler ($375) for four successive years, in consideration of
which a certain proportion of the apparatus was to become national
property.

The proposition was accepted and the instruments thus purchased
formed the nucleus of the present physical collection. At the expira-
tion of the above contract a similar arrangement was made, being
renewed annually until 1543, when, upon the recommendation of Min-
ister Eichhorn, the collection was placed in possession of a certain
allowance per year, which formed the only means ever placed at its dis-
posal with the two exceptions of the donations of the collection used
at the university for illustrating Goethe’s color theories, and of a col-
lection in the hands of Prof. Paul Erman, and transterred to the insti-
tute upon his death. Both collections combined represented only
twenty-seven pieces, so that almost the entire collection may be said to
have been procured from private means.

Since 1844 the collection had its rooms in the university building,
but space was wanting to enable physical researches to be executed.

The personal collection of apparatus and the library of Professor
Magnus, bequeathed to the university, formed the foundation of the:
physical laboratory of the university. Rooms were assigned upon the
first floor of the east wing and connected with basement rooms con-
taining the collections by means of winding stairs.

The present building was begun in 1873, and in 1878 had progressed
sufficiently to jastify the removal from the university building.

After the first few terms of instruction all available space had been
occupied, and further applications for admittance had to be rejected.

The present director of the institute is Privy Councillor of Govern-
ment, Professor Dr. von Helmholtz.

The Mineralogical Museum.—The collection of minerals established
by Privy Councillor of Mines Dietrich Karsten, in 1789, by order of
Minister Heinitz, consisted of Karsten’s private collection, which he
had presented to the State in 1781, and of the purchased collections of
Councillor of Mines Ferber and Privy Councillor of Finanee Gerhard.
In i801 it had been placed in the mint building, and by royal decree of
October 18, 1510, became incorporated in the collections of the univer-
sity under the conditions that the mining department should ber ecog.
nized as co-partner and should be consulted in case of required changes-
In September, 1814, it was placed on exhibition in the university build-
ing after having been named, in May, 1814, the Mineralogical Museum
of the University.
112 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN,

For the support and increase of the museum 1,000 thaler ($759) were
allowed annually since August, 1816, which amount has since been in-
creased to 5,020 mark ($1,255), not to include the personal expenses.

The museum contains the following divisions:

(1) Systematic mineralogical collection.

(2) Display collection of large specimens.

(3) Collection of cut stones and rocks.

(4) Meteorite collection.

(5) Systematic geognostie collection.

(6) Geographical collection, or the geognostic collection of the vari-
ous countries of the earth.

(7) The paleontological collection.

(8) The library, with collection of charts, well supplied with topo-
graphical maps and geognostic maps by the L. v. Borch collection.

The First Chemical Institute.—It is certainly a very remarkable fact
that of all the German universities that of Berlin should have been the
very last to organize a chemical institute, comprising everything re-
quired for the present state of science, since the chemists connected
with the University during the first fifty years of its existence occupy a
prominent place among the most celebrated investigators of the present
century.

But if, notwithstanding such illustrious representations, a great
chemical institute was not established until about twenty years ago, it
must be considered that at the time of the foundation of the University
chemistry was already existing in the academy of sciences, and that the
chemical chair at the University was generally occupied by the academical
chemist, and hence the University was relieved, in a measure, from the
responsibility of providing laboratories for the chemical professors.

The Chemical Institute of the University owes its existence to the
energy of the Minister of Education in demanding the appointment of a
university professor for the chemical chair.

The selection of a proper site was the next difficulty to overcome, and
this was accomplished by the purchase, for the sum of 72,000 mark
($18,000) from the Academy of a portion of its own estate, to which suf-
cient additional ground was obtained for the erection of an edifice, which
was begun in 1865 and completed in 1867.

In addition to the sum estimated, 75,000 mark ($18,750) were expended
on the internal arrangements; thus, counting all necessary expenditures,
including the 72,000 mark ($18,000) paid the academy and two-thirds of
the purchase money paid for the additional lot (only two-thirds of the
ground having been used in the erection of the building), 954,000 mark
($238,500) were willingly paid by the Prussian Government for the
erection of the new institute.

The Second Chemical Institute.—This institute was established simul-
taneously with the Pharmacological Institute, and opened on Easter,

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 113

1883. It serves specially for the study of inorganic, analytic, and min-
eral chemistry, and stands under the direction of Prof. Dr. Karl Fried-
rich Rammelsberg. °

For the practical teaching two divisions have been established. In
the synthetic laboratory the students are employed in the preparations
of chemical substances and the easier problems of quantitative analysis,
while in the analytical division quantitative analysis forms the princi-
pal subject.

The budget for regular expenditures of the institute, including the use
of water and gas has been fixed at 11,285 mark ($2,821).

The Technological Institute.—This Institute originated in the private
laboratory of Professor Wichelhans. To this were added the techno-
logical collections of the late Professor Magnus, and by decree of Sep-
tember 11, 1873, the first means were provided for the ‘establishment
of a technological laboratory and for the tectnological colleetion of the
University.” In April, 1883, the newly created Technological Institute
was removed to its present quarters under the direction of Prof. Dr.
Karl Hermann Wichelhans.

The publications of the institute are printed principally in the “Be-
richte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft,” in the “ Verhandlungen
des Vereins zur Befoérderung des Gewerbetleisses,” and in the ‘ Patent-
Schriften.”

The Botanical Garden.—The greater part of the present Botanical
Garden was, at about the middle of the seventeenth century, employed
for the growing of hops, to be used in the electoral brewery. In 1679,
on occasion of the abolishing of the brewery, Elector Frederick William
ordered the garden to be planted in fruit trees and garden truck.

Under the reign of King Frederick I the entire internal arrangement
was changed. Glass-houses were erected, oranges were raised, and the
kitchen garden changed into a royal pleasure garden.

Under Frederick William I the plans were changed; the garden
began to expand and to assume a really botanical character; but the
reform had barely begun when the garden was transferred to the keep-
ing of the Society of Sciences. It again lost its botanical character,
since, in planting medicinal herbs and plants for the royal pharmacy,
the practical king had sought to utilize it to the fullest extent. The
society could not afford to expend more than 600 mark ($150) a year on
the garden, and furthermore, its great distance from the city rendered
it difficult to find a suitable person to supervise it.

In 1809, on oceasion of the founding of the University, the Academy
of Sciences was relieved of the Botanical Garden, which was then placed
under the University, with a guarantied income of 13,000 mark ($3,250).

In 1820 the present winterhouse was erected, and in 1821 the oldest
palm house; the latter, however, proving too small it was replaced by
the present succulent house, In 1832 the garden possessed eighteen

H. Mis. 224——8

greenhouse divisions, representing a combined length of 350 meters
(1,148 feet) with 7,920 kilometer cubic contents.

On July 22, 1852, the Victoria Regia bloomed for the first time in a
building erected for its exclusive tse.

In view of the principal object of the garden, the advancement of sei-
entific botany, it should be the effort of the director to collect in his
garden extensive material for scientific botanical research, and to see
that it represents the entire vegetable kingdom to completeness.

The scientific means at the command of the garden are the library,
the microscope with auxiliary apparatus, all of which, together with
the catalogues of plants, are preserved in the offices of the palm house.

The working force consists of two principal assistants (foremen), fifteen
regular assistants, ten younger assistants, some of them voluntary assist-
ants without compensation, one overseer, one engineer, One mason,

‘one cabinet-maker, one carpenter, one glazier, one house-keeper, seven-
teen laborers, seven to ten char-women, and ten to twelve boys.

The plants cultivated in the garden during the year 1886 comprise
18,837 species, varieties, and forms. The budget is fixed at 85,365
mark ($21,341).

The garden is open to the public every day (except Saturday, San-
day, and legal holidays) from 8 A. M. to7 Pp. M. (in winter until dusk).
Strangers are admitted at any day.

The public makes very good use of this permission, more especially
during the period of blooming of the Victoria Regia, and also when the
plantation of gourds is at its height. From six to seven thousand vis-
itors have been recorded in a single day.

Special permission by card to visit the grounds is given to any one
desiring to investigate or study, and this special permission includes
the privilege to visit portions closed against the ordinary public, and
it also entitles the bearer to receive flowers or other material for in-
vestigation. Plants or parts of plants are also furnished to non-resi-
dent botanists. The garden supplies the University and Royal Schools
with the material required for botanical lectures.

The Botanical Museum.—Collections of curious objects from the
vegetable kingdom as well as of dried and mounted plants had been
commenced by the Society (later Academy) of Sciences in the last cen-
tury. The first herbarium presented to the society which possessed a
really scientific value was that of Andreas Gundelsheimer, consisting
of oriental specimens. Another important collection was begun by Lud-
wig Stosch in the Netherlands, France, and the Pyrenees by order of
King Frederick I. The Royal Library, too, and the Art Collection con-
tained a few collections of plants bound up in book form, of which the
oldest and most interesting is that of J. 8. Elsholz, the court physician
of the great elector and director of the pleasure garden, The “ Gesell-

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 115

schaft naturforschender Freunde” at Berlin, too. had its own cabinet
of natural curiosities, but all these divisions were gradually transferred
to the Botanical Museum.

The Royal Herbarium proper, which did not receive the designation
“Royal Botanical Museum” until 1879, existed since 1818, when the
Willdenow collection of plants was purchased for 36,000 mark ($9,000. )

The collections were at first deposited in the rear portion of the build-
ing (Dorotheenstrasse 10) belonging to the Academy, and in 1822 were
transferred to a house which had been purchased as a dwelling house for
the officials of the garden, but which had been let to the “ School for
Gardeners.” :

In 1824 the herbarium of Inspector Otto was purchased, comprising
between fourteen and fifteen thousand species and Leopold von Buchs
presented his collection made at the Canary Islands.

A new feature was now introduced, that of the lending out of collec-
tions. Until then they had been used and studied in the building by
but few people ; now any botanist employed in morphological and floral
studies could have the required material sent him; thus the herbarium
obtained a number of collaborators who voluntarily undertook the
determination of species, which resulted in the acquisition of a number of
original specimens. Upon the return of a collection the duplicates were
divided and employed in exchange with the leading establishments of
London, St. Petersburg, Paris, ete. The budget for the purchase of
plants being limited to 720 mark ($180), only collections of the greatest
importance could be procured from these means.

Although the means for running expenses were thus limited, the Gov-
ernment provided liberally on extraordinary occasions to secure the
acquisition of large and important private collections.

By such means the Kunth herbarium was obtained, which consisted of :
(1) A general collection of about 44,500 species in about 60,000 speci-
mens, comprising many duplicates, from the Paris Museum, and about
3,000 originals to ‘ Humboldt, Bonpland, and Kunth Nova Genera et
Species ;” (2) a collection of dried plants from the botanical garden at
Berlin, comprising 10,300 species; and (3) a collection of woods. The
price paid was 24,000 mark ($6,000).

The Link herbarium purchased in 1852 for 4,500 mark ($1,125)
enriched principally the European flora, especially by specimens col-
lected by himself in Portugal and Greece. It also increased the collee-
tion of fungi. The arrangement of garden plants, too, was of great
importance. The entire collection represented 3,113 eryptogams and
16,382 phanerogams.

The von Nees von Hserbeck collection of glumacexw was purchased
in 1855 for 2,700 mark ($675). It contained 9,559 species.

The collection of lichens of Major von Flotow was purchased in 1857
for 6,000 mark ($1.500),
116 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

Two donations were received which, aside fromthe transportation,
did not cause further expense. One of them, the herbarium of Lieu-
tenant General von Gansauge, obtained in 1871, contained about 15,000
species, while that of Professor Laurer, received in 1874, contained a
rare collection of lichens and of mosses.

Upon the death, in 1877, of A. Brauns, the state purchased his collec-
tions for 21,000 mark ($5,250), the Academy of Sciences his scientific
manuscripts for 4,000 mark ($1,000). They were transferred to the
museum on condition that they were to be preserved and made
accessible to specialists. The botanical collections consisted of: (1) a
morphological herbarium of forty-three maps; (2) an herbarium of
phanerogams of considerable extent, which excelled by its wealth of
forms and localities; (3) a valuable herbarium of cryptogams ; (4) a
collection of fruits and seeds, among which the cycadie, conifer, and
juglandie deserve special mention.

Owing to the want of sufficient accommodation the herbarium was,
in 1857, transferred to Berlin, and assigned rooms in the éast wing of
the University. Here the collections remained until March, 1880, when
they wereremoved to the new building, erected at a cost of 280,000 mark
($70,000) for the building and 80,000 ($20,000) for its internal arrange-
ment.

At about that time the large and precious Mettenius collection of
ferns was purchased for 6,000 mark ($1,500).

The most valuable collection of Dr. Georg von Martens was pre-
sented by his heirs. It comprised 12,459 species and contained among
others the originals employed in “ Schiibler and Martens flora of Wiir-
temberg,” valuable collections made by the Wiirtemberg Travelers
Society, and also 4,101 species of salt water alge in the best possible state
of preservation and fully described by the former owner.

Finally the herbarium of the late Professor Lorentz was received
(who died in the Argentine Republic), which contained a large and crit-
ical collection of mosses as well as a rich herbarium of the Argentine
flora, being largely the originals employed in ‘‘ Griesebach’s determina-
tion of the Argentine plants.”

Access to the collections is granted to any one personally known or
properly introduced. Any one desiring to compare or study plants or
other objects receives permission upon application, and is furnished
desk and temporary desk-room. Responsible botanists within the Prus-
sian domains can obtain the use of objects at their respective homes
for a limited period of time. Non-resident botanists can obtain that
privilege only upon special permission from the department.

The collections of the museum are open to the general public in sum-
mer on Monday and Thursday afternoons.

The University Garden.—Owing to the great distance of the botanical
garden the establishment of a garden as auxiliary means in the botan-

. * . . . . = s
ical instructions received early consideration soon after the founding of

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 117

the University, and in 1820 the space in the rear of the University was
employed tor the purpose. The garden was intended to contain the
principal officinal plants and those resembling these; and also, as far as
practicable, economical, technical, and commercial plants; while in the
surrounding vacant spaces, ornamental trees and shrubs were to be
planted. The establishment was completed in 1821~22. It was pro-
vided with a green-house containing a cold and a hot division. The
plants were furnished by the botanical garden, under the care of which
the new plantation was placed. In 1837 if was made independent, by
the appointment as University gardener, of Mr. Sauer, of the botanical
garden. As long as but one regular chair existed at the University for
botany, the incumbent always held the appointment of director of both
the Botanical and University gardens. .

The garden has not increased in extent. A small earth-house was
added to the existing green-house. Another small dirt-house without
furnace serves for the wintering of less sensitive plants. The heating
of the other houses is effected by means of hot water through copper
pipes. In the selection of green-house plants special attention was
given to those used for officinal and domestic purposes.

The Botanical Institute.—This Institute was established in 1878 on the
top floor of the old Exchange Building. A large hall with favorable
light was set aside for microscopical examinations by beginners, and
several other rooms were given to the more advanced students. A small
chamber served as dark-room and a large corner room was fitted up as
a physiological laboratory. The director, the assistants, and the mes-
senger had each one room assigned; an assembly room and a lecture
hall seating from thirty to thirty-five were also provided.

In the autumn of 1883 the Institute was transferred to its present lo-
cation, the situation of which, in the vicinity of the University and of
the University garden, may be pronounced as very favorable.

The Institute possesses at present nineteen large and twenty-eight
small microscopes, together with all the required auxiliary apparatus
(prisms, micrometer, goniometer, etc.), twenty-six demonstration micro-
scopes for use in lectures, one microtom, one micro-spectroscope, one
solar spectroscope, one large spectral apparatus by G. & S. Merz, one
heliostate by Heele, one achromatic lens by Steinheil (81 millimeters
aperture), one cathetometer by Heele, one compression-pump with lever
by Pfeil, one double-action air-pump, one double aspirator by Warm-
brunn & Quilitz, one gas-regulator, one gasometer, one astatic mirror
galvanometer by Siemens & lace gneve battery, three klino-
stats, among which one very large and powerful by Heele, one auxan-
ometer with self-registering clock-work, two pair of balance-scales, and
numerous smaller apparatus and models for physiological research.

The budget, exclusive of administration and salaries of assistant
and messenger, was 5,950 mark ($1,482.50) until 1885 when, in consid-
eration of lessened necessities, it was decreased to 3,930 mark ($982.50),
118 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The direction of the Institute is combined with the chair of anatomy
and physiology of plants at the Royal University.

The Institute of Vegetable Physiology.—The Institute was created in
1873, and in 1880 united with the botanico-microscopical laboratory of the
Agricultural High School in such a manner that the use of the scientific
apparatus and inventory belonging to the University is available to the
students of either of these establishments, while the means of support
are to be furnished by the Department of Agriculture exclusively.

The object of the Institute is the study of morphology, development,
and physiology of the plants. For this purpose lectures are delivered
and practical instruction furnished ; the students also have an oppor-
tunity for making individual examinations.

The Institute contains (1) a hall for the students in microscopy, seat-
ing twenty, and facing north; (2) a room for the director; (5) a room
seating four for chemical work ; (4) a large room for the assistant and
six of the advanced students. This room also contains the library.
(5) A dark-rocm ; (6) a room for physiological research and containing
a Pfeffer rotary apparatus ; (7) two greenhouses, in which the objects
for microscopical and physiological research are produced ; (8) a small
experimental garden.

The Institute is well provided with optical instruments and physiolog-
ical apparatus ; it also contains extensive collections for instruction,
comprising the subject of morphology, productionand development, and
the physiology of plants.

The Zodlogical Museum.—The establishment of the Zodlogical Museum
is contemporaneous with the foundation of the University. The Museum
was located in the University building since its erection, but from the
beginning the plan and execution exceeded the material required for
demonstration, and that in the direction of creating a basis for the sys-
tematic knowledge of all living animals, thus to form a zodlogical center
for Germany similar to that at Paris, London, Leiden, Vienna, for their
respective countries. The Museum was planned by Count Joh. v. Hoff-
mannsegg, who made the first donation, consisting of several thousand
specimens of Brazilian mammals, birds, and reptiles, The principal
and fundamental stock was formed by the donation, by the royal col-
lections, of a number of natural history objects, consisting of mammals,
birds, insects, and shells; to these were added the following original
collections :

(1) The collection of fishes of Dr. Marcus Elieser Bloch, practicing
physician at Berlin. Originals (partly dried, partly in sieoRen described
in his ‘ Naturgeschichte der Fische Deutschlands,” 1782-1785, and
‘“ Naturgeschichte der ausliindischen Fische,” 1785-1795.

(2) The collection of crustacea, of Joh. Friedr, Wilh. Herbst, pastor at
the Church of St. Mary, and purchased for 447 thaler ($312.75). CGrigi-
nals used in his ‘** Naturgeschichte der Krabben und Krebse,” 1790-1804.

“Tt. US |
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 119

(3) A large collection of corals, presented by counsellor of the court,
Dr. Gerresheim of Dresden, whose oil portrait has been placed in one of
the halls of the Museum. The collection serves as basis to Ehrenberg’s
systematic classification of corals.

A few but highly important original specimens of fishes and conehy-
lie from Northeast Asia were presented by P.S. Pallas, explorer of
Russia.

Of other collections added by explorers at the earlier times the fol-
lowing may be mentioned: Krebs and Bergius, South Africa; C. G.
Ehrenberg and Hemprich, Egypt, Nubia, and the coasts of the Red
Sea; Sello and v. Olfen, Brazil and the La Plata regions; von Sack,
Deppe, and Schiede, Mexico; Carl Ehrenberg, West Indies, principally
St. Thomas; J. Cabanis and Zimmermann, southern portion of North
America; v. Minutoli, Canary Islands; v. Sack, Cyprus; Eversmann,
Bokhara; Lamare-Picquot, Maskarena, and Bengal (purchased in 1836
for 6,000 thaler) ($4,500); Lhotsky and Schayer, Australia, ete.

The museum is provided with a fair library, which is placed in the
rooms of the director and custodians.

The budget was, in 1810, fixed at 2,200 thaler ($1,650), of which 1,900
($1,425) were paid for salaries (exclusive of that of the director). In
1837 the budget was increased to 3,550 thaler ($2,662.50) (salaries 3,400,
($2,550) ); in 1843 to 5,565 thaler ($4,173.75). At present the amount
allowed is (exclusive of the director’s salary) 1,800 mark ($450) 54,670
mark ($13,667.50), from which salaries are paid to the curators 3,300
($825) and 4,800 mark ($1,200), together with allowance for dwelling to
assistants, and taxidermists from 1,200 to 2,400 mark ($300 to $600),
while 22,960 ($5,740) are set aside for incidentals, of which amount
one-half is reserved for purchases.

The museum is open to the general public every Thursday and Friday
from J2 to2 P.M. Owing to the fact that the exhibition halls are not
heated, the attendance varies with the season; it is most numerous on
holidays. Classes of schools may be admitted any day upon proper
application. Studentsare supplied with tickets which admit them every
forenoon. Artists, upon receiving permission from the director, have
an opportunity of drawing and sketching. Scientific geologists are
admitted at any hour of the day

The Zoological Institute—When, upon the death of Prof. Wilhelm
Peters, director of the museum, a separation of the University protes-
sorship and direction of the Royal Zoological Museum had been de.
cided on, the establishment of a Zoological Institute, devoted exclu-
sively to the needs of academic instruction and to scientific investiga-
tion, became urgent.

The Natural History Museum.—The Zoological Museum and the Zoo-

logical Institute were, in 1888, removed to a new building, which bears
the name “ Natural History Museum.”
12U) THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The building consists of three stories above the basement. ‘The front
portion is intended to contain the Mineralogical Museum; it forms almost
a square around a glass-covered court, which serves as an entrance to
the rear portion of the building containing the Zoological Museum.

The Zoological Garden.—The history of the Berlin Zoological Garden
antedates that of any similar establishments of Germany.

Its nucleus was the colleetion of live animals of King Frederick Will-
iam III, located upon the ** Pfaueninsel,” near Potsdam. Upon hisdeath
Professor Lichtenstein, the naturalist, influenced King Frederick Will-
iam IV to consign the animals, as a beginning, to a zoological garden,
the erection of which, in the neighborhood of the capital, had already
been considered.

The former pheasant garden (Koénigliche Fasanerie) was given up to
the enterprise, which soon was called into existence by a syndicate, with
the assistance of money grants from the Government.

For a number of years the garden served principally for scientific
investigations until, in about 1865, by the establishment of gardens else.
where the general attention was drawn toward it. A comparison with
the more recent establishment proved rather unfavorable to the home
garden. A visit of the Queen Augusta to the zoological garden at
Cologne gave rise to the consideration of important improvements, sug-
gested with the view of making the Berlin garden worthy of the. dis-
tinction of being located in the national capital.

The first step was the formation of a company which issued shares to
the amount of 300,000 mark ($75,000) and effected an additional loan of
1,500,000 mark ($375,000). The ground was donated by the Govern-
ment, and Dr. H. Bodinus, former director of the Cologne garden, was
invited to assume the directorship. So energetically did he proceed
that the first concert could be arranged for in the garden in the sum-
mer of 1870, before the commencement of the Franco-Prussian war.
The new establishment had extended its usefulness and combined the
scientific investigations with amusement.

Inrapid succession the various buildings were now erected which were
to serve as quarters for the many animals, so that, in addition to the
old buildings, accommodations were prepared for the mammals, animals
of prey, birds of prey, for the antelopes, birds, elephants, ete. Consid-
erable additions were made to the stock of animals, and thus, within a
remarkably short space of time, an establishment was created which,
while it could favorably compare with any other existing garden, was
also worthy its rank, and took a conspicuous place among the points of
interest of the residence of the German Empire.

With regard to the collection it may be said that it comprises repre-
sentatives of most all the important mammals and birds, in as many
species and specimens as can successfully be provided for.

The more recent construction of a house for monkeys has offered an

opportunity for a rich and carefully selected collection of those ani-
mals.

The Aquarium.—The aquarium, constructed during the years 186769
(by the genial architect H. Luer), is an original and interesting struct-
ure, rich in grottoes and caves, and is intended to harbor animals of
other classes besides aquatic animals. The marine invertebrates are
principally represented.

The Berlin Aquarium, in its arrangement and facilities for the obser-

vation and study of the lower ciasses of animals, offers considerable
means for natural history instruction, and thus aids materially in the
development of natural history study.

To scientists it offers facilities by placing at their disposal the mate-
rial collected from many places and seas.

II.—THE MILITARY MEDICAL INSTITUTES.

[Omitted here. ]
IV.—THE AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL.

With regard to agricultural instruction in the margraviate Branden-
burg it may be stated that a chair for agriculture was founded in 172
at the University of Frankfort on the Oder.

In 1806, by invitation of King Frederick William [Ll Albrecht Thaer
established the first German agricultural academy under the name of
“ Royal Academic School of Agriculture at Méglin.”

In 1810, the trying time for the Kingdom, when the development of
economie and industrial resources assumed the greatest importance in
the struggle to supply means for a successful warfare, the agricultural
school became incorporated in the University; the distance, however,
preventing the close relationship anticipated, a separation again took
place.

Notwithstanding the discontinuance of agricultural lectures, some few
agriculturists continued in their attendance to the University, and the
authorities kept up their relationship to the agricultural academy in

_ order to enable students in the branches of political sciences to complete

their studies by participating in the practical course of instruction.

While in most of the Prussian provinces special agricultural schools
were established, the agricultural central union of the district of
Potsdam insisted on having the connection kept up between the Royal
Academic School of Agriculture and the University at Berlin.

In 1860 the old agricultural academy at Méglin ceased to exist and
an agricultural school was established at Berlin, which at first, accord-
ing to sections 1, 3, 4, and 5, of the programme illustrating the object
of the institute, was depending on the University in so far as being open
to all matriculated students.

The present requirements exact of an agriculturist a more thorough

‘scientific training than was expected at the agricultural school at

MOglin.
122 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

Since 1866 the students are required to register at the central bureau
of the Agricultural Department instead of at the University as formerly.
In 1867 the Department of Agriculture began the establishment of an —
agricultural museum, the nucleus being formed by the exhibits re-
turned from the Paris exhibition. 4

:

The demand for increased accommodations becoming felt more press-
ingly each year, the east portion of the site formerly occupied by the
Royal Iron Foundry, was assigned to the erection of an agricultural
building while the remaining portions were to be devoted to buildings
for the Geological Institute and Mining Academy, and for the natural
history Museum of the University. F

The agricultural building was erected during the years 1876—~80
and opened in 1880, with the International Fishery Exhibition, which

‘was held in the portion of the building intended for the agricultural
museum. The opening of the museum, therefore, had to be deferred
until after the close of the exhibition.

By royal decree of February 14, 1881, the united institute and museum
received the name ‘*“ Agricultural High School.” Its constitution was
arranged for by provisional statutes of May 27, 1881, of the Minister
of Agriculture. -

The constitution provides for the appointment of a commission for
the decision of points of organization and to submit propositions.

The directors of the various divisions have been granted considerable
freedom of action and separate funds have been placed at their dis-
posal.

The corps of teachers is presided over by a rector whose election
rests with the above-named commission, subject to confirmation by the
ministry.

The business affairs of the establishment are conducted in part by a
board of trustees and partly by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The degree of education required for admission is that demanded to
secure the privilege of voluntary service in the army.

An addition was made to the scope of the institute by the establish-
ment, in 1883, by ministerial decree of October 10, 1882, of a geodetic
and technical course for surveying. Special teachers have been em-
ployed for the purpose. The students of geodesy are required to pos-
sess the degree of the highest class of a gymnasium or real school.

The museum is to serve the double purpose of academic instruction
and of being the central institute which enables investigators to engage
in special studies; by its exhibits it also serves for the education of the
people.

The budget for 1886~87 fixed the expenses of the high school at
224,970 mark ($56,242.50): its income is 39,328 mark ($9,832); hence’
an appropriation of 185,642 mark ($46,410.50) is required. |

Examinations take place for (1) agriculturists, (2) land surveyors, (3)
technical culture, (4) agricultural teachers.

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 123

Three prize questions are propounded at the close of each summer
term, which pertain (1) to agriculture, (2) fundamental sciences, (3)
technic of cultivation. The award is 150 mark ($37.50) in each case.
Essays of merit, though not quite up to the standard of perfection,
receive honorable mention.

The Central Library.—lIts object and purpose is to offer to professors
and students of the agricultural high school all necessary scientific
means, and in its capacity as the most complete specific library, to aid
all interests. For this purpose much attention is given to its comple-
tion in all branches of agriculture, forestry, ete.

The Physical Cabinet and the Meteorological Observatory.—The collection
contains the apparatus required for instruction in physics. They are
employed by the students in the course of lectures and in investigations.
A series of meteorological apparatus has been provided, which serves
the purpose of instruction. Three daily readings are made of the in-
struments prescribed forstations of thesecond class; the results are pub-
lished by the Prussian Meteorological Institute. A number of automatic
apparatus register the progress of pressure, temperature, precipitation,
force, and velocity of wind, and these automatic records serve in the
preparation of essays on climatology, etc. The entire arrangement is
that of a station of the second order. A regular exchange of barograms
has been arranged with Hamburg, Magdeburg, Wien, and Copenhagen

The Chemical Institute—The principal object of the institute is the in-
struction of the students in general chemistry, qualitative and quantita-
tive analysis. Itis located in a building adjoining the Agricultural High
School, and also accommodates the laboratory of the Society for the
Production of Beet Sugar in the German Empire. The ground floor
contains a large work room arranged for fifty students, and is provided
with skylight; furthermore an auditory, having a capacity of one hun-
dred and forty. The upper floor accommodates the private laboratory
of the director and a few rooms intended for special investigations.

The chemical instruction comprises: (1) In winter, lectures on inor-
ganic, and (2) in summer, on organic chemistry ; (3) practical exercises
in qualitative and quantitative analyses, and other chemical experi-
ments, for which purpose the laboratory is open daily from 9 A. mM. to 5
P. M.

The Mineralogic-Pedological Institute.—In view of the existing connec-
tion between mineralogy, geology, and agriculture a chair of mineralogy
and pedology (zéd0v, earth, soil, and 2dyos) was provided at the re-

organization, in 1881, of the agricultural high school. The occupant

has also the charge over the recently created mineralogic-geologic-
pedological museum.

Its collections resolve themselves into the two classes for (a) educa-
tion and (b) exhibition.
124 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

(a) The educational collections contain minerals, rocks, and soils of
importance in agriculture ; the collection has been made instructive by
the selection of specimens showing the changes produced by exposure.

(b) The exhibition collections are placed in horizontal and perpendic-
ular glass cases, and represent a well organized and described material
for the instruction in and contemplation of the composition and variety
of the native soil.

The mineralogical coliection is arranged according to the Zirkel sys-
tem, and shows the more important minerals in their characteristic forms.

The petrographic collection is arranged according to Credner’s sys-
tem, and exhibits characteristic forms of rocks. The exhibition hall
also contains several geological charts, of which may be specially men-
tioned that of the Harz Mountains and the Thuringian forest, which is
composed of eighty-one sheets.

The geological and pedological collection is exhibited in the adjoining
hall. Commencing with the most recent formations, it passes through
the various layers of humus, clay, lime, gravel, sand, and ferriferous
soils, including the organic inclosures of alluvium, diluvium, and tertiary
periods which connect with the mesozoic, paleozoic, and archaic periods.

Chemical analyses, microscopic preparations, solutions, reliefs, pro-
files, and tableaus complete the objects. Illustrations of sceneries be-
longing to the various geological periods and illustrating their pecu-
liarities are suspended above the exhibition cases.

The pedological division has found accommodations along the light
court of the museum. It contains apparatus for examination of the
soil, the mineral fertilizers, fuel, representations of Thuringian brown
coal industry, manipulations of asphaltum, flint, and peat, and indus-
tries.

The Agronomic-Pedological Institute—The Institute embraces two
divisions, the agronomic-pedological and agricultural-chemical labor-
atory, and the division for soil, fertilizer, and irrigation and drainage.

The agronomic-pedological laboratory purports to promote the scien-
tific explorations ef the soil in its relation to the structure of plants and
to its cultivation, and to offer facilities for the study and execution of
agronomic-pedological and agricultural-chemical experiment.

The agronomic-pedological laboratory consists of a large room for the
accommodation of the assistant and twenty students, and contains all
apparatus for agricultural-chemical and physical examination and
analysis.

The Institute of Vegetable Physiology.—The Institute was established
in 1881, and comprises a laboratory for physiological work, with dark
room, microscopic room, chemical division, green-house, and experi-
mental garden. It possesses all the necessary apparatus, instruments
and collections, and a library. ‘The Institute prepares the physio-
logical experiments required in the lectures, and offers opportunity to
the student to practice vegetable physiology and pathology. To the

director, his assistants, and the practitioners it affords means for spe-
cial investigation in vegetable physiology and the diseases of culti-
vated plants.

The Vegetable Division of the Museum.— When the request was made on
the agriculturists to furnish exhibits for the Paris Exposition of 1867
they readily responded, but expressed themselves desirous of transfer-
ring their exhibits, after the close of the exposition, to the Government,
to serve in the foundation of an agricultural museum. This proposi-
tion was accepted, and many objects were added to those exhibits, by
donation or by purchase. The products of agriculture, of course, re-
ceived the first consideration, and thus the wealth of the division may
be explained. Corresponding to the enlargement of the agricultural
administration to a department of agriculture, lands, and forests, the
science of forestry has received consideration, and the collection of
woods has becomea very complete one, owing to donations of foreign
governments, especially of those of India, Japan, and of the French
colonies.

The Zoological Institute.x—The collections of the Institute are rela-
tively complete, especially with regard to the osteology of mammals; it
contains the collection of skulls and skeletons of Herm von Nathu-
sius and those of the abandoned agricultural academies of Eldena and
Proskau. In addition to the skulls of other mammals it contains large
collections of the skulls of horses, hogs, cattle, sheep, and dogs of the
various breeds, domestic and foreign, which in completeness can not be
excelled by any other museum. The remaining divisions of the zoolog-
ical collections are generally restricted to the European animals of
interest or importance tothe agriculturist, without, however, excluding
such foreign animals as may be required in the systematic study of the
animal kingdom. The Institute proposes to investigate all zoological
questions relating to agriculture, and to carefully trace the derivation
and evolution of all domesticated animals, for which purpose a special
interest is given to the fossil and subfossil remains of the domestic
animals and to their relatives.

The Institute of Animal Physiology.—Since the enlargement of the
last year, the institute has the use of two largeand four small laborato-
ries, Which are provided with all improvements required for the analyt-
ical and vivisectory labors of the institute. It also controls a stable
with divisions for the various animals and some basement rooms which,
on account of their good light, are well adapted for the keeping of ani-
mals under observation. A small respiratory apparatus has found room
in the basement.

The institute possesses the required apparatus for microscopical
work and for the study of material changes of the mechanism of the
nervous system, of respiration and cireulation. Additions to the appa-
ratus are made whenever needed, as far as the means at disposal per-
mit.
12G THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The institute serves for instruction in so far as it aids the lectures on
animal physiology, sanitation, ete., by actual demonstration and experl-
ments.

The Zoo-technical Institute.—The means by which the Zoo-technical
Institute expects to succeed, excepting the necessary apparatus, ete.,
are found in the representations, models, and, as regards sheep-
raising, of samples of wool. The wealth of the collection and the cor-
rectness of the representations render this portion of the museum a
permanent animal exhibition, with however the additional advantage
that the model does not represent one single act, but that each typical
appearance of the agricultural domestic animal has been shown therein.
It is a further object of the Zoo technical Museum to keep before the
pubiie all possible phases of animal industry of the nation.

The Institute is in charge of Privy Councellor, Prof. Dr. H. Settegast.

The Institute of Geodetic Instruction.—The geodetic collection,
founded in 1883, contains ten theodolites (three with microscopes), two
compass apparatus, eleven levelling instruments, of which two are for
exact work having all auxiliary apparatus, one sextant, one prism circle,
one engineer’s table, one Fortin barometer, four aneroids, three Amler
planimeters, two precision planimeters, two pantographs, apparatus
for the examination of the above instruments, demonstration apparatus,
and surveying apparatus. Available for instruction are further a geo-
detie library, a collection of plans, and a series of forty-two wall-dia-
grams representing geodetic instruments.

The surveying exercises are—during the summer—executed in the
open air; in winter, indoors in a large hall which has been constructed
for the purpose. Two large rooms are used in geodetic computations
and drawing; adjoining these is the room of the assistant, which con-
tains the collection of plans, and that of the professor, which contains
the library.

Division of Machinery and Models.—The collection,located in a hall of
the ground floor, consists of measuring apparatus, actual machines, or
models. Among the latter may be mentioned the Rausch models ex-
hibited in the southern vestibule and show the historical development
of hand implements and of the plow. The requirements of instruction
and of practical use determine the enlargement of the collections; the
additions, therefore, confine themselves principally to elements of con-
struction and to apparatus for the testing of useful machinery.

A collection of serviceable machinery in complete working order is
employed for instruction. For that purpose an engine of 35 horse-
power has been mounted in the hall. A water reservoir located in the
hall contains a pulsometer, a centrifugal pump, an open archimedian
screw, an overshot and an undershot wheel. Exhibitors have free use
of space for terms of six months; the articles exhibited are published
annually in the Deutsche landwirthschaftliche Presse. The space will

admit of the exhibition of about two hundred objects, including three
to four locomotives and as many combined threshers.

The Division of Fermentation and Starch-making.—This division repre-
sents the above industries and belongs to the State only in so far as it
occupies an official building and its director is one of the teachers of
the agricultural high-school. The management is in the hands of the fol-
lowing technical associations: The Society of Distillers in Germany,
the Society and Experimental Institute for Brewing, and the Society of
Starch Manufacturers in Germany. These associations, with a mem-
bership of about three thousand, pay 100,000 mark ($25,000) annually
towards the support of the division.

The Division of Sugar Industry.—This division, supported by the Society
for Beet-Sugar Industry in the German elas receives its rooms from
the state free of expense, Its objects are: (1) the education of chemists
for the sugar industry; (2) any nat required by a member of
the society and the testing of instruments of precision ; (3) the opening
up of new fields regarding the composition of raw substances, auxiliary
substances, and products of manufacture, as well as the development
of technic and supervision of management. These objects are attained
by the labors of the very completely organized laboratory, by lectures,
and by attendance to the periodical meetings of the industrials.

The Royal School for Gardening, and the National Nursery.—Although
occupying separate localities, but closely related, both establishments
owe their existence to the exertions, in 1823, of the general director of
the gardens, Dr. Lenné, who secured the means necessary for their es-
tablishment from the munificency of King I’rederick William III, from
the interested departments of the government, from the society for the
promotion of horticulture in the Prussian states and from the stock-
holders of the national nursery. The royal decree of August 20, 1823,
granted them the privileges of a corporation.

The Gardening school, whose principal object was the education of the
various grades of gardeners, had its practical division at Schéneberg, a
suburb of Berlin, while the division for scientific and artistic instrue
tion was located upon the “ Pfaueninsel,” near Potsdam. Owing toinsuf-
ficient results caused by the separation the divisions at Schoneberg were
abandoned and combined with the establishment at Potsdam.

The principal building of the establishment, in addition to the apart-
ment set aside for the inspector, contains halls for instruction and for
the collections, as also accommodation for twenty-seven apprentices
which number, however, is generally exceeded. This arrangement, to-
gether with the permission of the Emperor of the freedom of the im-
perial gardens for purposes of instruction, and the connection with the
national nursery, affords great facilities.

The National Nursery is located upon a territory of 200 acres in ex-
tent. In addition to the training of young gardeners it has engaged in
128 ‘THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

the examination of important pomological questions and subjects and is
testing and supplying to fruit-growers reliable standard trees.

Both establishments have been placed under the care of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and are managed by a board of trustees composed
of a representative of the Department of Agriculture, lands and for-
ests, who is the president, a representative of the royal garden in-
tendancy and a member of the society for the promotion of horticulture
in the Royal Prussian state. The immediate administration is in the
hands of Royal Garden Inspector Jiihleke, assisted by two inspectors
and one secretary.

V.—THE GEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AND THE MINING ACADEMY.

The Mining Academy.—This was called into existence by royal decree
of September 1, 1860,. In its organization the same points were con-
sidered which for some time prior had been adopted in the training of
candidates for technical positions.

The mining officials requiring an education which involves a knowl-
edge of law, national economy, and the natural sciences, in addition to
their technical attainments were, until then, required to finish their
studies at some national university. In the organization of the Berlin
Academy all branches had been provided for thus enabling the student
to complete his studies without being obliged to visit a university.
The programme of instruction therefore provided for the following
branches:

(1) Science of mining. (2) Mining, surveying and mathematical
geography. (3) Practice of mine surveying and in drafting. (4) Sei-
ence of salt mining. (5) Science of manufacture. (6) General metal-
lurgy. (7) General assaying. (8) Blowpipe. (8) Iron mining. (9)
Projecting of iron-works. (11) Assaying of iron. (12) Metallurgical
technology. (13) Chemical technology. (14) Science of machinery.
(15) Machines for mining and smelting works. (16) Construction. (17)
Architectural construction. (18) Drawing. (19) Plane and spherical
trigonometry, stereometry, and analytical geometry. (20) Descriptive
geometry. (21) Differential and integral calculus. (22) Mechanics.
(23) Mineralogy. (24) Mineralogical practice. (25) Petrography.
(26) Petrographic practice. (27) Paleontology. (28) Paleontological
determinations. (29) Fossil plants. (30) Geognosy. (31) Geology of
quaternary formations. (32) General geology. (33) Analytical chem-
istry. (34) Chemical laboratory. (35) Mining laws.

The Geological Institute.—The first beginning of the present institute
may be traced back to the year 1862. he office of the royal director
of mines had commenced the construction of geological maps of the
Rhine province and of Westphalia at a scale of 1:80000, of Nether and
Upper Silesia at a seale of 1:100000, and for the province of Saxony it
had undertaken a continuation of von Strombeck’s map of the district
of Magdeburg.

THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 129

When, in the execution of that work, the maps of the general staff,
which were prepared to ascale of 1: 25000, were compared, it was shown
in a prominent manner that geological maps constructed according to
that scale would be of infinitely greater value both for scientific and
practical purposes than maps constructed at a scale of 1:100000. It
was, therefore, decided to accept the scale of 1:25000 as a basis for all
the maps of the entire State.

The execution of the survey and the construction of the maps on the
prescribed scale was commenced in various portions of the State. First
of all, attention was given to the provinces of Hesse and Hanover,
which, in 1866, had been added to the Kingdom, because they would
form a continuation of the survey already begun of the Harz Mount-
ains and the Thuringian Forest. It then was extended to the former
Duchy of Nassau, the southern portion of the Rhine province and to
the plains of North Germany and to the provinces of Silesia.

The Kingdom of Saxony, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Grand Duchy of
Hesse have since adopted the Prussian plan and have consented to the
construction of a geological map on a scale of 1: 25000.

As regards the organization of the geological survey, it may be stated
that since 1862 geological surveys were made by teachers of mineralogy
at the mining academy at Berlin. The building of this academy con-
tained the geological and mineralogical collections intended both for
instruction and for explorations, and the results of the surveys were
worked out in that building.

On January 1, 1873, the Royal Geological Institute was established,
and on April 8, 1875, received the final statutes, as follows:

SEc. 1. It is the object of the Geological Institute to execute the
geological examinations of the Kingdom of Prussia and to digest the re-
sults in a manner to make them available and useful to science, as well
as to the economic interest of the country.

Sec. 2. In accordance with the above the Geological Institute
will execute the following work: (1) The construction and publication
of a geological map of the entire state, on the basis of the original
surveys of the General Staff, on a scale of 1: 25000. This chart is to
contain a representation of the geological formations, condition of the
soil, and the occurrence of useful stone and minerals, and is to be ac-
companied by descriptive text. (2) The construction of a geological
chart on a basis of 1: 100000. (3) The publication of monographs on
geological or mineralogical objects of special interest. (4) The publi-
cation of essays on geological, paleontological, or montanistic con-
tents, supplementing the geological chart. (5) The collection and
preservation of all documents obtained in the construction of the publi-
cations. All these, together with profiles and other representations
and illustrations, will be combined in the Geological Museum, to which
are to be connected the technological collections of the ‘Museum of
Mining and Metallurgy.” These combined collections will afford a very

H. Mis. 224——9
130 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

complete representation of the geological structure, composition of
soil, mineral wealth, and of the industries of the country based thereon.
(6) The collection and preservation of geological specimens and infor-
mation relating thereto.

Src. 3. The superintendeney of the Geological Institute will be
placed into the hands of two directors appointed by the King, one of
them to be the director of the Royal Mining Academy. The works of
the Geological Institute will be performed, under their direction, by
geologists of the Government and assistants.

Src. 18. The Geological Institute and the Mining Academy are placed
under the Ministry of commerce, industry, and public works. The
director of the mining academy is to conduct the business of the Insti-
tute. He will be assisted by a board of trustees, to be appointed by
the Minister of commerce, industry, and public works, who are obliged
to participate in the organic arrangement and in the determination of
the regular course of instruction.

The library consists of about 36,000 volumes, relating to mining,
smelting, salines, mineralogy, geology, geography, ethnography, pale-
ontology, and scientific explorations. A large portion is represented
by the former mining library of the department.

Its use is intended primarily for the Institute and the Academy, ana
their professors and students, as well as for the other divisions of the
department of public works. The privilege may however be extended
to other persons. Connected with the library is a reading-room, which
is open to the public on all days of the week from 10 A. M. to 2 P. M.,
but is closed during the month of September.

VI.—THE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL.

The Technical High School originated on April 1, 1879, in the uniting
of the Royal Academy for Architects (founded in 1799) with the Tech-
nological Institute (founded in 1821).

Its organization is regulated by a constitutional statute of July 28,
1882. Its object is to afford a higher education in all technical and in-
dustrial branches and to promote the sciences and arts which form part
of technical education.

The Technical High School presents five divisions: (1) architecture ;
(2) civilengineering; (3) machine emgineering and naval architecture ;
(4) chemistry and metallurgy ; (5) general sciences.

The regular professors receive their appointment from the King.

The plan of instruction applies to a yearly term; the students have
the selection of the lectures and of the exercises desired by them.

Admittance is granted to graduates trom Prussian high schools.
Others may be accepted upon the personal decision of the rector as to
their qualification.

Each division is managed by a director, who is assisted by a commit-
tee selected from among the teachers of the respective divisions, while
the rector and the senate supervise the entire high school. :

at
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 131

Each division is complete in itself. It is the duty of the committees
of teachers to oversee the scientific instruction of the students within
their own section. Its president, elected from among their own num-
ber, communicates with the rector and the senate.

The senate consists of the rector, as presiding ofticer, the retired rec-
tor (prorector), the chiefs of the divisions, the chief of the section of
naval architecture, and a number of teachers appointed by the various
committees for the term of two years.

The position of private lecturer may be obtained by adhesion to one
of the existing divisions. The applicant is required to furnish the fol-
lowing documentary evidence: (1) a curriculum vitae; (2) graduation
from a high school (gymnasium or realschule); (3) testimonial of a
tbree-years academic study and proof of the successful performance of
the first technical examination required by the state or of the diploma
examination at some German technical high school, or of the doctor de-
gree of some German university ; (4) proof of a continued three-years
course of scientific or artistic study following the university term; (5)
a manuscript or printed essay on the specialty of the applicant (archi-
tects may replace the essay by plans or by bringing satisfactory proof
of having had charge of some important construction) ; (6) an official
testimonial of character, and in case the applicant is a German, proof
of his having performed his military duties. All the above conditions
having been complied with to the satisfaction of the division, the appli-
cant is required to hold one lecture and to subject himself to an exami-
nation.

The corps of teachers at present consists of fifty-seven professors
and twenty-four private teachers.

The Mineralogical Institute.—In addition to the lecture-rooms the Insti-
tute comprises: (1) The laboratory for crystallographic-physical, and
chemico-mineralogical experiments; (2) a mineralogical collection ; (3)
a geological collection; (4) the mineralogical museum.

The lectures combine a course for the practical determination of min-
erals by microchemical tests and by blow-pipe, determinations of rocks,
and instructions for geological surveying.

The public museum, comprising two halls, contains: (1) The system-
atic mineralogical collection (Tamnan); (2) a mineralogic-technical
collection ; and (3) the geoiogical collection.

The geological room contains a collection from the Gotthard Tun.
nel, together with geological profile of the Gotthard in the plane of the
axis of the tunnel; projection, 1:2000; a geological collection arranged
according to formations.

The Laboratory for Inorganic Chemistry.—The laboratory has room for
Sixty-six operators; they occupy two larger and two smaller halls.
Separate rooms are provided for special work.

An auditory of one hundred and seventy seats is situated within the
middle section; it connects with rooms for preparation and collections.
132 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The Laboratory of Organic Chemistry.—Erected by Prof. A. Baeyer in
1860, with eighteen students as part of the former Technical Academy.
It was enlarged to forty places on occassion of the re-construction of the
Technical High School. It is used by students of the fifth and sixth
terms. The studies comprise analytical and preparative exercises in
the field of organic chemistry; facilities are given for independent
researches.

The Metallurgical Laboratory.—The institute is the most recent of the
laboratories of the Technical High School. In addition to the lecture
rooms, and the room for the instruction of drawing and projecting, of
smelting works, ete., the Laboratory comprises: (1) the metallurgical
laboratory ; (2) the assaying laboratory, and the metallurgical collec-
tion.

The assay laboratory of sixteen seats, and separated from the assay
room by a glass door, occupies a separate room. It is provided with
all necessary apparatus, consisting of muffles, wind furnaces of various
sizes, tables, and quenching troughs, ete.

A forge iia some storage rooms eoruplere the facilities of the labor-
atory.

The Laboratory confines itself to the examination of metals, flux,
smelting products, fuel; it pays special attention to gas analysis in its
relation to generator gases, noxious gases, etc.; to electrolysis; to the
examination and production of fire-proof articles.

The Laboratory of Technical Chemistry.—Established in 1884, the Lab-
oratory occupies rooms on the second floor for an auditory and chemico-
technological collection consisting principally of raw materials of inter-
est to the chemical industry, especially those employed in ceramics,
glass manufactory, textile industry, manufactory of sugar, also inter-
mixtures, and finished articles.

The Photo-chemical Laboratory.—It was established in 1864 as part of
the instructions of the Technological Institute; photographic experi-
ments were added in 1865, experiments with intermittent light in 1870,
spectral analysis in 1873, lectures on electric-lighting in 1881, and lect-
ures on interior application of electric light in 1886. The object of the
Laboratory has received due consideration in the re-organization of the
Technical High School.

The Royal Mechanico-technical Institute.—The object of the Institute
is to make official tests of materials required in technics, with the ex-
ception of building materials, and to undertake scientific examinations
in that direction. It was established in 1871, and in 1878 received its
present organization, which provides for the general supervision of this
and of its connection with and relation to other similar establishments
by the royal commission for the supervision of the technical experi-
mental institutes.

The Institute comprises three divisions, of which the first is to ex-
periment on finished articles of metals, belts, ropes, chains, woods,
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 133

machinery, etc., while the second division has to test on the principle
of Wohler-Spangenberg duration experiments, and the third is confined
to the official testing of paper. A mechanical workshop has been
placed under the charge of the second superintendent.

The Institute owns two excellent machines for the testing of finished
articles, having a power of 100,000 and 50,000 kilograms (system Wer-
der and Marten’s), six smaller machines for the same purpose, eleven
machines for duration tests, photographic, microscopic, ete., apparatus.

The Royal Testing Station of Building Materials.—This was founded on
March 1, 1871, in connection with the Technical High School; it decides
as to the quality of cements and other building material furnished to
the Government. The station owns apparatus for the testing of dura-
bility and other physical properties of burnt and unburnt artificial
stone, natural stone, cement, plaster, lime, clay pipes, and all other
building material.

The hydraulic press of the station, of 140,000 kilograms (308,646
pounds) pressure, permits the test of bodies (including pillars of brick
or natural stone) of 1 meter height and of 55 by 55°™ diameter. Tests
can be made both as to the stone and to the binding material. .

A 20-fold lever is employed in testing the resistance of cylindrical
bodies, and a 30-fold lever is used in the testing of elasticity of roofing
paper and of the adhesiveness of mortar.

Tests of clay pipes are made by horizontal pressure of from 20 to 30
atmospheres to 1 to 3 meters internal diameter.

The tests of cement are made in accordance with the rulings of No-
vember 12, 1878, of the Ministry of commerce, industry, and public
works.

With regard to adhesiveness of cement and cement mortar, a 50-fold
normal lever apparatus is used with sample piece of 59 centimeters at
the point of rupture; in pressure tests and break tests the hydraulic
press, a 500-fold lever and a 20-fold lever are employed.

With regard to fineness of grain, sieves of from 600, 900, and 5,000
“meshes to the square centimeter are employed. In ail cement tests the
officially introduced normal sand alone finds employment.

A horizontal disk of emery, operated by a gas-motor, which also oper-
ates a diamond plane machine used in finishing the bodies for pressure
tests, is employed in the experiments as to the wear of the building ma-
terials.

VIII.—OTHER SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL INSTITUTES.

The Astro-physical Observatory.—Until the first quarter of the present
century astronomy employed itself almost exclusively with the discovery

ry
134 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

of mechanics of the heavens; and the physical conditions of the stars
received but occasional, and more accidental than systematic, attention
from a few astronomers. Astro-physies had not fully developed itself as
a branch of astronomy. When, then, later, more attention was given to
certain changes on the surface of the sun and to other phenomena, the
observations were restricted to the use of such apparatus as was then
found in a well-equipped observatory, and not much difficulty was expe-
rienced in combining new requirements with the existing apparatus. It
was not until the more extending field of study brought physical and —
chemical examinations in contact with the astronomical, and more es-
pecially since theapplication ofthe spectral analysis upon the astro-phys-
ical investigations proved the most powerful means for the discovery of
the substances of which the heavenly bodies are composed, and since
photography had begun to be employed in fixing certain events observed
in the skies, it was not until then that the needs of separate establish-
ments was fully recognized, equipped with suitable instruments not re-
quired by observatories of the older kind. Such an establishment is
now found in the Astro-physical Observatory at Potsdam.

As early as 1860 it was suggested to establish, in the vicinity of Berlin,
an Observatory for the physical examination of the sun. The conditions
however were then not favorable, and it was not until 1871 that the
first steps were taken towards the realization of the project. The Crown
Prince, whose attention had been called to the effort by Prof. D. Schell-
bach, managed to have propositions invited with regard to the subject
from the director of the Berlin Observatory to which it was planned to
connect the proposed solar observatory. To this the director responded
on September 30, 1871, by submitting a memorial. It was proposed to
establish an observatory in the vicinity of Berlin well-equipped for the
direct, spectroscopic, and photographie investigation of the surface of
the sun, this observatory at the same time to be the central station for
magnetic and meteorological observations.

The Academy of Sciences, at the request of the Government, on April
29, 1872, while recognizing the interest of the subject, objected to the
execution of the proposition from the stand-point that the scientific re-
quirements would demand the establishment of two institutes, of which
one should be devoted to astro-physiecs and the other to tellurian phys-
ics; it opposed an organic combination of the two on the ground that
its scope would be too large for a successful administration. In this
case however the observations of the sun would have to form but a
part of the labors of the astro-physical institute.

The Minister of Education then called together a special commission
under the presidency of Privy Counsellor E. du Bois-Reymond, which,
in accordance with the academic consideration, recommended at first
the establishment of an astrophysical observatory, with the proviso,
however, that, in the case of uncertainty of the early erection of a tel-
lurian observatory, such magnetic observations should be provided for
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 135

which are of essential interest in the study of the sun’s activity. A
plan was prepared with regard to the establishment, organization, and
equipment of the observatory, which was accepted by the Royal Gov-
ernment and sanctioned by legislative action of 187574.

The cost of the building for astrophysical observations was 874,000
mark ($218,500). ‘

The budget for the Observatory is 71,600 mark ($17,900), of which
42,000 ($10,500) are paid out for salaries and compensation.

The astro-physical institute is not an establishment for teaching, but
is intended exclusively for the scientific investigation of this new branch
of astronomy. Since the short existence of the Observatory many scien-
tists have taken part in its works, most especially as they relate to
spectral analysis and photography.

The Observatory possesses the following larger telescopes:

One large refractor of 29.8 centimeters (113? inches) aperture and 5.4
meters focus. Objective by Schréder, mountings by A. Repsold, Ham-
burg. Placed in the central cupola. Refractor by Grubb of Dublin,
aperture 20 centimeters (7§ inches), focus 3.2 meters; in place in the
west cupola. <A refractor by Steinheil, 13.5 centimeters aperture and
2.2 focus; placed in the east cupola. Photo-heliograph and mount-
ings by Repsold, objective by Steinheil, aperture 16 centimeters and
focus 4 meters; placed in the southern addition to the main building.
Comet-seeker by Reinfelder and Hertel.

The observatory possesses a large number of spectral apparatus,
among them one large by Schroder, for observations of the sun, and
one spectroscope by the same. John Browning furnished two spectro-
scopes for observations of the stars and for solar protuberances, re-
spectively. Other spectroscopes emanate from the shops of Hilger,
London; Schmidt & Hiensch, Berlin ; Repsold, Hamburg; Topper,
Potsdam. In connection with the prism apparatus some finely gradu-
ated grates of glass and metal for the representation of grate spectra
may be mentioned ; among these are some excellent ones by Wanschaff,
Berlin.

In addition to the larger apparatus for photographie work the equip-
ment for laboratory work is excellent. For photometric representa-
tions of spectral analysis a large Zollner photometer by Wanschaff and
several smaller photometers are employed.

The Geodetic Institute—The purpose of the Institute is the improve-
ment of geodesy by scientific investigations. At the time of its estab-
lishment it was also intrusted with the Prussian portion of the European
Geodetic Survey ; in fact that undertaking was the cause of the estab-
lishment of the institute. The Kuropean Geodetic Survey developed
itself out of the Middle European Survey. In 1862, at the suggestion
of Lieutenant- General Baeyer—the collaborator of Bessels in the East-
ern Prussian Geodetic Survey and chief of the trigonometrical division
136 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

of the general staff of the Army—a convention took place of delegates
of most of the German States, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Denmark,
Sweden, Norway, etc., for the Geodetic Survey of the represented
States. 3

The Institute is divided into four sections, each of which has a chief,
one regular and one temporary assistant. The field work of the sum-
mer is computed during the winter and published.

During Baeyer’s administration, from 1869 to his death, September
10, 1885, the Institute measured the longitude of sixty-three places,
obtained longitudinal differences of twenty-one places, and completed
the astronomical work of twenty-seven stations of the trigonometrical
system. The triangles were completed by elaborate work along the
Rhine from Belgium to Switzerland and from the Middelrhein through
Thuringia to Berlin, etc., and provided with two new base lines, ob-
tained by means of measurements with a platin-iridium apparatus by
Brunner at Paris. Pendulum observations were made at thirteen
places, older ones corrected, new levels obtained from Swinemiinde to
Constanz and to the frontier of the Netherlands and of the mean water
height of the Baltic Sea. The greater portion of the work has already
been published.

The Museum of Ethnography.—sSince the middle of the present century
ethnology and anthropology have begun to take definite shape as a
science with well-pronounced objects and purposes.

Of the exotic material which reached Europe as a result of the discov-
eries of, and scientific journeys in foreign continents the objects which
could be incorporated in natural history collections found their proper
places in the zoological or botanical museums, while the objects relat-
ing to man did not have any relation to the special studies of the
times, and they therefore became more the subject of curiosity and
wonder than of earnest consideration.

These objects generally received a place in the section of foreign
curiosities in most the cabinets enjoying a princely protection, and
these sections followed the movement of their respective museums.

Thus in Berlin, where from the days of the colonial policy of the
Great Elector an interest had continued in that direction, and where
the “ Silver Chamber” of the Royal Castle contained many ethnological
articles, which, in the union of the old and the new museum were trans-
ferred under the designation of “ Ethnographic division. ”

In the new Museum one hall contained the pre-historic collections of
Prussia, while three other halls contained everything of an ethnolog-
ical character which had found its way thither by donation or purchase.
The same arrangement existed in London, Copenhagen, Lyons, Munich,
Gottingen, Wien, ete.

In the middle of the present century however, when anthropological
and ethnological studies experienced that powerful impulse which has
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 137

produced their rapid development and when the movement originated
in Engiand and France was transferred to Germany, it soon became
apparent that the space devoted to these collections demanded an im-
mediate enlargement.

Deliberations to that effect commenced in 1873 and continued during
the years 1873-1876, and finally, in 1880 resulted in the accomplish-
ment of the desire for an independent ethnographical museum.

The building was finished in the spring of 1886, at a cost of 2,000,000
mark ($500,000).

The Standard Measures Commission.—Article 18 of the law of August
17, 1868, relating to weights and measures within the North German
Confederation provides for the establishment of a standard measures
commission, with its seat at Berlin and duties specitied as follows :

‘“* A standard measures commission is to be appointed by the Confed-
eration. The same is to be located at Berlin. It is the duty of the
commission to see that all the measures within the Confederation
are conducted on a uniform system. It has to prepare the standard
and to communicate the same to all measure bureaus throughout the
Confederation, and for that reason it is to be equipped with all neces-
sary apparatus and instruments. The standard measures commission
has to issue orders and prescriptions with regard to material, form,
designation, and other conditions of weights and measures, and to de-
termine the limit of errors. It decides on the kind of scales to be used
in public and for special industrial purposes, and determines their ac-
curacy. It is to issue all necessary prescriptions and formulas for the
manufacture of weights and measures and to test the accuracy of any
articles which may be offered for the purpose. The standard measures
commission has to regulate the fees to be exacted by the measuring
establishments, and in fact the entire technics of weights and measures.

‘* All bureaus of measures within the North German Confederation,
in addition to the local stamp, have to use the mark of the standard
measures commission which will be furnished for the purpose.

‘The standard weights and measures are to be preserved after true
and attested copies have been made of them.”

Article 22 of the law providing for the introduction of the new
weights and measures, on and after January 1, 1870, called for the
immediate formation of the conference in order to enable the bureau
of measures to have the necessary facilities and standards in time for the
testing and approving of any new weights and measures brought
before them.

As a result of the conference metrical regulations were established on
July 16, 1869; and on July 21, 1869, the business instructions and the
composition and organization of the standard measures commission
were completed.

According to the rules adopted, the standard measures commission
was to consist of the director, assisted by the regular force required
138 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

for the business affairs of the commission, and of attached members
to be called in for conference; their number is to correspond to the
demand. They are recommended for appointment of five years by the
director and confirmed by the chancellor of the Empire. Their office is
an honorary one, but members, non-residents of Berlin, are refunded
expenses incurred on occasion of official business conferences at Berlin.
All projects relating to the entire system of measures are to be consid-
ered in full session.

The business instructions provide that the director be assisted by two
experienced technicians, well versed with gauging; further, some per-
son or persons skilled in making mathematical computations or physical
examinations, a secretary, a messenger, and the required number of
clerks and copyists.

The scientific publications of the commission relate to measurements,
weighings, barometric, thermometric, and areometric examinations,
to which are added experiments on alloys, inflammability of petro-
leum, ete.

The commission employs the following apparatus: universal com-
parator, by A. Repsold Sons, at Hamburg; longitudinal comparator, by
A. Repsold Sons, at Hamburg; universal cathetometer (vertical, trans-
versal, and longitudinal comparator), by C. Bamberg, at Berlin; kilo-
gram scale, within hermetical glass bell, by P. Stiickrath, at Berlin;
scale of 100 grams by P. Stiickrath; seales of 500 milligrams, by P.
Stiickrath; standard barometer and manometer, with vertical compar-
ator; thermometers, and apparatus for the testing of air thermometers,
by Fuess.

In addition to the above the commission possesses a number of ap-
paratus and instruments, consisting of comparators, scales, barometers,
barographs, thermometers, alcoholometers, areometers, hollow meas-
ures, gas-meters, cubic apparatus, petroleum tester, crucibles and fur-
nace for alloy, measuring-scales of platinum, brass, crystal, iron, and
aluminium.

The more delicate apparatus are mounted in rooms having double
walls of zine, the intervening space of which is tested by gas for the
preservation of a constant temperature. They are lighted by Siemens’s
regenerative shallow burners, the radiation of which is prevented by
cloaks of water, while the light is carried through a hollow lens filled
with a solution of alum and is retlected by mirrors upon the scales to be
read. The instruments have been isolated by placing them upon pillars
extending in wells to a depth of 8 meters.

The Hydrographic Office of the Imperial Admiralty.—On December 18,
1853, Professor Berghaus suggested to Prince Adalbert, of Prussia, the
establishment of a hydrographic office. The. plan was accepted, but
its execution delayed on account of insufficient funds. The desirability
and necessity of such an establishment becoming more urgent, a Direc-

a
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 139

tion of Navigation was established on June 28, 1854, to form a technical
division of the naval office at Danzig. On account of insufficient force
the institute had to limit its operations to the needs of the war navy.

The Direction of Navigation at Danzig was dissolved on September
25, 1861, and in its place a ‘* Hydrographic Bureau” was established to
form a section of Division X of the Ministry of Navy. Its functions re-
mained unchanged, and in addition it was commissioned with the current
work of sea charts and with the collecting and tabulating of nautical
informations, which, between the years 1863 and 1868, were furnished to
the vessels of the war navy. In order to extend its usefulness to the
mercantile marine these informations were published, since 1869, under
the title of ‘‘ Nachrichten fiir Seefahrer,” at first as additions to the
‘¢ Preussisches Handelsblatt” and since 1870 as additions tothe“ Marine
Verordnungs- Blatt.” |

The demands on the Hydrographic Office increased with the rapid
increase of the war navy, until it became unable to do all the work
expected of it. In January, 1874, therefore, it was enlarged and
appointed a separate division of the Admiralty, with the following per-
sonnel :

One full captain (or admiral), in charge; two chiefs of division, five
section chiefs (including the chief of the Wilhelmshaven Observatory),
five assistants, one librarian, and a number of draughtsmen, engravers,
and mechanics.

For the business administration the following clerical foree was ap-
pointed: Two chiefs of bureaus, two registrars, two secretaries of chan-
celry, and the required subordinates.

The Hydrographic Office in first line serves the interests of the im
perial navy, but its advantages are extended to the mercantile navy as
far as possible.

A survey of the entire territory of the North and Baltic Seas was
begun in 1867 and completed in 1879; from 1880 to 1884 test measure-
ments were made, scientific experiments instituted along the German
coasts, and the knowledge of the physical conditions of the native seas
improved.

The Central Telegraph Bureau and the Telephone Service.—With regard
to its importance in the telegraphic intercourse the Bureau at Berlin
occupies the first place among the telegraphic stations of the Empire.
It is attached to the second division of the Imperial Post-oftice Depart
ment and serves as center of the telegraphic and pneumatic intercourse
for Berlin.

A few figures will exhibit the importance of the establishment and
afford an illustration of its operations.

The service of the Central Bureau gives employment to four hundred
and ninety-two officials and one hundred and twenty-eight subordinates.

The telegraphing business requires the application of fifty-four type
apparatus, Hughes’s construction, one hundred and seventy-eight Morse
140 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

apparatus, and fifty-one apparatus of a peculiar construction. Two
hundred and eighty-two wires center at Berlin; of these fifty-six are
underground and serve the larger circuit, thirty-seven, seventy, and
twenty-eight overhead wires are used for foreign, the larger and smaller
domestic circuits, respectively, while fifty-six underground wires accom-
modate the city trade. Within the city limits all wires, with the ex:
ception of those used in telephoning, are placed underground.

One hundred and twenty-four batteries, representing 7,350 elements,
together with eight batteries for special purposes representing 290 ele-
ments, are employed in the central office.

The Berlin service comprises 351.8 kilometers (218.6 miles) of lines,
with 2,428.5 kilometers (1,509 miles) of wire; the pneumatic service
comprises 40.5 kilometers ‘25 miles’ of lines. with 46.35 kilometers (29
miles) of tubes.

The pneumatic line commences at the Central Telegrap.a Bureau,
radiates in six principal directions, and together with the branch lines
forms connection with thirty-three pneu matie offices. Each line runs one
train every fifteen minutes in either direction, with a velocity of 1,000
meters (5281 feet) per minute. The pressure and vacuum are produced
at eight stations, each of which is provided witha double set of en-
gines of a total force of 135 horse-power. Forty-four compartments of a
total capacity of 772 cubic meters serve to hold the compressed air and
the air ejected by the tubes. Each line controls a special series of sig-
nals.

The telephone service was established in 1881. At the beginning
two central offices were established. Each of these received two switch-
boards for fifty plugs each. The great advantages of immediate personal
communication and the extraordinary simplicity of the arrangement
became so apparent that this mode of communication soon came into
general use. The increase is best illustrated by stating that from the
end of November, 1881, to June, 1886, the number of participants had
increased from 442 to 5,194, while the line had increased from 1,319
to 10,477 kilometers (819 to 6,510 miles.)

In order to enable the subscribers to communicate with their own
homes or places of business from more distant parts and also to throw
the service open to general utility, public stations were established
which could be used by any one so desirous upon the payment of a small
fee. At present there are twelve such stations.

The constant increase in the number of telephones rendered it desira-
ble to extend the telephonic service beyond the city limits. The prog-
ress made in this field of technic, especially in the construction of long-
distance microphones, rendered it practicable to establish, in November,
1882, connection between Berlin and Charlottenburg; in May, 1883, it
was extended to Berlin and Potsdam; in December 1883 connection was
made between the exchanges of Berlin and Magdeburg; in the years
1884 and 1885 with the surburban places: Westend, Képenick, Steg-
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 141

litz, Rixdorf, Gross Lichterfelde, Weissensee, Pankow, Rummelsburg,
Friedenau, and Griinau.

The greatest distance of 347 kilometers (215 miles) was accomplished
between Berlin and Hanover, and a large number is projected between
Berlin and Halle, Breslau, Leipzig, Hamburg, etc.

The total cost of construction of the telephone service in Berlin to
and including the year 188485 has been about 2,000,000 mark ($500,-
000). Large amounts are required for the support and changes of
lines and for their maintenance and operation.

Until the beginning of the year 1886 the conduct and supervision of
the telephone service was inthe hands of the Central Telegraph Bureau ;
the extent and growing demand however made it desirable to establish
the service on an independent basis with a rank of an office of the first
class. The service, at present employs two hundred and seventy-five
regular officials with a corresponding number of subordinates.

The principal supervision of the erection of buildings for the tele-
phonic service and of its administration, belongs to the Imperial Post-
Office Department at Berlin, which has established a special division
for the purpose. This is in charge of a councilor of post assisted by a
telegraph inspector and ten officials for the business affairs of the bureau.
To these, ten officials have been added who are employed in technical
affairs, that is, in the preparation of plans and execution of the necessary
building and changes in the lines and who have charge of a large number
of laborers. And all decisions in telephonic affairs are rendered by tbis
second division of the imperial post-office department.

The Telegraph Workshop, etc.—The duties of the telegraph apparatus
workshop comprise: (1) The manufacture of apparatus and parts of
such, as well as of the materials and tools required ; (2) the changes and
repairs to existing apparatus; (3) the making of contracts for the
manufacture of apparatus and their parts, tools, materials, ete.; (4) the
testing of apparatus, tools, materiais, or changes or repairs made at
private shops; (5) the examination of the bills; (6) the care and stor:
age of apparatus and their parts; (7) the transmission of apparatus
and their parts; (8) the sale of condemned material; (9) the keeping
of accounts with regard to tools, apparatus, and their parts, materials
and equipment; (10) the keeping of a list of applicants for mechanical
positions; (11) the employment of assistant mechanics appointed by
the post-office department.

The telegraph workshop is therefore divided into three branches,
viz: (a) the bureau, (b) the mechanical work shop, (c) the carpenter
shop and shipping office.

The bureau gives employment to one official of the first class, and three
of the second, while the mechanical workshop employs one official of the
first class who supervises the force, consisting of twenty mechanics.

Each mechanic has a separate and completely equipped place assigned
within the shop.
142 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

The cable examination-room serves in the first line for continued
measurements of the underground lines of Berlin, which are made once
a week; it is furthermore used for the accurate measurements and ex-
periments with new batteries, apparatus, and switches, ete. The cur-
rents of the two underground cables, Beriin and Thorn and Berlin and
Dresden, are measured by the aid of two self-registering apparatus lo-
cated in the testing-room.

The use of underground cables made it desirable to test their elec-
trical properties at regular, short intervals by measuring the resistance
of the copper wire, the isolating resistance, ete., of the insulating mate-
rial, etc. This had the effect of giving full information of the state of
the cable at all times; any mechanical injury was at once indicated, and
could be repaired without delay. These regular measurements offered
an opportunity for the instruction to a large number of officials located
throughout the Empire, thus enabling them to be of service in case of
emergency.

The Postal Museum.—The collections of the postal museum are located
on the ground floor of the monumental building of the central Post-
Office Department of the German Empire.

The Postmaster-General, soon after entering upon his duties, endeav-
ored to interest the official bureaus, private individuals, artists, scien-
tists, ete., in his ideas, and succeeded therein in such a measure that at
the beginning of the present decade already a pretty complete repre-
sentation from the beginning of communication to the present days, was
presented in the collections of the postal museum.

In the mean time, by the incorporation, in 1876, of the telegraphy
with the post, all the apparatus, models, materials, etc., collected by
the former general director of telegraphy were transferred to the older
sister establishment, and this collection being very rich and complete,
the telegraph division of the postal bureau offers to the technician and
to the physical science a rich source for earnest study, and especially
a true historical picture of the development of the telegraph.

The postal division, of course, is still more extended, for the history
of communication is as old as man himself. In the museums are rep-
resented the Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Hebrews, and other people
of antiquity; Egyptian hieroglyphs, papyrus with hieratic writing, and
Niniveh writing upon terra-cotta plates are the proofs which those
people offer. The little plates of the Greeks and Romans which were
laid before the oracle of Dodons, the skytale written upon parchment,
the well executed imitations of the rare “ tabelle duplices et trip-
lices” and the ** Diptyches,” distributed by the Roman consuls upon the
commencement of their terms of office, conclude the antiquity. The
gradual development of more regulated forms of later periods, inchud-
ing the Middie Ages, are illustrated by precious samples of writings
emanating from the contemplative quiet of the monasteries, representa-

tions of boats, wagons and teams, streets, ships, ete., etc., while the
THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN. 143

- modern cosmopolitan character of the “ post” is represented by natural
models of all peoples and countries. Everything is represented, from
the most primitive row-boat to the highly elegant steamer, from the
“dog post” to the six-horse postal carriage, railway post, pigeon post,
field post, ete. Numerous illustrations of the homes of the post in all
zones, and models of the stately buildings of modern times, complete
the panorama.

IX.—THE ROYAL LIBRARY.

The establishment of a public library dates back to the year 1661, and
is owing to the Grand Elector who ordered the collection of the frag-
ments of the monasterial libraries and had them combined with the
library of the castle, forming a collection comprising 1,618 European
and Oriental manuscripts and 20,600 printed works, representing about
90,000 volumes. Frederick I added to it the purchased Spanheim col-
lection of books, and Frederick II the library and collection of charts of
Colonel Quintus Icilius and other valuable purchases. The present
building was erected in the years 1774-1780 by order of Frederick the
Great; the books were transferred to it in 1782, and the reading-room
was opened in 1784.

According to the report of the director, in 1836, the library contained
about 200,000 printed volumes, and 4,611 manuscripts. The growth of
the library was such, that toward the end of the reign of Frederick
William III, the lower floor of the building—used for the storage of
books, had to be applied to the use of exposition. It was re-modelled
during the years 1840 to 1842, and divided into two stories. The burn-
ing in 1843, of the Royal Opera House, immediately opposite the library,
called attention to the importance of fire-proofing the building, the
provision of iron stairways, doors, etc., and of suitable water reservoirs.

The extraordinary increase of the collections—amounting at present
(1886) to 800,000 volumes, and 20,000 manuscripts, rendered it necessary
to divide the elevation of the stories byemeans of iron ceilings, and to
use a portion of the attic for the storage of books.

The budget for 188687 allowed 96,000 mark ($24,000) for the pur-
chase of books, manuscripts, journals, music, charts, and illustrations,
and for the necessary expense for the binding of books.

X.—THE ROYAL BUREAU OF ENGRAVING AND PRINTING.

In 1850, when the Finance Department had under advisement the best
method for preventing the manufacture of counterfeit money, a propo-
sition was made to have all paper money and securities made at some
central establishment. On April 30, 1851, a royal decree authorized
the establishment of a bureau for the manufacture of paper money,
bonds, and other securities, and a building was purchased for the put-
pose at a cost of 5,380 thaler ($4,135).
144 THE NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS AT BERLIN.

In 1852, the establishment commenced operations with a personnel
consisting of four officials, two messengers, and fifteen laborers. At
present nine hundred persons are employed.

On August 1, 1852, the manufacture of postage stamps, stamped en-
velopes,; newspaper wrappers, which until then had been made by pri-
vate contract, was given to the bureau together with all the necessary
machines and implements for the manufacture of the same, which had
been the property of the Post-Office Department.

At the close of the year 1860, when the Royal Lithographing Institute
became combined with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, it was
found necessary to employ copper engraving with photographie and gal-
vanoplastic processes in engraving of charts instead of lithography,
and this change again was productive of an enlargement of the office
together with a corresponding increase in machinery.

A great source of revenue and profit was offered in the enormous sup-
ply of postage stamps and cards required by the totally unexpected de-
velopment of the postal service. This kind of work had formerly been
performed by the printing office of Decker, which by decree of May 23,
1877, had been purchased by the German Government for the sum of
6,780,000 mark ($1,695,000) and had been placed under the jurisdiction
of the Postmaster-General.

By law of May 15, 1879, the Prussian Bureau of Engraving was pur-
chased by the Imperial Government for a consideration of 3,573,000
mark ($893,250) and consolidated with the printing establishment under
the name, “ Royal Bureau of Engraving and Printing.”

The amalgamation took place at once from a business point of view,
the general supervision remaining in the hands of the chief of the Ger-
man post and telegraph administration, in whose bureau a separate
division was established under the name “ Director of the Royal Bureau
of Engraving and Printing.”

In order to accommodate the increased force of the combined offices,
the adjacent buildings were purchased in May, 1879, for the sum of
517,500 mark ($129,375); the téaring down of the old buildings began
at once and in the autumn of 1881 the new building was ready for
occupation.

The bureau at present employs ninety-five artists and regular mechan-
ies, and seven hundred and seventy laborers (male and female), appren-
tices, and porters.

The work of the bureau increases from year to year although a great
deal of it, not involving money or bonds, is now turned over to private
industries.

At present the ordinary work required by the Government and bu-
reaus represents about 120,000,000 sheets, of which the Imperial Post
and Telegraph Administration uses about 13,000,000 sheets and about
60,000,000 cards, independent of the large amount of work ordered from
private firms.
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS.*

BY G. W. DE TUNZELMANN, B. SC.

H. Hertz has been engaged for some time past in a series of researches
on electrical oscillations, which have led to results of very exceptional
importance, and as these results throw considerable light on the nature
of electrical action, it will be of interest to have a connected account
of the investigations, to which I therefore propose to devote a short
series of papers.

In Hertz’s first paper on the subject, viz, *‘On Very Rapid Electrical
Oscillations” (Wiedemann’s Annalen, 1887, vol. XXxI, page 421), he
refers to a paper by Colley, ‘‘On Some New Methods for Observing
Electrical Oscillations, with Applications” (ibid., vol. XxvI, page 432),
who calls attention to the fact that Sir William Thompson in 1853,
showed the possibility of producing electrical oscillations by the dis-
charge of a charged conductor, and gives references to all the investiga-
tions in the same direction which were kuown to him.t

146 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

According to these investigations, the electrical oscillations produced
in an open circuit by means of an induction coil are measured by ten
thousandths of a second, while in the case of the oscillatory discharge
of a Leyden jar they are about a hundred times as rapid, as was shown
by Feddersen.

According to theory, still more rapid oscillations should be possible
in an open circuit of wire of good conducting material, provided its ends
are not connected with conductors of any considerable capacity ; but it
is not possible to determine from theory whether measurable oseilla-
tions are actually produced. Some observations of Hertz’s led him to
believe that under certain circumstances oscillations of this kind were
produced, and his researches show that this is so, and that the oscilla-
tions are about a hundred times as rapid as those observed by Fedder-
sen; so that their periods are measured by hundred millionths of a
second, and they therefore occupy a position intermediate between
acoustic and luminous vibrations.

Preliminary Experiments.—It is known that if in the secondary circuit
of an induction coil there be inserted, in addition to the ordinary air
space, across which sparks pass, a Riess spark micrometer, with its
poles joined by a long wire, the discharge will pass across the air space
of the micrometer in preference to following the path of least resistance
through the wire, provided this air space does not exceed a certain
limit, and it is upon this principle that lightning protectors for tele-
graph lines are constructed. It might be expected that the sparks
could he made to disappear by diminishing the length and resistance
of the connecting wire; but Hertz finds that though the length of the
sparks can be diminished in this way, it is almost impossible to get rid
of them entirely, and they can still be observed when the balls of the
microineter are connected by a thick copper wire only a few centimeters
in length.

This shows that there must be variations in the potential measure-
able in hundredths of a volt in a portion of the circuit only a few centi-
meters in length, and it also gives an indirect proof of the enormous
rapidity of the discharge, for the difference of potential between the
micrometer knobs can only be due to self-induction in the connecting
wire. Now the time occupied by variations in the potential of one of
the knobs must be of the same order as that in which these variations
can be transmitted through a short length of a good conductor to the
second knob. The resistance of the wire connecting the knobs is found
to be without sensible effect on the results.

In Fig. 1, A is an induction coil and 6 a discharge. The wire con-
necting the knobs 1 and 2 of the spark micrometer
M, consists of a rectangle, half a meter in length,
of copper wire 2 millimeters in diameter. This rect-
angle is connected with the secondary circuit of the
coil in the manner shown in the diagram; and when
the coil is in action, sparks—sometimes several
millimeters in length—are seen to pass between the
knobs 1 and 2, showing that there are violent elec-
trical oscillations, not only in the secondary circuit
itself, but in any conductor in contact with it. This
experiment shows even more clearly than the previ-
ous one that the rapidity of the oscillations is com-
parable with the velocity of transmission of electrical
disturbances through the copper wire, which, ac-
cording to all the evidence at our disposal, is nearly Fis. 1.
equal to the velocity of light.

In order to obtain micrometer sparks some millimeters in length, a
powerful induction coil is required, and the one used by Hertz was 52
centimeters in length and 20 centimeters in diameter, provided with a
mercury contact breaker, and excited by six large Bunsen cells. The
discharger terminals consisted of brass knobs 3 centimeters in diame-
ter. The experiments showed that the phenomenon depends to a very
great extent on the nature of the sparks at the discharger, the micro-
meter sparks being found to be much weaker when the discharge in
the secondary circuit took place between two points, or between a point
and a plate, than when knobs were used. The micrometer sparks were
also found to be greatly enfeebled when the secondary discharge took
place in a rarified gas, and also when the sparks in the secondary were
less than half a centimeter in length, while on the other hand, if they
exceeded 14 centimeters the sparks could no longer be observed be-
tween the micrometer knobs. The length of secondary spark which
was found to give the best results, and which was therefore employed
in the further observations, was about three-quaiters of a centimeter.

Very slight differences in the nature of the secondary sparks were
found to have great effect on those at the micrometer, and Hertz states
that after some practice he was able to determine at once from the
sound and appearance of the secondary spark whether it was of a kind
to give the most powerful effects at the micrometer. The sparks which
gave the best results were of a brilliant white color, only slightly
jagged, and accompanied by a sharp crack.

The influence of the spark is readily, shown by increasing the distance
between the discharger knobs beyond the striking distance, when the
micrometer sparks disappear entirely, although the variations of po-
tential are now greater than before. The length of the micrometer cir-
cuit has naturally an important influence on the length of the spark, as

148 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

the greater its length the greater will be the retardation of the electrical
wave in its passage through it from one knob of the micrometer to the
other.

The material, the resistance, and the diameter, of the wire of which
the micrometer circuit is formed, have very little influence on the spark.
The potential variations can not therefore be due to the resistance, and
this was to be expected, for the rate of propagation of an electrical dis-
turbance along a conductor depends mainly on its capacity. and co-effi-
cient of self-induction, and only to a very small extent on its resistance.
The length of the wire connecting the micrometer circuit with the
secondary circuit of the coil is also found to have very little influence,
provided it does not exceed a few meters in length. The electrical dis-
turbances must therefore traverse it without undergoing any appreciable
change. The position of the point of the micrometer circuit which is
joined to the secondary circuit, is on the other hand of the greatest
importance, as would be expected, for if the point is placed symmetric-
ally with respect to the two micrometer knobs the variations of poten-
tial will reach the latter in the same phase, and there will be no effect,
as is verified by observation. If the two branches ot the micrometer
circuit on each side of the point of contact of the connection with the
secondary are not symmetrical, the spark can not be made to disappear

entirely ; but a minimum effect is obtained when the point of contact is”

about half-way between the micrometer knobs. This point may be
called the null point.

Fig. 2 shows the arrangement employed, e being the null point & the
rectangular circuit, Sach is 125 centimeters long
by 80 centimeters broad. When the point of con-
tact is at a or b, sparks of from 35 to 4 millimeters
in length are observed, when it is at e no sparks
are seen, but they can be made to re-appear by
shifting the point of contact a few centimeters to
the right or left of the null point. It should be
noted that sparks only a few hundredths of a milli-
meter in length can be observed. If when the
point of contact is at e another conductor is placed
in contact with one of the micrometer knobs the
sparks re-appear,

Now the addition of this conductor can not pro-
duce any alteration in the time taken by the dis-
turbances proceeding from e to reach the knobs,
and therefore the phenomenon can not be due simply to single waves
in the directions ca and db respectively, but must be due to repeated re-
flection of the waves until a condition of stationary vibration is attained,
and the addition of the conductor to one of the knobs must diminish or
prevent the reflection of the waves from that terminal. It must be as-
sumed then, that definite oscillations are set up in the micrometer cir-

Fics: 2.

cuit just as an elastic bar is thrown into definite vibrations by blows
from a hammer, If this assumtion is correct, the condition for the dis-
appearance of the sparks at M will be that the vibration periods of the
two branches e1 and e2 shall be equal. These periods are determined
by the products of the coefficients of self-induction of these conductors
into the capacity of their terminals, and are practically independent of
their resistances.

In confirmation of this, it is found that if when the point of contact is
at e and the sparks have been made to re-appear by connecting a con-
ductor with one of the knobs, this conductor is replaced by one of
greater capacity, sparking is greatly increased. Ifa conductor of equal
capacity is connected with the other micrometer knob the sparks disap-
pear again; the effect of the first conductor can also be counteracted
by shifting the point of contact towards it, thereby diminishing the
self-induction in that branch. The conclusions were further confirmed
by the results obtained when coils of copper wire were inserted into one
or other and then into both of the branches of the micrometer circuit.

Hertz supposed that as the self-indnetion of iron wires is, for slow
alternations, from eight to ten times that of copper wires, therefore a
short iron wire would balance a long copper one; but this was not
_ found to be the case, and he concludes that, owing to the great rapidity
of the alternations, the magnetism of the iron is unable to follow them
and therefore has no effect on the self-induction.*

Induction phenomena tn open circuits.—In order to test more fully his
conclusion that the sparks obtained in the experiments described in the
previous section, were due to self-induction, Dr. Hertz placed arectangle
of copper wire with sides 10 and 20 centimeters in length, respectively,
broken by a short air space, with one of its sides parallel and close to
various portions of the secondary circuit of the coil, and of the micro-
meter circuit, with solid di-electrics interposed, to obviate the possibil-
ity of sparking across, and he found that sparking in this rectangle
invariably accompanied the discharges of the induction coil, the longest
sparks being obtained when a side of the rectangle was close to the dis-
charger.

A copper wire, i g h (Fig. 3), was next attached to the discharger,
and a side of the micrometer circuit, which was supported on an insu-
lating stand, was placed parallel to a portion of this wire, as shown in
the diagram. The ae at M were then found to be ea) feeble

uptil a conductor, C, was attached to the free end, h, of the copper wire,
when they increased to 1 or 2 milli-
meters in length. That the action of
C was not an electrostatic one was
shown by its producing no effect when
attached at g instead of ath. When
the knobs of the discharger B were
so far separated that no sparking took
place there, the sparks at M were also
found to disappear, showing that these
were due to the sudden discharges and
not to the charging current. The
sparks at the discharger which pro-
duced the most effect at the micrometer
were of the same character as those
described in my last paper. Sparks
ares b were also found to occur between the
Fra. 3 micrometer circuit and insulated con-
ductors in its vicinity. The sparks
became much shorter when conductors of larger capacity were attached
to the micrometer knobs, or when these were touched by the hand, show-
ing that the quantity of electricity in motion was too small to charge
these conductors to a similarly high potential. Joining the micrometer
knobs by a wet thread did not perceptibly diminish the strength of the
sparks. The effects in the micrometer circuit were not of sufficient
strength to produce any sensation when it was touched or the circuit
completed through the body.

In order to obtain farther confirmation of the oscillatory nature ot the
current in the circuit kih g (Fig. 3), the conductor C was again attached
to h, and the micrometer knobs drawn apart until sparks only passed
Singly. A second conductor, C’, as nearly as possible similar to C, was
then attached to k, when a stream of sparks was immediately observed,
and it continued when the knobs were drawn still further apart. This
effect could not be ascribed to a direct action of the portion of circuit
ik, for in this case the action of the portion of circuit g h would be
weakened, and it must therefore have consisted in C/ acting on the dis-
charging current of C, aresult which would be quite incomprehensible
unless the current in g h were of an oscillatory character.

Since an oscillatory motion between C and C’ is essential for the pro-
duction of powerful inductive effects, it will not be sufficient for the
spark to occur in an exceedingly short time, but the resistance must at
the same time not exceed certain limits. The inductive effects will there-
fore be excessively small if the induction coil included in the circuit
C C’ is replaced by an electrical machine alternately charging and dis-
charging itself, or if too small an induction coilis used ; oragainif the
air space between the discharger knobs is too great, as in all these cases
the motion ceases to be oscillatory.

HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 151

The reason that the discharges of a powerful induction coil gives rise
to oscillatory motion is that firstly, it charges the terminals C and C’
to a high potential; secondly, if produces a sudden spark in the inter-
vening circuit ; and thirdly, as soon as the discharge begins the resist-
ance of the air space is so much reduced as to allow of oscillatory motion
being set up. If the terminal conductors are of very large capacity, for
example, if the terminals are in connection with a battery, the current
of discharge may indefinitely reduce the resistance of the air space, but
when the terminal conductors are of small capacity this must be done —
by a separate discharge, and therefore under the conditions of the
author’s experiments, an induction coil was absolutely essential for the
production of the oscillations.

As the induced sparks in the experiment last described were several
millimeters in length, the author modified it by using the arrangement
shown in Fig. 4, and greatly increasing the distance between the micro-
meter circuit and the secondary circuit of the induction coil. The ter-
minal conductors C and C’ were 3 meters apart, and the wire between
them was of copper, 2 millimeters in diameter, with the discharger B
at its center.

Fig. 4.

The micrometer circuit consisted, as in the preceding experiments, of
a rectangle 80 centimeters broad by 120 centimeters long. With the
nearest side of the micrometer circuit at a distance of half a millimeter
from C B C’ sparks 2 millimeters in length were obtained at M, and,
though the length of the sparks decreased rapidly as the distance of
the micrometer circuit was increased, a continuous stream of sparks was
still obtained at a distance of 14 meters. The intervention of the ob-
server’s body between the micrometer circuit and the wire C B C’ pro-
duced no visible effect on the stream of sparks at M. That the effect
was really due to the rectilinear conductor C B OC’ was proved by the
fact that when one or other, or both, halves of this conductor were re-
moved the sparks at M ceased. The same effect was produced by draw-
152 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

ing the knobs of the discharger B apart until sparks ceased to pass
showing that the effect was not due to the electro-static potential differ
ence of C C’, as this would be increased by separating the discharger
knobs beyond sparking distance.

The closed micrometer circuit was then replaced by a straight copper
wire, slightly shorter than the distance C C’, placed parallel to C BC’,
and at a distance of 60 centimeters from it. This wire terminated in
knobs, 10 centimeters in diameter, attached to insulating supports, and
the spark micrometer divided it into two equal parts. Under these cir-
cumstances sparks were obtained at the micrometer as before.

With the rectilinear open micrometer circuit sparks were still observed
at the micrometer when the discharger knobs of the secondary coil cir-
cuit were separated beyond sparking distance. This was of course due
simply to electro-static induction, and shows that the oscillatory current
in C C’ was superposed upon the ordinary discharges. The electro-static
action could be got rid of by joining the micrometer knobs by means of
a damp thread. The conductivity of this thread was therefore sufficient
to afford a passage to the comparatively slow alternations of the coil
discharge, but was not sufficient to provide a passage for the immeas-
_ureably more rapid alternations of the oscillatory current. Considerable
sparking took place at the micrometer when its distance from OC B C!
was 1 or 2 meters, and faint sparks were distinguishable up to 3 meters.
At these distances it was not necessary to use the damp thread to get
rid of the electro-static action, as owing to its diminishing more rapidly
with increase of distance than the effect of the current induction, it was
no longer able to produce sparks in the micrometer, as was proved by
separating the discharger knobs beyond speaking distance, when sparks
could no longer be perceived at the micrometer.

Resonance phenomena.—In order to determine whether, as some minor
phenomena had led the author to suppose, the oscillations were of the
nature of a regular vibration, he availed himself of the principle of reso-
nance. According to this principle, an oscillatory current of definite
period would, other conditions being the same, exert a much greater in-
ductive effect upon one of equal period than upon one differing even
slightly from it.*

If then two circuits are taken, having as nearly as possible equal
vibration periods, the effect of oue upon the other will be diminished by
altering either the capacity or the co-efficient of self-induction of one of
them, as a change in either of them would alter the period of vibration
of the circuit.

This was carried out by means of an arrangement very similar to that
of Fig. 4. The conductor C C’ was replaced by a straight copper wire
2.6 meters in length and 5 millimeters in diameter, divided into two equal
parts, as before, by a discharger. The discharger knobs were attached

*See Oberbeck, Wiedemann’s Annalen, 1885, vol. XxVI, p. 245.
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 153

directly to the secondary terminals of the induction coil. Two hollow
zinc spheres, 30 centimeters in diameter, were made to slide on the wire,
one on each side of the discharger, and since, electrically speaking,
these formed the terminals of the conductor, its length could be varied
by altering their position. The micrometer cirenit was chosen of such
dimensions as to have, if the author’s hypothesis were correct, a slightly
shorter vibration period than that of CC’. It was formed of a square,
with sides 75 centimeters in length, of copper wire 2 millimeters in di-
ameter, and it was placed with its nearest side parallel to C B C’, and
at a distance of 30 centimeters from it. The sparking distance at the
micrometer was then found to be 0.9 millimeter. When the terminals
of the micrometer circuit were placed in contact with two metal spheres,
8 centimeters in diameter, supported on insulating stands, the sparking
distance could be increased up to 2.5 millimeters. When these were re-
placed by much larger spheres the sparking distance was diminished to
a small fraction of a millimeter. Similar results were obtained on con-
necting the micrometer terminals with the plates of a Kohlrausch con-
denser. When the plates were far apart the increase of capacity
increased the sparking distance, but when the plates were brought close
together the sparking distances again fell to a very small value.

The simplest method of adjusting the capacity of the micrometer cir-
cuit is to suspend to its ends two parallel wires, the distance and lengths
of which are capable of variation. By this means the author succeeded
in increasing the sparking distance up to 3 millimeters, after which it
diminished when the wires were either lengthened or shortened. The
decrease of the sparking distance on increasing the capacity was natu-
rally to be expected ; but it would be difficult to understand, except on
the principle of resonance, why a decrease of the capacity should have
the same effect.

The experiments were then varied by diminishing the capacity of the
circuit C B C’ so as to shorten its period of oscillation, and the results
contirmed those previously obtained, anda series of experiments in which
the lengths and capacities of the circuits were varied in different ways
showed conclusively that the maximum effect does not depend on the
conditions of either one of the two circuits, but on the existence of the
proper relation between them.

When the two circuits were brought very close together, and the dis-
charger knobs separated by an interval of 7 millimeters, sparks were
obtained at the micrometer, which were also 7 millimeters in length,
when the two circuits had been carefully adjusted to have the same pe-
riod. The induced electro-motive forces must in this case have attained
nearly as high a value as the inducing ones.

To show the effect of varying the co-efficient of self-induction, a series
of rectangles ab cd (Fig. 4), were taken, having a constant breadth
a b, but a length ac continually increasing from 10 centimeters up to
250 centimeters ; it was found that the maximum effect was obtained
154 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

with a length of 1.8 meters. The quantitative results of these experi-
ments are shown in Fig. 5, in which the abscisse of the curve are the
double lengths of the rectangles, and the ordinates represent the corre-
sponding maximum sparking distances. The sparking distances could
not be determined with great exactness, but the errors were not suffi-
cient to mask the general nature of the result.

In a second series of experiments the sides ac and b d were formed of
loose coils of wire which were graduaily pulled out, and the result is
shown in Fig. 6. It will be seen that the maximum sparking distance
was attained for a somewhat greater length of side, which is explained
by the fact that in the latter experiments the self-induction only was
increased by increase of length, while in the former series the capacity
was increased as well. Varying the resistance of the micrometer cir-
cuit by using copper and German silver wires of various diameters was
found to have no effect on the period of oscillation, and extremely little
on the sparking distance.

When the wire cd was surrounded by an iron tube, or when it was
replaced by an iron wire, no perceptible effect was obtained, confirm-
ing the conclusion previously arrived at that the magnetism of the iron
is unable to follow such rapid oscillations, and therefore exerts no ap-
preciable effect.

Nodes.—The vibrations inthe micrometer circuit which have been con-
sidered are the simplest ones possible, but not the only ones. While
the potential at the ends alternates between two fixed limits, that at the
central portion of the circuit retains a constant mean value. The elec-
trical vibration therefore has a node at the center, and this will be the
only nodal point. Its existence may be proved by placing a small insu-
lated sphere close to various portions of the micrometer circuit while
sparks are passing at the discharger of the coil, when it will be found
that if the sphere is placed close to the center of the circuit the spark-
ing will be very slight, increasing as the sphere is moved farther away.
The sparking cannot however be entirely got rid of, and there is a bet-
ter way of determining the existence and position of the node. After
adjusting the two circuits to unison, and drawing the micrometer termi-
nals so far apart that sparks can only be made to pass by means of
resonant action, let different parts of the circuit be touched by a con-
ductor of some capacity, when it will be found that the sparks disap-
pear, owing to interference with the resonant action, except when the
point of contact is at the center of the circuit. The author then en-
deavored to produce a vibration with two nodes, and for this purpose

he modified the apparatus previously used by adding to the micrometer
circuit a second rectangle e fg h exactly similar to the first (as shown
in Fig. 7), and joining the points of the circuit near the terminals by
wires 15 and 24, as shown in the diagram.

The whole system then formed a closed metallic circuit, the funda-
mental vibration of which would have two nodes. Since the period of
this vibration would necessarily agree closely with that of each half of
the circuit, and therefore with that of the circuit C C’, it was to be ex-
pected that the vibration would have a pair of loops at the junctions
1 and 3, and 2 and 4, and a pair of nodes at the middle points of cd
andgh. The vibrations were determined by measuring the sparking
distance between the micrometer terminals 1 and 2. It was found that—
contrary to what was expected—the addition of the second rectangle
diminished this sparking distance from about 3 millimeters to about 1
millimeter. The existence of resonant action between the circuit C C’ and
the micrometer circuit was however fully demonstrated, for any altera-
tion in the circuit e fg h, whether it consisted in increasing or in decreas-
ing its length, diminished the sparking distance. It wasalso found that
much weaker sparking took place between c d or .g h and an insulated
sphere, than between a e or b f and the same sphere, showing that the
nodes were in c d and g h, as expected. Further, when the sphere was
made to touch cd org h it had no effect on the sparking distance of 1
and 2; but when the point of contact was at any other portion of the cir-
cuit the sparking distance was diminished, showing that these nodes did
really belong to the vibration, the resonant action of which increased
this sparking distance.

The wire joining the points 2 and 4 was then removed. As the
strength of the induced oscillatory current should be zero at these points,
the removal ought not to disturb the vibrations, and this was shown
experimentally to be the case, the resonant effects and the position of
the nodes remaining unchanged. The vibration with two nodal points
was of course not the fundamental vibration of the circuit, which con.
sisted of a vibration with a node between a and e, and for which the
highest values of the potential were at the points 2 and 4.

When the spheres forming the terminals at these points were brought
close together, slight sparking was found to take place between them,
which was attributed to the excitation, though only to a small extent,
of the fundamental vibration. This explanation was confirmed in the
following manner: The sparks between 1 and 2 were broken off, leaving
only the sparks between 2 and 4, which measured the intensity of the
fundamental vibration. The period of vibration of the circuit C C’ was
then increased by drawing it out to its full length, and thereby increas-
ing its capacity, when it was observed that the sparking gradually in-
creased to a maximum, and then began to diminish again. The max-
imum value must evidently occur when the period of vibration of the
circuit CC’ is the same as that of the fundamental vibration of the
micrometer circuit, and it was shown that when the sparking distance
between 2 and 4 had its maximum value, the sparks corresponded to a
vibration with only one nodal point, for the sparks ceased when the pre-
viously existing nodes were touched by a conductor, and the only point
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES. ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. LG

where contact could take place without effect on the sparking was be-
tween aand e. These results show that it is possible to excite at will
in the same conductor either the fundamental vibration or its first over-
tone, to use the language of acoustics.

Hertz appears to consider it very doubtful whether it will be possible
to get higher overtones of electrical vibration, the difficulty of obtaining
such lying not only in the method of observation, but also in the nature
of the oscillations themselves. The intensity of these is found to vary
considerably during a series of discharges from the coil even when all
the circumstances are maintained as constant as possible, and the com-
parative feebleness of the resonant effects shows that there must be a
considerable amount of damping. There are moreover many second-
ary phenomena which seem to indicate that irregular vibrations are
superposed upon the regular ones, as would be expected in complex
systems of conductors. If therefore we wish to compare electrical os-
cillations (from a mathematical point of view) with those of acoustics,
we must seek our apalogy in the high notes intermixed with irregular
vibrations, obtained, say, by striking a wooden rod with a hammer,
rather than in the comparatively slow harmonic vibration of tuning-
forks or strings; and in the case of vibrations of the former class we

_ have to be contented, even in the study of acoustics, with little more
than indications of such phenomena as resonance and nodal points.

Referring to the conditions to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best
results, should other physicists desire to repeat the experiments, Dr.
Hertz notes a fact of very considerable interest and novelty, namely,
that the spark from the discharger should always be visible from the
micrometer, as when this was not the case, though the phenomena ob-
served were of the same character, the sparking distance was invaribly
diminished.

Theory of the experiments.—The theories of electrical oscillations
which have been developed by Sir William Thomson, von Helmholtz,
and Kirchhoff, have been shown* to hold good for the open-circuit oscil-
lations of induction apparatus, as well as for the oscillatory Leyden-jar
discharge; and although Dr. Hertz has not succeeded in obtaining defi-
nite quantitative results to compare with theory, it is of interest to
inquire whether the observed results are of the same order as those in-
dicated by theory. ;

Hertz considers, in the first place, the vibration period. Let T be the
period of a single or half vibration proper to the conductor exciting the
micrometer circuit; P its co-efficient of self-induction in absolute elec-
tro-magnetic measure expressed therefore in centimeters; C the capac-
ity of one of its terminals in electro-static measure, and therefore also
expressed in centimeters; and v the velocity of light in centimeter-
seconds.

Then, if the resistance of the conductor is small,

In the case of the resonance experiments, the capacity C was approx-
imately the radius of the sphere forming the terminal, so that C=15
centimeters. The co-efficient of self-induction was that of a wire of
length /=150 centimeters, and diameter d=4 centimeter.

According to Neumann’s formula,

p={ [% “dsds’,

which gives in the case considered

P=21(log<,— 0.75 )=1902,

As however it is not quite certain that Neumann’s formula is ap-
plicable to an open circuit, it is better to use von Helmholtz’s more
general formula, containing an undetermined constant k, according to
which

P

P=21 ( logs! 0.75 +15 )

Putting k=1 this reduces to Neumann’s formula; for k=0 it reduces
to that of Maxwell; and for k=—1 to Weber’s. The greatest difference
in the values of P obtained by giving these different values to k would
not exceed a sixth of its mean value, and therefore for the purposes of
the present approximation it is enough to assume that k is not a large
positive or negative number; for if the number 1902 does not give the
correct value of the co-efficient for the wire 150 cm. in length, it will give
the value corresponding to a conductor not differing greatly from it in
length.

Taking P=1902°™., we have 7 YCP=531™., which represents the
distance traversed by light during the oscillation, or, according to Max-
well’s theory, the length of an electro-magnetic «ther wave. The value
of T is then found to be (;o0-4¢¢000) 1.77 hundred millionths of a second,
which is of the same order as the observed results.

The ratio of damping is then considered. In order that oscillations
inay be possible the resistance of the open circuit must be less than

oy /P. For the exciting circuit used this gives 676 ohms as the
G

upper limit of resistance. If the actuai resistance r is sensibly below
rT

this limit, the ratio of damping will be e??. The amplitude will there-
fore be reduced in the ratio 1:2.71 in

oscillations. Unfortunately we have no ‘means of determining the re-
sistance of the air space traversed by the spark, but as the resistance
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 159

of a strong electric are is never less than a few ohms we shall be justi-
fied in assuming this as the minimum limit. From this it would follow
that the number of oscillations due to a single impulse must be reckoned
in tens, and not in hundreds or thousands, which is in accordance with
the character of the experimental results, and agrees with the results
observed in the case of the oscillatory Leyden-jar discharge. In the
case of closed metallic circuits, on the other hand, theory indicates that
the number of oscillations before equilibrium is attained must be reck-
oned by thousands.

Hertz compares lastly the order of the inductive actions of these
oscillations, according to theory, with that of the effects actually ob-
served. To do this it must be noted that the maximum electro-motive
force induced by the oscillation in its own circuit is approximately
equal to the maximum potential difference at its extremities ; for if
there were no damping, these quanities would be identical, since at
any moment the potential difference at the extremities and the E. M.
F. of induction would be in equilibrium. In the experiments under
consideration the potentiai difference at the extremities was such as to
give a spark 7 to 8™™. in length, which must therefore represent the
maximum inductive action excited in its own circuit by the oscillation.
Again, at any instant the induced E. M. F. in the micrometer circuit
must be to that in the exciting conductor in the same ratio as that of
the co-efficient of mutual induction p of the two circuits to the co-efti-
cient of self-induction P of the exciting circuit. The value of p for the
case considered is easily calculated from the ordinary formule, and itis
found to lie between one-ninth and one-twelfth of P. This would only
give sparks of from $ to 3™™. in length, so that according to theory
visible sparks ought in any case to be obtained; but, on the other hand,
sparks several millimeters in length, as were obtained in the experi-
ments previously described, can only be explained on the assumption
that the successive inductive actions produce an accumulative effect ;
so that theory indicates the necessity of the existence of the resonant
effects actually observed.

Dr. Hertz was at first inclined to suppose that as the micrometer cir-
cuit was only broken by the extremely short air space limited by the
maximum sparking distance under the conditions of the experiment, it
might therefore be treated as a closed circuit, and only the total indue-
tion considered. The ordinary methods of electro-dynamies give the
means of completely determining the total inductive effect of a current
element on a closed circuit, and would therefore in this case have
sufficed for the investigation of the phenomena observed. He found
however that the treatment of the micrometer circuit as a closed circuit
led to incorrect results, so that it, as well as the primary, had to be
treated as an open circuit, and therefore a knowledge of the total induc-
160 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

tion was insufficient, and it became necessary to consider the value both
of the E. M. F. induction and of the electro-static E. M. F. due to the
charged extremeties of the exciting circuit at each point of the microm-
eter circuit.

The investigations to which these considerations led are described by
Dr. Hertz ina paper ‘“ On the Action of a Rectilinear Electrical Oseil-
lation upon a Circuit in its Vicinity,” published in Wiedemann’s Annalen,
1888, vol. XXXIV, page 155.

In what follows, the exciting circuit will be spoken of as the primary,
and the micrometer circuit as the secondary. Hertz points out that the
reason that the electro-static effect can not be neglected is to be found
in the extreme rapidity with which the electro-static forces change their
sign. If the electro-static alternations in the primary were compara-
tively slow they might attain a very high intensity without giving rise
to a spark in the secondary, since the electro-static distribution on the
secondary would vary so as to remain in equilibrium with the external
E.M.F. This however is impossible, because the variations in direc-
tion follow each other too rapidly for the distribution to follow them.

In the presentinvestigations the primary circuit consisted of a straight
copper wire 5 millimeters in diameter, carrying at its extremeties hollow
zine spheres 30 centimeters in diameter. The centers of the spheres
were 1 meter apart, and at the middle of the wire was an air space three-
fourths centimeter in length. The wire was placed in a horizontal posi-
tion, and the observations were all made at points near to the horizontal
plane through it, which however did not of course affect their gen-
erality, as the same effects would necessarily be produced in any plane
through the horizontal wire. The secondary circuit consisted of a circle
of 35 centimeters, radius, of copper wire 2 millimeters in diameter, the
circle being broken by an air space capable of variation by means of a
micrometer screw.

The circular form was selected for the secondary circuit because
the former investigations had shown that the sparking distance was
not the same at all points of the secondary, even when the con-
ductor as a whole remained unchanged in position, and with a circular
circuit it was easier to bring the air space to any part thanif any other
form had been used. To attain this object the circle was made movable
about an axis passing through its center perpendicular to its plane.

The circuits of the dimensions stated were very nearly in unison, and
they were further adjusted by means of little strips of metal soldered to
the extremities, and varied in length until the maximum sparking dist-
ance was obtained.

We shall follow Dr. Hertz in first considering the subject theoretic-
ally, and then examining how far the experimental results are in accord-
ance with the theoretical conclusions. It will be assumed that the E.
M. F. at every point is a simple harmonic function of the time, but that
it does not undergo reversal in direction, and it will further beassumed
=

that the oscillations are at any given moment everywhere in the same
phase. This will certainly be the case in the immediate neighborhood
of the primary, and for the present we shall confine our attention to such
points. Lets be the distance of a point, measured along the circuit from
the air space of the secondary, and F the component E. M. F. at that
point along the circular are ds. Then F is a function of s, whieh
assumes its original value after passing once round the circle of cireum-
ference S. It may therefore be expanded in the form

F=A4B cos” G+ cece ee PBisin St

The higher terms of the series may be neglected, as the only resplt of
so doing will be that the approximate theory will give an absolute dis-
appearance of sparks where really the disappearance is not quite com-
plete, and indeed the experiments are not delicate enough to enable us
to compare their results with theory beyond a first approximation.

The force A acts in the same direction, and is of constant amount at
all points of the circle, and therefore it must be independent of the eiec-
tro-static E. M. F., as the integral of the latter round the circle is zero.
A, then, represents the total E. M. F. of induction, which is measured
by the rate of variation of the number of magnetic lines of force which
pass through the circle. If the electro-magnetic field containing the
circle is assumed to be uniform, A will therefore be proportional to the
component of the magnetic induction perpendicular to the plane of the
secondary. It will therefore vanish when the direction of the mag-
netic induction lies in the plane of the secondary. <A will consist of an
oscillation, the intensity of which is independent of the position of the
air space in the circle, and the corresponding sparking distanee will be
called a.

The term B cos 2 = will give force acting in the same direction in
the two quadrants opposed to the air space, and will excite the funda-
mental vibration. In the two quadrants adjacent to the air space it
will give a force in the opposite direction, but its effect will be Jess than
that of the former one. For the current is zero at the extremities of
the circuit, and therefore the electricity can not move so freely as near
the center. This corresponds to the fact, that if a string fastened at
each end has its central portion and ends acted on respectively by
oppositely directed forces, its motion will be that due to the force at
the centrai portion, which will excite the fundamental vibration if its
oscillations are in unison with the latter. The intensity of the vibra-
tion will be proportional to B. Let E be the total &. M. F. in the uni-

4 will vary, and therefore also the intensity of the vibration and the
sparking distance. The sparking distance corresponding to the sec-
ond term of the expansion for F can therefore be represented approxi-
mately by a formula of the form / sin 6.

Now the oscillations giving rise to sparks of lengths a and £ sin @ re-
spectively are in the same phase. The resulting oscillations will there
fore be in the same phase, and their amplitudes must be added together.
The sparking distance being approximately proportional to the maxi-
mum total amplitude, may therefore also be obtained by adding the
sparking distances due to the two oscillations respectively. The spark-
ing distance will therefore be given as a function of the position of the
air space on the secondary circuit by the expression a+ sin 6. Since
the direction of the oscillation in the air space does not come into con-
sideration we are concerned only with the absolute value of this ex-
pression, and not withit sign. The determination of the absolute values
of the quantities @ and (6 would involve elaborate theoretical investiga-
tions, and is moreover unnecessary for the explanation of the experi-
mental results.

dxperiments with the secondary circuit in a vertical plane.—W hen the
circle forming the secondary circuit was placed with its plane ver-
tical, anywhere in the neighborhood of the primary, the following re-
sults were obtained :

The sparks disappeared for two positions of the air space, separated
by 180°, namely, those in which it lay in the horizontal plane through
the primary; but in every other position sparks of greater or less length
were observed.

From this it followed that the value of @ must have been constantly
zero, and that # was zero when the air space was in the horizontal plane
through the primary.

The electro-magnetic lines of foree must therefore have been perpen-
dicular to this horizontal plane, and therefore consisted of circles with
their centers on the primary, while the electro-static lines of foree must
have been entirely in the horizontal plane, and therefore this system of
lines of foree consisted of curves lying in planes passing through the
primary. Both of these results are in agreement with theory.

When the air space was at its greatest distance from the plane the
sparking distance attained amaximum value of from 2 to 3 millimeters.
The sparks were shown to be due to the fundamental vibration, by slightly
varying the secondary, so as to throw it out of unison with the primary,
when the sparking distance was diminished, which would not have been
the case if the sparks had been due to overtones. Moreover, the sparks
disappeared when the secondary was cut at its points of intersection
with the horizontal plane through the primary, though these would be
nodal points for the first overtone.

When the air space was kept atits greatest possible distance from
the horizontal plane through the primary, and turned about a vertical
axis, the sparking distance attained two maximaat the points for which
p=, aud almost disappeared at the points for which p=90°.

The lower half of Fig. 8 shows the different positions of minimum
sparking. A A’is the primary conductor, and the lines m n represent
the projections of the secondary circuit on the horizontal plane. The
arrows perpendicular to these give the direction of the resultant lines
of force. As this did not anywhere vanish in passing from the sphere
A to the sphere A’, it could not change its sign.

The diagram brings out the two following points :

(1) The distribution of the resultant E. M. F. in the vicinity of the
rectilinear vibration is very similar to that of the electro-static E. M. F.
due to the action of its two extremities. It should be specially noted
that near the center of the primary the direction is that of the electro-
static E. M. F., showing that it is more powerful than the electro-dynamic,

as required by theory.

(2) The lines of force deviate more rapidly Asti the line A A’ than
the electro-static lines, though this is not soevident on the reduced seale
of the diagram as in the author’s original drawings on a much larger
seale.

It is due to the components of the electro-static E. M. F. parallel to
A A’ being weakened by the E. M. F. of induction, while the perpendiec-
ular components remained unaffected.
164 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

Experiments with the secondary circuit in a horizontal plane.—The re-
sults obtained when the plane of the secondary was horizontal can best
be explained by reference to the upper half of the diagram in Fig. 8.

In the position 7, with the center of the circle in the line A A’ pro-
duced, the sparks disappeared when the air space occupied either of the
b, or b’;, while two equal maxima of the sparking distance were obtained
at a, and a’;, the length of the spark in these positions being 2.5 milli-
meters. Both these results are in accordance with theory.

In position JZ the circle is cut by the electro-magnetic lines of force,
and therefore a does not vanish. It will however be small, and we
should expect that the expression a+/ sin 4 would have two unequal
maxima /+a and /—a, both for 6=90°, and having the line joining
them perpendicular to the resultant E. M. F., and between these two
maxima we should expect two points of no sparking near to the smaller
maximum. This was confirmed by the observations.

The maximum sparking distances were 3.5 millimeters at a, and 2
millimeters ata’, Now with the air space at d),—the sphere A being
positive,—the resultant E. M. F. in the opposite portion of the circle will
repel positive electricity from A, and therefore tend to make it flow
round the circle clockwise. Between the two spheres the electro-static
E. M. F. acts from A towards A’, and the opposite E. M. F. of induction
in the neighborhood of the primary acts from A’ to A, parallel to
to the former, and acting more strongly on the nearer than on the
further portion of the secondary, tends to cause a current in the
same direction as that due to the former, namely, in a clockwise direc-
tion. Thus the resultant E. M. F. is the sum of the two as required
by theory, andin the same way it is easily seen that when the air space
is at ay, the resultant E. M. F. is equal to their difference.

As the position 7/7 is gradually approached, the maximum disap-
pears, and the single maximum sparking distance a3 was found to be 4
millimeters in length, having opposite to it a point of disappearance @’3.
In this case clearly a=/, And the sparking distance is given by the
expression a (1+sin 4). The line a;,a’; is again perpendicuiar to the
resultant E. M. F.

As the circle approaches further towards the center of A A’, a will be-
come greater than /, and the expression a+/ sin @ will not vanish
for any value of 6, but will have a maximum a+/ and a minimum
a—/, and in the experiments it was found that the sparks never entirely

disappeared, but varied between a maximum and a minimum, as indi-

cated by theory.
In the position JV a maximum sparking distance of 5.5 millimeters
was observed at a, and aminimum of 1.5 millimeter at a’,
In the position V there was a maximum sparking distance of 6 millim-
eters at a; anda minimum of 2.5 millimeters at a/;. In these experi-

ments the air space should be screened off from the primary in the

latter positions as well as in the earlier ones, in which it is unavoidable,
as otherwise the results would not be comparable. ;
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 165

In passing from the position JZ7 to the position V the line aa’
rapidly turned from its position of parallelism to the primary cireuit
into a position perpendicular to it. In the latter positions the sparking
was essentially due to the inductive action, and therefore the author
was justified, in his former experiments, in assuming the effect in these
positions to be due to induction.

Even in these positions however, the sparking is not totally inde-
pendent of electro-static action, except when the air space is half way
between the maximum and minimum positions, and therefore 6 sin 6=0,

Other positions of the secondary circuit.—Dr. Hertz made numerous
observations with the secondary circuit in other positions, but in no
case were any phenomena observed which were not completely in ac-
cordance with theory. As an example of these consider the following
experiment:

The secondary was first placed in the horizontal plane in the position
V (Fig. 8), and the air space was in the position a; relatively to the
primary. The circle was then turned about a horizontal axis through
its center and parallel to the primary, so as to raise the air space above
the horizontal plane. During this rotation 6 remained equal to 909,
and the value of 6 remained nearly constant, but @ varied approxi-
mately in the same ratio as cos ¥, Y being the angle between the plane
of the circle and the horizontal, for a is proportional to the number of
magnetic lines of force passing through the circle. Let a) be the value
of ain the initial position, then in the other positions its value would
be a cos Y, and therefore the sparking distance should be given by
the expression a) cos Y + 3, in which a was known to be greater than
f. This was confirmed by observation, for it was found that as the air
space inereased its height above the horizontal plane the sparking dis-
tance diminished from 6 millimeters down to 2 millimeters, its value when
the air space was at its greatest distance above the horizontal plane.
During the rotation through the next quadrant the sparking distance
diminished almost to zero, and then increased to the smaller maximum
of 2.5 millimeters, which it attained when the circle had turned though
180°, and was therefore again horizontal. Similar results were obtained
in the opposite order, as the circle was rotated from 180° to 860°, When
the circle was kept with the air space at its maximum height above the
horizontal plane, and then raised or lowered bodily without rotation,
the sparking distance was found to diminish in the former case and to
increase in the latter, results completely in accordance with theory.

Forces at greater distances.—Experiments with the secondary at
greater distances from the primary are of great importance, as the dis-
tribution of E. M. F. in the field of an open circuit is very different ac-
cording to different theories of electro-dynamic action, and the results
166 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

may therefore serve to eliminate some of them as untenable. in mak-
ing these experiments however, an unexpected difficulty was encoun-
tered, as it was found that at distances of from 1 to 1.5 meters from the
primary the maximum and minimum, except in certain positions, be-
came indistinctly defined ; but when the distance was increased to up-
wards of 2 meters, though the sparks were then very small, the maximum
and minimum were found to be very sharply marked when the sparks
were observed in the dark. The positions of maximum and minimum
were found to occur with the circle in planes at right angles to each
other. At considerable distances the sparking diminished very slowly
as the distance was increased. Dr. Hertz was not able to determine an
upper limit to the distance at which sensible effects took place, but in
a room 14 meters by 12, sparks were distinctly observed when the pri-
mary was placed in one corner of the room, wherever the secondary
was placed. When however the primary was slightly displaced, no
effects could be observed, even when the secondary was brought con-

siderably nearer. The interposition of solid screens between the two-

circuits greatly diminished the effect.

Dr. Hertz mapped out the distribution of force throughout the room
by means of chalk lines on the floor, putting stars at the points where
the direction of the KE. M, F. became indeterminate. A portion of the dia-
gram obtained in this manner is shown on a reduced scale in Fig. 9,

with respect to which the following points are note-worthy:

1. At distances beyond 3 meters the E.M. F. is everywhere parallel
to the primary oscillation. Within this region, therefore, the electro-
Static E, M. F. is negligible in comparison with the EF. M. F. of induction.
Now all the theories of the mutual action of current elements agree in
giving an BH, M. F. of induction inversely proportional to the distance,
while the electro-static E. M. F., being due to the differential action of
the two extremities of the primary, is approximately inversely propor-
tional to the cube of the distance. Some of these theories however
are not in accordance with the experimental result that the effect dimin-
ishes much more rapidly in the direction of the primary oscillation than
iu a direction at right angles to it, induced sparks being observed at a
distance exceeding 12 meters in the latter direction, while they disap-
peared at a distance of about 4 meters in tWe former direction.

HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 167

2. For distances less than 1 meter (as already proved), the distribu-
tion of E.M. F. is practically that of the electro-static E. M. F.

3. There are two straight lines, at all points of which the direction of
the E. M. F. is determinate, namely, the line in which the primary oscil-
lation takes place, and the perpendicular to the primary through its
middle point. Along the latter the E. M. F. does not vanish at any point,
the sparking diminishes gradually as the distance is increased. ‘This
again is inconsistent with some of the theories of mutual action of cur-
rent elements, according to which it should vanish at a certain definite
distance. A very important result of the investigation is the demon-
stration of the existence of regions within which the direction of the
E. M. F. becomes indeterminate. These regions form two rings encir-
cling the primary circuit. Since the E. M. F. within them acts very
nearly equally in every direction, it must assume different directions in
succession, for of course it can not act in different directions simulta-
neously. ;

The observations therefore lead to the conciusion that within these
regions the magnitude of the EK. M. F. remains very nearly constant,
while its direction varies through ail the points of the compass at each
oscillation. Dr. Hertz states that he has been unable to explain this
result, as also the existence of overtones, by means of the simplified
theory in which the higher terms of the expansion of F are neglected,
and he considers that no theory of simple action at a distance is capa-
ble of explaining it. If however the electro-static E. M. F. and the
E.M.F. of induction are propagated through space with unequal veloc-
ities it admits of very simple explanation; for within these annular
regions the two E. M. F.’s are at right angles and of the same order of
magnitude; they will therefore in consequence of the distance trav-
ersed, differ in phase, and the direction of the resultant will turn
through all the points of the compass at each oscillation.

This phenomenon appears to him to be the first indication which has
been observed of a finite rate of propagation through space of electrical
actions, for if there is a difference in the rate of propagation of the elec-
tro-static and electro-dynamie E. M. F. one at least of them must be
finite.

At the end of the paper in which the preceding experiments are de-
scribed Dr. Hertz describes some observations which he has made on
the conditions at the primary sparking point which affect the produc-
tion of sparks in the secondary circuit. He finds that illuminating the
primary spark diminishes its power of exciting rapid oscillations, the
sparks in the secondary being observed to cease when a piece of mag-
nesium wire was burnt, or an are lamp lighted, near the primary spark-
ing point. The observed effeet on the primary sparks 1s that they are
no longer accompanied by a sharp crackling sound as before. The effect
of a second discharge is especially noteworthy, and it was found that the
secondary sparks could be made to disappear by bringing an insulated

conductor close to the opposed surfaces of the spheres forming the ter-
minals at the primary air space, even when no visible sparking took
place between the latter and the insulated conductor. The secondary
sparking could also be stopped by placing a fine point close to the pri-
mary air space, or by touching one of the opposed surfaces of the ter-
minals with a pieze of sealing wax, glass, or mica. Dr. Hertz states
that further experiments have led him to conclude that even in these
cases the effect is due to light too feeble to be perceived by the eye,
arising from a side discharge. He points out that these effects afford
another example of the effects of light on electric discharges, which
have been observed by E. Wiedemann, H. Ebert, and W. Hallwachs.

Dr. Hertz’s next paper in order of publication in Wiedemann’s Anna-
len, “On Some Induction Phenomena Arising from Electrical Actions in
Dielectrics” (Wiedemann’s Annalen, 1888, vol. XXXTYV., p. 273), contains
an account of some researches undertaken with a view of obtaining direct
experimental confirmation of the assumption involved in the most sug-
eestive theory of electrical actions, viz, that of Faraday and Maxwell,
that the well-known electro-static phenomena observed in dielectrics are
accompanied by corresponding electro-dynamic actions. The method
of observation consisted in placing a secondary conductor adjusted to
unison, as regards electrical oscillations, with the primary, as near as
possible to the former, and in such a relative position that the sparks
in the primary produced no sparking in the secondary. As the equilib-
rium could be disturbed and sparking induced in the secondary by the
approach of conductors, it formed a kind of induction balance; but the
point of special interest in connection with it was that a similar effect
was produced when the conductors were replaced by insulators, pro-
vided the latter were of comparatively large size. The observed rapidity
of the oscillations induced in the di-electrics showed that the quantities
of electricity in motion under the influence of di-electric polarization
were of the same order of magnitude as in the case of metallic conduct-
ors.

The apparatus employed is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 10, and
was supported on a light wooden framework, not Shown in the illustra-
tion. The primary conductor consisted of two brass plates, A.A’, with
sides 40 centimeters in length, jomed by a copper wire 70 centimeters
long and half a centimeter in diameter, containing an air space of three-
quarters of a centimeter, with terminals formed of potished brass spheres.
When placed in connection with a powerful induction coil, oscillations
are set up, the period of which, determined by the dimensions of the
primary, can be determined to a hundred millionth of a second. The
secondary conductor consisted of a circle, 35 centimeters in radius, of
copper wire 2 millimeters in diameter, containing an air space, tb?

length of which could be varied by means of a screw from a few hun-
dredths of a millimeter up to several millimeters. The dimensions
stated were such as to bring the two conductors into unison, and see-
ondary sparks up to six or seven millimeters in length could be ob-
tained.

Fic. 10.

The circle was movable about an axis through its center perpendicu-
lar toits plane, to enable the position of the air space to be varied.
The axis was fixed in the position mn in the plane of A and A’, and
half way between them. The center of the circie was at a distance of
12 centimeters from the nearest points of A and A’.

When / was in either of the positions a or @ lying in the plane of A A’
no sparking occurred in the secondary, while maximum sparking took
place at ) and b’ 90° from the former positions. The E. M.F. giving rise
to the secondary sparks is, aS in previous experiments, partly electro-
static and partly electro-magnetic, and the former being the greater will
determine the sign of the resultant E.M.F. The oscillations must, for
the reason previously explained, be considered as produced in the part
of the secondary most remote from the air space. Assuming the E. M. F.
and the amplitude of the resulting oscillation to be positive when / is
in the position b’, they will both be negative when / is at b.

When the circle was slightly lowered in its own plane the sparking
distance was increased at b’ and diminished at }b, and the nuil points
lay at a certain distance below a and a’. The electro-static E. M. F. is
searcely affected by such a displacement, but the integral of the EH. M. F.
of induction taken round the circle is no longer zero, and therefore gives
rise to an oscillation which will be of positive sign whatever be the po-
sition of f; for the direction of the resultant E. M. F. of induction is op-
170 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

posite to that of the electrostatic E. M. ¥. in the upper half of the circle,
and eoincides with it in the lower half where the electrostatic E. M. F. has
been assumed to be positive. Since the new oscillation so produced is
in the phase as the previously existing one, their amplitudes must be
added to give the resultant amplitude, which explains the phenomena.

Effects of the Approach of Conductors.—In making these observations
it was found necessary to remove all conductors to a considerable dis-
tance from the apparatus, in order to obtain a complete disappearance of
sparking at the points aand a’. Even the neighborhood of the observer
was sufficient to set up sparking when the air space f was in either of
these positions, and the sparks had therefore to be observed from a
distance. The conductor used for the experiments was of the form
shown at C (Fig. 10), and consisted of thin metal foil. The objects kept
in view in selecting the material and dimensions were to obtain a con-
ductor which would give a moderately large effect, and having an os-
cillation period less than that of the primary.

When the conductor C was brought near to A A’, it was found that
the sparking distance decreased at } and increased at 0’, and the null
points were displaced upwards,—that is, in the direction of @.

From the results of experiments already described it is evident that
the effect of displacing A A’ upwards would be the same, qualitatively, as
that of a current in the same direction as that in A A’ directly above it.
The effect produced by the approach of C was the reverse of this, and
could be explained by an inductive action, supposing there were a cur-
rent in C in the opposite direction to that in A A’, which is exactly
what must occur; for the electro-static E. M. F. would give rise to such
a current, and since the oscillations in C are more rapid than those
of this BE. M. F. the current must be in the same phase as the indue-
ing E. M. F. The truth of this explanation was confirmed by the
following experiments. The horizontal plates of the conductor C being
left in the same position as before, the vertical plate was removed,
and successively replaced by wires of increasing Jength and fineness,
in order to lengthen the oscillation period of C. The effect of this
was to displace the null points more and more in an upward direction,
while at the same time they became less sharply defined, a mininum
sparking taking the place of the previous absolute disappearance. The
sparking distance at the highest point had previously been much less
than at the lowest point, but after the disappearance of the null points
it began to increase. At a certain stage the sparking distance at the
two positions became equal, and then no definite minimum points
could be found, but sparking took place freely at all positions of f.
Beyond this stage the sparking distance at the lowest point diminished
and very soon two minimum points made their appearance close to it, not
clearly defined at first, but gradually becoming more distinet, and at
the same time approaching the points aa’, with which they ultimately

eoincided, when the minimum points again beeame absolute null points.
These results are in agreement with the conclusion drawn from the
former observations, for as the oscillation period of C approaches that
of A A’, the intensity of the current in the former increases, but a dif-
ference of phase arises between it and the exciting E. M.F. When the
two are in unison the current in C attains its maximum, and, asin other
cases of resonance, the difference of phase gives rise to a slightly damped
oscillation, having a period of about a quarter that of the original one,
which makes any interference between the oscillations excited in the
circle B by A A’ and C respectively impossible. These conditions clearly
correspond to the stage at which the sparking distances at b and b’ were
equal. When the oscillation period of C becomes decidedly greater
than that of A <A’, the amplitude of the oscillation in the former will
again diminish, so that the difference in phase between it and the ex-
citing E.M.F. will approach half of the original period. The current in
C will therefore always be in the same direction as that in A A’, so
that interference between the two oscillations excited in B will again
become possible, and the effect of C will then be opposite to its original
effect. When the conductor C was made to approach A A’ the sparks
in 6B became much smaller, which is explained by the fact that its ef-
fect will be to increase the oscillation period of A A’, and therefore to
throw it out of unison with B.

Liffects of the approach of dielectrics. —A very rough estimate shows
that when a di-electric of large mass is brought near to the apparatus,
the quantities of electricity set in motion by di-eleetric polarization are
at least as large as in metallic wires or thin rods. If therefore the ac-
tion of the apparatus were unaffected by the approach of such masses
it would show that in contradiction to the theories of Faraday and
Maxwell, no electro-dynamic actions are called into play by means of
di-electric polarization, or as Maxwell calls it, electric displacement.
The experiments however showed an effect similar to that which would
be produced if the di-electrie were replaced by a conductor with a very
small oscillation period. In the first experiment made, the mass of di-
electric consisted of a pile of books, 1.5 meter long, 0.5 meter broad, and
1 meter high, placed under the plates A A’. Its effect was to displace
the null points through about 10° towards the pile. A block of asphait
(D, in Fig. 10), weighing 800 kilograms, and measuring 1.4 meter in
length, 0.4 meter in breadth, and 0.6 meter in height, was then used in
place of the books, the plates being allowed to rest upon it.

The following results were then obtained :

(1) The spark at the highest point of the circle was now decidedly
stronger than that at the lowest point, which was nearer to the asphalt.

(2) The null points were displaced through about 23° downwards,
that is, in the direction of the block, and at the same time were trans-
formed into mere points of minimum sparking, a complete disappear-
ance being no longer obtainable.
172 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

(3) When the plates A A‘ rested on the asphalt block the oscillation
period of the primary was increased, as shown by the fact that the
period of B had to be slightly increased in order to obtain the max-
imum sparking distance.

(4) When the apparatus was moved gradually away from the block
its action steadily diminished without changing its character.

(5) The action of the block could be compensated by bringing the con-
ductor C over the plates A A’, while they rested on the block, the null
points being brought back to a and a’ when CO was at a height of 11
centimeters above the plates. When the upper surface of the asphalt
was 5 centimeters below the plates, compensation was obtained when C
was placed at a height of 17 centimeters above them, showing that the
action of the di-electric was of the order of magnitude which had been
anticipated.

The asphalt contained about 5 per cent. of aluminium and iron com-
pounds, 40 per cent. of calcium compounds, and 17 per cent. of quartz
sand. In order to make sure that the observed effects were not due
to the conductivity of some of these substances, a number of further
experiments were made.

In the first place the asphalt was replaced by a mass of the same
dimensions of the so-called artificial pitch prepared from coal, and ef-
fects of a similar kind were observed, but slightly weaker, the great-
est displacement of the null points amounting to 19°. Unfortunately
this pitch contains free carbon, the amount of which it is difficult to
determine, and this would have some conductivity.

The experiments were then repeated with a conductor, C, of half the
linear dimensions of the former one, and smaller blocks of various sub-
stances, on account of the great cost of obtaining large blocks of pure
materials. The substances used were asphalt, coal-pitch, paper, wood,
sandstone, sulphur, paraffine, and also a fluid di-electric, namely petro-
leum. With the smaller apparatus it was not possible to obtain quan-
titative results of the same accuracy as before, but the effects were
of an exactly similar character, and left little room for doubt of the
reality of the action of the di-electrie.

The results might possibly be supposed to be due to a change in
the distribution of the electro-static E. M. F.in the neighborhood of
the di-electric, but in the first place Dr. Hertz states that he has been
unable to explain the details of the observations on this hypothesis,
and in the second place it is disproved by the following experiment :

The smaller apparatus was placed with the line 7s on the upper near
corner of one of the large blocks, in which position the di-electric was
bounded by the plane of the plates A A’ and the perpendicular plane
through rs, both of which are equipotential surfaces, so that if the
action were electro-static no effect should be produced by the di-electrie.
It was found however to produce the same effect as in other positions.
It might also be supposed that the effects were due to a slight conduc-

tivity, but this could hardly be the case with such good insulators as
sulphur and paraffine. Suppose moreover that the conductivity of the
di-electric is sufficient to discharge the plate A in the ten-thousandth of
a second, but not much more rapidly. Then, during one oscillation,
the plates would lose only the ten-thousandth part of their charge, and
the conduction current in the substance experimented on would not ex-
ceed the ten-thousandth part of the primary current in A A’, so that the
effect would be quite insensible.

It was shown in the experiments described in the last section, that
when variable electrical forces act in the interior of di-electrics of specific
inductive capacity not equal to unity, the corresponding electric dis.
placements produce electro-dynamic effects. In a paper “On the
Velocity of Propagation of Electro-Dynamiec Actions,” in Wiedemann’s
Annalen, 1888, vol. XXXIV, p.551, Dr. Hertz shows that similar actions take
place in the air, which proves, aS was previously pointed out, that elec-
tro-dynamic action must be propagated with a finite velocity.

The method of investigation was to excite electrical oscillations in a
rectilinear conductor in the same manner as in former experiments, and
then to produce effects in a secondary conductor by exciting electrical
oscillations in it by means of those in the rectilinear conductor, and at
the same time by the primary conductor acting through the intervening
space. This distance was gradually increased, when it was found that
the phase of the vibrations at a distance from the primary lagged behind
those in its immediate neighborhood, showing that the action is propa-
gated with a finite velocity, which was found to be greater than the
velocity of propagation of electrical waves in wires in the ratio of about
45 to 28, so that the former is of the same order as the velocity of light.
Dr. Hertz was unable to obtain any evidence with respect to the veloe-
ity of propagation of electro-static actions.

The primary conductor A A’ (Fig. 11) consisted of a pair of square

wire 60 centimeters in length, at the middle point of which was an air

space, across which sparks were made to pass by means of powerful
discharges from the induction coil J. The conductor was fixed at a
height of 1.5 meter above the base-plate of the coil, with its plates ver-
tical, and the connecting wire horizontal. A straight line r s, drawn
horizontally through the air space of the primary and perpendicular to
the direction of the primary oscillation, will be called the base-line,
and a point in this situated at a distance of 45 centimeters from the air
space will be referred to as the null point.

The experiments were made in a large lecture room, with nothing
near the base-line for a distance of 12 meters from the primary con-
ductor. The room was darkened during the experiments.

The secondary conductor consisted either of a circular wire C, of 35
centimeters radius, or of a square of wire B, with sides 60 centimeters
long. The primary and secondary air spaces were both capable of ad-
justment by means of micrometer screws. Both the secondary con-
ductors were in unison with the primary, the (half) vibration period of
each being joo-te4s-o00 (1-4/hundred-millionths) of asecond, as caleulated
from the capacity and coefficient of self-induction. Itisdoubtful whether
the ordinary theory of electrical oscillations would lead to accurate results
under the conditions of these experiments; but as it gives correct
numerical results in the case of Leyden-jar discharges, it may be ex-
pected to be correct as far as the order of the results is concerned.
When the center of the secondary lies in the base-line, and its plane
coincides with the vertical plane through the base-line, no sparks are
observed in the secondary, the E. M. F. being everywhere perpendicular
to the direction of the secondary. This will be referred to as “the first
principal position” of the secondary. When the plane of the secondary
is vertical and perpendicular to the base-line, the center still lying in
the base-line, the secondary will be said to be in its “second principal
position.” Sparking then occurs in the secondary when its air space is
either above or below the horizontal plane through the base-line, but
not when it is in this plane. As the distance from the primary was in-
creased the sparking distance was observed to decrease, rapidly at first,
but ultimately very slowly. Sparks were observed throughout the
whole distance of 12 meters available for the experiments. The spark-
ing in this position is due essentially to the BH. M. F. produced in the
portion of the secondary remote from the air space. The total E. M. F.
is partly electro static and partly electro-dynamic, and the experiments
show beyond the possibility of doubt that the former is greater, and
therefore determines the direction of the total E. M. F. close to the
primary, while at greater distances it is the electro-dynamic E. M. F.
which is the greater.

The plane of the secondary was then turned into the horizontal, its
center still lying in the base-line. This may be called “ the third prin-
cipal position.” When the center of the cireular secondary conductor
was kept fixed at the null point, and the air space was made to travel
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 175

round the circle, vigorous sparking was observed in ll positions. The
sparking distance attained its maximum length of about six millimeters
when its air space was nearest to that of the primary, and its minimum
length of about three millimeters when the distance between the two
air spaces was greatest. Jf the secondary had been influenced by the
electrostatic force, sparking would only be expected when the air space
was Close to the base-line, and a cessation of sparks in the intermediate
positions. The direction of the oscillation would, moreover, be deter-
mined by the direction of the E. M. F. in the portion of the secondary
furthest from the air space. There is however superposed upon the
electro-statically-excited oscillation a second oscillation due to the FE.
M. F. of induction, which produces a considerable effect since its inte-
gral round the circle (considered as a closed circuit) does not vanish ;
and the direction of this integral E. M. F. is independent of the position
of the air space, opposing the electro-static E. M. F. in the portion of
the secondary next to A A’, and assisting it in the portion furthest from
A A’, as explained in a previous paper.

The electro-static and electro-dynamic E. M. F.s therefore act in the
same direction when the air space is turned towards the primary con-
ductors, and in opposite direction when the air space is turned away
from the primary. In the latter position it is the E. M. F. of induction
which is the more powerful, as is shown by the fact that there is no dis-
appearance of sparking in any position of the air space, for when this
is 90 degrees to the right or left of the base line it coincides with a node
with respect to the electrostatic E.M.F. In these positions the in-
ductive action in the neighborhood of the primary can be observed, in-
dependently of the electrostatic action.

Waves in Rectilinear Wires.—In order to produce in a wire by means
of the primary oscillations a series of advancing waves of the character
required for these experiments, the following arrangements were
made: Behind the plate A was placed a plate P of equal size. A
copper wire one millimeter in diameter connected P to the point m of
the base-line. From m the wire was continued in a curve about a meter
in length to the point n, situated about 30 centimeters above the air
space, and was then further continued ina straight line parallel to the
base-line for such a distance as to obviate all danger of disturbance from
reflected waves. In the present series of experiments the wire passed
through a window, and after being carried to a distance of about 60
meters was put to earth, and a special series of experiments showed
that this length was sufficient. When a wire, bent so as to forma
nearly closed circuit with a small air space, was brought near to this
straight wire, a series of fine sparks was seen to accompany the dis-
charges of the induction coil. Their intensity could be varied by vary-
ing the distance between the plates P and A. The waves in the recti-
linear wire were of the same period as that of the primary oscillations, as
was proved by their being shown to be in unison with each of the two
176 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

secondary conductors previously described. The existence of station-
ary waves showed that the waves in the rectilinear wire were of a
steady character in space as well as in time. The nodal points were
determined in the following manner: The further end of the wire was
left free, and the secondary conductor was brought near to it, in such
a position that the wire lay in its plane, and had the air space turned
towards it. As the secondary was moved along the wire, points of no
sparking were observed to recur periodically. The distance from the
point » to the first of these was measured, and the length of the wire
made equal to a multiple of this distance. The experiments were then
repeated and it was found that the nodal points occurred at approxi-
mately equal intervals along the wire.

The nodes could also be distinguished from the loops in other ways.
The secondary conductor was brought near to the wire, with its plane
perpendicular to it, and with its air space neither directed completely
towards the wire nor completely away from it, but in an intermediate
position, so as to produce E. M. F.’s perpendicular to the wire. Sparks
were then observed at the nodes, while they disappeared at the loops.
When sparks were taken from the rectilinear wire by means of an in-
sulated conductor, they were found to be stronger at the nodes than at
the loops; the difference however was small, and was indeed scarcely
distinguishable unless the position of the nodes and loops was previ-
ously known. The reason that this and other similar methods do not
give a well-defined result lies in the fact that irregular oscillations are
Superposed upon the waves considered; the regular waves however
can be picked out by means of the secondary, just as definite notes are
picked out by means of a Helmholtz resonator. If the wire is severed
at a node, no effect is produced upon the waves in the portion of wire
next to the origin; but if the severed portion of wire is left in its place,
the waves continue to be propagated through it, though with somewhat
diminished strength.

The possibility of measuring the wave-lengths leads to various appli-
cations. If the copper wire hitherto used is replaced by one of differ-
ent diameter, or by a wire of some other metal, the nodal points retain
their position unchanged. It follows from this that the velocity of prop-
agation in a wire has a definite value independent of its dimensions and
material. Even iron wires offer no exception to this, showing that the
magnetic susceptibility of iron does not play any part in the case of
such rapid motions. It would be interesting to investigate the behavior
of electrolytes in this respect. In their case we should expect a smaller
velocity of propagation, because the electrical motions are accompanied
by motions of the molecules carrying the electric charges. It was found
that no propagation of the waves took place through a tube 10 millimeters
in diameter, filled with a solution of sulphate of copper; but this may
have been due to the resistance being too high. By the measurement
of wave-lengths the relative vibration periods of different primary con-
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. u igi?

ductors can be determined, and it therefore becomes possible to com-
parein this manner the vibration periods of plates, spheres, ellipsoids, We.

In the experiments made by Dr. Hertz, nodes were very: distinctly
produced when the wire was severed at a distance of either 8 meters or
5.5 meters from the null point of the base line. In the first case the
nodes occurred at distances from the null point of —0.2 meter, 2.35
meters, 5.1 meters, and 8 meters, and in the latter case at distances of
—(.1 meter, 2.8 meters, and 5.5 meters. It appears therefore that the
(half) wave-length in a free wire cannot differ much from 2.8 meters
The fact that the wave-lengths nearest to P were somewhat smaller was
to be expected from the influence of the plates and of the curvature of
the wire. This wave-length, with a period of 1.4/ hundred-millionths of
a second, gives, 200,000 kilometers per second for the velocity of prop-
agation of electrical waves in wires. Fizeau and Gounelle (Poggen-
- dorff’s Annalen, vol. LXXX, p. 158, 1850) obtained for the velocity in
iron wires 100,000 kilometers per second, and 180,000 in copper wires.
W. Siemens (Poggendorfi’s Annalen, vol. CLVII, p. 309, 1876), by the
aid of Leyden -jar discharges, obtained a velocity of from 200,000 to
260,000 kilometers per second iniron wires. Dr. Hertz’s result is very
nearly the mean of these, from which we may conclude that the order,
at any rate, of the vibration period as calculated by him is correct.
The value obtained cannot be regarded, independently of its agreement
with experimental results otherwise obtained, as a fresh determination
of the velocity, since it rests upon a theory which is open to doubt.

Interference of the direct actions with those transmitted through the
wire.—If the square circuit B is placed at the null point in the second
principal position, with the air space at its highest point, it will be un-
affected by the waves in the wire, but the direct action when in this
position was found to produce sparks 2 millimeters in length. B was
then turned about a vertical axis into the first principal position in
which there would be no direct action of the primary oscillation, but
the waves in the wire gave rise to sparks, and by bringing P near
enough to A, a sparking distance of 2 millimeters could be obtained.
In the intermediate positions sparks were produced in both these ways,
and it would therefore be possible to get a difference of phase, such
that one should either increase or diminish the effect of the other.
Phenomena of this nature were, indeed, observed. When the plane of
B was in such a position that the normal drawn towards A A’ was
directed away from that side of the primary conductor on which P was
placed, there was more sparking than even in the principal position;
but if the normal were directed towards P the sparks disappeared, and
only re-appeared when the air space was made smaller. When the air
space was at the lowest point of 6, the other conditions remaining the

178 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

same, the sparks disappeared when the normal was turned away from
P. Further variations of the experiment gave results in accordance
with these.

It is easily seen that these phenomena were exactly what were to be
expected. To fix the ideas, suppose the air space to be at the highest
point and the normal directed towards P, as in Fig. 11. Consider what
happens at the moment that the plate A has its greatest positive charge.
The electro-static, and therefore the total E. M. F., is directed from A
towards A’. The oscillation to which this gives rise in Bis determined
by the direction of the E. M. F. in the lower portion of B. Therefore
positive electricity will flow towards A’ in the lower portion, and away
from A/ in the upper portion.

Consider next the action of the waves. As long as A is positively
charged, positive electricity will flow from the plate P. This current
is, at the moment considered, at its maximum value at the middle
point of the first half wave-length. A quarter of a wave-length further
from the origin—that is to say, in the neighborhood of the null point—
it first changes its direction. The E. M. F. of induction will here there-
fore impel positive electricity towards the origin. A current will there-
fore flow round B towards A’ in the upper portion and away from A‘
in the lower portion. The electro-static and electro-dynamic E. M. F.’s
are therefore in opposite phases and oppose each other’s action. If
the secondary circuit is rotated through 90 deg., through the first prin-
cipal position, the direct action changes its sign, but not so the action
of the waves, so that they now tend to strengthen each other. The
same reasoning holds when the air space is at the lowest point of B.

Greater lengths of wire were then included between m and n, and it
was found that the interference became gradtally less marked, until
with a length of 2.5 meters it disappeared entirely, the sparks being of
equal length whether the normal were directed towards or away from
P. When the length of wire between m and n was further increased,
the distinction between the different quadrants re-appeared, and witha
length of 4 meters the disappearance of the sparks was fairly sharp.
The disappearance however then took place (with the air space at the
highest point) when the normal was directed away from P, the opposite
direction to that in which the disappearance previously took place.
With a still further increase in the length of the wire the interference
re-appeared and returned to its original direction with a length of 6
meters. These phenomena are clearly to be explained by the retarda-
tion of the waves in the wire, and show that here again the direction of
motion in the advancing waves changes its sign at intervals of about
2.8 meters.

To obtain interference phenomena with the secondary circuit Cin
the third principal position, the rectilinear wire must be removed from
its original position, and placed in the horizontal plane through C either
on the side of the plate A or of the plate A’. Practically it is sufficient
il

HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 179

to stretch the wire loosely, and to fix it by means of an insulated clamp
on each side of C alternately. It was found that when the wire was on
the same side as the plate P the waves in it diminished the previous
sparking, and when on the opposite side the sparking was increased,
both results being unaffected by the position of the air space in the
secondary circuit. Now it has been already pointed out that at the
moment when the plate A has its maximum positive charge, and at
which therefore the primary current begins to flow from A, the cur-
rent at the first node of the rectilinear wire begins to flow away from
the origin. The two currents therefore flow around C in the same di-
rection when C lies between the rectilinear wire and A and in oppo-
site directions when the wire and A are on the same side of C. The
fact that the position of the air space is indifferent confirms the con-
clusion formerly arrived at, that the direction of oscillation is that due
to the electro-dynamic E. M. F. These interferences are also changed
in direction when the wire m n, 1 meter in length, is replaced by a wire
4 meters in length.

Dr. Hertz also succeeded in obtaining interference phenomena when
the center of the secondary circuit was not in the base-line, but these
results were of no special importance, except that they confirmed the
previous conclusions.

Interference phenomena at various distances.—Interference may be
produced with the secondary at greater distances than that of the null
point, but care must then be taken that the action of the waves in the
wire is of about the same magnitude as the direct action of the primary
circuit through the air. This can be effected by increasing the distance
between P and A.

Nowif the velocity of propagation of the electro-dynamie disturbances
through the air is infinite, the interference will change its sign at every
half-wave length in the wire—tbat is to say, at intervals of about 2.8
meters. If the velocities of propagation through the air and through
the wire are equal, the interference will be in the same direction at all
distances. Finally, if the velocity of propagation through the air is
finite, but different from the velocity in the wire, the interference will
change in sign at intervals greater than 2.8 meters.

The interferences first investigated were those which occurred when
the secondary circuit was rotated from the first into the second prin-
cipal position, the air space being at the highest point. The distance
of the secondary from the null point was increased by half-meter stages
from 0 up to 8 meters, and at each of these positions an observation
was made of the effects of directing the normal towards and away from
P respectively. The points at which no difference in the sparking was
observed in the two positions of the normal are marked 0 in the table
below. Those in which the sparking was least, showing the existence
of interference, when the normal was directed towards P are marked +,
and those in which the sparking was least when the normal was directed
180 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

away from P are marked —. The experiments were repeated with
different lengths of wire mn, varying by steps of half a meter from 1
meter up to 6 meters. The first horizontal line in the table gives the
distances in meters of the center of the secondary circuit from the null
point, while the first vertical line gives the lengths of the wire m n,
also in meters :

An inspection of this table shows, in the first place, that the changes
of sign take place at longer intervals than 2.8 meters; and in the sec-
ond place that the change of phase is more rapid in the neighborhood
of the origin than at a distance from it. As a variation in the velocity
of propagation is very unlikely, this is probably due to the fact indi-
cated by theory that the electro-static E. M. F., which is more powerful
than the electro-dynamic E. M.F.in the neighborhood of the primary oscil-
lation, has a greater velocity of propagation than the latter.

In order to obtain a definite proof of the existence of similar phenom-
ena at greater distances, Dr. Hertz continued the observations in the
case of three of the lengths m up to a distance of 12 meters, and the
result is given in the table below:

If we make the assumption that at the greater distance it is only the
E.M.¥. of induction which produces any effect, the experiments would
show that the interference of the waves excited by the E. M. F. of induc-
tion with the original waves in the wire changes its sign only at inter-
vals of about 7 meters.

In order to investigate the E.M.F. of induction close to the primary
oscillation, where the results are of special importance, Dr. Hertz made
use of the interferences which were obtained when the secondary circuit
Was in the third principal position, and the air space was rotated through

90 degrees from the base-line. The direction of the interference at the
null point, which has already been considered, was taken as negative,
the interference being considered positive when it was produced by the
passage of waves on the side of C remote from P, which makes the signs
correspond with those of the previous experiments. It must be borne
in mind that the direction of the resultant E.M.F. at the null point is
opposed to that of the E. M. F. of induction, and therefore the first table
would have begun with a negative sign if the electro-static E. M. F. could
have been eliminated. The present experiments showed that up to a
distance of 3 meters interference continued to occur, and always of the
same sign as at the null point. It was untortunately impossible to ex-
tend these observations to a greater distance than 4 meters, on account
of the feebleness of the sparks, but the results obtained were sufficient
to give distinct evidence of a finite velocity of propagation of the E, M.F.
of induction. These observations, like the former ones, were repeated
with various lengths of the wire m n in order to exhibit the variation in
phase, and the results obtained are given in the table below:

which shows that as the distance increases the phase of the interference
changes in such a manner that areversal of sign takes place at intervals
of from 7 to 8 meters. This result is further confirmed by comparing
the results of Table III with the results for greater distances given in
Table I, for in the former series, the effect of the electro-static EK. M. F. is
eliminated, owing to the special position of the secondary circuit, while
in the former it becomes insensible at the greater distances, owing to
its rapid decrease with increasing distance. We should therefore ex-
pect the results given in the first table for distances beyond 4 meters
to follow without a break the results given in Table III for distances
up to 4 meters. This was found to be the case, as is evident from in-
spection of Tables II and III.

To show this more clearly the signs of the interference of the waves,
due to the electro-dynamic E.M.F., with the waves in the wire, are col-
lected together in Table LV, the first four columns of which are taken
from Table III, and the remaining columns from Table II.

From the results given in this table, the author draws the following
conclusions :

(1) The interference does not change its sign at intervals of 2.8 meters.
The electro-dynamic actions are therefore not propagated with an infi-
nite velocity.

(2) The interference is not in the same phase at all points, therefore
the electro-dynamic actions are not propagated through air with the
same velocity as electric waves in wires.

(3) A gradual retardation of the waves in the wire has the effect of
displacing a given phase of the interference towards the origin of the
waves. The velocity of propagation through the air is therefore greater
than through a wire.

(4) The sign of the interference is reversed at intervals of 7.5 meters,
and therefore in traversing this distance an electro-dynamic wave gains
one length of the waves in the wire.

Thus, while the former travels 7.5 meters, the latter travels 7.5—2.8=
4,7 meters, and therefore the ratio of the velocities is 75: 47, which gives
for the half-wave length of the electro-dynamie action 2.8475 /47=4.5
meters. Since this distance is traversed in 1.4/ hundred millionths of a
second, the absolute velocity of propagation through the air must be
320,000 kilometers per second. This result can only be considered re-
liable as far as its order is concerned; but its true value can hardly
exceed half as much again, or be less than two-thirds of this amount.
In order to obtain a more accurate determination of the true value it
will be necessary to determine the velocity of electric waves in wires
with greater exactness.

It does not necessarily follow from the fact that in the immediate
neighborhood of the primary oscillation the interference changes its
sign after an interval of 2.8 meters that the velocity of propagation of
the electro-static action is infinite, for such a conclusion would rest upon
a Single change of sign, which might moreover be explained independ-
ently of any change of phase, by a change in the sign of the amplitude
of the resultant force at a certain distance from the primary oscillation.
Quite independently however of any knowledge of the velocity of pro-
pagation of electrostatic actions, there exist definite proofs that the
rates of propagation of electro-static and electro-dynamic E. M. F.’s are
unequal.

In the first place the total force does not vanish at any point on the
base-line. Now, near the primary, the electro-static E. M. F. is the greater,

Sete ee
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 183

while the electro-dynamic E.M.F. is the greater at greater distances.
There must therefore be some point at which they are equal, and since
they do not balance, they must take different times to reach this point.

In the seeond place, the existence of points at which the direction of
the. resultant E. M. F. becomes indetermivate does not seem capable of
explanation, except on the supposition that the electrostatic and electro-
dynamic components perpendicular to each other are in appreciably
different phases, and therefore do not compound into a rectilinear os-
cillation in a fixed direction. The fact that the two components of the
resultant are propagated with different velocities is of considerable im-
portance, in that it gives an independent proof that one of theni at any
rate must have a finite velocity of propagation.

The latest researches of Dr. Hertz on electrical oscillations of which
accounts have been published at present, are described in a paper “On
Electro-Dynamic Waves in Air, and their Reflections,” in Wiedemann’s
Annalen, 1888, vol. XxxtIv, p. 609. The author had been endeavoring
to find a more striking and direct proof of the finite velocity of propaga-
tion of electro-dynamic waves than those which he had hitherto given,
for though these are quite sufficient to establish the fact, they can only
be properly appreciated by one who has obtained a grasp of the results
of the entire series of researches.

In many of the experiments which have been described, Dr. Hertz
had noticed the appearance of sparks at points in the secondary con-
ductor, where it was clear from geometrical considerations that they
could not be due to direct action, and it was observed that this occurred
chiefly in the neighborhood of solid obstacles. It was found moreover,
that in most positions of the secondary conductor the feeble sparks pro-
duced at a great distance from the primary became considerably
stronger in the vicinity of a solid wall, but disappeared with consider-
able suddenness quite close to the wall. The most obvious explanation
of these experiments was that the waves of inductive action were re-
flected from the wall and interfered with the direct waves, especially
as it was found that the phenomena became more distinct when the
circumstances were such as to favor reflection to the greatest possible
extent. Dr. Hertz therefore determined upon a thorough investigation
of the phenomena.

The experiments were made in the Physical Lecture Theatre, which
is 15 meters in length, 14 meters in width, and 6 meters in height.
Two rows of iron columns, running parallel to the sides of the room,
would collectively act almost like a solid wall towards electro-dynamie
action, so that the available width of the room was only 8.5 meters. All
pendent gas-fittings were removed, and the room left empty, with the
exception of wooden tables and forms, which would not exert any ap-
184 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

preciable disturbing effect. The end wall, from which the waves were
to be reflected, was of solid sandstone, with two doors in it, and the
numerous gas pipes attached to it gave it, to a certain extent, the
character of a conducting surface, and this was increased by fastening
to it a sheet of zinc 4 meters high and 2 meters broad, connected by
wires to the gas-pipes and a neighboring water-pipe. Special care was
taken to provide an escape for the electricity at the upper and lower
extremities of the zine plate, where a certain accumulation of electricity
was to be expected.

The primary conductor was the same that was employed in the ex-
periments last described, and was placed at a distance of 13 meters from
the zine plate, and therefore two meters from the wall at the other end
of the room. The conducting wire was placed vertically, so that the E.
M. F.’s to be considered increased and diminished in a vertical direction.
The center of the primary conductor was 2.5 meters above the floor of
the room, which left a clear space for the observations above the tables
and benches. The point of intersection of the reflecting surface with
the perpendicular from the center of the primary conductor will be called
the point of incidence, and the experiments were limited to the neigh-
borhood of this point, as the investigation of waves striking the wall
at a considerable angle would be complicated by the differences in their
polarization. Theplaneof vibration was therefore parallel to the reflect-
ing surface, and the plane of the waves was perpendicular to it, and
passed through the point of incidence.

The secondary conductor consisted of the circle of 35 centimeters
radius, which has been already described. It was movable about an axis
through its center perpendicular to its plane, and the axis itself was
movable in a horizontal plane about a vertical axis. In most of the
experiments the secondary conductor was held in the hand by its
insulating wooden support, as this was the most convenient way of
bringing it into the various positions required. The results of these

experiments however had to be checked by observations made with
the observer at a greater distance from the secondary, as the neighbor-
hood of his body exerted a slight influence upon the phenomena. The
sparks were distinct enough to be observed at a distance of several
meters when the room was darkened, but when the room remained light
they were practically invisible even when the observer was quite close
to the secondary.

When the center of the secondary was placed in the line of incidence
and with its plane in the plane of vibration, and the air space was
turned first towards the reflecting wall and then away from it, a con-
siderable difference was generally observed in the strength of the sparks
in the two positions. At a distance of about 0.8 meter from the wall
the sparks were much stronger when the air space was directed towards
the wall, and its length could be adjusted so that while there was a
Steady stream of sparks when in this position, they disappeared entirely
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 185

when the air space was directly away from the wall. These phenomena
were reversed at a distance of 3 meters, and recurred, as in the first
case, at a distance of 5.5 meters. At a distance of 8 meters the sparks
were stronger when the air space was turned away from the wall, as at
the distance of 5 meters, but the difference was not so well marked.
When the distance was increased beyond 8 meters no further reversal
took place, owing to the increase in the direct effect of the primary
oscillation and the complicated distribution of the E. M. F. in its neigh-
borhood.

Fia. 12

The positions I, II, and IV, (Fig. 12) of the secondary circie are
those in which the sparks were strongest, the distance from the wall
being shown by the horizontal scale at the foot. When the secondary
circle was in positions V, VI, and VII, the sparks were equally
strong in both positions of the air space, and quite close to the wall the
difference between the sparking in the two positions again diminished.
Therefore the points A, B, C, D in the diagram may in a ¢ertain sense
be regarded as nodes. The distance between two of these points must
not however be taken as the wave half-length, for if all the electrical
motions changed their directions on passing through one of these points
the phenomena observed in the secondary circuit would be repeated
without variation, since the direction of oscillation in the air space is
indifferent.

The conclusion to be drawn from the experiments is that in passing
any one of these points part of the action is reversed, while another
partis not. The experimental results however warrant the assumption
that twice the distance between two of these points is equal to the half
wave-length, and when this assumption is made the phenomena can be
fully explained.

For suppose a wave of E. M. F., with oscillations in a vertical direec-
tion, to impinge upon the wall, and to be reflected with only slightly
diminished intensity, thus giving rise to stationary waves. If the wall
were a perfect conductor, a node would necessarily be formed in its sur-
face, for at the boundary and in the interior of a perfect conductor the
E. M. F. must be infinitely smail. The wall cannot however be con-
sidered as a perfect conductor, for it was not metallic throughout, and the
186 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

portion which was metallic was not of any great extent. The E. M. F.
would therefore have a finite value at its surface, and would be in the
direction of the impinging waves. The node, which in the case of perfect
conductivity would occur at the surface of the wall, would therefore
actually be situated a little behind it, as shown at A in the diagram.
If then twice the distance A B—that is to say, the distance A C—is
half the wave-length the steady waves will be as represented by the
continuous lines in Fig. 12. The £. M. F.’s acting on each side of the
circles, in the. positions I, II, Ill, and IV, will therefore at a given
moment be represented in magnitude and direction by the arrows on
each side of them in the diagram. If therefore in the neighborhood
of a node the air space is turned towards the node, the strongest E. M. F.
in the circle will act under more favorable conditions against a weaker
one under less favorable conditions. If however the air space is turned
away from the node, the stronger E. M. F. acts under less favorable con-
ditions against a weaker one under more favorable conditions. In the
latter case the resultant action must be less than in the former, which-
ever of the two E.M. F.’s has the greater effect, which explains the
change of sign of the phenomenon at each quarter wave-length.

This explanation is further confirmed by the consideration that if itis
the true one, the change of sign at the points B and D must take place
in quite a different manner from that of the point C. The E. M. F.’s,
acting on the secondary circle, in the positions V, VI, and VII, are
shown by the corresponding arrows, and itis clear that in the positions
B and D, if the air space is turned from one side to the other, the vibra-
tion will change its direction round the circle, and,therefore the spark-
ing must during the rotation vanish either once or an uneven number
of times. In the position C, however, the direction of vibration remains
unaltered, and therefore the sparks must disappear an even number of
times, or uot at all.

The experiments showed that at B and D the sparking diminished as
the air space receded from a, vanished at the highest point, and again
attained its original value at the point 6. At OC, on the other hand,
the sparking continued throughout the rotation, being a little stronger
at the highest and lowest points. If then there is any change of sign
in the position C, it must occur with very much smaller displacements
than in other positions, so that in any case there is a distinction such
as required between this and the other two cases.

Another very direct proof of the truth of Dr. Hertz’s presentation of
the nature of the waves was obtained. If the secondary circle lies in
the plane of the waves instead of in the plane of vibration, the E. M. F.
must be equal at all points of the circle, and for a given position of the
air space, the sparking must be directly proportional to its intensity.
When the experiment was made it was found, as expected, that at all
distances the sparking vanished at the highest and lowest points of the
circle, and attained a maximum value at the points in the horizontal
plane through the point of incidence.
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 187

The air space was then placed at such a point and close to the wall
and was then moved slowly away from the wall, when it was found that
while there was no sparking quite close to the metal plate, it began at
a very small distance from it, rapidly increased, reached a maximum at
the point B, and then diminished again. At C the sparking again be-
came excessively feeble, and increased as the circle was moved still
further away. The sparking continued steadily to increase after this,
as the motion of the circle was continued in the same direction, owing,
as before, to the direct action of the primary oscillation.

The curves shown by the continuous lines in Fig. 12 were obtained
from the results of these experiments, the ordinates representing the
intensity of the sparks at the distances represented by the correspond-
ing abscissie. '

The existence in the electrical waves of nodes at A and ©, and of
loops at B and _ D, is fully established by the experiments which have
been described; but in another sense the points B and D may be re-
garded as nodes, for they are the nodal points of a stationary wave of
magnetic induction which, according to theory, accompanies the elee-
trical wave and lags a quarter wave-length behind it.

This can easily be shown to follow from the experiments, for when the
secondary circle is placed in the plane of vibration with the air space
at its highest point, there will be no sparking if the FE. M. F. is uniform
throughout the space occupied by the secondary. This can only take
place if the E. M. F. varies from point to point of the circle, and if its
integal round the circle differs from zero, This integral is proportional
to the number of magnetic lines of force passing backwards and for-
wards across the circle, and the intensity of the sparks may be consid-
ered as giving a measure of the magnetic induction, which is perpen-
dicular to the plane of the cirele. Now in this position vigorous
sparking was observed close to the wall, diminishing rapidly to zero
as the point B was approached, then increasing to a maximum at C,
falling to a well-marked minimum at D, and finally inereasing continu-
ously as the secondary approached still nearer to the primary. If the
intensities of these sparks are taken as ordinates, positive and negative,
and the distances from the wall as abscissa, the curve shown by the
dotted lines in Fig. 12 is obtained, which therefore represents the mag-
netic waves.

The phenomena observed in the first series of experiments described
in this paper may therefore be regarded as due to the resultant electric
and magnetic actions. The former changes sign at A and CG, the latter
at B and D, so that at each of these points one part of the action changes
sign, while the other does not, and therefore the resultant action, which
is their product must change sign at each of these points, as was found
to be the case.

When the secondary circle was in the plane of vibration the sparking
188 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

in the vicinity of the wall was observed to be a maximum on the side
towards the wall, and a minimum at the opposite side, and as the circle
was turned from one position to the other there was found to be no
pointat which thesparks disappeared. Asthedistance from the wall was
increased, the sparks on the remote side gradually became weaker, and
vanished ata distance of 1.08 meters from the wall. When the circle was
carried further in the same direction, the sparks appeared again on the
side remote from the wall, but were always weaker than on the side next
to it; the sparking however no longer passed from a maximum to a min-
imum merely, but vanished during the rotation once in the upper and
once in the lower half of the circle. The two null points gradually re-
ceded from their original coincident positions, until at the point B
they occurred at the highest aad lowest points of the circle. As the
circle was-moved further in the same direction, the null points passed
over to the side next to the wall, and approached each other again,
until when the center was at a distance of 2.55 meters from the wall the
two null points were again coincident. B must be exactly half-way be-
tween this point and the similar point previously observed, which gives
1.72 meters as the distance of B from the wall, a result which agrees,
within a few centimeters with that obtained by direct observation.
Moving further in the direction of C, the sparking at different points of
the circle became more nearly equal, until at C it was exactly so. In
this position there was no null point, and as the distance was further
increased the phenomena recurred in the same order as before.

Dr. Hertz found that the position of C could be determined within a
few centimeters, the determinations of its distance from the wall vary-
ing from 4.10 to 4.15 meters; he gives its most probable value as 4.12
meters. The point B could not be observed with any exactness, the
direct determinations varying from 6 te 7.5 meters as its distance from
the wall. It could however be determined indirectly, for the distance
between B and C being found to be 2.4 meters, taking this as the true
value, A must have been 0.68 meter behind the surface of the wall, and
6.52 meters in front of it. The half-wave length would be 4.8 meters,
and by an indirect method it was found to be 4.5 meters, so that the
two results agree fairly well. Taking the mean of these as the true
value, and the velocity of light as the velocity of propagation, gives as
the vibration period of the apparatus 1.55/ hundred-millionths of a see-
ond, instead of 1.4/ hundred-millionths, which was the theoretically cal-
culated value.

A second series of experiments were made with a smaller apparatus,
and though the measurements could not be made with as much exact-
ness as those already described, the results showed clearly that the
position of the nodes depends only on the dimensions of the conductors
and not on the material of the wall.

Dr. Hertz states that after some practice he succeeded in obtaining
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 189

indications of reflection from each of the walls. He was also able to
obtain distinet evidence of reflection from one of the iron columns in the
room, and of the existence of electro-dynamic shadows on the side of
the column remote from the primary.

In the preceding experiments the secondary conductor was always
placed between the wall and the primary conductor ;—that is to say, in
a space in which the direct and reflected rays were travelling in oppo-
site directions, and gave rise to stationary waves by their interference.

He next placed the primary conductor between the wall and the see-
ondary, so that the latter was in a space in which the direct and re-
flected waves were traveling in the same direction. This would neces-
sarily give rise to a resultant wave, the intensity of which would depend
on the difference in phase of the two interfering waves. In order to
obtain distinct results it was necessary that the two waves should be
of approximately equal intensities, and therefore the distance of the
primary from the wall had to be small in comparison with the extent of
the latter, and also in comparison with its distance from the secondary.

To fulfill these conditions the secondary was placed at a disadvantage
of 14 meters from the reflecting wall, and therefore about 1 meter
from the opposite one, with its plane in the plane of vibration, and its
air space directed towards the nearest wall, in order to make the con-
ditions as favorable as possible for the production of sparks. The
primary was placed parallel to its former position, and at a perpendic-
ular distance of about 30 centimeters from the center of the reflecting
metallic plate. The sparks observed in the secondary were then very
feeble, and the air space was increased until they disappeared. The
primary conductor was then gradually moved away from the wall, when
isolated sparks were soon observed in the secondary, passing into a
continuous stream when the primary was between 1.5 and 2 meters from
the wall;—that is, at the point B. This might have been supposed to
be due to the decrease in the distance between the two conductors, ex-
cept that as the primary conductor was moved still further from the
wall the sparking again diminished, and disappeared when the primary
was at the point C. After passing this point the sparking continually
increased as the primary approached nearer to the secondary. These
experiments were found to be easy to repeat with smaller apparatus, and
the results obtained confirmed the former conclusion, that the position
- of the nodes depends only on the dimensions of the conductor, and not
on the material of the reflecting wall.

Dr. Hertz points out that these phenomena, which are exactly anal-
ogous to the acoustical experiment of approaching a vibrating tuning-
fork to a wall, when the sound is weakened in certain positions and
strengthened in others, and also to the optical phenomena illustrated in
Lloyds form of Fresnel’s mirror experiments; and as these are accepted as
arguments tending to prove that sound and lightare due to vibration, his

investigations give a strong support to the theory that the propagation
of electro-magnetic induction also takes place by means of waves. They
therefore afford a confirmation of the Faraday-Maxwell theory of elec-
trical action. He points out however that Maxwell’s, in common with
other electrical theories, leads to the conclusion that electricity travels
through wires with the velocity of light, a conclusion which his experi-
ments show to be untrue. He states that he intends to make this con-
tradiction between theory and experiment the subject of further inves-
tigation.
REPETITION OF HERTZ’S EXPERIMENTS,
AND DETERMINATION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE VIBRATION OF LIGHT.*
By FREDERICK T. TROUTON.

Since last October (1888), Professor Fitzgerald and I have been re-
peating some of Professor Hertz’s experiments, as occasion allowed,
and it may not be without interest at the present ‘time to give a short
account of our work.

The first experiment tried was the interference of direct electro-mag-
netic radiation with that reflected from a metallic sheet. This experi-
ment is analogous to that known in optics as “ Lloyd’s experiment.”

The radiation was produced by disturbances caused in the surround.
ing space by electrical oscillations in a conductor. It was arranged in
this wise. Two thin brass plates, about 40 centimeters square, were
suspended by silk threads at about 60 centimeters apart, so as to be in
the same plane. Each plate carried a stiff wire furnished at the end
with a brass knob. The knobs were about 5 millimeters apart, so that

on electrifying one plate a spark could easily pass to the other. This
spark, as is well known, consists not simply of a transference of half
the electricity of the first plate to the second—though this, whicii is
the final state, is all that is observable by ordinary experimental meth-
ods—but the whole charge passes across to the second plate, then re-
turns, and so on, pendulum-fashion, the moving part of the charge
becoming less each time, till finally brought to rest, the energy set free
at sparking being converted partly into heat in the wire and air break,
partly into radiation into space, or in terms of action at a distance in
inducing currents in other bodies.

The time taken by the charge to pass over to the second plate and to
return, is a definite thing for a given sized arrangement, and depends
on the connection between them. If C be the capacity of the plates,
and I the self-induction of the connection, the time of each complete
oscillation equals 27 ¥Y (CI). The time in the case of the particular ar-

rangement used is (speaking roughly) about the s>-so5-05 (one/thirty-
millionth) of a second.

If there be conductors in the neighborhood of this ‘ vibrator,” cur-
rents will as usual be induced in each on every passage of the charge
between the plates, each passage serving simply as a primary current.

Now, speaking briefly, the whole object of the experiment is to find
out if these induced currents take place simultaneously in conductors
situated at various distances from the primary current, and if not, to
determine the delay. In order to do this we must, in the first place, be
possessed of some means of even ascertaining that these currents occur,
all ordinary methods being inadequate for detecting currents lasting
only for such exceedingly short periods as these do. By devising how
to determine the existence of these currents, Hertz made the experi-
ment possible.

His method depends on the principle of resonance, previously sug-
gested by Fitzgerald, and his current-observing apparatus is simply a
conductor, generally a wire bent into an unclosed circle, which is of such
a length that if a current be induced in it by a passage of a charge
across the ‘‘ vibrator” the return current or rush back of the electricity
thus produced in the ends of the wire occurs simultaneously with the
next impulse, due to the passage back across the “ vibrator.”

In this way the current in the ‘‘ resonator” increases every time, so
that at last the end charges, which are always of opposite sign, grow
to be so great that sparks will actually occur if the ends of the wire are
broughtnear together. Thus Hertz surmounted the difficulty previously
experienced by Fitzgerald when proposing electro-magnetic interference
experiments.

The time of vibration in this circle is, as before, 27 V (C1), but on account
of difficulties in calculating these quantities themselves, the length of the
wire is most readily found by trial. To suit the “ vibrator” we used, it
was about 210 centimeters of wire No. 17. The ends of the wire were
furnished with small brass knobs, which could be adjusted as to dis-
tance between them, by a screw arrangement, the whole being mounted
on a cross of wood for convenience in varrying about.

At first sight the simplest “‘ resonator” to adopt would seem to be
two more plates arranged similarly to the “ vibrator,” but it will be seen
on consideration that it would not do, because no break for seeing the
sparking could be put between the plates, for if it were, the first in-
duced current would be too feeble to jump the break, so that the re-
enforcement stage could never begin.*

The charging of the “vibrator” was effected by connecting the ter-
minals of an induction-coil with the plates. In this way a continuous
shower of sparks could be ees in the RES UR SDS circle.

_ Homes two pairs Gees in nines ‘hes pairs aonneciedh by a a wire, could prob-
ably be got to spark between the center plates,

The circle in the interference experiment was held in the horizontal
plane containing the axis of the “ vibrator,” the ends of the circle of
wire being in such a position that a line joining the knobs was at right
angles to the “vibrator.” In this position only the magnetic part of

ee

the disturbance could affect the circle, the ‘ magnetic lines of force,”
which are concentric circles about the axis of the ‘‘ vibrator,” passing
through the “resonator” circles.

When the knobs of the circle are brought round through 90°, so as
to be parallel to the “vibrator,” the electric part of the disturbance
comes into play, the electric lines of force being, on the whole, parallel
to the axis of the “vibrator.” The electric action alone can cause a
forced vibration in the knobs, even when the connecting wire is re-
moved, if placed fairly close to the ** vibrator.”

Again, if the knobs be kept in this position, but the circle be turned
through 90°, so that its plane is vertical, only the electric part can act,
the magnetic lines of force just grazing the circle. In this way the dis-
turbance can be analyzed into its magnetic and electric constituents.

Lastly, if the knobs be in the first position, while the circle is vertical,
there will be no action.

To exhibit these alone forms an interesting set of experiments. It
also makes a very simple and beautiful experiment to take a wire
twice as long and fix it instead of the first, but with two turns instead
of one; no sparking is then found to occur. This is of course quite
opposed to all ordinary notions, double the number of turns being
always expected to give double the electro-motive force. In this way
the reality of the resonance is easily shown.

Interference experiment.—The sparking of course becomes less in-
tense as the resonator is carried away from the “ vibrator,” but by
screwing the knobs nearer together it was possible to get sparks at 6
and 7metersaway. On bringing alarge sheet of metal (3 meters square,
consisting of sheet zinc) immediately behind the “ resonator,” when in
sparking position, the sparking increased in brightness, and allowed
the knobs to be taken further apart without the sparking ceasing ; but
when the sheet was placed at about 2.5 meters further back, the spark-

194 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

ing ceased, and could not be obtained again by screwing up the knebs.
On the other hand, when the sheet was placed at double this distance
(about 5 meters), the sparking was slightly greater than without the
sheet.

Now these three observations canonly be explained by the interference
and re-enforcement of a direct action of the “vibrator” with one re-
flected from the metallic sheet, and in addition by the supposition that
the action spreads out from the vibrator at a finite velocity. Accord-
ing to this explanation, in the first position the reflected part combines
with the direct and reinforces its effects. In the second position (that
of no sparking), the reflected effect in going to the sheet and returning
has taken half the time of a complete vibration of the “ vibrator,” and
so is in the phase opposite to the incident wave, and consequently inter-
feres with it.

If it were possible to tell the direction of the current in a “ resona-
tor” at any moment, then, by employing two of them, apd placing one
just so much beyond the other that the currents induced in them were
always in opposite directions, we would obtain directly the half-way
length. Now by reflection, we virtually are put in possession of two
“resonators,” which we are enabled to place at this distance apart, al-
though unable to tell more than whether there be a current or not.

The distance from the position of interference to the sheet is a quar-
ter of the wave-length, being half the distance between these simulta-
neous positions of opposite effects.

In the third position, the reflected wave meets the effect of the next
current but one, in the “ vibrator,” after the current it itself emanated
from, and since these two currents are in the same direction, their effects
re-enforce each other in the “resonator.” This occurs at half the wave-
length from the sheet.

The first two observations alone could be explained by action at a
distance, by supposing the currents induced in the metallic sheet to
oppose the direct action in the “resonator” everywhere, and by also
supposing that in the immediate neighborhood of the sheet, the direct
action is overmastered by that from the sheet, while at 2.5 meters away
the two just neutralize each other.

On this explanation, at all distances further the direct action should
be opposed by that from the sheet, so that the fact of being increased
at 5 meters upsets this explanation. Again, behind the sheet, evidently
on this supposition, the two actions should combine so as to increase
the sparking, but instead of this the sparking was found to cease on
placing the sheet in front of the “ resonator.”

In performing these experiments, the “resonator” circle was always
placed in the position in which only the magnetic part of the disturb-
ance had effect. Hertz has also used the other positions of the resonat-
ing circle, whereby he has observed the existence of an electric dis-
turbance coincident with the magnetic one, the two together forming
the complete electro-magnetic wave. .
HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 195

Ordinary masonry walls were found to be transparent to radiation of
this wave-length (that is, of about 10 meters), and some visitors to the
opening meeting of the Dublin University Experimental Society, last
November, were much astonished by seeing the sparking of the resonating
circle out in the College Park, while the vibrator was in the laboratory.

Attempts were first made !ast December to obtain reflection from the
surface of a non-conductor, with the hope of deciding by direct experi-
ment whether the magnetic or electric disturbance was in the plane of
polarization; that is, to find out whether the ‘“ axis of the vibrator”
should be at right angles to the plane of reflection or in it, when at the
polarizing angle, for obtaining a reflected radiation. It is to be ob-
served that in these radiations the electric vibration is parallel to the
‘axis of the vibrator” while the magnetic is perpendicular to it, and
that they are consequently polarized in the same sense as light is said
to be polarized.

Two large glass doors were taken down and used for this purpose,
but without success; and until lately, when reflection from a wall was
tried, the experiment seemed unlikely to be successful.

In working with the glass plate, the resonator circle was first placed
so that the “ vibrator” had no effect on it. Then the glass plate was
carried into position for reflection, but without result, though even the
reflection from the attendants moving it was amply sufficient to be
easily detected.

To obviate a difficulty arising from the fact that the wave was diverg-
ent, we decided to try Hertz’s cylindrical parabolic mirrors, for concen-
trating the radiation. Two of these were made with sheets of zine
nailed to wooden frames, cut to the parabo)ic shape required.

In the “ focal line” (which was made 12.5 centimeters from the vertex)
of one of these, a ‘“‘ vibrator” was placed, consisting of
two brass cylinders in line, each about 12 centimeters
long and 3 centimeters in diameter, rounded at the spark-
ing ends.

In order that the *‘ resonator” wire may lie in the ‘ focal
line” of the receiving mirror, it has to be straight; this
necessitates having two of them. They each consist of
a thick wire 50 centimeters long, lying in the * focal line,”
and of a thin wire, 15 centimeters long, attached to one
end at right angles, and which passes out to the back of
the mirror through a hole in the zinc, where the sparking
can be viewed, without obstructing the radiation in front.
The total length of each ‘‘ resonator ” is about two wave- O
lengths, the wave-length being about 33 centimeters, so
that it may be that there are two vibrating segments in
each of these ‘ resonators.”

With this apparatus it is possible to deal with definite
angles of incidence. No effect was obtained with glass plates using

these mirrors, whether the “‘ vibrator” was perpendicular to the plane
of reflection or in it. But with a wall 3 feet thick reflection was ob-
tained, when the “vibrator” was perpendicular to the plane of reflec-
tion; but none, at least at the polarizing angle,* when turned through
90° so as to be in it.

This decides the point in question, the magnetic disturbance being
found to be in the plane of polarization, the electric at right angles.
Why the glass did not reflect was probably due to its thinness, the re-
flection from the front interfering with that from the back, this latter
losing half a wave-length in reflection at a surface between a dense and
a rare medium; and, as Mr. Joly pointed out, is in that case like the
black spot in Newton’s rings, or more exactly so, the black seen in very
thin soap-bubbles.

Fig. 4.

Hertz has pointed ont several important things to be guarded
against in making these experiments. Ultra-violet light, for exam-
ple, falling on the “vibrator,” prevents it working properly, the spark-
ing in the resonator ceasing or becoming poor. Also the knobs of the
‘‘ vibrator” must be cleaned of burnt metal, and polished every quarter
of an hour at least, to prevent a like result.

Both these effects probably arise, as suggested by Mr. Fitzgerald,
from a sort of initial brush discharging (either ultra-violet light or
points being capable of doing this), which prevents the discharging im-
pulse being sufficiently sudden to start the oscillation in the ‘ vibra-
tor.” For to start a vibration, the time of impulse must be short com-
pared with the time of oscillation. These precautions therefore become
especially needful when working with small-sized “ vibrators.” Possibly
charging the “vibrator” very suddenly, after the manner of one of
Dr. Lodge’s anti-lightning-rod experiments, would save the irksome
necessity of repeatedly cleaning the knobs of the “ vibrator.”

Several important problems seem to be quite within reach of solution
by means of these Hertziau waves, such for instance as dispérsion.
Thus it could be tried whether placing between the reflector and the
“resonator” conducting bodies of nearly the same period of vibration
as the waves used would necessitate the position of the ‘ resonator”

* Slight reflection was obtained at an incidence of 70°.

being changed so as to retain complete interference. Or again,
whether interspersing throughout the mass of a large Hertzian piteh-
prism, conductors with nearly the same period would alter the angle
of refraction. In some such way as this, anomalous dispersion, with
its particular case of ordinary dispersion, may yet be successfully
imitated.

The determining the rate of propagation through a large tile, or sheet
of sandstone, could be easily made by means of the interference experi-
ment, by placing it between the screen and the “resonator.”

EXPERIMENTS ON ELECTRO-MAGNETIC RADIATION,
INCLUDING SOME OF THE PHASE OF SECONDARY WAVES.*

1n continuation of some experiments which were described in Nature,
vol. XXXIXx, p. 391 (‘ Repetition of Hertz’s Experiments and Determina-
tion of the Direction of the Vibration of Light”), attempts were made to
obtain periodic reflection of electric radiation from plates of different
thicknesses, analogous to Newton’s rings, with the view of further
identifying these radiations with “light.”

It was there described how a sheet of window-glass refused to reflect
the Hertzian waves, but how a masonry wall reflected them readily.
The non-reflection from the thin sheet is due to the interference of the
reflected waves from each side which takes place owing to a change of
phase of half a period on reflection at the second surface, as in the black
spot of Newton’s rings.

By making the reflection plate such a thickness that the reflection
from the back has to travel half a wave-length farther than that from
the front, the two reflections ought to be in accordance, for they differ
by a whole period, half arising from difference in path, and half from
change of phase on reflection; but if the difference in paths were made
a whole wave-length by doubling the thickness of the plate, there ought
again to be interference, and so on.

The first plan tried with this end in view, was to fill a large wooden
tank to different depths with water or other liquids. On gradually fill-
ing the tank reflection should be obtained, and at a certain depth equal
to4 (A seer) + pw, reach a maximum; further addition of the liquid
then should diminish the reflection, and at double the above depth the
reflection should reach a minimum, the two waves interfering.

The mirrors for concentrating the radiation had for this purpose to

’ be suspended over the tank as shown in the figure. The tank was first
tried empty, but unfortunately the wooden bottom was found to reflect,

° 4 a

thus it was useless for the purpose intended. I then tried what ought
to have been tried before constructing the tank, namely—whether or-
dinary boards, such as flooring, reflected. The floor was found to
reflect readily. This was attributed to moisture in the wood causing it
to conduct, specially as wood was found not to polarize by reflection.
Experiments were then undertaken to determine if water reflected, even
though in thin sheets. <A large glass window was placed beneath the
mirrors and flooded with water; this was found to reflect well, both
when the mirrors were in the position shown and when rotated to the
position “at right angles.” Thus water also acts like a metal, reflect-
ing the radiation however polarized. The glass had to be hardly more
than damp to get some reflection.

The wooden tank being unsuitable, a glass tank was thought of, but
was given up for solid. paraffine, which, being in slabs, could be easily
built up into a vertical wall of any desired thickness. Through the
kindness of Mr. Rathborne a large quantity of this was lent for the pur-
pose.

A thin sheet of paraffine about 2 centimeters thick was found not to
reflect, as was expected. Next a wall 13 centimeters thick (180 centi-
meters long, 120 centimeters high) was tried, and found to reflect, this
being the thickness required in order to add another half period to the
retardation of the wave reflected from the back at an incident angle of
55°, the wave-length being taken as 66 centimeters, and the index of
refraction being taken as 1.51, the square root of 2.29, the value taken
as the specific inductive capacity of paraffine.

Then a wall twice the thickness was tried, but it also reflected, con-
trary to expectation. While in doubt as to the cause of this, it was de-
cided to make a determination by direct experiment of the index of re-
fraction of paraffine for these waves, by a method suggested in Nature
(vol. XXXIX, p. 393), which consists in interposing a sheet or wall of par-
affine between the resonator and the metallic reflection in the Hertzian
experiment of loops and nodes which are formed by the interference of
the reflected wave with the direct radiation; the ratio of the velocity
in the wall to that in the air being easily found from the observed shift-
ing of the loops and nodes towards the screen.

HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES. 199

In this way the index of refraction for the radiation of the period em-
ployed was found to be about 1.8, so that the paraftine walls which had
been used were too thick, the proper thickness being about 10 and 20
centimeters—exactly so for an incident angle of 51°.) On making this
alteration I fancied I could detect a slight difference between the re-
flections from the thick and thinner walls; still the difference was
not sufficient to be at all satisfactory. The nature of the observing
apparatus makes it almost impossible to say if the reflection on one oc-
casion is more intense or less so than on another so long as sparks can
be obtained. This is due to the sparking-point in the receiving appa-
ratus continually requiring re-adjustment when working with small
sparks, as the distance between them changes either from shaking or
from the points getting burnt up.* Dust, and moisture from the ob-
server’s breath, are also troublesome. Thus it might be quite possible
that the points had always to be much closer with the 20-centimeter
wall than with the 10-centimeter wall in order to get sparks, and yet
the difference escape detection; the thing observed being whether
sparks can be obtained or not, theeye being incapable of comparing with
any degree of accuracy the intensity of light on one occasion with that
on another.

However, if it had been possible to suddenly change the wall, while
viewing the sparking, from being 10 to 20 centimeters, it would have
been easy to detect any difference which might have existed, but un-
fortunately it took some little time to alter the wall.

In order to obviate this difficulty the following device was resorted
to with the object of showing that there was a difference in the be-
havior of the wall when 10 centimeters thick to its behavior when 20
centimeters thick. (For at the time I did not see that the experiment
was inconclusive, the effects observed being the same whether the back
reflected at all or not.) A small sheet of zine was placed at the back
of the wall, and the effect on the sparking observed while an attend-
ant suddenly removed or again replaced the zine. It was supposed
that when the wall was 20 centimeters thick, and there was sparking,
that on suddenly placing the zine on the back the sparking would in-
crease, owing to the phase of the reflection from the back being half
a period different from that of the reflection from the zine; but when
the wall was 10 centimeters thick that the presence of the zine would
diminish the sparking.

It was with no little surprise that the reverse was observed. That
is to say, placing a sheet of zinc about 30 centimeters square on the
back of the wall actually aided the reflection from the back so as to
diminish the sparking with the 20-centimeter wall, but increasing it
with the 10-centimeter wall. This observation made it look as if it
must be on the first reflection from the paraffine (that is to say, on

ing.

passing from a rare to adense medium) that the “ change of phase”
occurs, and not at the back (at a reflection from a dense to a rare med-
ium), as is ordinarily supposed. For Hertz’s experiment of loops and
nodes showed that there was no change of phase on metallic reflection,
that is, of the magnetic displacement; there is a change of phase of the
electric displacement. It is important to bear in mind that the electric
loop and the magnetic node occurred at the same place, and of course
so too the electric node and the magnetic loop.

In order to investigate this, attempts were made to obtain Hertz’s
loops and nodes off a paraffine wall as reflector, but no reflection could
be discovered, the intensity of the vertically reflected rays being !n-
sufficient. However, by inclining the incident radiation to an angle of
57°, the intensity of the reflection was found to be amply sufficient.

Fia. 6.

With a ecireular resonator, which is for these waves about 10 centime-
tres in diameter, sparks were obtained close to the retleetor, the circle
being held at right angles to the wall so as to be equally inclined to
both direct and reflected radiation, and this was confirmed by a straight
resonator giving none there. At 30 centimeters from the wall* there
was interference with the circle, and vigorous sparking with the
straight resonator. This being about the right distance for the loop to
be from the reflector at an incident angle of 57°, :

SA =14 I = psec ui + cos 22) = 2p cos 2.

Thus there is no doubt that it is on the second reflection that the
change of phase occurs.

Here then was a difficulty; the small sheet of zine at the back of
the paraffin undoubtedly reflected with a change of phase, while, ac-
cording to the Hertzian experiment, metallic reflection is unaccompa-
nied by change of phase. On mentioning this to Professor Fitzgerald, he
pointed out to me its complete agreement with wave theory. For by
considering the secondary waves produced by dividing up a primary
wave with reference to any point into half-period zones, it can be

from the central circle, and in consequence is half a period behind the
phase which would be at the point if an infinitesimal portion of the
center alone acted. For the effect of each ring can be considered as
destroyed by half the effect of its two neighbors, and thus half the

effect of the central circle is left uncompensated. But the distance of
the edge of this circle is half a wave-length farther from the point
than its center is, so that the resultant phase at the point will be be-
hind that due to the center, but in front of that due to the edge, which
effect would be half a period behind that arising from the center.
Taking the mean between them, the resultant phase then at the point
is a quarter of a period* behind what it would be if the center alone
acted. Thus it was that the reflection from the small sheet of zine
differed from what I had expected it to be.

Experiment showing phase of secondary waves.—To experimentally
test this, the small sheet of zine was used as reflector in the Hertzian
experiment of loops and nodes. Employing the circular resonator, the
position of interference was found to have shifted out from 17 to over
24 centimeters, which nearly corresponds to an acceleration of phase
of a quarter of a period, the wave going in all nearly a quarter of a
wave-length farther, and nevertheless being still only half a period
behind the phase on starting. The farthest out the loop could be is
25.5 centimeters: to obtain this would require an indefinitely small re-
flector. Of course, when the resonator was close in to the sheet, no
change of phase was found to occur, the sheet being then practically
infinite.

Another interesting observation was made. <A long sheet of zinc,
30 centimeters wide, was found to act similarly to the sheet 30°
centimeters square, provided it was placed with its breadth parallel to
the electric displacement. When thus placed at 24 centimeters from
the circular “ resonator,” there was interference, but on rotating the
reflector so as its length was parallel to the electric displacement,
sparking occurred, and now the “resonator” had to be brought back
to 17 centimeters in order to again obtain interference. This experi-

* That it aided the back rather than the front was probably due to their phase not
being an exact period or half period different from each other.
202 HERTZ’S RESEARCHES ON ELECTRICAL WAVES.

ment is interesting in connection with the electro-magnetic way of
looking at the acceleration of phase as being due to the accumulations
of electricity on the edges of the reflector, which is the same as the
reason why it is necessary to use long cylindrical mirrors, as was pointed
out by Professor Hertz in a letter last February to Professor Fitz-
gerald. This experiment is really the same as Stokes’s experimentum
crucis, aS Professor Fitzgerald points out.

If instead of using the whole primary wave in the former experiment,
it be passed through a screen with a hole in it (either square or a
long slit at right angles to the electric displacement), the position of
interference, as might be anticipated, was not shifted out as much as
before.- In the rough experiment made, it was found to occur at about
19 centimeters from the screen.

It was now thought well to repeat the determination of the index of
refraction with a larger wall and metallic reflector than had been used
before, as this change of phase might have affected the former re-
sults. But it was found that it had not done so to a sensible extent.
However, the result of these new experiments was finally to give for
paraffin, « = 1.75, and at the same time it was found that the wave-
length given by the “ vibrator” was 68 and not 66 centimeters, as had
been assumed.

Two new knobs for the “ vibrator” had been made, and the fact had
been overlooked that they were slightly larger than the old ones, which
gave a wave-length of 66 centimeters. These new knobs were electro-
plated with gold, and were a great saving of trouble, as they could be
cleaned by merely rubbing with paper; apparently, the gold carried
across by the sparking (in the form of a black powder) coming off,—*
but some may have re-burnished on. It was a curious thing that if the
knobs were left uncleaned over night, the next morning it was very
hard to get the black offi—some molecular change probably occur
ring.

If the value of . thus found be not in some way due to the paraffin
being in separate blocks, it would show a remarkable anomalous dis-
persion for paraffin near these curiously slow vibrations, and as sug-
gested by Professor Fitzgerald, may be connected with the vibration
periods of atoms in the molecule, as it can hardly be connected with the
vibrations in the atoms themselves. It might be interesting to inves-
tigate whether these slow vibrations could cause dissociation, and thus
lead to a photographic method of observing them. It may also be
allied with ordinary electrolysis by very long period currents, as is
also suggested by Professor Fitzgerald.

Assuming po =1.75,* and A4=68 centimeters, the thicknesses of the
walls in the ‘‘ Newton’s ring” experiment, as above described, were wrong.
However, it was found more convenient to alter the angle of incidence to

“This value agrees with polarization experiments. No reflection was obtained at
its corresponding angle, while at tan-! 1.51 some sparks were occasionally seen.

suit the walls than to change the thickness of the walls. Thus, the
mirrors were put at 25°, which is the proper angle with the above data
for 10 centimeter and 20 centimeter walls. On now repeating the ex-
periment, better results were obtained than I should have anticipated.
When the wall was 10 centimeters thick, continuous sparking was
easily obtained, but when 20 centimeters thick, it was only after much
adjustment and patience that perhaps one slight spark could be ob-
tained. This was quite sufficient, considering the nature of the wall, for
it was only built up of plates, which afforded internal reflections, weak-
ening the transmitted rays, and also since it requires the sum of the
effect arising from the multiple reflections back and forward inside the
wall to completely interfere with the front, and some of these are lost
at the edge of the beam.

PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

By GEORGE E. CURTIS.

I.—INSTITUTIONS; INTERNATIONAL POLAR WORK; NECROLOGY.

U. 8. Signal Office—The work of the year has been prosecuted with
no important change in the personnel of the office.

Professor Abbe has completed a report entitled ‘‘ Preparatory Studies
for Deductive Methods in Storm and Weather Predictions” which ap-
pears as appendix 15, annual report for 1889.

A limited number of lithographic copies of that portion ot the bibli-
ography of meteorology covering temperature and moisture have been
issued under the editorship of Mr. O. L. Fassig, librarian and biblio-
grapher.

New life has been infused into the river and flood service by Pro-
fessor Russell, to whom the work has been intrusted, and it is now for
the first time being conducted from the stand-point of scientific hydrol-
ogy. The inter-relation of rainfall, evaporation, and discharge has
been investigated, and the results, which are of as great value as the
data now at hand admit, are published in appendix No. 14 of the an-
nual report.

The instrument division, under the direction of Professor Marvin, has
not only raised the standard of the instrumental work of the service
by greater perfection in the details of operation, but has accomplished
much valuable work, both theoretical and practical, in the perfecting
of new instruments, and in the development of improved methods for
the reduction and treatment of instrumental records.

Capt. H. H. C. Dunwoody has been in the charge of the weekly weather
crop bulletin, and of the work co-operative with the State weather ser-
vices, of which latter the field of operation and usefulness have been
largely extended during the past few years.

A valuable compilation of the rainfall statistics of the Pacifie slope
has been made, largely by Lieut. W. A. Glassford, and is published as
a Congressional document. (1888).

The weather forecasts during the year have apparently not increased
in accuracy.

Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory.—The observations for 1887 and
1888 have been published in extenso in quarto form as parts I and II,
vol. xx, of the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard

College. The director, Mr. A. L. Rotch, by his own private munificence
in the establishment and equipment of this observatory, has made it a
model of its kind, comparable with the best observatories of foreign
meteorological institutions. The personal inspection of European ob-
servatories made by Mr. Rotch has enabled him to incorporate their
best features in his own methods and equipment, and in the form of
publication of results. The staff of the observatory has remained un-
changed, with Mr. H. Helm Clayton as observer, and Mr. Fergusson as
assistant. ,

The present volumes contain, besides the more usual observations
and their summaries, hourly precipitation; hourly wind azimuths and
movements; number of hours of prevalence of each wind direction ;
days of visibility of western mountains; hourly sunshine; hourly cloud
observations from 8 A. M. to11 P.™M.; appendices in the volume for 1887,
containing comparisons of thermometer shelters; investigations of nor-
mal and abnormal temperature differences between the base and sum-
mit; and meteorograms illustrating special phenomena. Of the ob-
servations above enumerated, the hourly cloud observations deserve
special mention because of the indefatigable industry and enthusiasm
necessary to their prosecution, and because of the interesting and im-
portant results that promise to be developed from their discussion.

Indian meteorological service.—The Report on the Administration of
the Meteorological Department of the Government of India in 1887~88
describes the actual working of the department and the condition of
the observatories, and contains extracts from the reports of the inspec-
tion of the stations. Mr. Eliot has discontinued solar and terrestrial
radiation observations except at a few selected stations. The calcula-
tion of daily averages, and the extension and improvement of the meth-
ods of collecting rainfall data have been undertaken. An observatory
has been opened at Bagdad, and the question of establishing one at
Perim, at the entrance of the Red Sea, has been suggested by the Eng-
lish Meteorological Council.

The International Meteorological Committee held a meeting at Zurich,
September 3-5, 1888, at which the following resolution was adopted :

‘The committee, in view of the circumstance that the assembling of
an international meeting of the same character as the congress at Vienna
and Rome presents great difficulties, considers that the commission it
received at Rome is exhausted and that it ought to dissolve itself.

‘“ At the same time, in order to continue the relations between the
different meteorological organizations that have been productive of
such good results during a series of years, the committee appoints a
small bureau with the duty of using its best endeavors to bring about,
at some convenient time, an international mecting of representatives of
the different meteorological services.”

By a subsequent resolution the burean was made to consist of the
president and secretary of the committee, Professor Wild and Mr.
Scott. (Nature, Xxxviil, p. 491.) °

The third general assembly of the Italian Meteorological Society, which
is held every three years, met in Venice from 14th to 21st September,
1888.

- The subjects of the programme were divided into four classes :

(1) General meteorology ; (2) agricultural meteorology and phenol-
ogy; (3) medical meteorology and hydrology ; (4) geodynamics.

Among others, papers were presented upon the following topics:

General meteorology and climatology.—New studies and experiments
of Prof. L. Palmieri on the origin of atmospheric electricity reported
by Prof. Del Gaizo, of Naples. Results of the magnetic observations
conducted at one hundred and sixty-three stations by P. Denza. Re-
sults of the meteorological observations made at the suggestion of the
Society upon two Italian steamers, the Generale and the Veloce, extend-
ing through forty-three voyages in 1887. The helio-photometric observa-
tions of Prof. Friedrich Craveri, at the observatory of Bra, conducted
since 1874 with a helio-photometer of his own construction. Two papers
by Professor Busin, of Rome, upon the distribution of temperature in
Italy, and upon the high and low pressures of the northern hemisphere.
Notes by Professor Galli and by Professor Golfarelli upon the hourly
velocity of the wind and upon lightning conductors. Professor Roberto
described a new hygrometer.

Agricultural meteorology.—P. Ferrari, of Rome, gave an exposition of
the present applications of meteorology to the interests of agriculture.

Medical meteorology and hydrology.—Discussion arose upon the dis-
position and classification of climatie stations. P. Siciliani, of Bologna,
presented a paper on the relation between the height of water in wells
and the air pressure. P. Bertelli took up the theories that assume
electricity as the principal cause of earth tremors, and demonstrated
their improbability. P. Denza had a paper on the more important
earthquakes of 1887.

An Intercolonial Meteorological Congress was held at the Melbourne
Observatory September 11-15, 1888, at which all the Australian colo-
nies, New Zealand, and Tasmania were represented. The question of
thermometer exposure was discussed at length. Mr. Todd considered
it impossible for any one to say positively what is the best form of ex-
posure, but had himself fully tested the Stevenson stand and shoald
adopt it for his out-stations. Various other questions were discussed,
including the relation of climatologic observations to hygiene, and the
reduction of the barometer to sea-level.

International Meteorological Tables.—The International Meteorological
Committee has published the collection of tables that have been in
course of preparation for several years. They fill 400 quarto pages and
the volume is sold for 35 tranes. The tables include the reduction of
both temperature and pressure to sea-level, conversion tables, units of
measure, geodetic measures, hygrometric tables, and tables for the re-
duction of wind, rain, evaporation, magnetism, and electricity.
208 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

The sixth volume of the Reports of the International Bureau of
Weights and Measures contains three papers of importance to instru-
mental meteorology in continuation of the valuable memoirs published
in the preceding volumes, which include researches on the tensions of
aqueous vapor, on the fixed points of thermometers, on the true
weight of a litre of air, on the dilatation of mercury, on methods of
verifying subdivided linear measures, on calibrating thermometers,
and other thermometrie studies. Of the papersin the new volume that
are of meteorological interest, one (tome VI, pp. 620) is by Dr. René
Benoit, on the measurement of dilatations by the method of M. Fizeau ;
one, on the comparison of mercurial thermometers with the air or hydro-
gen thermometer, by Dr. P. Chappuis; and a third paper, on practical
formule for the transformation of thermometric co-efficients, by Dr. A.
E. Guillaume. |

Daily synoptic weather charts for the North Atlantic Ocean, Parts 1
to 5, September, 1883, to November, 1884, have been published con-
jointly by the Danish Meteorological Institute, and the Seewarte at
Hamburg. Each volume contains a carefully prepared summary of the
principal meteorological features. A novel point in the work is the
introduction by Dr. Képpen of a new system of discussing the paths
of storms in which their rate and direction of motion are shown to be
dependent on surrounding conditions; so that the movement of cy-
clones is almost entirely dependent on their relation to existing anti-
cyclones. Dr. K6ppen finds one type of conditions to consist of an
almost stationary anti-cyclone with a cyclone traveling along its bor-
ders. He then proceeds to represent all periods of this type on one
chart, the number of such periods in the year ending with August,
1884, being fifty-seven, each ranging from three to eleven days each.

The movements of the cyclones during the type are represented by
lines joining the ascertained positions each day, and by a simple ar-
rangement the lowest pressure and the wind force are represented
daily. The anti-cyclones are considered as stationary and the isobar
of 30.12 inches has been adopted and plotted as the inclosing periphery
of such areas; itS position is the mean position of that isobar during
the period; the maximum barometric readings are shown near the
center, and the direction in which the highest pressures moved. By
this method the representation of storm tracks has been greatly sim-
plified. In some special cases one chart has been devoted to a single
period showing conditions of marked interest. In the study of trop-
ical cyclones the positions of neighboring anti-eyclonic areas is shown
to govern the various paths pursued.

The publication of synoptic weather maps twice a day was begun by
the Central Physical Observatory May 12, 1889. Tie map covers the
whole of Europe, and a summary of the weather is given in Russian
and French.

Lady Franklin Bay Expedition.—The official report of the Lady Frank-
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 209

lin Bay Expedition, made by General A. W. Greely, has been published
in two quarto volumes. The first volume contains the report of the
commanding officer, and appendices containing detailed reports of spe-
cial expeditions and the diaries of Lieutenant Lockwood and Sergeant
Brainard; it is the history of the expedition. The second volume con-
tains the main scientific results. The meteorological report and tables
of observation occupy 360 pages. The annual mean temperature for
three years was —5°.9 F., the lowest mean temperature known for any
place on the globe. The precipitation was a little less than 4 inches a
year, and evaporation in winter was found to be inappreciable. Auroras
were neither frequent nor brilliant. Storms were not especially fre-
quent or severe. In the winter, calms averaged seventeen hours daily,
but during the continuous sunlight, only one hour daily. The diurnal
oscillation of the barometer was less than 0.01 inch. These are a few
striking results abstracted from this great store-house of arctic meteo-
rology. Separate chapters are given to the astronomical observations
for determining geodetic positions, and to the magnetic, tidal, and pen-
dulum observations which are specially reported upon by the officers
of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A valuable bibliography of arctic
literature is also given as an appendix.

M. HERVE MANGON died in Paris May 15,1888. In his death agricult-
ure and meteorology have lost a most active worker. In 1850 he pub-
lished his “ Etudes sur les Irrigations dela Campine Belge” and the
“Travaux Analogues de la Sologne,” which brought about important
improvements in the French laws in relation to agriculture. Drainage
was at that time scarcely known in France; in 1851 M. Mangon pub.
lished a work on the subject which received from the Academy of
Sciences the decennial prize for the most useful work on agriculture
issued during the previous ten years. Irrigation and the fertilization
of land were subjects to which he gave prolonged and careful study.
These researches were followed by meteorological studies in which he
took an active interest; he invented or improved many meteorological
instruments and organized on his estate in Normandy a model meteo-
rological station provided with the latest scientific improvements; he
aided in the re-organization of the French Meteorological Service, and
became the president of the meteorological council. He contributed
also to the organization of the scientific mission to Cape Horn which
obtained a large amount of valuable meteorological data. (Nature,
MeN VILL, ps 111,)

Dr. O. J. BrRocH, director of the International Bureau of Weights
and Measures, died at Sevres, February 5, 1889, at the age of seventy-
one. The memoirs on thermometry published by the bureau during
his administration have greatly advanced the accurate measurement of
temperature.

Prof. EL1As Loomis, the American meteorologist, died at New Haven,

H. Mis. 224 14

~

210 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

August 15, 1889, at the age of seventy-eight years. For fifty-six years
Professor Loomis had been engaged in collegiate work and in original re-
search, having devoted the whole of his strength during the last ten
years to the completion of his meteorological studies.

Ina memoir by Prof. H. A. Newton (Am. Journ. Sci., June, 1890) a
bibliography of Professor Loomis’s writings is given containing 164 titles.
These include contributions to astronomy, terrestrial magnetism, and
meteorology, and a series of mathematical text-books which attained an
extensive circulation.

His first work in terrestrial magnetism consisted in a series of hourly
observations (seventeen hours each day) of the magnetic needle for a
period of thirteen months in 1834 and 1835. With exception of a short
series by Professor Bache this was the earliest series of hourly magnetic
observations in America, and only one or two ante-dated it in Europe.

Professor Loomis’s early work in astronomy was likewise at the time
when that science was having its beginning in this country. Comets,
shooting stars, and the determination of geodetic positions formed the
subject of his observations and study. He was among the first to en-
gage with Professor Bache in the telegraphic determination of longi-
tudes, several years before the use of the method by European astrono-
mers. In later years, additional important papers upon the aurora,
terrestrial magnetism and astronomy followed these early labors. But
meteorology has been the science to which Professor Loomis devoted
his best work, and in which he made the most important advances in
human knowledge. At the beginning of his work not a single law of
storms was satisfactorily demonstrated. Franklin, in the last century,
had discovered their progressive motion, and Brandes and Dove (1810-
1830) had announced their essential character to be that of extended
whirlwinds (eirbelstiirme.) Therival theories of Redfield and Espy, the
former claiming a circular movement of the winds around astorm center,
and the latter, following Brandes, claiming a radial direction, each had
its warm supporters, but no decisive victory had been gained by either.
Professor Loomis’s first meteorological investigations, beginning in
1837, were directed towards the further study of these unsettled prob-
lems of storm movement, and his last work a half century later, centered
in the statistical development of all the phenomena of cyclonic systems.
This example of patiently sustained scientific labor, directed in certain
well-marked lines for half a century, is a rich legacy of unselfish devo-
tion and becomes itself a part of the history of science.

In his second meteorological paper published in 1840, Professor Loomis
made a study of astorm occurring near the 20th of December, 183%, adopt-
ing graphical methods very similar to those principally used by Espy, but
the results were not entirely satisfactory, and he waited for another oppor-
tunity for continuing the investigation. This was found in two storms of
February, 1842. Instead of using the line of minimum depression of the
barometer, as before, Professor Loomis now drew maps containing lines
ad

of equal barometric pressure (or more correctly of equal departures from
the normal) together with wind directions, temperatures, and weather.

The suggestion of this method of representing barometric observa-
tions was made by Brandes in 1810 in recommending that observers
should give in their record books the departure from the normal of
every barometric observation, and that these departures should form
the principal data in the study of the compiled data. Whether Pro-
fessor Loomis was acquainted with this suggestion, does not appear.
This graphical method is now the essence of the modern weather map,
and the memoir of 1843 in which the method was presented created a
profound impression. In his appreciative biographical sketch, Pro-
fessor Newton expresses his opinion that the introduction of this single
method of representing and discussing the phenomena of a storm was
the greatest of the services which Professor Loomis rendered to science.
Professor Loomis’s own estimate of the method at the time of publica-
tion was expressed as follows: “It appears to me that if the course of
investigation adopted with respect to the two storms of February, 1842,
was systematically pursued we should soon have some settled prinei-
ples in meteorology. If we could be furnished with two meteorological
charts of the United States daily tor one year it would settle forever the
laws of storms. No false theory could stand against such an array of
testimony. Such aset of maps would be worth more than all which has
hitherto been done in meteorology. <A well arranged system of observa-
tions spread over the country would accomplish more in one year than
observations at a few insulated posts, however accurate and complete,
continued to the end of time. Is not such an enterprise worthy of the
American Philosophical Society? If private zeal could be more gener-
ally enlisted the war might soon be ended, and men would cease to
ridicule the idea of our being able to predict an approaching storm.”

Thirty years passed before the system of observations was inaugurated
and the maps constructed for which Professor Loomis here appealed.
In 1871 the signal service was established, and as soon as two years’ maps
had been issued, Professor Loomis turned again, with unabated inter-
est and enthusiasm, to the work that he began with such scanty mate-
rial in 1840. For the remaining fifteen years of his life he devoted
nearly his whole strength to this work. Twenty-three papers, entitled
Contributions to Meteorology, were published in the American Journal
of Science, and in 1884 he began a revision of the whole series. This
revision was arranged in three chapters, covering areas of low pressure,
areas of high pressure, and rain-fall. Chapters I and U1 were presented
to the National Academy in 1885 and 1887, respectively, and chapter rT
was completed and issued a few weeks before the author’s death. In
these three monographs is compiled a wealth of statistical data which
will long afford the observational basis for the explanation of climate
and for the theoretical study of the atmospheric circulation and the
phenomena of storms.
212 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

I].—GENERAL TREATISES; CLIMATE; WEATHER PREDICTIONS AND
VERIFICATIONS.

Contributions to Meteorology, by Elias Loomis. Chapters 1 and IIT
of Professor Loomis’s revision of his Contributions to Meteorology have
been issued during 1859.—Chapter 1, previously published in Vol. m1
of the Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, treats of areas
of low pressure—their form, magnitude, direction, and velocity of move-
ment. Chapter I1 treats, similarly, of areas of high pressure, and of
the relation of areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. Chap-
ter 111, which completes the revision, treats of rain-fall ; the conditions
favorable and the conditions unfavorable to rain-fall are enumerated,
and their application is shown in a survey of the more striking feat-
ures of the mean annual rain-fall of different countries. Special study
is made of individual rain-falls in the United States, in Europe, and
over the Atlantic Ocean, and fruitful suggestions are offered towards
a physical explanation of the characteristic features of individual cases.

In this revision the earlier series of papers are reduced to a more
systematic form, new researches and results are introduced based on
later and more extended data, and the text is accompanied by a large
number of elegantly printed illustrative plates. Chapter III is accom-
panied by a rain-fall map of the world and by rain-fall maps of India
and California, which present features of special interest. The whole
forms a great compendium of meteorological results derived by statis-
tical methods and inductive processes from the modern weather map.

Meteorologia Generale, Luigi de Marchi, Milano, 1888, 160 pages.—
The author has brought together in this brief compendium, in a thor-
oughly scientific and quite original way, the most important principles
of meteorology. The book is divided into four parts. The first, enti-
tled “Air and the Atmosphere,” treats of the physical properties of
the air. The second part treats of the conditions of equilibrium and
of motion in the air, and is composed of three chapters: Air pressure
and wind; causes of motion, laws of motion. The third part takes
up the meteorological factors which depend upon the normal distribu-
tion of temperature and the periodic oscillations of temperature and
their consequences. The fourth part embraces irregular meteorological
phenomena and the art of weather prediction. In this section the
paths of eyclones over Europe are shown on a chart, and their easterly
movement is ascribed to the difference in density of the warm easterly
and cold westerly winds.

Treatise on Meteorological Apparatus and Methods, by Cleveland
Abbe, Annual Report of the Chief Signal Officer, 1887, Part 2.—This
exhaustive work treats in five sections the subject of the measurement
of temperature, pressure, the motion of the air, aqueous vapor, and
precipitation. The section on thermometry opens with a chapter on
the history of the thermometer, and then proceeds to discuss the theory

”
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. a Wea

of the air thermometer and its relation to the absolute thermo dynamic
scale, the normal mercurial and its reductions to the air thermometer,
and ordinary thermometers with their reductions to the normal mer-
curial. After the theory of the instrument, the subject of thermometer
exposure is treated with corresponding fullness, and the conditions
necessary for obtaining the true air temperature are clearly set forth.
Chapters on miscelianeous forms of thermometers and on thermographs
complete the section. The third section-—that treating of the motion
of the air—also commands special attention on account of the origi-
nality and depth of its treatment. The results of a large amount of
research in theoretical and experimental hydrodynamics are discussed
in their relation to the theory of the action of the different classes of
anemometers. The last chapter of the section takes up the various
methods of measuring upper currents by means of observations of
clouds, and describes the different methods of using the nephoscope.
The section on hygrometry gives a similarly complete exposition of
the theory of the psychrometer.

A Popular Treatise on the Winds, by William Ferrel.—“ It is with no
ordinary degree of satisfaction that we hail the publication of Professor
Ferrel’s treatise. The work is a‘ popular” treatise, but popular only
in the higher sense of the word. A system of movements so complex
as those of the earth’s atmosphere can not be made clear ¢o any one who
is not capable of following a chain of close reasoning, or who is not pre-
pared to bring to the study that concentrated attention that is requisite
to master any problem in deductive science.

‘¢ The most important and original portion of the book is that which
deals with the general circulation of the atmosphere, in relation to
which the cyclones and anticyclones that cause the vicissitudes ef
local weather are but matters of subordinate detail. The magnitude of
the work achieved by Professor Ferrel in this field has hitherto been
recognized only by the few. It is not too much to say that he has done
for the theory of atmospheric circulation that which Young and Fresnel
did for the theory of light; and that the influence of his work is not more
generally reflected in the literature of the day must be attributed to
the want of some popular exposition of the theory.

“‘ Starting with the fundamental conditions of a great temperature dif-
ference between equatorial and polar regions and a rotating globe, and
postulating in the first instance a uniform land or water surface, it is
shown how the convective interchange of air set up by the former must
result in producing two zones of maximum pressure in about latitude 30°
in both hemispheres, two principal minima at the poles, and a minor
depression on the equator, together with strong west winds in middle
and high latitudes, and an excess of easterly winds in equatorial re-
gions. The two tropical zones of high pressure determine the polar
limits of the trade winds, and the whole system oscillates in latitude
with the changing declination of the sun. Further, as a consequence of
PAA PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

the fact that the great mass of the land is restricted to the northern
hemisphere, whereas the southern hemisphere presents a comparatively
uninterrupted sea surface on which the retarding friction is less than
in the northern hemisphere, the west winds of middle and high latitudes
are much stronger in the latter than in the former, and by their lateral
pressure cause a slight displacement of the tropical zones of high press-
ure and the equatorial zone of low pressure to the north of their nor
mal positions on a hypothetical uniform terrestrial surface.

‘The great modification and extension of Hadley’s theory thus intro-
duced by Professor Ferrel depends mainly on two points of the first
importance. By all previous writers it was assumed that a mass of air
at rest relatively to the earth’s surface on the equator, if suddenly trans-
ferred to some higher latitude—say, e. g., 60°—would have a relative
easterly movement in that latitude equal to the difference of rotary ve-
locities on the equator and on the sixtieth parallel, or about 500
niles an hour, the difference being proportional to that of the cosines
of the latitudes. This, however, would be true only in the case of ree-
tilinear motion. In reality, as Professor Ferrel was the first to demon-
strate, the mass of air wouid obey the law of the preservation of areas,
like all bodies revolving under the influence of a central force, and its
relative eastward velocity in latitude 60° would be 1,500 miles an hour,
being as the difference of the squares of the cosines. If, on the other
hand, any mass of air at rest in latitude 60° were suddenly transferred
to the equator, it would have a relative westerly movement of 750 miles
an hour, and any mass of matter whatever moving along a meridian is
either deflected, or, if like a railway train or a river between high
banks it is not free to yield to the deflecting force, presses, to the right
of its path in the northern and to the left in the southern hemisphere.

“ The second point first established by Professor Ferrel is that, in vir-
tue of centrifugal force, this deflection or pressure to the right in the
northern and to the left in the southern hemisphere is suffered in ex-
actly the same degree by bodies moving due east and due west, or along
a parallel of latitude, and theretore also in all intermediate azimuths.

‘‘ rom the first of these principles it will be readily seen why the west
winds of middle latitudes are so much stronger than the easterly winds
of the equatorial zone; and from the second, how these opposite winds,
by their mutual pressure, produce the tropical zones of high barometer
and the polar and equatorial regions of low barometer.

“In subsequent chapters are discussed the modes in which the general
circulation of the globe affects the climates of different latitudes by de-
termining the distribution of rain-fall in wet and dry zones and inequali-
ties of temperature through the agency of marine currents. Also the
causes that modify and disturb the regularity of the ideal system, the
chief of which is the mutuai interaction of expanses of land and sea.

‘“‘ Professor Ferrel’s book covers very much of the ground of which
modern meteorology usually takes cognizance, and in the thoroughness

PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 215

of its treatment we know of no modern work in our language that can be
brought into comparison with it.” (H. F. Blanford, Nature, xut, p. 124.)

Bibliography of Meteorology.—The bibliography of temperature and
the bibliography of moisture, parts of the general bibliography of me-
teorology, which has been in preparation by the Signal Office since 1884,
have been made available to a limited number of meteorologists by the
lithographic reproduction of a type-written copy. This great work has
been compiled by Mr. C. J. Sawyer with the assistance of the present
editor, Mr. O. L. Fassig, and Mr. Kk. H. Hilton. The card catalogues
of Mr. G. J. Symons (18,000) and of Prof. Cleveland Abbe (11,000) have
been employed, and many meteorologists throughout the world have
co operated by furnishing lists of meteorological books and memoirs.
The classification adopted employs four general divisions, viz, general,
theoretical, and applied meteorology, and observations. The first division
includes (@) history and bibliography, (>) general and collected works, (c)
organization and method, (d) instruments. The second division embraces
(a) the physics of the atmosphere, including (1) temperature, (2) moist-
ure, (3) pressure, (4and 5) optical and electrical phenomena; ()) mechan
ics of the atmosphere, including (1) general atmospheric circulation, (2)
winds, (3) storms, (¢c) cosmic relations of meteorology. The third di.
vision embraces weather predictions, agricultural and medical meteor-
ology, and climatology. |

The portions now issued are therefore, I1, theoretical meteorology, (a
physics of the atmosphere, (1) temperature, and (2) moisture. These
two parts are subdivided into fourteen and twenty-seven subdivisions
respectively. The temperature volnme contains 2,000 authors and 4,000
titles; the moisture volume contains 2,500 authors and 4,500 titles.
The Chief Signal Officer states that no other portions are to be issued in
this manner.

Climates and Weather of India, by H. F. Blanford, London, 1889, pp.
369.—The first ninety pages, constituting Part I of this book, discusses
systematically the various meteorological elements—temperature, pres-
sure, winds, humidity, cloudiness, rain, and storms—presenting in each
chapter a wealth of meteorological and climatic data. The second part,
entitled “Climates and weather of India in relation to health and in-
dustry,” takes up the climates of the different climatic districts, the
weather and weather reports, the storms of Indian seas, and the hydrog-
raphy. Every chapter and almost every page is replete with interest-
ing and suggestive information.

Instructions for observing clouds on land and seas, By Hon. R. Aber-
cromby.—This pamphlet by Mr. Abercromby presents in a concise way
the fundamental conceptions and the methods to be employed in cloud
observation and is a convenient and valuable syllabus upon an import-
ant class of meteorologic observations.

in which descriptive meteorology is the principal purpose of the author.
Many important climatic facts have beer garnered and the Mane of the
work is increased by good maps and illustrations.

Das Klima des ausser-tropischen Stidafrica, by Dr. Karl Dove, Gott-
ingen, 1888.—This book describes the climate of a large region, much
of which is but little known. The area is divided into four great districts
classified according to the period of occurrence of the rainy season, viz
(1) the region of winter rains ; (2) the intermediate region of spring and
autumn rains; (3) the region of heavy summer rains; (4) the west coast.
Under (1) are found the southwest province, the western Karroo, and the
Little Namaqua land. Under (2) come the south coast, north and south
Karroo, and the southeast mountain land; and under (3) we have the
table-land of the upper Orange River, the north Transvaal, the Kala-
hari, and the Great Namaqua and Damara land. After treating of the
geography, the author discusses the possible developments of agricul-
ture in the different districts. In a chapter on the treatment of the
rain-fall and its distribution, Dr. Dove concludes with some remarks on
the alleged deterioration of the climate by the drying up of the country.
This effect he considers to be the outcome of reckless forest destruction.
He points out the brilliant results obtained at small cost by the con-
struction of reservoirs, as at Beaufort and at Van Wyk’s Vley.

Die Meteorologie, mit besonderer Beriicksichtigung geographischer Fra-
gen dargestellt, by Dr. 8. Giinther, Miinich. This work is an attempt
to produce a text book of the whole of meteorology in 300 pages, and,
so far as the effort is at all possible, the work is successful. Each sub-
ject is treated in an excessively condensed manner, and references to
the literature are given for what is left unsaid. It is, therefore, rather
a good index or reference book than a successor of Kimtz or Schmidt.

Der Einfluss einer Schneedecke auf Boden, Klima und Wetter, by A
Woeikof, pp. 1-115.—In this book Dr. Woeikof sums up all that is at
present known of the influence of a snow covering, upon the soil, the
climate, and the weather. Data are given which show that the effect of
a snow sheet in lowering the temperature of the air is very considerable
and certain anomalies in mean winter temperature are explained in
view of this relation.

In discussing the effect of a thick winter snow-sheet on springs and
rivers, a variation is pointed out which is of importance in its bearings
on hydrography. In latitudes where the winter cold is sufficient to
freeze the ground to a considerable depth, if heavy snow falls early in
the winter before cold has penetrated deeply below the surface, the
protection thereby afforded allows the ground to thaw by conduction
from the lower strata, and the water from the slow melting of the basal
snow layer, and much of that which is produced in the spring thaw, soaks
into the soil and affords a supply which maintains the rivers more or
less full through the succeeding summer. But if, before snow falls, the

soil has been frozen to a great depth, a rapid thaw, setting in in the
spring, floods the rivers and the surrounding tracts, while little or
none enters the ground, and but little supply is stored up for main-
taining the summer flow. (Nature, XL, p. 315.)

Greenland Hxploration.—At a meeting of the Royal Geographical
Society, Dr. F. Nansen told the story of his journey across Greenland in
the summer and fall of 1888. He found the country so thickly covered
with the ice accumulations of ages that no part of the interior is ever
laid bare. This will put to rest the idea that somewhere in Greenland
there may be a fertile oasis. He estimates that the ice in places is 6,000
feet deep. The temperature during the expedition reached 90° F below
freezing, which was as low as their thermometer registered.

Secular Oscillations in Climate.—K. Sieger has added some new and
important contributions to the statistics showing long period oscilla-
tions in the level of inland seas. That such variations in level have
occurred was pointed out by Hann as early as 1867, and during the past
two years has also been elaborately discussed by Dr. Briickner.

The work of Sieger relates to the level of the Armenian lakes. The
material available for such an investigation consists, not of exact obser-
vations of water level, but of opportune notes of individual travellers,
upon the location of places on the sea-shore, the course of the shore-
line, the appearance of islands, and finally upon the oscillation of the
water surface, derived from the statements of the neighboring inhab-
itants.

From this heterogeneous material the author endeavors to show sec-
ular oscillations in the levelof Armenian lakes, especially the Wan, the
Urmia Goktscha, and also a series of smaller lakes, and attributes the
cause of these oscillations to oscillations in temperature and rain-fall.
Similar secular variations of Jevel are adduced for lakes in Iran, in the
Alps, and in Italy, and for Lake Valencia, honey Lake, Pyramid Lake,
Winnemucca Lake, and the Great Salt Lake of Utah.

The times of maximum and minimum of level are grouped about the
following well-defined periods: (1) Maximum between 1770 and 1780;
(2) minimum about 1800 (not pronounced); (3) maximur about 1815;
(4) minimum about'1830; (5) between 1835 and 1865 a series of lakes
has two maxima, a minor about 1845 and a major about 1860; these are
the Armenian lakes, Lake Constance, Lake George in Australia, Great
Salt-Lake, and some of their neighbors. The remaining, on the other
hand, show only a maximum about 1845; (6) a minimum in the sixties,
1860-1870; (7) arise from 1865 to 1870, followed by an interruption
beginning with 1870; (8) a diminution after 1880.

In a memoir entitled “‘ In how far is our present climate permanent ?”
Prof. Dr. Briickner brings together a store of data from various sources
which gives evidence of well-defined oscillations in rain-fall and temper-
ature, oscillations having a period of no definite length, but averaging
during the present century from thirty to thirty-six years. The author
218 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

finds similar and synchronous oscillations in the level of the Caspian,
the Black, and the Baltic seas; in the rain-fall throughout Europe, and
in Asia, Australia, and in the interior of North America; in the tem-
perature of Europe and New England; in the advance and recession
of the lower limit of the Alpine glaciers; in the times of vintage in
France, Germany, and Switzerland; and in the opening of Russian
rivers.

The rhythm of temperature oscillations corresponds with therain-fall
variations in such a way that warm periods are dry, and cool periods are
wet. In the present century the maximaof rain-fall group themselves
around the years 1815, 1850 and 1880, the minima around the years 1830
and 1860. The curves also show an increase in the amplitude of oscil-
lation on advancing from the coast into the interior of the continents.

These climatic oscillations in their effect upon agriculture, are believed
to be of sufficient magnitude to determine the productivity or non-pro-
ductivity of vast areas in arid and semi-arid regions.

Storm Warnings.—-The possibility of giving successful storm warnings
for western Europe by constructing the hypothetical distribution of
pressure over the Atlantic is urged by M. deBort. He points out that
from the known monthly normal distribution of pressure, together with
the observed isobars of Europe and America, obtained from telegraphic
reports, the general pressure over the Atlantic, and especially the ex-
istence there of pronounced storm-centers, can be inferred. (Nature,
XXXVIII, 419.)

In the report of the Meteorological Council (of Great Britain) for the
year ending March 31, 1888, Mr. R. B. Scott concludes that it is extremely
improbable that telegraphic reports from America can assist in fore-
casting the weather in Great Britain, and this conclusion is supported
by the actual results obtained in dealing with American reports during
the year.

Mr. H. N. Dickson has presented a paper to the Scottish Meteoro-
logical society on ‘‘ The weather lore of Scottish fishermen.” Prognosti-
cations from halos; corone, and mock suns are of common acceptation.
It is a current belief that when a sun-dog precedes the sun it is a sign
of good weather, and when it follows the sun it is a sign of bad weather.
Another very general belief relates te the existence of spider’s webs in
sails and cordage. On the north and west coast it is believed that cir-
rus running from northeast to southwest is a sign of good weather, and
running from southeast to northwest is a sign of bad weather. Many
other peculiar beliefs are related.

Gas thermometer.—In the International Bureau of Weights and Meas-
ures Dr. Chappuis has conducted a new series of observations on the
difference between gas and mercurial thermometers. The latter were
‘

PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 219

made by Tonnelot of hard glass whose chemical composition is specified.
Four thermometers were compared having scales from —5° C. to 104°,
and a length of 70°™, the length of a scale-division being 5.7™"; and
four other mercurial thermometers 54°" long for low temperatures, with
seales from —32° to +599, to which an extension is added which ineludes
scale readings from 95° to 103°. Between these eight mercurial ther-
mometers there were no systematic differences, and they agreed with one
another very well, the greatest difference in an observation being 0°.006.

The gas thermometer is constructed so that the portion that is not
brought to the temperature of the bath is extremely small. To attain
this a large cylinder of iridio-platinum (1.10 ™ high and 36™™ diameter)
is used as a thermometer box. It is a gas thermometer of constant vol-
ume. The pressure at 0° is about 1™ of mercury: The description of
the manometer and the detail of the comparisons will be found in the
Archives des Sciences phys et nat. Bd. xx, 1888. The following is an
abstract of the differences found between a mercurial thermometer
and the three gas thermometers containing hydrogen, nitrogen, and car-
bonic acid, whose fixed points agreed with the mercurial.

Differential barometer.—Director Crnils, of the Rio Janeiro observa-
tory, has invented a new form of differential barometer for use in hyp-
sometry. Each arm of a U-shaped tube terminates in an air-tight box
of known capacity provided with a stop-cock. If the U be partially
filled with a suitable liquid and both cocks are opened, the height of
the liquid in the twe arms will be the same. If now the cocks be
closed and the instrument be taken to a station of different elevation
_and only one of the cocks be opened, the closed box will retain the air-
pressure of the first and the open end will assume that of the second
station. The level of the liquid will now be different in the two arms
by a height which will depend on the difference of pressure at the two
Stations.

A light liquid like water can be employed, and yet the instrument
may be keptof convenient size. If the stop-cocks are small, they may
be opened alternately, each just long enough to partially equalize the
difference of pressure in the boxes; with each opening the level of the
ends of the liquid columns is to be read off, and the sum of the differences
measures the difference of pressure. (Am. Meteor. Journal, VI, p. 181.)
220 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

Aspiration thermometer.—Professor Assmann has replied to the objec-
tions which have been raised against his aspiration thermometer, after
giving it a thorough test. The instrument, even when exposed to the
most intense solar radiation, should record the true temperature of the
surrounding air. In order to determine whether the instrument satis-
fies this requirement, Dr. Assmann spent four weeks on the Sentis and
found as a result of several thousand observations that this condition
is fulfilled by the instrument in its present form. By means of an ar-
rangement of clock-work, a constant current of air is drawn through the
metallic tube which surrounds the thermometer. This clock-work
is attached to the upper end of the tube and drives a fan with consid-
erable velocity, thus forcing the air out of the tube at the top and draw-
ing it up from the lower portion of the tube; by this means a rapid
current of air is kept streaming over the thermometer. By direct ex-
periment with hot water he found that the temperature is not affected
even when the temperature of the metal tube is 20° C. above that of
the surrounding air. (Nature, XL, p. 660.)

New hygrometer.—H. Dufour has constructed a dew-point hygrometer,
the peculiarity of which is that the condensing surface, instead of
being a thin silver plate, is a thick silvered copper plate with the ther-
mometer embedded init. The thermometer thus set is supposed to
register the temperature of the condensing surface more accurately than
when immersed in the evaporating liquid, and that one of the largest
errors incident to the dew-point hygrometer is thereby overcome; but
it seems questionable whether this result is secured. (Bull. Soc. Vau-
dovse, 1888, p. 88.)

The Tenth Annual Hehibition of Instruments by the Royal Meteoro-
logical Society was held March 19-22, 1889. Special attention was given
to the display of all forms of solar radiation apparatus. There were
shown specimens of the aetinometer of Sir John Herschel, that of Hodg-
kinson, Pouillet’s direct pyr-heliometer, Secchi’s apparatus, Balfour
Stewart’s actinometer, black and bright bulb thermometers in vacuo,
Luvini’s di-etheroscope, Bellani’s lucimeter, Crooke’s radiometer, sun-
shine recorders, and photometers.

Among new instruments exhibited were Fineman’s and Galton’s nepho-
scopes, Davis’s improved air meter, Negretti and Zambra’s recording
hygrometer, and de Normanville’s self-compensating sympiesometer.

Mr. Clayden showed a working model illustrating the generation of
ocean currents. This shows how the prevalent winds over the Atlantic
are the chief cause of the circulations of the waters. A number of tubes
are so arranged that when an attached blower is worked the circulation
of air produced resembles that of the atmosphere; the imitation winds
thus set up, re-act upon the surface of the water, creating a system of
currents which reproduces the main features observed in the Atlantic.

ee

a Bd oe.

Mr. Clayden also showed some lantern slides illustrating the spiral
circulation of the wind both in a cyclone and an anti-cyclone.

Mr. A. L. Rotch describes the meteorological instruments exhibited at
the Paris Exposition, the special features of which are the many novel-
ties presented in self-recording apparatus. (Am. Meteor. Journal, VI,
pp. 293, 362.)

Professor Tait has devised an instrument, named the stephanome, for
measuring the angular size of halos, parhelia, coronie, etc. It is now
used at the Ben Nevis Observatory.

Cloud Photography.—Dr. Riggenbach, of Basle, has adopted special
methods for overcoming the difficulties met in photographing cirrus
clouds. The blue light of the sky acts with nearly the same active
energy as the white light of the clouds. Dr. Riggenbach dulls the blue
light of the sky by means of the analyzer of a polarizing apparatus.
The blue sky-light is partly polarized, and to the largest extent at the
points which are situated 90° from the sun; the plane of polarization
passing through the points looked at, the sun, and the eye of the ob-
server. On the other hand, the light from a cloud is polarized only to
a slight extent. Instead of a Nicol’s prism, a dark mirror, or better, a
plate of obsidian may be used; and, when conveniently situated, the
surface of a lake may be used asa polarizing mirror. (Nature, XXXIX, p.
112.)

Thermometer Shelters.—In vol. x of Aus dem Archiv der Deutschen See-
warte, Dr. K6ppen contributes a useful paper on the determination of
air temperature. The author investigates the influence of radiation on
different thermometers and screens, and gives a résumé of the experi-
ments with regard to the latter in various countries, and of the obser-
vations on local differences of temperature (including the influence of
radiation). These experiments seem to show that screens through
which the air can pass freely, are better than large shelters, and that the
effect of radiation is lessened by the free circulation of the air, and by
the smallness of the thermometer bulbs.

Psychrometry.—Dr. Grossmann has published in the JMeteorologische
Zeitschrift an elaborate paper on the theory of the psychrometer, with
an introductory sketch of the development of the subject up to the
present time. The following is an outline of his treatment:

(1) If a wet bulb exposed in air (pressure Lb, vapor pressure p, and
temperature t) reads ¢, in consequence of the evaporation of water (the
latent heat being A), and if p,; be the pressure of saturated vapor at ¢,,
we may assume that, when the conditions have become steady, the
process which has gone on and is going on continuously round the wet
bulb is as follows: A quantity of heat is absorbed by evaporation, the
vapor pressure of a layer of air containing m, grams of dry air being
raised from p to p,; this heat is supplied by the reduction of the tem-
perature of a layer of air, containing m’ grams of dry air, from ¢ to t.

Equating these quantities of heat, we get, if S be the specific heat

of dry air, S, the specific heat of moist air referred to unit mass of dry
air, o the specific gravity of vapor referred to air at the same tempera-
ture and pressure,

a general and strict formula for the psychrometer under the conditions.
This reduces to August’s formula on introducing the assumption that
the whole of the air which is reduced in temperature becomes at the
same time saturated by the evaporation, in other words, that m,=m.
2) The heat derived from the cooling of m/ is assumed to represent
all the heat derived from conduction, radiation, local convection, and
the independent general motion of the air. By reckoning separately
that part of the heat supptied to the bulb by radiation in time 7 as
equal to ZOR (t—t,) (O being the area of the surface of the bulb, and R
the coefficient of radiation), we Bh

In order to express the effect of the velocity of motion of the air,
assume that q and q/ are linear functions of the velocity v with a coeffi-
cient ¢, that they are equal when v is infinite, and that their values,
when v 1s zero, are q°; and q/ respectively.

Substituting, we get the following general formula for the psychrom-
eter, in moving air, with spherical bulb, radius r:

The values of S, A, o, and & are known, and ean be substituted (A=
606.5—0.695 t, for water-covered bulbs, and 685.5—0.695 t, for ice-cov-
ered bulbs).

The values of q°; and q’) are not known @ priori, but they may be
regarded as constant for a given velocity, so X and H can be deter-
mined from observations with the psychrometer upon air of known
humidity moving with known velocity, and thus a numerical formula
of reduction obtained. It is assumed that the radiation effect is the
same in moving air as in still air.

(3) From this general equation the formulas hitherto employed can be
deduced by the introduction of the special assumptions upon which they
are respectively based. To obtain August’s formula (corrected for ra-
diation) K’ must be put equal to D, and / equal tof, In Maxwell’s
formula 6 and /, are both infinite. Ferrel’s formula for moving air is

PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889, 220

obtained by altering the expression for radiation, so as to make it follow
Dulong and Petit’s law, and assuming / to be equal to f,, and each to
be inversely proportional to the velocity of the air. Though the theo-
retical expressions for A and 4% are different, the resulting formula is
identical in form with (5), except that the factor oe is omitted.
A numerical table shows the effect and importance of the missing fac-
tor, which is moreover shown to be required by some observations of
Ferrel’s, from which it appears that the factor A of the temperature
difference in the typical psychrometer formala, p=p,—A B (t-t,), where
A is supposed to have a known value in making reductions, increases
more rapidly with the temperature of the wet bulb than can ‘be ac-
counted for by the mere variation of the latent heat.

(4.) The values of A for ¢;=9) are also tabulated for a series of veloci-
ties; they show considerable variation for small velocities, and also
greater variation with a large bulb than witha small one. On this ac-
count it is evidently necessary to provide for a constant ventilation of
the psychrometer, and to determine the factor A for the specific arrang-
ment of the psychrometer by comparison with a dew-point instrument.
For small velocities the constants for each psychrometer must be deter-
mined as far as possible under the conditions that will obtain when the
instrument 1s subsequently used for observations.

(5) The use of psychrometer tables, founded upon Regnault’s formula,
certainly gives on the average, for psychrometers with small bulbs, too
small values for the humidity.

(6) The question as to whether different values for the latent heat of
vaporization should be substituted in formule for water-covered bulbs
and ice-covered bulbs respectively was raised by Sworykin upon his
finding, in comparisons before mentioned, that the formula for water-
covered bulbs gave satisfactory reductions when applied to ice-covered
bulbs. It is pointed out (following Ekholm) that practical importance
is to be attached to the fact that below the freezing-point the pressure
of water vapor has one value over ice, and another over water at the
same temperature. The latter is the greater, and should be taken in
dew-point experiments, whereas Regnault’s table (ased by Sworykin in
the comparison) gives the ice-vapor pressure. When account is taken
of this, it is shown that Sworykin’s observations do not entitle us to
abandon the change in the value of A for ice-covered bulbs, which is
required on theoreticalfgrounds. (Quar. Journal Roy. Meteor. Soc.)

Mr. 8. A. Hill has made a series of comparative observations with the
psychrometer and condensing hygrometer under a wide range of con-
ditions. He discusses the difficulties and the limits of error in the use
of the dew-point apparatus, which he adopts as a standard for compar-
ing with the results given by the psychrometric formula of Regnault.
His principal results are: The factor A of the psychrometer formula is
approximately, if not entirely, independent of the air pressure, and also
independent of the relative humidity. On an occasion of extreme dry-
224 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

ness the direct dew-point determination gave the vapor pressure 5.2™™,
while Regnault’s formula gave 3.9™™, a value considerably too small.*
Anemometry.— Prof. C. F. Marvin, in presenting the results of the
recent experiments of the U. 8. Signal Office for determining anemom-
eter factors, points out that an important consideration has hitherto
been overlooked in applying the factors obtained in whirling-machine
experiments to anemometers in actual use. In the experiments the
velocity is uniform, in practice the wind is extremely variable. The
revolving parts of an anemometer exposed to a variable wind will, in
consequence of their inertia, fall short of their proper rate of revolu-
tion when the velocity of the wind is increasing, and then catch up and
run too fast when the wind velocity diminishes, and it has been gener-
ally assumed that the amount lost in the one case is balanced by that
gained in the other, so that the mean rate is not affected. But such is
not the case, from the fact that the resultant force acting on the cups
when the wind is increasing and tending to increase the velocity of the
cups is much greater than the corresponding force in action when the
wind is diminishing in intensity and tending to retard the velocity of
the cups. In one ease it is a question of the resistance of the air to the
concave side of the cups, and in the other that to the convex surface;
the latter being smaller, the cups will always continue to move more
rapidly and longer after the wind has diminished in velocity, than they
lagged behind when the wind was increasing, so that the mean velocity
of the cups exposed to a variable wind is eaniceenln higher than it
would be in a uniform wind having the same mean velocity. Conse-
quently, if the equation of an anemometer whose constants have been
determined upon a whirling machine be used to reduce ordinary obser-
rations, the computed wind velocities will be too high by an amount
depending upon the moment of inertia of the cups and the extent of
the wind variations. Since these latter are too complicated to be de-
termined, it is impossivle with anemometers of the Robinson type to
obtain accurate measures of the mean velocity of a variable wind unless
the moment of inertia of the cups is very small in relation to the wind
pressures, and even then the result is still affected by another error.
For accurate results a formula involving the square as well as the
first power of the velocity of the cups must be used, as in the form
=a+bv+cv? where V=velocity of wind and v=mean velocity of the
cup centers. Now, when the wind is variable the third term should not
be cv? but = (voP+e24+vey+ou~g+ . . . « ,”)3; even in ordinary cir-
cumstances this difference between the square of the mean velocity
and the mean of the squares is appreciable.
The constants for a small anemometer of extreme lightness were de-
termined with great precision on a whirling machine and comparisons
in ogee air made between it and a Signal per ice anemometer of the

imation to the value given by the direct hygrometer.—G. E. C.

ordinary pattern whose constants had also been determined. These
comparisons have shown that the wind velocities computed from the
ordinary anemometer average 10 per cent. higher than the wind ve-
locities given by the little anemometer having very small inertia, and
that the percentage of excess increased with decrease of wind velocity.
An anemometer was then tried whose cups were weighted, and still
greater percentages of excess were discovered. (Am. Meteor. Journal,
Wire ps LED:)

The wind force committee of the Royal Meteorological Society,
consisting of Mr. G@. M. Whipple and Mr. W. H. Dines, has made a
report on experiments with anemometers at Hersham. <A whirling ap-
paratus of 29 feetradius was rotated by means of asmall steam-engine.
On the arms of the whirler four different anemometers were placed ;
each experiment lasted fifteen minutes, the steam-pressure remaining
constant during therup, for the new standard anemometer with arms
2 feet long the experiments gave a mean value for Robinson’s factor
of 2.15, and for two smaller instruments the factor is 2.51 and 2.96. Mr.
Dines’ helicoid anemometer gave very satisfactory results, the mean
factor being 0.996. (Nature, Xxxvi, p. 191.)

Air pressure against moving plates.—The results of Recknagel’s ex-
periments on the resistance of the air to the motion of plates ona
whirling-machine agree in general with those of other experimenters.
He finds that the total resistance is greater the smailer the distance ot
the plate from the axis of rotation. The total resistance R which a
circular plate of diameter D experiences when rotated at a distance
ZI from the axis of rotation is from his experiments—

in which H represents the pressure due to the velocity, or Tq" A for-

mula is given for the distribution of pressure over the front of the
plate, and the diminution of pressure behind the plate is shown to de-
pend largely on its diameter. (Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, V1., p. 3.)

Mr. W. H. Dines has conducted a series of whirling-machine experi-
ments to determine the pressure on various shaped objects placed at
the end of the arm and whirling with different velocities. The machine
was operated by steam-power. ‘Che pressure upon a plane plate three-
eighths inch thick, and either round or square, was found to be 1.51
pounds per square foot for a velocity of 20.86 miles per hour. The
pressure upon the same area is increased by increasing the perimeter.
The pressure upon a one-quarter-foot plate the author states to be pro-
portionately less than upon a plate either one-half or double its size,
and the pressure upon any surface was found to be but slightly altered
by a cone projecting at the back. (Quar. Jour. Roy. Met. Soc., Xv,
p. 187.) .

Measurement of rain-fail—Prof. Cleveland Abbe has discussed at
length the seurces of error in the collection and measurement of rain-
fall. From a study of published observations of rain-fall measures at
different heights above ground he finds that the deficit in collection
equals 6 per cent. multiplied by the square root of the altitude in meters.
It is further shown that the error of collection may be eliminated by
observing two gauges at different altitudes and applying a formula of
reduction. (Am. Meteor. Journal, V1, p. 241.)

Errors in thermometer readings.— Messrs. W. A. Rogers and R. 8.
Woodward, in a paper on errors in reading mercurial thermometers, dis-
cussed an instrumental error hitherto generally overlooked. The theo-
retical study of Professor Woodward led to a dynamical equation ex-
pressing the motion of the end of the column in terms of its mass, the
volume and elasticity of the bulb, and the frictional and other forces,
including surface tension. When the latter forces are constant, and
when the rate of temperature rise is constant, the formula shows:
(1) That the motion of the end of the column is by pulsations ef regular
recurrence, the reading of the thermometer being alternately too great
and too small; (2) that the period of recurrence in the same thermom-
eter varies directly as the square root of the rate of temperature rise;
(3) that the amplitude is sensibly constant; (4) that, since the ampli-
tude is nearly constant and the period thus dependent on the rate of
the temperature rise, the danger of error in thermometer readings is
greater for slow than for rapid temperature changes. (heport Am.
Assoc. A. S., 1889.)

Method of obtaining daily mean temperatures.—Dr. W. Koéppen has
sought for the most accurate method of deriving the true daily mean
temperature from observations made at 8 A. M., 2 and 8 P. M., and the
minimum temperature. The author assumes, as recommended by the
Vienna Congress, that the true mean temperature m is given by the
formula m=n—k (n—min) where n is the arithmetical mean of the three
observed values, and k a constant to be determined. The author has
determined the value of k for different seasons at different places where
hourly temperatures have been recorded, and finds that in spring and
summer the value is almost the same at all stations. In a similar way
the author investigates the accuracy of the combination of the 8 A. M.,
2p.M.,and 8 p. M. without the minimum temperature. (J/eteorolo-
gische Zeitschrift, 1889, v1, p. [1].)

Reduction of air pressure to high levels.—As a supplement to his paper
on the construction of isobars for the level of 2,500 meters (JMeteo-
rologische Zeitschrift, December, 1888), Dr. Képpen gives the following
table of constants for obtaining the mean temperature of the air column,
or the temperature at 1,250 meters, by subtracting them from the sea-
level temperatures ;

Balloon observations.—Lieutenant Médebeck has made a contribution
to the meteorology of the upper currents by observations made in a
balloon voyage March 31, 1888, from Berlin. The marked phenomenon
experienced was the influence of rivers. After the balloon had risen to
a height of 300 to 500 meters, it sank so rapidly while passing over the
Spree that when it was about 50 meters above the earth a large quan-
tity of ballast had to be thrown out. At an elevation of 1,200 meters
he met with a long narrow rain-cloud, in passing through which the
dry-bulb thermometer registered 1°.5 C., the wet bulb 1° C.; at an
elevation of 1,300 to 1,400 meters both thermometers registered the
same temperature, 2°.5 ©. At this height, andin circumscribed areas,
afew very small semi-soft hailstones were observed.

Soaring of birds.—Mr. G. K. Gilbert, in a paper read before the Phil-
osophical Society of Washington, shows that the soaring of birds is ren-
dered possible by the differential motions of the air. The following
paragraphs are extracted from his paper :

“The soaring bird, with wings expanded, is formed so as to move
forward with little friction and downward with great friction. We
may conceive him as having two coincident motions—a forward motion,
juitiated by muscular action; and a downward motion, under the pull
of gravity. In order that the resultant may be horizontal, it is neces-
sary (1) that the forward component bedirected obliquely upward, and
(2) that it exceed a certain minimum amount.

‘“ However small may be the friction created by the forward motion
it is not nil, and, unless the energy it consumes is in some way re-
placed, the forward motion is eventually so reduced that the horizon-
tal motion cannot be maintained. It is proposed to show that the
needed compensatory energy may be derived from the differential
motions of the air.

‘* Let us assume that the air currents above and below a certain hor-
izontal plane have the same direction but different velocities, the upper
moving the faster by a certain amount, 7. A soaring bird is moving
through the lower air in the opposite direction, and the bird’s velocity
with reference to the air is V, then the velocity of the bird with refer-
ence to the upper current is V+i.

+
228 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

“Now let the bird change his course, turning obliquely upward and pass-
inginto theuppercurrent. His velocity with reference to the airin which
he isimmersed is at onceincreased from Vto V4+7. Next letthe bird wheel,
to the right or to the left, until the direction of his motion is coincident
with that ofthe wind. His velocity with reference tothe upper current is
still V + i, but the reversal of his direction has changed his relation to
the currents. He is passing the lower and slower current more rapidly
than he passes the upper, and his velocity with reference to the lower
current is greater by their difference; itis V + 2%. Now let him de-

scend obliquely and enter the lower current. His velocity is not af- -

fected by the transfer. Finally let him wheel in the lower current until
his direction is once more directly opposed to that of the wind. The
“eycle of evolutions leaves him with the velocity V + 2i, referred to the
lower current, in the place of his initial velocity V, referred to the same
datum. He has gained a velocity of 27, or double the velocity of one
air current referred to the other, and he has resumed his original rela-
tion to the currents. Manifestly he can repeat the process indefinitely.

“Add now that velocity thus gained is the required compensation
for the velocity lost by friction, and the essence of the theory is stated.”

When the orbit of the bird is circular and lies in an inclined plane
rising toward the wind, and when the horizontal velocity of the air di-
minishes uniformly from the highest point to the lowest point of the
orbit, the velocity gained by the bird in making the circuit is equal
to the differential velocity of the highest and lowest layers of air
traversed, multiplied by 5 into the cosine of the angle of inclination of
the plane of the orbit.

IV.—PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE OCEAN.

Height of the atmosphere.—M. Soret criticises the assumption made
by Liais in his method for determining the height of the atmosphere.
Liais found that the light of the sky is still polarized in a plane passing
through the sup when the sun is 18° below the horizon, and concluded
from this that the sun must have directly illuminated the air particles
in the zenith of the observer. Soret shows that by diffusion of the
second order a mass of air in the shade may be illuminated by the par-
ticles in the sunlight. Mathematical analysis shows that in this case
also, the light diffused by the mass in shade is polarized in the plane de-
termined by the point considered and the eye of the observer. Hence
the results of Liaisare subject to the error of his assumption. (Comptes
Rendus, Ci, p. 103.)

Specific volume of aqueous vapor.—Dr. Dieterici has presented to the
Physical Society of Berlin the results of his researches on the determina-
tion of the specific volume of saturated vapor at0°C. His new method is
to measure the amount of water that must be converted into vapor at
0° ©. in order to fill completely a known space with saturated vapor by
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 229

means of the heat which becomes latent during its evaporation. The
vessel containing the water was immersed in an ice calorimeter and was
connected with a large space, which could be rendered both vacuous
and dry. The water was then allowed to evaporate until the space was
filled with saturated vapor; the amount of heat requisite to produce
the observed evaporation was determined from the amount of mercury
which was expelled from the calorimeter, and this then gave the amount
of water evaporated. One outcome of the experiments is that Gay-
Lussae’s law holds good almost up to the temperature of saturation.
The mass of water that must be evaporated in order to saturate a
space of 1 liter capacity at 0° C. was found to be 4,886 milligrammes ;
heuce the specific volume of aqueous vapor saturated at 0° C. is 204.7
liters, and its pressure is 4.62 millimeters.

Spectrum of ozone.-—Mr. W. N. Hartley has examined the absorption
spectrum of ozone by photographing the ultra-violet rays transmitted
through measured quantities of the gas, and finds that it possesses
most extraordinary absorptive powers. Cornu’s experimental proof
that the ultra-violet rays of the sun are absorbed with energy by the
atmosphere is attributed by Hartley to the ozone which is a constituent
of the atmosphere, and which he states is in greater proportion in the
upper regions than near the earth’s surface.

The explanation that the blue color of the sky is caused by reflection
from minute particles which on account of their size most readily refiect
blue rays is rejected as incompetent, and a theory suggested by his
own experiments is presented. He announces that ozonized oxygen is
highly fluorescent. and that the color of the fluorescence is a beautiful
steel blue. Oxygen also is believed to be fluorescent, though this has
not been proved.

He concludes (1) that the extreme limit of the solar spectrum ob-
served by Cornu is caused by the gases in the atmosphere, probably
both by oxygen and ozone; (2) that the blue of the sky is caused in
part by fluorescence, and probably ozone and oxygen are the chief
fluorescent substances ; (5) that ozone is generally present in the air in
sufficient quantity to render its characteristic absorption spectra visi-
ble, and that therefore it gives a blue color to the atmosphere by ab-
sorption. (Nature, XXXIx, p. 475.)

Specific heat of sea water.—Messrs. Thoulet and Chevalier have pre-
sented to the Paris Academy of Sciences the results of a series of
measurements on the specific heat of sea water at different degrees of
dilution and concentration. The results are applied to explaining the
enormous influence exercised by the sea in modifying climates.

The law of thermal radiation.—-H. F. Weber derives for the total

radiation of a body the formula S= OFTY where C is a constant de-

pending on the natrre of the substance and the properties of its sur-
face, and a is a constant for all solids. J is the radiating surface and
230 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

T the absolute temperature. He believes that this formula will hold
good for all temperatures between the melting point of ice up to the
melting point of platinum, while Stefan’s law gives results too high
for low temperature and much too low for high temperatures.

Herr Graetz (Wiedemann’s Annalen, 1889, p. 857) criticises Weber's
claims, and maintains that Stefan’s formula has a much better basis
Iv, than this new formula. (Jeteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, V1, p. 38.)

Laws of thermal radiation.—In an article on the law of the thermal
radiation, Professor Ferrel has compared with observational data, both
Dulong and Petit’s law and Stefan’s law of radiation. He finds that
Dulong and Petit’s law holds through only a comparatively short range
of temperature, and the same is true of any function of the same general
form; but by giving different values to the constant in the formula
(taken by Dulong and Petit as 1.0077), increasing with lower tempera-
tures, the rate of cooling may be represented through a considerable
range of temperature. For temperatures from 50° C. to 137° C.
Stefan’s law agrees with the observed rates of cooling, but for higher
temperatures an exponent of 4.2 is required instead of 4.

Professor Ferrel then shows that the law of radiation for the result-
ant radiation of all wave lengths must differ very much in different
bodies in which the radiativities differ considerably from that of a sur-
face of maximum radiativity, according as the predominating wave
lengths in the radiations are toward the one or the other end of the
spectrum. The application of the various radiation formule in obtain-
ing the temperature of the sun is shown to give no reliable results.
(American Journal of Science, XXXVIII, p. 3.)

V.—SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERIC ABSORPTION; TEMPERATURE.

Solar radiation.—During the summer of 1888 a series of observations
of solar radiation were made on Mont Ventoux (altitude 1,907 meters)
with a continuously recording photographic Crova actinometer. The
following is a brief statement of results:

Continual oscillations are apparent in the solar curve, but with a
smaller amplitude than at Montpellier.

A regular midday depression of the curve takes place to the same
degree as at Montpeilier. This is due to the vertical ascent of vapor,
and not to the influence of the sea.

The solar constant, computed from the observations at Montpellier,
is nearly 3 calories, and it is believed that the registering apparatus
and the method when used at greater heights will give a value greater
than 3 ealories.

The polarization of the sky-light appears as a rule to be greater the
greater the solar constant and the smaller the diathermancy. Conse-
quently the degree of polarization may furnish useful indications for
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN i889. 231

judging the relative diathermancy. (Meteorologtsche Zeitschrift, 1889,
VI, p. 62.)

R. Ssawelief has made a series of solar radiation observations at
Kiew, extending through 1888. The instrument used was a Crova
actinometer. The yearly range of the intensity of solar radiation at
Kiew agrees with that at Montpeilier. The principal maximum, 1.59
calories, occurred on May 8; the principal minimum, 1.13 calories, at
the winter solstice (on account of the small altitude of the sun). Since
the values of the radiation are very nearly the same at Montpellier and
at Kiew, though the latter is 7 degrees farther north, it- follows that in
Russia the air has a materially greater diathermancy. The variations
of the diathermancy at Kiew are smaller than at Montpellier.

The value of the solar constant is computed from a series of forty-two
measures, nade on January 7, and found to be 2.86 calories. In obtain-
ing this result, the observations at midday were excluded because they
showed a smaller radiation than both before and after noon, resulting from
adiminished diathermancy. This large solar constant, which approaches
very nearly to Langley’s values, shows again the extraordinary purity
of the air in Russia on fine winter days. (Comptes Rendus, CVIII, p. 287.)

Actinometric observations made in 1888 at the Montpellier Observa-
tory are reported by M. A. Crova as confirming the results established
by previous observations, namely, that a primary maximum of intensity
always occurs in spring and a secondary maximum in autumn. (Na-
ture, XXXIX, p. 504.)

Dr. J. M. Pernter has discussed the solar radiation observations made
by Lephay at Cape Horn with a Pouillet pyr-heliometer, and despite the
fact that such a crude instrument was used, some valuable results are
derived. ;

A selection of the best observations, tabulated aecording to the
zenith distance of the sun, shows that the diathermancey of the atmos-
phere increases materially with the zenith distance of the sun. The
cause of this is attributed to the fact that rising air currents are most
frequent in summer and in the middle of the day, and that aqueous
vapor carried to great heights by these convective currents is condensed
in the upper air strata even on clear days when the amount of condensa-
tion is not sufficient to be visible. The average summer value of the
midday diathermancy is 0.55; the average winter value is 0.80. (Me-
teorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, v1, p. 130.)

Atmospheric absorption.—Dr. Angstrém has communicated to the
Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholin a contribution on the absorp-
tion of radiant heat through the various components of the atmosphere.

Distribution of heat over the earth’s surface.—Dr. Zenker has made
an elaborate research on the distribution of heat over the earth’s surface,
taking account not only of the radiation from the sun and absorption
of heat by the atmosphere, but also of the effect of the distribution of
¢

nas ys PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

land and water over the earth’s surface. In previous researches on the
distribution of heat, the mean values have been determined and based
upon empirical observations; but Dr. Zenker has calculated the distribu-
tion of heat over the surface of the sea with the help of Hann’s isothermal
charts, starting with the temperature of a point on its surface which
was quite uninfluenced by the neighboring continents, and was conse-
quently equally unaffected by any warm or cold current. Using this
factor, and the formule deduced in the theoretical part of his paper,
he has calculated the distribution of heat from the pole to the equator
for each successive parallel, and compared it with the distribution of
solar radiation. Asa basis for the distribution of heat over the surface
of the land, it was first necessary to determine the condition under which
the intluence of the neighboring sea is either nothing or minimal in
amount. The starting point for this was the fact that the temperatures
on the continents exhibit very great variations, and from these was
determined for each area, as a percentage, the relative influences of the -
sea and continent upon its temperature. The region where the influ-
ence of the sea was proved to be nil (or where the “ continentality ”
was 100 per cent.) was in the neighborhood of the east coast of Asia,
whereas all other points were found to be affected by the neighboring
sea to a greater extent. The observed temperature on the land was
therefore only partly dependent upon the position of the place on any
given parallel, other influences making themselves more or less felt.
Hence it was possible to calculate for each parallel the real and ‘ acces-
sory” temperature. The amount of heat radiated from the sun was
compared with these temperatures, and was found to be about the same
for each 10° C, of difference in temperature; from 0° to 10° C. however,
quite considerable differences in radiation were necessary. In conelu-
sion, Dr. Zenker compared the temperatures which really exist on the
earth’s surface with those which he had deduced, and found that in re-
ality the climate on the sea in the southern hemisphere is colder than it
should be according to caleulations—a result which must be attributed
to ocean currents of cold water. The continental climate in the north
ern hemisphere is slightly too warm, in consequence of the effect of the
Gulf Stream. (Nature, XXXVI, p. 48.)

Terrestrial temperature.—Mr. Arthur Searle in a paper entitled
‘‘Atmospheric economy of solar radiation,” discusses the manner in
which the assumed protective action of the atmosphere maintains ter-
restial temperatures. Since the supposed effect of selective absorption
whereby the atmosphere was supposed to be more diathermanous to solar
than to terrestrial radiation, has been largely disproved by Langley’s
experiments, the author points out that heat transferred from the earth
to the air by conduction and convection is not radiated into space with
the same facility as it would be if radiated directly from the earth’s sur-
face. The inerease of energy thus accumulated in the atmosphere is
checked by the development of atmospheric movements. Warm air is
. PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 233

transferred to cold regions where it is cooled by conduction of its heat
to the cold surface.
In comments on this paper Professor Ferrel accepts the fact of the
heating of the air by conduction and by convection as outlined by Mr.
Searle, but thinks that this circumstance can not have much effect in
modifying terrestrial temperature. “The whole amount of heat con-
veyed away from the earth’s surface in the form of latent heat, is per-
haps one-tenth of that received from the sun and absorbed, and so
radiated again into space. If this one-tenth part only has a little less
facility for escaping into space than it would have if radiated directly
from the earth’s surface, the protective effect can not be very much.”
In fact the primary assumption that the earth’s mean temperature
would be much lower than itis, if it were not protected in some way by
the atmosphere, is by no meanscertain. (Am. Meteor. Journal, V1, p. 173.)
Decrease of temperature with height.—Dr. Hann, in a discussion of the
results of observations on the Sonnblick, derives some important form-
ule expressing the decrease of temperature with height. For yearly
means he finds that thejtemperature at any elevation is represented by
the formula T=8°.0—0°.482h/— 0°.0018h”, in which h/ is the height of the
station above Salzburg (450 meters) expressed in hectometers. This
equation shows that the true mean temperature of the air column be-
tween the summit and base is 09.8 higher than the arithmetical mean of
the temperature at the summit and base—a result of great importance
in practical hypsometry. Tor the different seasons the formule for
decrease of temperature are as follows:
Winter : T= —2°.1 —0.186h’ —0.0111h”
Spring : T= 7.1 —0.537h’ —0.0011h/2
Summer: 77— 18.0 —0.637h’
Autumn: T= 9.7 —0.4338h’ —0.0031h”
(Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, V1, p. 33.)
Mr. 8S. A. Hill has conducted an extended series of observations of
temperature and humidity at different heights above ground at Allaha-
bad, and the results are published in Vol. Iv, Part v1, Indian Meteoro-
logical Memoirs (see Bibliography). From observations at heights of
4, 46, 104, and 166 feet, the daily range of temperature was found to
diminish with altitude at a rate represented by the formula
log. r =1.324 —0.118h +0.025h?
in which h is given in hundreds of feet. The formula can be extended
scarcely 100 feet beyond the observed values. Normal hourly temper-
atures for each month of the year are given for each of the four eleva
tions, and from these the temperatures for altitudes of every 20 feet up
to 200 feet are given for 6 A. M., 2 P. M., and 10 Pp. M. for each month and
the year. The results of the observations are also graphically repre-
sented by contours giving for every 5° the variations of temperature in
the diurnal period at different heights. Thirteen such sets of isother-
mal contours give the means for each month and the year. The obser-
vations of vapor pressure show a minimum from 3 to 4 P.M., followed by
234 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN i889. .

a rapid increase; in the months from November to February a maximum
is reached at 7 Pp. M., while from March to May the maximum occurs at
about 7 A. M.; but the curve from 8 P. M. to7 A. M. is high and has but
little rise. From June to October there are two maxima, one at 8 A.
M., the other at 8 P. M.

Periodicity of temperature.—In the treatment of the mean daily tem-
perature curves at polar stations, Prof. H. Fritz has perceived aregular
sequence in the maxima that seems to him to be not purely accidental.
By placing together the maxima at Jan-Mayen, Godthaab, Fort Rae,
Uglamie, Vivi on the Congo, and Zurich, he has derived a 13.84-day
period, or better, the half of a 27.687-day period. This agrees almost
exactly with the period of sunspots and auroras (see Fritz; Das Polar-
licht, p. 206), as well as with the period found by Buys Ballot from the
temperatures at Zwanenburg, Harlem, and Danzig.

For further proof of the reality of this period, the observations of
Kane in Smith’s Sound, of the second German North Polar expedition
to Sabine Island, and of other arctic observers are reduced to the same
period and compared with the maximum of sunspots. These data also
show an agreement.

Temperature anomaly —Dr. Hellmann calls attention to the long-con-
tinued temperature anomaly which has prevailed over Germany and
other neighboring countries of western Kurope from the beginning of
1885 to the present time (April, 1889). By means of graphic charts of
monthly temperature he shows that the temperature in western
Germany has for the most part lagged behind the normal. In Loningen,
of the fifty-one months from January, 1885, to March, 1889, 71 per
cent. have been too cold. Previous cold periods have occurred in the
years 1835~38 and 178487. (Meteorologische Zeitschrift, VI, p. 275.)

Secular variation of temperature.—Mr. William Ellis has tabulated
and discussed the temperature observations made in England from
1849 to 1888 with the following results :

periods from the forty-year average at stations

VI.—ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE; CONDENSATION, FOGS, HAZE, AND
CLOUDS; RAIN, SNOW, HAIL, AND FLOOD.

Amount of water in cloud.—Dr. J. Hann has put together the obser-
vations on the amount of moisture contained in a given volume of cloud
at different temperatures. In the experiments made by A. and H.
Schlaginweit in 1851, the amount of moisture in the water particles in a
cloud was in every case less than the uncondensed vapor in the same
volume. (Meteorologische Zeitschrift, V1, p. 304.)

London fog.—tIn an address on the relation of smoke to fogs in Lon-
don, Mr. F. A. R. Russell shows that the characteristic London fogs
are produced by the mechanical combination of particles of water with
particles of coal or soot. The conditions of their development are a still
air, lower temperature near the ground than ata height of some hun-
dreds of feet, high relative humidity, a cloudless sky, and free radiation
into space.

The darkness and peculiar coloring occur with greatest effect when a
very large quantity of coal is being burnt in domestic fires, hence 8 to
10 A. M. of the winter season is the time of thickest and darkest fogs.
The fogs are formed by the mixture of soot and smoke with an
already existing white fog. <A thick layer of these carbonaceous par-
ticles prevents the sunshine from reaching and evaporating the particles
of naturalfog. Thus the fog is blackened and its dissipation is retarded.
The author estimates that the loss from all sources due to this wasteful
method of burning coal is for London alone about £5,000,000 a year.
(Nature, XXX1X, p. 34.) .

Haze.—Mr. Russell has made an elaborate analysis of the causes and
character of haze, of which the following is a partial summary:

Unlike fog, haze commonly occurs when the lower air is in a state of
unusual dryness. Haze does not prevail on the Continent of Europe or
in the interior of North America to anything like the same extent as in
England. On the east coast of Scotland, and over all north Britain,
if is exceedingly common, especially in the spring, and during the prev-
alence of east wind. The conditions favorable for the production of
haze are: (1) A gentle wind from east-southeast to northeast, inclusive,
and east wind in general, especially with dry weather in spring and
summer. If the east wind be established up to a great height, the
lower air is usually clear, but if the upper current is from a westerly
direction, haze prevails. (2) Fine settled weather, with variable cur-
rents, a dry air, and little dew. (3) Opposition of currents—such as
occurs when several shallow barometric depressions exist over the coun-
try—and the atmospheric state preceding thunder-storms. (4) Damp
weather, with light winds and varying temperature.

The very condition to which haze in England is commonly, and in a
certain sense correctly, attributed—namely, atmospheric humidity—is,
236 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN i889.

if sufficiently uniform and extended, least favorable to its manifestation.
A constant moisture-laden westerly breeze would give a climate nearly
as clear as that of the southwest corner of France.

Two principal factors go to the production of ordinary haze; the first,
a rather large amount of vapor between the earth and a great altitude,
say 60,000 feet; and the second, a mixture of two heterogeneous masses
of air. Evidence of the correctness of this proposition is to be found
in the geographical distribution of haze and the state of the winds
when it occurs.

In the majority of cases of east wind, and especially when this wind
is of brief duration, local or gentle, a westerly wind flows above it at
no great distance from the surface of the earth. Considering the per-
petual rapid interchanges (hardly to be called diffusion) going on in the
atmosphere, the lower wind must be largely mixed with air of a differ-
ent condition derived: from the westerly current. If a@ cold, dry east
wind be permeated by patches and filaments, however minute, of moister
and warmer air, they must be cooled by contact with the polar wind,
and a slight deposition of vapor may take place. Or the countless in-
visible dust particles may, by increased radiation towards space through
a drier air, either cause a deposition of moisture upon themselves or
collect still smaller particles together, as dust is known to collect on
cold surfaces in a warm air. If deposition of moisture take place, the
dryness of the air prevents the water particles from growing to any-
thing like the size of the particles of a fog; a relatively small diffused
quantity of vaporous air in minute parcels conld not produce by con-
densation any but extremely small and transitory water particles, in
the aggregate visible through long distances, but probably individually
beyond the power of the miscroscope to discern. They may be com-
pared to the blue mist escaping from the safty-valve of a boiler under
high pressure, the invisible steam turns for a moment blue and then to
the ordinary white of visible steam. The haze may possibly be equally
momentary in duration, disolving long before reaching the white stage,
but fresh filaments are perpetually keeping up the process and giving
the appearance of a persistence like that of smoke or dust.

The evidence concerning the appearance of haze by irregular trans-
mission of light due to unequally heated currents of transparent air
seems to be quite insufficient, and however great the heat near the sur-
face of the ground, say in the desert, with consequent distortion of
images, it does not, as a rule, bring about the haze so common in tem-
perate climates. (Nature, Xt, p. 60.)

In a communication in Nature, Mr. J. H. Poynting suggests that com-
mon summer haze may be due to local convection currents, which by
reason of their difference of temperature and density render the air op-
tically heterogeneous. The light received from any object is more or
less irregularly refracted, and on account of the motion of the currents
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. Zot

its path is continually varying. The outline of the object has a tremu-
lous motion, and so becomes ill defined. At the same time reflection
occurs where there is refraction at the surfaces of separation of hetero-
geneous portions, and the reflected light is diffused as a general glare.
The combination of the quivering of outline and the loss of direct light,
as a diffused glare, may possibly give the appearance called haze which
is seen in the middle of a hot, cloudless, summer day. The author
mentions other cases of haze which may possibly be likewise due to op-
tical heterogeneity. (Nature, XXXIx, p. 323.)

In a series of letters to Nature by a number of prominent scientists,
a valuable contribution has been made to our knowledge of the peculiar
characteristics of different types of haze. Professor Tyndall opened
the subject by reporting his observations of the prevalence in the val-
leys of the Alps of a fine haze appearing as long horizontal strice.
Amid the haze were often patches of cloud which disappeared under the
sun’s rays, leaving the permanent haze behind. From this fact he is
certain the haze is not aqueous, and suggests that it may be due to
autumn pollen in the air.

Mr. Johnston-Lavis corroborates the observation that haze assumes
the form of horizontal strata, and supports the theory of its micro-
organic nature. During the hottest and driest weather of summer,
haze similar to that observed by Professor Tyndall in the Alps can be
seen in the Gulf of Naples and other parts of the Mediterranean coasts
at an average altituce of 1,500 feet and rarely reaching 2,000 feet.

M. @’Abbadie furnishes a valuable list of special names by which.
such haze is designated in many warm countries, where it is most fre-
quently observed. In Ethiopia, where it is called qobar, this haze is of
extraordinary density and hides all the features of the landscape be-
yond the distance of a mile, and conceals stars of the third magnitude
even in the zenith. Observations of its occurrence are quoted from
Peru, Hayti, Switzerland, Spain, and other localities; its color is a hight
buff, and when dense, a “lurid gray, verging to blackness.”

W. Clement Ley reports that the horizontal layers of haze may be
frequently seen throughout the British Isles at times when the atmos-
phere at the eartl’s surface is nearly calm and moderately dry. He
has given it the specific name of dust-haze, and distinguishes it from
the ordinary water haze by its color; dust-haze appears of a reddish
buff tint, while water haze usually appears gray or blue in reflected
light, and yellow, orange, or red in transmitted light.

Classification of clouds.—Prof. H, H. Hildebransson has submitted to
the Meteorological Congress at Paris (September, 1889) a report on
the classification of clouds, adopted by Mr. Abercromby and himself,
and urges its general adoption. This classification distinguishes ten
forms, as follows:

1. Cirrus. 2. Cirro-stratus, a thin cloud veil composed of thickly
compagted cirrus fibres, indicative of rain, 3, Cirro-cumulus, small
238 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

globular cloudlets, commonly called mackerel sky. 4. Cumulo-cirrus
or alto-cumulus, a form intermediate between cirro-cumulus and strato-
cumulus, of a large globular form like white wool packs. 5. Strato-
cirrus or alto-stratus, a thick gray or bluish layer of cloud at an aver-
age elevation of 17,000 feet. 6. Strato-cumulus, large rounded masses
of gray cloud, sometimes called roll-eumulus. 7. Nimbus. 8. Cumu-
lus. 9. Cumulo-nimbus, the thunder cloud. 10. Stratus, an elevated
sheet of mist or fog.

In order that the exact forms of cloud to which the names apply may
be learned and the names be properly used, the author calls attention
to the photographs in his Classification des nwages, aud also recom-
mends the new cloud-atlas, published by Gustav Seitz Nachfolger, of
Hamburg.

Results of rain, river, and evaporation observations made in New South
Wales during 1888, by H. C. Russell.—This volume contains a most val-
uable collection of meteorological and hydrographic data, tabulated,
charted, and discussed. The rain-fall from eight hundred and seventy
stations is given for each month and the year, together with the great-
est daily rain-fall in each month, the mean annual, and the number of
years of observation. The mean annual precipitation ranges in differ-
ent districts from 10 to 68 inches. The year 1888 is the driest upon
record, and in striking contrast with 1887, the wettest on record. The
rain-fall for the year is charted on a large scale map by red circles at
each station of observation. The monthly distribution of rain is shown
for each square degree by twelve blocks proportional in length to
the monthly amount. <A third diagram shows the stage of the rivers
above mean summer level. Tables of average daily evaporation for
each month are given for nine stations. These show a range of 36

to 65 inches in the total evaporation for the year. Comparative obser-

vations on the amount of evaporation from water, grass, and earth sur-
face show that when the soil is saturated the evaporation proceeds at
a rate greater than from a water surface. The value of these observa-
tions would have been increased if surface temperatures had been
taken.

For the Murray River the annual discharge ranges from 20 to 40 per
cent. of the rain-fall over its catchment area, while for the Darling the
discharge is in general less than 3 per cent. of its rain-fall.

Rain-fall of India.—Parts ri and 1v, vol. 111, Indian Meteorological
Memoirs, published in 1888, bring to a close Blanford’s great monograph
on the rain-fall of India. Part 11 treats of the variability of the rain-
fall, and is summarized in Part ur. As a rule stations having the
smallest average rain-fall are those at which the variability of rain-fall
is greatest; this is specially true of stations situated in dry plains or
table lands which yield but little local evaporation, and where the winds
from opposite quarters are strongly contrasted in point of dryness and
dampness.
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 239

In a brief discussion of the relations of forests to rain-fall, three cases
are adduced all of which confirm the view that the forests have increased
the rain-fall, but the evidence is stated to be in no case absolutely con-
clusive.

The remaining portion of the memoir is occupied with the considera-
tion of the questions as to whether any laws of coincidence or sequence
can be derived; whether certain regions are, as arule, subject simultane-
ously to similar or alternative conditions, whether any physical connee-
tion can be traced between abnormal meteorological conditions in ¢
given region and the excess or deficiency of rain-fall there or elsewhere,
and whether there are valid reasons for believing that the rain-fall of
India is subject to any periodic law.

Diurnal period of rain-fall at Caleutta.—Mr. H. F. Blanford has found
the following times of maximum and minimum in the daily period of
rain at Calcutta. In the cold season (November to February) the prin-
cipal minimum occurs at noonday, the maximum from 6 to 9 P. M.; in the
hot season (March to May) there is only one well defined maximum and
minimum, the former falling from 6 to 8 P. M., the latter between sunrise
and 11 A. mM. In the rainy season the principal maximum occurs from
2to4Pp.M., and the principal minimum a little before 11 A.M. The
daily period in the amount of rain agrees, in general, with the period
of rain frequency. (Indian Meteor. Memoirs, Iv, pp. 39-46.)

Diurnal period of rain-fall.—Dr. Hellmann has reported to the German
Meteorological Society some of the results of his investigations upon
the daily period of precipitation. He shows that the different curves
may be reduced to types which are characteristic of certain localities
and seasons. ‘The afternoon maximum prominent in many places may
be shown to rise naturally from the daily period of thunder-storms,
whilst the equally widely extended nocturnal maximum, which is es-
pecially prominent in winter, and in all seasons on the west coast of
Europe, appears to be connected with certain peculiarities in the daily
period of air pressure, temperature, and wind velocity. (Jleteorolo-
gische Zeitschrift, 1889, V1, p. 271.)

Diurnal periodicity of rain-fall at Hong IKkong.—In the rainy season,
from June to August, the diurnal variation is most strongly marked.
The rain curves then run from a forenoon maximum at 9 A. M. to an
evening minimum at 11 p.M. From March to May, the principal maxi-
mum falls at noon and the principal minimum at 7 P.M. In autumn
and winter the diurnal curve is quite irregular. (Ibid., p. 350.)

Daily period of rain-fall at Vienna.—The general results of the self-
recording rain-fall observations for seven years at Vienna have been
worked out by Hann. When given in groups of two months each no
regular diurnal period is manifest, but in the total of seven months
from April to October a periodicity is clearly expressed. The princi-
pal maximum of both frequency and quantity of rain occurs at the hour
240 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

between 8 and 9 p.M. Hours of minimum amounts of rain-fall are 4
to5 A.M. and 11 A.M. to noon. For the results of the spring, summer,
and autumn months, which by themselves are somewhat irregular, a
periodic formula of two terms is computed, and from examination of
the computed results the essential periodicity of the various groups is
discoverable. For all three seasons the minimum of rain-fall is between
9 A.M, and noon, the maximum in spring falls from 10 to 11 P. M., that
in summer from 7 to 8 P. M., and in autumn from 2 to 3 A. M., with a
secondary maximum from 8 to 9 Pp. M. - The late hour of the maximum
is in contrast with the general assumption that it occurs in the early
afternoon.

Secular variation of rain-fall.—Professor. Frank Waldo gives three
tables containing the mean residuals of five-year periods from the mean
rain-fall. The first is taken from Dr. Wild’s ‘“‘ Regen Verhaltnisse des
Rus. Reiches;” the second is from Dr. Lang’s article, “Der saculare
Verlauf der Wetterung als Ursache der Gletcherschwankungen in den
Alpen,” and the third is compiled from American observations. The
writer finds evidence in these tables of a long-period inequality having
the following periods:

The maximum at one station is often found to occur at the time of a
minimum at another.* (Am. Meteor. Journal, v, p. 412.)

Causes of rain.—Professor von Bezold, in a paper before the Berlin
Meteorological Society, discussed the manner of formation of precipita-
tion. The mixing of warm moist air with cold air by which the tempera-
ture falls to the mean of the two can but seldom produce an appreciable
precipitation. Precipitation occurs only when a mass of moist air is
directly cooled, as in nature, chiefly by radiation and ascension. Clouds
are most dense in the center of a cyclone where the pressure is a mini-
mum, and are progressively less dense toward the periphery.

Mr. H. F. Blanford, in a letter to Nature, discusses the humid climate
that fosters the rank exuberance of the Aruwhimi forests traversed by
Stanley’s expedition. He believes the excessive rain-fall is due to the
equatorial position of the Aruwhimi basin where ascending convection
currents prevail on a gigantic scale. By dynamic cooling these currents

«This is different from the result derived by Dr. E. Briickner. (Ante, pp. 217, 218.)
Gabi:
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 241

part with nearly the whole of their vapor in the act of ascending and
so do not carry away to other regions the water evaporated from the
surface; the same water is evaporated and precipitated again and
again, and the only loss of water to be supplied by outside winds is
that carried off by river drainage, probably less than half of the rain-fall.
“As the result of a long study of the rain-fall of India, I have become
convinced that dynamic cooling, if not the sole cause of rain, is at all
events the only cause of any importance, and that all the other causes
so frequently appealed to, such as the intermingling of warm and cold
air, contact with cold mountain slopes, ete., are either inoperative or
relatively insignificant.” (Nature, XXXIX, p. 583.)

Accuracy in measuring rain-fall.—F rom a long series of rain-fall obser-
vations Dr. A. Riggenbach draws the following important conclusions
as to the accuracy attainable :

(1) The irregularity in the areal distribution of rain-fall is so great
that the amounts collected in neighboring gauges, similarly exposed,
differ on the average by 0.8™™ and in extreme cases by 5™™. Add to this
0.2™" for instrumental errors, and it will be seen that an accuracy of
0.5" is sufficient in the individual daily readings.

(2) In counting the days of precipitation the minimum amount of
precipitation considered should not be under 0.5™™,

(3) In monthly totals, fractions of a millimeter have no meaning.

(4) Yearly totals which agree to 0,5°™ are to be treated as identical.
(Meteor. Zeitschrift, 1889, V1, p. 156.)

Hailstones, structure of.—Mr. E. EK. Robinson gives the accompanying
diagram of the cross-section of a hailstone measuring 2.9 centimeters in
diameter. The center was circular and consisted of opaque ice, about
the size of an ordinary hailstone; this was surrounded by a circle of
almost perfectly clear ice, this again by a circle of opaque ice, and this
once more was surrounded by almost clear ice, but with fine circular
lines in it, and bounded by a frilled outline of opaque ice, which imi-
tated in shape the spheroidal state of a drop of
water. Outside this again was a thick layer of
clear ice of crystalline form. The diagramisdrawn
natural size, the dark spots representing white
opaque ice. Other large stones showed the same
construction. Mr. C. D. Holt, in examining hail-
stones, has detected a metallic taste and also a
flavor of ozone. All the stones showed an air-
bubble at the center. (Nature, xu, p. 151.)

Floods in the middle Atlantic States from May 31 to June 8, 1889.—The
following description of unprecedented rains and floods is collated from
articles by Prof. T. Russell, of the Signal Service, and Prof. Lorin
Blodgett, of Philadelphia, in the Monthly Weather Review for May and
June:

A general storm, central in the Ohio valley on the 30th, passed slowly
eastward over the Alleghanies ip Virginia, where it remained until the
evening of the 31st. Its slow movement was attended by conditions
favorable to continued heavy rains,—east and southeast winds along the
coast, high temperature, and dense saturation. As this saturated con-
dition reached the higher ridges of the Alleghanies it developed the
most excessive rain-fall of the century for so large an area, depositing a
uniform sheet of from 6 to 8 inches of rain-fall during a continuous
storm of from twenty-four to fifty-six hours’ duration. This rain-fall
was in sheets or masses rather than in drops, being described as “ cloud-
bursts” by observers in localities from Pennsylvania to Virginia. The
intensity of the barometric depression was not large, but on the other
hand rather small. At Pittsburgh the fall of the barometer was about
one-fourth of an inch only, and the lowest isobars were 29.7 on the 30th
and 29.8 on the 31st.

A table is given containing all the rain-fall observations made in the
middle Atlantic States during the period of heavy rains, and approxi-
mate isohyetal lines are presented on charts. The times of beginning of
rain are not very accordant, but the observations indicate that the prog-
ress of rain was from the coast inland, and from the south toward the
north. The greatest rain-fall was in the northeast quadrant of the bar-
ometric depression, where there was a steep temperature gradient, the
temperature increasing from 40° in the lake region to 70° on the Atlan-
tic coast.

The floods resulting from these rains extended from southern New York
over Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the Virginias, were unprecedented in
height, and the most destructive ever occurring in the United States.
A detailed statement of the enormous loss of life and property in the
flooded region would require more space than is here available. Cities
were inundated, bridges swept away, canals washed out, harbor im-
provements damaged, and millions of dollars worth of property de-
stroyed. As a culmination of these disasters, the dam on the South
Fork above Johnstown, Pennsylvania, gave way, and the immense body
of water in the reservoir swept down upon that city and adjoining vil-
lages, causing the loss of nine thousand lives and thirty million dollars’
worth of property.

VII.—WINDS AND OCEAN CURRENTS; GENERAL ATMOSPHERIC CIRCU-
LATION.

The Helm wind.—Mr. W. Marriott has presented to the Royal Meteor-
ological Society a report on the Helm-wind—a wind peculiar to the
Cross Fell Range of mountains in Cumberland. This range is high,
and runs from north-northwest to south-southeast without being cut
through by any valley. From the top of the mountains to the plain
on the west there is an abrupt fall of from 1,000 to 1,500 feet in a mile
and a half. At times, when the wind is from some easterly point, the
—

PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 243

Helm forms over the district, the chief features of the phenomenon
being the following: A heavy bank of cloud rests along the Cross Fell
range, at times reaching some distance down the western slapes, while
at a distance of 2 or 5 miles from the foot of the Fella slender roll of dark
cloud appears in mid-air and parallel with the Helm cloud ; this is the
Helm bar. The space between the Helm cloud and the bar is usually
quite clear, while to the westward the sky is at times completely covered
with cloud. A cold wind rushes down the side of the Fell and blows
violently till it reaches a spot nearly underneath the Helm bar, when
it snddenly ceases. The Helm wind was observed sixty-three times in
1886, and nineteen times in 1887. (Nature, XXXIX, p. 431.)

Wind velocity in the United States.—Mr. F. Waldo, in an extended
paper on the distribution of wind velocity in the United States, divides
the signal service stations into typical groups, and plots the annual
march of wind velocities for each group. The relation of wind velocity
to areas of low pressure and the variation with altitude are discussed,
and charts are given showing the January, July, and annual distribu-
tion. (Am. Meteor. Journal, VI, pp. 219, 300, 368.)

Sea-breeze.—Prof. W. M. Davis has made a report to the New England
Meteorological Society, giving the results of special observations of
the sea-breeze at one hundred stations, chiefly in Massachusetts.

The general theory that the sea-breeze is caused by the difference of
temperature between the land and water requires the breeze to begin
at the shore and to extend its area seaward, while observation shows
that the breeze begins out at sea and works its way in-shore. It may
be explained by supposing that the circulation of air is not established,
but in process of establishment, and that the quick morning expansion
of the land air causes a reverse gradient at the shore line, turning the
surface winds toward the sea. This gradient disappears as the expan-
sion of the air causes an upper outflow, and then the inland progress of
the sea-breeze is effected. There should in this case be a difference of
barometrie pressure at land and sea stations, and such observations of
pressure and temperature have been made by Blanford in India.

The depth of sea-breeze was determined by balloon observations at
Coney Island to be between 300 and 400 feet. (Am. Meteor, Journal,
VI, p 4.)

Ocean currents.—Prince Albert of Monaco has presented to the Paris
Academy of Sciences a paper on the surface currents of the North
Atlantic. Of 1,675 floats cast into the sea from the Hirondelle, 146 have
already been recovered at various points. These apparently demon-
strate a circular movement of the surface waters round a point situated
somewhere to the southwest of the Azores. The outer edge of this
current sets east-northeast to the neighborhood of the English Channel,
where it is deflected southward along the coasts of Europe to the Cana-
ries, thence trending southeast to the equatorial current, thus com.
pleting the circuit by merging in the Gulf Stream. (Nature, XL, p.
167.)
244 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

General circulation of the atmosphere.—M. Moller contributes an arti-
cle to Aus dem Archiv der Deutschen Seewarte on the circulation of the
atmosphere between the equator and the poles. The results arrived at
differ from those of Professor Ferrel, especially with regard to the force
of westerly winds in latitude 38° in the lower and upper strata.

M. Weyher has instituted a most interesting series of experiments
designed to illustrate the cyclonic phenomena of the atmosphere, espe-
cially tornadoes, water-spouts, and dust whirls, and has found that his
results agree in every point with those deduced from the mathematical
theory of their movement. In one of his first experiments M, Weyher
shows the analogy between water eddies and air whirls. In the water
eddy the source of action must be at some distance below the surface,
while in the air whirls the source of action must be located in the wpper
part of the air column, and the motion is communicated downwards.
The most interesting of his experiments are those in which he artifi-
cially produces the phenomena of the water-spout. By meansof a rotating
tourniquet placed over cold water, an aerial eddy is caused which draws
up the water, in the form of a spout composed of drops, to a considerable
height; but when the water is heated, a clearly defined condensed vapor-
spout makes its appearance. With from fifteen hundred to two thousand
rotations per minute the vapor from the heated water is found to con
dense itself into a visible sheet enveloping a clearly defined and rarefied-
central nucleus, conical, and tapering downwards. Besides this vapor-
spout, water drops are carried up as in natural water-spouts until they
are thrown out beyond the influence of the upward current; the press-
ure and temperature conditions in different parts of the area are also
investigated by means of amanometer. It was found that the rarefac-
tion at the center of the tourniquet is transmitted almost unaltered in
intensity to the center of the whirl on the surface, while the thermome-
ter at the same time at first shows a fall and then arise of temperature,
the latter evidently due to the friction of the rapidly moving air against
the surface.

The analogous phenomena of a cyclone are very fairly imitated by an
apparatus consisting of a large tourniquet placed over a table covered
with a number of pins mounted with movable threads of wool; the
tourniquet is mounted so as to be capable of translation as well as rota-
tion, and changes of pressure are registered by a manometer which
connects with a hole in the surface of the table by means of a rubber
tube. On rotating the tourniquet and giving it a forward motion, the
directions and positions of the threads shew both the horizontal and
vertical Components of the winds thus produced, including the region
of caln in the center as well as the outward and downward motion at
the anti-cyclonic border, The variations of pressure, when pointed
out, show a curve similar to that in a symmetrical cyclone.

Hail is explained as being caused by vapor drawn up into the center
of a cyclonic system, and is essentially similar to the explanation given
by Ferrel and Moller. These experiments do not of course fulfill all
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 245

the conditions which prevail in nature, since, in that case, the rotation
is doubtless kept up by the upward movement along the axis and the
consequent aspiration of the surrounding air into the area of gyration,
but in general the analogy seems quite complete. (Nature, XXXVIII,
p. 104.)

Mr. Ralph Abercromby has made special observations on the upper
wind currents over the equator in the Atlantic Ocean. In December
(1888) the northeast and southeast trades both turned into a commen,
light-surface, easterly current along the line of the doldrums; low clouds
from southeast drove over the northeast trade up to 15° north, and from
300 miles south of the equator, a very high current from northwest pre-
vailed over the southeast trade. From the equator southward 300 niles,
no high observations were obtained. In May a somewhat different
system prevailed. The northeast trade turned to north as it approached
the doldrums, instead of towards the east, asin December. In the calm
belt, it met a light, easterly current without producing much rain;
while further south the regular southeast trade was experienced as tar
south as 8° south, when the northeast monsoon prevailed along the
Brazilian coast nearly down to Rio Janeiro. No southeast wind could
be discovered at any level over the northeast trade.

These observations are held to confirm in a striking manner his pre-
vious discovery ‘*‘ that the highest air current over the equatorial dol-
drums is from the eastward, lying between the southwest current which
flows on one side over the northeast trade, and the northwest current
which flows on the other side over the southeast trade.”

With respect to the general circulation of the atmosphere we know
that the surface trades either die out at the doldrums or unite into one
moderate east current; that the low and middle currents over the dol-
drums are very variable, but that the winds at these low and middle
levels, 2,000 to 20,000 feet, come usually from the southeast over the
northeast trade, and from the northeast over the southeast trade, and
that the highest currents—over 20,000 feet—move from east over the
doldrums, from southwest over the northeast trade, and from northwest
over the southeast trade.

What we do not know is the relation of the southeast low and middle
current over the northeast trade to the southeast trade on the other
side of the equator, nor do we yet know what becomes of this middle
current in the northern hemisphere.

The simple scheme which assumes nothing but an upward current over
the doldrums, and a return current toward each pole is not confirmed by
observations. There is always a regular vertical succession of the upper
currents as we ascend according to the hemisphere. (Nature, XL, p. 297.)

Thermo-dynamics of the atmosphere.—Dr. W. von Bezold has continued
his contribution upon the thermo dynamics of the atmosphere in the
Sitsungsberichte of the Berlin Academy. The whole series of papers ~
are being prepared by Professor Abbe for publication in this Report.

Mittel und Differenzen, sowie deren mehrjihrige Periode, von J. Hann,
Wien, 1887. This volume is ‘Band 11, Heft 2,” of the Geographische
Abhandlungen, published by Prof. Dr. A. Penck. It is divided into
the following sections: Introduction. Chapter 1. On the methods for
obtaining comparable mean air pressures and for drawing correct iso-
bars. wu. Monthly and annual isobars of central and southern Europe.
11. Annual period in the air pressure relations of Hurope. Iv. Con-
nection between the air pressure anomalies of Europe and the tem-
perature anomalies in central Europe. v. The mean and absolute
variability of the monthly and annual means of air pressure. VI. The
probable error of the thirty-year mean air pressure. Vil. The variabil-
ity of the differences of the mean air pressure of two places. VIII. Re-
duction to the normal period of 1851-1880. 1x. Reduction of the mean
air pressures to the same level. x. Many year period of the air pressure.

The three plates at the end of the volume contain the isobars for each
month and the year reduced to sea-level, and for January, May, July,
October, and the year reduced to 500 meters elevation. The annual
period of air pressure in various portions of Kurope is presented by dia-
grains. The curves are quite irregular, showing the phases from conti-
nental to oceanic climates. Therelation between the temperature and
air pressure deviations for the seasons is investigated by Professor
Hann. One conclusion reached is that ‘in all eases of very warm
winter in central Europe the air pressure in the northwest over the
Atlantic Ocean was too low; if central Europe alone be considered,
very cold winters occur just as frequently by high as by low pressure.”
The following table shows approximately the dependence on the lati-
tude of the average variability of the monthly and annual air pressures :

Effect of lunar attraction on the atmosphere.—Professor Bornstein, of
Berlin, has taken up the question of the effect of the moon’s attraction
on the atmosphere. At Singapore, Melbourne, St. Helena, and Batavia
observers have succeeded in establishing a daily variation in the baro-
meiric pressure dependent upon the moon, and having two maxima and

two minima, with an amplitude varying from 0.079 to 0.2 millimeters.
But opposed to these are the observations of Laplace on the variations
of the barometer at Paris, as also of Kreil in Prague, and Bessel’s
observations on atmosphere refraction. <AJl these last-named observers
found that the action of the moon on the earth’s atmosphere is either
nil, or else the reverse of that described. Professor Bornstein then
discussed the question whether any ebb or flow of the atmosphere could
possibly be detected by the means at our disposal, and showed that the
mercurial barometer can never give indications of such action, since it
is itself affected by the alterations of gravity that are due to the vary-
ing position of the moon. He explained the phenomena observed at
the four stations mentioned above as due to the fact that they are
situated on the sea-coast at places on the earth’s surface where the ebb
and flow of the sea is very considerable. The barometric effect is,
then, a secondary one, due to the changing position of the sea-level.
(Nature, XXxtx, p. 600.)

Charts of barometric pressure.—The Meteorological Council have pub-
lished charts showing the mean barometric pressure over the Atlantic,
Indian, and Pacific Oceans. These are issued in the form of an atlas,
and give in a very complete manner the barometric means and rain
over all oceans. Separate charts are given for February, May, August,
and November, which are selected to represent the characteristic dis-
tribution of pressure for the respective seasons. The number of observa-
tions used in the preparation of the charts is, for the Atlantic Ocean,
539,300; Indian Ocean, 163,000; Pacific Ocean, 88,300. The baro-
metric means are given for areas of 5 degrees of latitude by 5 degrees
of longitude in large figures, and in smaller figures are given the mean
for areas of 2 degrees in latitude and longitude, the several means being
obtained from the daily averages; the isobars are given for each tenth
of an inch. The general charts which give the isobars of the globe
show very clearly the prevalence of high pressure areas in each ocean
in each of the four seasons; it is seen that these areas oscillate in posi-
tion and alter somewhat in intensity with the seasons, but there are
many characteristics in common. The Northern Indian Ocean, which
is much more surrounded by land, is however an exception, the high
pressure being situated over the northern part of the ocean in Novem-
ber and February and decreasing southwards, whilst in May and August
the pressure is lowest in the north and increases southwards, this change
being closely related to the monsoon winds. These charts are consid-
erably in advance of any previous work of a similar nature, and will
materially aid in explaining the general circulation of the wind over
the globe. (Nature, XXXVIII, p. 196.)

Diurnal variation of the sroneer .—Mr. Henry F. Blanford has made
an important study of the relations of the diurnal barometric maxima
to certain critical conditions of temperature, cloud and rain-fall. The
author has re-examined the suggestion made by Espy (1840) and Kreil
248 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

(1861), that the morning maximum of pressure is due to a reaction of
the upper cloud layers against the expanding lower air, and finds that
the results of observations at Calcutta, Melbourne, and Batavia are,
on the whole, favorable to this hypothesis, since the morning maximum
of pressure approximately coincides with the instant when the temper.
ature is rising most rapidly. At tropical stations the barometric max-
imum follows the time of most rapid heating by a shorter or longer
interval, but this may probably be attributed to the action of con-
vection which must accelerate the time of most rapid heating near the
ground surface; while the barometric effect, if real, must be determine:
by the condition of the atmosphere up to a great height. With refer-
ence to Lamont’s criticism of Espy’s theory, a condition is pointed out
which alters the data of the problem, viz, the resistance that must be
offered to the passage of the pressure wave through the extremely cold
and highly attenuated strata of the upper atmosphere. With respect
to the evening maximum of pressure it is pointed out that in India,
and also at Melbourne, there is a strongly marked minimum of cloudi-
ness between sunset and midnight, which on the average coincides with
the evening maximum of the barometer. In the author’s opinion these
and other facts seem to indicate a compression and dynamic heating of
the cloud-forming strata, and that therefore the diurnal barometric
oscillations are dynamic phenomena. (Nature, XXXVI, p. 70.)

Mr. H. H. Clayton has a paper on the annual and diurnal periods of
the barometer. Ieferring to the result pointed out by General Greely
that the epochs of maxima and minima of air pressure show a coinci.
dence, the author traces the probable cause of the occurrences of the
maxima to the expansion and overflow of air from Asia and America
to the pole; and of the minima at the pole to the fact that the overflow
from the pole towards those continents is not replaced by an influx in
that direction from the oceans. Theretardations of the annual maximum
from the Arctic region to the equator, and of the minimum from the
southern parts of the continent to the Arctic region, is also attributed
to the relative heating and cooling of the continent and oceans. (Am.
Meteor. Journal, V1, p. 150.)

Mr. A. Angot, in a paper on the diurnal variation of the barometer
(Annuaire Soc. Méteor. de France), finds that the diurnal variation results
from the superposition of two distinct waves. One of these is expres-
sible as a harmonic function, the constants of which depend on the
latitude and geographical features; this wave is due to the diurnal
variation of temperature of the air near the earth’s surface.

The second wave has a semi diurnal period and its amplitude varies
with the latitude of the place and with the declination of the sun.

Dr. J. Hann has made an exhaustive investigation of the diurnal
range of the barometer over the globe. He las caleulated the harmonic
co-efficients for each month, and for the year, for a large number of
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 249

places, and has investigated the variation both of the phases and of
the amplitudes of the single and double oscillations. The latter show a
remarkable independence of geographical and seasonal influences and
appear to be connected with a cosmical origin. The investigation also
shows that the amplitudes of the semi-diurnal oscillation decrease with
height in exact proportion to the pressure, and have a marked depend-
ence upon Jatitude. The yearly range exhibits two maxima at the equi-
noxes and also a third maximum which falls in January in both nemi-
spheres, while over the whole globe the amplitude of the double daily
oscillation is smallest in July. (Nature, XXxXrx, p. 517.)

Mr. F. C. Bayard has reduced the hourly records of the barometer at
the nine observatories, in Great Britain and Ireland for the years 1876
to 1880, and has compared the resulting curves of diurnal range.

The curves of inland places are smoother than those of sea-coast
stations, and the curves of places to the westward are more irregular
than those of places to the eastward. In going toward the north the
diurnal range diminishes. (Nature, XXXIX, p. 623.)

Krakatoa air waves.—Part 1 of the report of the Krakatoa com-
mittee of the Royal Society, has been prepared by General R. Strachey
and investigates the extraordinary air waves and sounds caused by the
Krakatoa eruption. Barometer traces from forty-seven stations scat-
tered over the whole world exhibit the passage of air waves travelling
around the world not less than seven times. The general velocity at
which the wave spread outward in concentric circles from Krakatoa as
a center was 700 miles per hour, which is slightly less than the velocity
of sound at zero Fahr., viz, 723 miles. A decided variation of velocity
was discovered in those portions of the wave which moved with or
against the earth’s rotation, such variation being due to the prevalent
drift of the winds.

In the extra-tropics the wave moving from west to east was acceler-
ated, and that moving from east to west retarded, by about 14 miles
per hour; within the tropics the wave which passed through Mauritius
was affected in a reverse manner, the passage eastward being retarded,
while the westward was comparatively unaffected, the amount corre-
sponding to an east wind of about 10 miles per hour. These amounts
are almost precisely those given by Ferrel for the easterly and westerly
components of the prevailing currents at their respective latitudes.

The area over which the sound of the eruption was heard is estimated
at one-thirteenth of the entire earth’s surface. (Natwre, XXX1x, p. 566.)

A curious sudden barometric oscillation passed over central Europe
on the evening of January 31, 1889. Dr. E. Herrmann, of the Deutsche
Seewarte, traces it from Kertum (latitude 54° 54’), where it occurred at
7" 50™ p. M., Berlin time, to Pola (latitude 49° 42’), which it reached
at 4" 38" A. M., on February 1, having travelled at the rapid rate of
about 71 miles an hour. The cause of the phenomenon is unexplained.

IX.—CYCLONES; TORNADOES; THUNDER-STORMS; WATER-SPOUTS; GEN-
ERAL WEATHER RELATIONS.

Hurricane theories.—Hon. Ralph Abercromby compares the old and
the modern views of hurricanes. The old conception was of acireular-
shaped eddy, round which the wind blew in circles. Modern research
shows that a hurricane is an oval eddy, and that the wind blows in an
incurving spiral round the vortex, not round the center of the oval,
and that the incurvature is less in front than in rear of the vortex. A
hurricane is always changing its shape, so that the vortex is one day
on one side of the oval, and towards another side on the next.

No rule is possible for determining absolutely the bearing of the vor-
tex by observations on board a single ship, whereas it used to be stated
that facing the wind the vortex bore eight points to the right in the
northern and to the left in the southern hemisphere.

We can say now only, that when fairly within the storm field and
facing the wind, the vortex will be from eight to twelve points to the
right of the wind in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the
southern hemisphere. Greater precision can be obtained in certain
circumstances. For example, if a ship is nearly in front of the vortex,
the bearing of the vortex will probably not be much more than eight
points to the right or left, and in the rear of a hurricane the vortex
may bear twelve points to the right or left of the wind, because the
wind is there very much incurved. A ship should then always lie to
till the barometer begins to rise, otherwise she will be liable to run right
into the vortex.

Modern research has proved that a hurricane is usually imbedded in
some prevailing trade or monsoon, and that there is a belt of intensi-
fied trade-wind outside the true storm field. This beltis always on the
side of the hurricane farthest from the equator. A ship in this belt
experiences an increasing trade without change of direction, and with

ee eee

a falling barometer, thongh she may be far away from the line of the
vortex. Now she would experience the same things if she were in the
line of progression; but as there is no means of knowing which is the
case, the empirical rule is: le to till the mercury has fallen 0.6 inch
before beginning torun. (British Association Report, 1888, p. 586.)

Theory of cyclones.—From a mathematical study of cyclonic motion
M. Henri Lasne finds that the “eye” of tropical cyclones (the small area
of calm, and of clear sky, in which the air is relatively warm and dry)
is accounted for and explained by theory. A regular cyclonic motion
of great intensity like that in tropical hurricanes makes possible a feebie
descending motion at the center. In theirregular cyclones of temperate
latitudes having large horizontal and small vertical extent no such phe-
nomena can be developed ; in these the center is not the locus of great-
estenergy. (Annuaire Soc. Météor. de France, 37° année, p. 126.)

Tropical cyclones.—W. Doberck discusses the relation of the wind at
Hong Kong to the typhoons occurring in 1886 and 1887. Only those
within 300 miles of the observatory are considered. No connection is
found between the distance from the center and the direction of the
wind, but the latter depends on the bearing of the center. The wind
has a tendency to blow along the southern coast of China when a ty-
phoon is raging in the China Sea, so that the wind in such cases veers
only about half as much while the typhoon moves westward as in other
cases, and for the same reason the angle between the wind and the ra-
dius vector is larger than usual when the center is situated to the south
of Hong Kong. A cutis given showing the direction of incurvature on
all sides of the storm center when in the vicinity of Hong Kong. (Na-
ture, XXXIXx, p. 301.)

Mr. H. F. Blanford has given the results of his study of the incurva-
ture of the winds in tropical cyclones as observed in the Bay of Bengal.
In order to derive practical rules for navigators he has measured the
angle between the wind direction and the radius vector instead of be-
tween the wind direction and the isobar,as is done by Professor Loomis,
and has restricted the measurements to wind observations of ships at sea
within the influence of the storm, and to good observations on the coast.
His results confirm the general fact of a great incurvature obtained by
Professor Loomis, but differ somewhat in the amount:

(1) The mean of one hundred and thirty-two observations between
latitudes 15° and 22°, within 500 miles of the storm center, gives the
angle 122° between the wind direction and its radius vector.

(2) The mean of twelve observations between the same latitudes,
within 50 miles of the storm center, gives the angle 123°.

(3) The mean of sixty-eight observations Letween N. latitudes 8° and
15°, within 500 miles of the storm center, gives the angle 129°.

For the guidance of navigators Mr. Blanford formulates the following
rules:
252 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

(1) In the north of the Bay of Bengal, standing avith the back to the
wind, the center of the cyclone bears about five points on the left hand
or three points before the beam.

(2) In the south of the Bay it bears about four points to the left hand
or four points before the beam.

(3) These rules hold good for all positions within the influence of the
storm up to 500 miles from the storm center.

The author concludes by pointing out that these facts are fatal to the
cyclone theories of M. Faye. (Nature, XxxvItlI, p. 181.)

Mr. S. R. Elson, an experienced East Indian pilot, comments on Mr.
Blanford’s rules for avoiding cyclones, and shows that a number of modi-
fications must be introduced in applying these rules in special localities
and under special circumstances. One of these is the strong currents
setting in in advance of cyelones that drift the vessel far out of its course
and towards the “eye of the storm.” In and off the Hooghly River,
whatever be the direction and motion of the cyclone, the first wind in-
variably blows from the northeast, and the regular rules are inapplica-
ble without taking account of this peculiarity. Mr. Elson thinks Mr.
Blanford’s rules for finding the storm’s center are perplexing and liable
to misconstruction. (Natwre, XXXIX, p. 69.)

In vol. IV, part V, of the Indian Meteorological Memoirs, Mr. F. Cham-
bers, has presented a study of the cyclone of the 25th of May to the 2d
of June, 1831, in the Arabian Sea. After a painstaking preparation of
the data, it is classified with respect to the gradient, with respect to
the distance from the center, and with respect to the octant of the
cyclone, And many relations of the pressure, the force and directions
and incurvature of the wind in different parts are derived. The re-
sults show no regular increase of the angle between the radius and the
wind in approaching the center, though no doubt this angle is greater
near the center than farther away from it, but the observations are too
few to give averages showing a regular progression. As an observa-
tional fact it was found that the cyclone moved from that side where
the wind was strongest to that side where it was weakest, and Mr.
Chambers explains this by showing that the first effect of the approach
of a tropical cyclone is to neutralize the normal wind, and so to cause less
than the normal amount of air motion. As one practical outcome of
the study, rules are formulated for the guidance of the navigator when
caught in a cyclone in the Arabian Sea, and some interesting relations
are suggested between the direction of the swell and the direction of
the wind as throwing additional light on the position of the cyclone
center.

Paths of cyclones.—In vol. 1x of Aus dem Archiv der Deutschen See-
warte Dr. van Bebber investigates typical weather conditions and
traces the influen ce of cyclonic areas upon the weather with a view to the
discovery of the laws governing the changes in direction of their tracks
and of their rates of progression. It is shown that the depressions move
along certain tracks with greater than average velocity.

PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 200

Thunder-storms.—Karl Prohaskahas collected and discussed a mass of
thunder-storm observations from about three hundred stations in Steier-
mark, Kiirten, and Oberkrain for four years, 1885 to 1888. About nine
thousand reports were received annually, making an average of thirty
reports trom each station.

The average duration of a thunder-storm was 1.4 hours, being 1.2 in
spring, 1.4 in summer, and 1.6 in autumn. The average velocity of
passing was 30 kilometers per hour; hence the extent of the thunder-
storm cloud was at the highest 43 kilometers; but if it be remembered
that the above computed duration represents the mean time between
first and last thunder, the average extent of the usual thunder-storm
cloud does not exceed about 37 kilometers. ‘The velocity of propaga-
tion of the thunder-storms is materially less in these districts of the
southern Alpine mountains thanin southern Germany. ‘Thus the after-
noon velocity is 10 kilometers per hour greater for the latter than for
the former. This is due to the large number of local storms, “ wiirmege-
witter,” with their slow rate of novement. In hot summer days in the
Alps, in spite of a high barometer, frequent local thunder-storms arise,
which seem to be almost unprogressive. On certain selected days in July,
1887, for the hours from noon to 6 Pp. M., there were 1,193 reports, and 218
for the remaining eighteen hours. Thunder-storms occur most frequently
when the barometer is about normal; those from the north and south
have the smallest area of extension, those from the west the greatest.

In addition ‘to these statistical results, Prohaska undertakes to ex-
plain the occurrence of thunder-storms and rain with a rising air press-
ure. The basis of his theory rests on the assumed backward inclination
of the axes of cyclones. This assumption leads to the conclusion that
the rise of the barometer immediately following the passage of baro-
uetric minima is occasioned by dense heavy air adjacent to the earth’s
surface pressing into the region of low pressure. Now, as heavy air
masses come into a region of lower pressure they experience a continu-
ally smaller compression, and consequently there is developed an up-
ward gradient, and a rise of the air strata lying thereon must ensue.
Dynamic cooling is thus brought into play, so that in higher air strata
a fall of temperature takes place whilst the barometer is still falling.
Thus there is a causal connection between rising air pressure and the
formation of precipitation and thunder-storms, inasmuch as the rising
air pressure consists in the formation and condensation of a cloud
swell advancing in front like a true wave movement. (JMeteorologische
Zeitschrift, 1889, vi, p. 226.)

The report of the director of the Hong Kong Observatory for 1888
contains a special study of thunder-storms in the colony during the past
five years. Dr, Doberck states that they are most frequent in May, and
that they have not occurred in November, December, and January.
In diurnal period they are most frequent about 1 A. M., and least so at
about 8 A. M., in the proportion of about two to one.
254 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889,

Professors Mohn and Hildebrandsson have published a study of
thunder-storms in the Scandinavian peninsula. (Upsala, 1888, 55 pp.)
This monograph supplies for the Scandinavian peninsula statistical
information about thunder-storms similar to that so richly collected in
the states of central Europe. The meteorological conditions favorable
to thunder-storms in eastern Norway are given in detail, and by their
aid thunder-storms can be predicted from the morning weather map.

Dr. E. Wagner has investigated the periodicity of thunder-storms in
Bavaria, Wurtemburg, and Baden, and finds that they have a period
of twenty-nine days, containing three maximum points, the chief of
these being in the last half quarter, the next at new moon, and the
least at fall moon. No physical explanation for this is attempted.
(Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, V1, p. 299.)

Doctor Wagner has tabulated the observations of thunder-storm
frequency in Bavaria and Wurtemburg with respect to the phases of
the moon, and considers that they each show a well-marked maximum
between the last quarter and the fourth octant. (Ibid, p. 300.)

Dr. Karl Lang has reported to the German Meteorological Society
the results of his investigations upon the velocity of propagation of
thunder-storms in south Germany. He finds a close counection between
the velocity of propagation and the proximity of storm tracks. Thus
in the winter months, when van Bebber’s cyclone track No. Iv has its
most southerly position, the velocity of thunder-storms is greatest, and
geographically the velocity diminishes from north to south. Thunder-
storms coming from the west and west-southwest most frequently arise
in the southern border of cyclones and travel the fastest, while those
from northwest to northeast travel the slowest. (Jbid, p. 271.)

Dr. Franz Horn finds from a study of thunder and hail storms in
Bavaria during the years 1880 to 1888 that no hail has ever been re-
ported withoat a simultaneous observation of electrical discharge.
The hours of greatest thunder-storm frequency are in the afternoons;
in the winter between 2 P. M. and 3 P. M., and in summer an hour later.
(Ibid. p. 272.)

Tornado charts.—Lieut. J. P. Finley has published in successive
issues of the American Meteorological Journal State tornado charts
showing paths of tornadoes, each accompanied by a brief table of sta-
tistics. These ought to be a concise presentation of valuable informa-
tion collected on this subject; but as shown by Professor Hinrichs,
they contain rather a large amount of mis-information due to the utter
absence of scientific criticism in the compilation of the data.

Tornadoes and derechos.—lu a paper entitled “Tornadoes and Dere-
chos,” Professor Hinrichs describes the characters of tornadoes and
of the peculiarly destructive squalls of Iowa, which he has named the
derecho.

He defines the derecho as a violently progressing mass of cold air,
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889, 255

moving destructively onward in slightly divergingestraight lines, in
Iowa generally towards the southeast. The barometer rises suddenly
and the thermometer falls greatly under the blow of this cold air of
the upper strata suddenly striking the ground. While occurring occa-
sionally in the spring and early summer, the derecho has its period of
greatest frequency and intensity in the*’midsummer months, July and
August. In these two months the tornado does not occur in Iowa.
The writer shows that the list of Lowa tornadoes published by Lieu-
tenant Finley is untrustworthy, and then gives a corrected list of all
the authentic tornadoes that can be verified by reports. These have
oceurred in April, May, June, and October. (Am. Meteor. Journal, V,
p. 385.)

Water-spouts— Mr. 8S. R. Elson teports several water-spouts observed
on the Hooghly. Cne was seen ‘ projected from the level vapor-plane
of a towering cumulus cloud; through a telescope it showed well the
downrush on the inside of the tube, and its counterpart the whirling
uprush on the outside, twisting and coiling round and round against
the watch hands (face upwards). In another case after a water-spout
had been observed for some time and it was beginning to shrink and to
draw itself upwards, “the inside downrush was again seen to advan-
tage and the simultaneous upward whirl around the dense remains of
the tube, which I can not do better than liken to the turning inside
out of a coat-sleeve, only the end of the tube was always ragged ; and
here, where the reversing process was taking place, there was great
commotion in the air currents. I had a good telescope, observed these
phenomena very carefully, and was on the alert for optical illusions.”
(Nature, XXXIX, p. 334.)

Rain-fall and cuclones.~-The Report on the Meteorology of India in
1887 (Caleutta, 1889) calls attention to the relation that has previously
been shown to obtain between rain-fall and cyclones during the south-
west monsoon period. There is a very marked tendency for cyclonic
rain-storms to run along the trough of low pressure, the mean position
of which during the rains stretches from Sind or Cutch in an east south-
east direction to the eastern districts of the central provinces, Orissa and
Chutia Nagpur. An examination of the storm tracks of 1887 and 1888
has shown that the great majority of these storms marched across the
coast in the direction of the belt of lowest pressure at the time of their
formation, and hence it may be inferred that if a depression forms dur-
ing the rains in the bay it will very probably run along the belt of
lowest pressure or the trough of minimum pressure in existence imme-
diately antecedent to its formation. Since the chief characteristic of
such a barometric depression is light and variable winds, it will be seen
that this principle virtually coincides with the rule that cyclonic storms
in the bay march in the direction of least relative air motion immedi-
ately antecedent to the formation of the cyclone, which is a more gen-
eral rule than the former.
256 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

Abnormal weather.—The eastern as well as the western hemisphere
was visited by eXtraordinary spring weather in 1889. The following
note is from Nature, June 20, 1889:

‘It appears that the somewhat eccentric weather of western Europe
during the present year finds @ parallel in both China and Japan, where
people complain bitterly of the sudden changes of temperature, the pre-
mature heat followed by cold “snatches,” the storms in quick succession
and of great intensity. In northern China there has not been known
such an inclement spring since foreigners have resided in the country.
A warm week in February broke up the ice on the Peiho River prema-
turely, but afterwards cold set in with great severity, and March was
characterized by a succession of gales, lasting sometimes a week with-
out intermission, and as late as the 24th the ground was covered with
snow.”

Dr. B. Andries has investigated the so-called cold period in May
which is popularly supposed to prevail about the 10th of that month;
he finds that while each year frosts occur in May, after a period of warm
weather has excited a hope for continuous rise of temperature, yet the
same thing occurs in April and June, and the weather of May is more
uniform than all the other months except October. (Das wetter, June,
1889.

X.—ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY; LIGHTNING; TERRESTRIAL MAGNET-
ISM; AURORAS.

Atmospheric electricity—Dr. Less (Berlin) has studied the occurrence
of rain, bail, and snow, in connection with thunder-storms. He concludes
that on days of thunder-storms in winter, the temperature diminishes
with altitude at a much greater rate than on days of precipitation, and
thunder-storms seem to cease entirely when there is considerable amount
of condensed moisturein the atmosphere. He considers that both these
results afford substantial confirmation of Sohnecke’s theory that the elec-
tricity of thunder-storms first arises from the friction between ice and
water particles, but additional consideration must be added in order
to explain quantitatively the high potential of the lightning discharge.

Mr. Angus Rankin has a paper in the Journal of the Scottish Meteor-
ological Society on the conditions of the occurrence of St. Elmo’s fire
on Ben Nevis. He finds that the fifteen observed cases occurred a few
hours after the passage of the center of a cyclonic depression, when the
temperature was rapidly falling, the pressure rising, the wind west-
northwest, and heavy showers of snow and snow-hail prevailing. (Na-
ture, XL, p. 439.)

Globular lightning.—At the British Association meeting in 1888 Sir
William Thompson expressed the belief that ball lightning is altogether
physiological. A vivid flash produces an intense action on the center
of the retina, and when the eyes are moved, a spot of light follows,
which is the marvellous ball lightning frequently reported,
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. Zot

At the American Association meeting in 1889, Prof. Dr. T. C. Men-
denhall presented a series of observations of ball lightning, the concur-
rent testimony of which had convinced him of the reality of the phe-
nomenon.

Lightning —Mr. W. G. MeMillan describes a lightning discharge
which struck a house in Calcutta. The instantaneous discharge of rib-
_ bon-lightning was apparently converted on entering the house into a
relatively slowly moving fire-ball. The effect is described as that of an
intensely brilliant ball of yellow fire about 6 or 7 inches in diameter
which passed across the room at a pace sufficiently slow to allow it to
be followed by the eve; about half way across, if appeared to be mo-
mentarily checked, and then, seeming to burst with a deafening report,
which shook the whole house, it scattered aud passed onward. <A
large portion of the oxygen in the air immediately surrounding the
path of the flash was converted into the oxides of nitrogen. (Nature,
XL, p. 295.)

Lightning conductors.—A discussion on lightning and lightning con-
ductors was held at the British Association meeting in 1888, in which
Professor Lodge, Mr. W. H. Preece, Lord Rayleigh, Professor Forbes,
Sir William Thomson, and others participated. The discussion took
a wide range, though primarily designed to elucidate the question as to
the relative superiority of iron and copper wire. Mr. Preece stated
that both iron and copper are efficacious. Sir William Thomson
knew of no experiment which proved iron less efficient, and it is prefer-
able because of its higher melting point as well as on account of its
cheapness. Contrary to the opinion of Mr. Preece, Professor Lodge
believed that lightning conductors are sometimes inefficient even
when erected in accordance with all the demands of electrical science,
and, as acase in point, he instanced M. Melsen’s hotel at Brussels
which had been struck and burned although elaborately protected.

Terrestrial magnetism.— Prof. Arthur Schuster has presented to the
Royal Society an elaborate investigation on the diurnal variation of
terrestrial magnetism, in which he makes use of the method of har-
monic analysis to separate internal from external causes of variation.

If the magnetic effects can be fairly represented by a single term in
a series of harmonies so far as the horizontal forces are concerned,
there should be no doubt as to the location of the disturbing cause,
for the vertical force should be in the opposite direction if the origin
is outside from what it should be if the origin is inside the earth.
If it be then a question simply of deciding whether the cause is
outside or inside, without considering a possible combination of both
causes, the result should not be doubtful, even if we have only an ap-
proximate knowledge of the vertical forces. He had previously shown
that the leading features of the horizontal components for diurnal

variations could be approximately represented by the surface har-
monic of the second degree and first type, and that the vertical vari-

ation agreed in direction and phase with the calculation, on the as-
sumption that the seat of the force is outside the earth. In the present
more complete investigation the matter has been more fully taken up
and the original conclusions have been confirmed.

The observations taken at Bombay, Lisbon, Greenwich, and St. Peters-
burgh are used, and the potential is computed in thirty-eight terms
of a series of surface harmonics by means of the horizontal compo-
nents only. Irom the potential thus computed the vertical force is de-
duced both on the assumption of an inside and an outside origin of the
variation. By tabulating the amplitude and phase of the forces com-
puted on each assumption and by comparing the results with the act-
ually observed values a complete disagreement is found with the results
obtained on the assumption that the disturbing force is inside the earth
and nearly complete agreement on the alternative hypothesis.

The observed amplitudes are found in all cases to be considerably
smaller than the computed ones.

In an appendix Prof. H. Lamb shows thatif the earth be heated as a
conducting sphere, in which induced currents are excited by an exter-
nal cause, this reduction in amplitude may be accounted for.

Prof. Balfour Stewart’s suggestion that convective currents in the
atmosphere moving across the lines of the earth’s magnetic forces are
the causes of the daily variation, gains much in probability by this in-
vestigation. If the daily variation of the barometer is accompanied by
a horizontal current in the atmosphere similar to the tangential motion
in waves propagated in shallow canals, and if the conductivity of the
air is sufficiently good, the effects on the magnetic needles would be
very similar to those actually observed. (Nature, XXXIXx, p. 622.)

Auroras.—Mr, H. Hildebransson gives a summary of the result of
the elaborate observations of the aurora made by the Swedish polar
expedition at Bossekop (situated in the maximum zone of auroras, on
the coast of northern Norway.)

(1) A mean of 371 measures gave the azimuth of the summit of the
auroral arch in S. 24° 12/ EB,

(2) A mean of 87 measures on the position of the center of the corona
gave its altitude 79° 55’, azimuth §.7° 12’ EK. This point is nearly in the
magnetic zenith, but not in the same vertical as the highest point of the
arch.

(3) The breadth of the auroral arches varies with their elevation
above the horizon. The arches consist of rays running in the direction
of the breadth of the arch and converging toward the magnetic zenith.

(4) The auroral light sometimes formed a true spherical zone parallel
with the earth’s surface, thus floating in space as a horizontal layer of
light.

(5) The movements of the arches from north to south and from south
to north were almost equally frequent.

(6) Anomalous forms of arches were very frequent.
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 259

(7) Often, waves of light run along the arches; eastward and west-
ward motion of the waves were equally frequent.

(8) The author rejects the classification of auroral forms given by
Weyprecht, and distinguishes only two different forms of auroral light,
viz, zones, or horizontal layers of light, and arches, composed of rays
parallel to the dipping needle. The arches are of four varieties: (1)
arch, or aregular band; (2) band or drapery; (3) spiral; (4) pseudo-
arch.

(9) The auroral light is of two kinds: (1) the yellow light, entirely
monochromatic ; (2) the crimson or violet light.

(10) No sound was ever heard from the aurora.

(11) The aurora was never seen to descend below the mountains or
lower clouds. Only two or three times it is possible that the hght was
seen below the upper clouds. Direct measures of the parallax from the
end of a short base (573 meters) gave an average height of 55.1 kilom-
eters, and by several other methods about 2 kilometers was found to
be the probable mean height of the aurora.

(12) No annual variation could be discovered.

A daily variation having its maximum at 3 P. M., and minimum at 8
A. M., Jocal time, was computed. (Nature, XXXVI, p. S4.)

XI.—SCINTILLATION; LIGHT AND COLOR OF THE SKY; TWILIGHT
GLOWS, ETC.

Scintillation of the stars.—Dr.J.M. Pernter has conducted some sein-
tillometer observations upon the Sonnblick (elevation 3,100 meters), in
order to determine whether there is greater steadiness at high than at
low levels. Two of Exner’s scintillometers were used in the work, and
simultaneous observations were made on two nights at the summit and
at Rauris (900 meters). The result of these comparisons showed that
the scintillation was noticeably greater at the summit than at Rauris.
Dr. Pernter properly draws the conclusion that scintillation does not, in
all cases and exclusively, take place in the lower air layers, and that
many cases occur in which the air above 3,100 meters elevation is more
productive of scintillation than that at lower levels. Pernter further
concludes that little or nothing is gained in steadiness by building ob-
servatories at high elevations; but Exner considers the observations too
few to warrant this generalization and considers that it is simply proved
that the Sonnblick is not particularly suitable for an astronomical ob-
servatory. (Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, V1, p. 30.)

Spectro-photometry.—M. Crova has presented a paper to the Paris
Academy of Sciences on the analysis of the light diffused by the sky.
He made observations on the top of Mont Ventoux with a modified
form of his spectro-photometer, which could be directed to any part of
the sky.

The curves for zenithal light show a predominance of the more re-

260 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

frangible radiations at sunrise, diminishing towards midday, then in-
creasing towards sunset, but .not reaching, in homologous hours after
noon, the same values as in the morning. The figures show to what
extent the light is bluer than the direct sunlight, and the light of the
sky at Montpellier.

Polarization of sky-light.—Myr. J. ©. McConnel has made observations
with a polarimeter at St. Moritz, Thersis, and Davos, and derives the
following results:

(1) The polarization of sky-light is weakest at midday, and is greater
the nearer the sun to the horizon.

(2) Snow-covered ground diminishes polarization, and in general the
brighter the ground is illuminated, the weaker the polarization.

(3) Polarization is greater at high altitudes than at sea-level. (Phil.
Mag., 1889, p. 81.)

Twilight phenomena and the Krakatoa eruption.—Prof. J. Kiessling
has published the results of his studies on the twilight phenometa
accompanying the Krakatoa eruption in a quarto volume of 169 pages,
illustrated with colored plates, charts, and wood cuts.

The author first inquires in what particular the optical phenomena of
1885-86 differ from ordinary twilight, and finds that it is essentially the
intensity and frequent repetition which distinguish the one from the
other. The extension of this optical phenomena over the world after the
Krakatoa eruption is represented by four charts on which are entered
the places and times of observation. Kiessling’s experiments teach
that the colored suns observed after the eruption are produced by dense
clouds of smoke and dust, the single particles of which may be of quite
different sizes. He was able to obtain all colors from reddish brown to
violet, except the green colors were not pure, but appeared with a yel-
lowish tint. Colored rings are seen around the sun only when the par-
ticles are approximately of equal size, and the more nearly equal the
size, the brighter the coloring. This forces the conclusion that the rings
are phenomena of diffraction. In the discussion of twilight phenomena,
Kiessling separates the colored horizonal bands from the after-glows
(purpurlicht). The latter are phenomena of the same kind as Bishop’s
ring; the former are due essentially to absorption. Of special interest
is the question whether the particles that produced the abnormal phe-
nomena were smoke, dust, or water. It is possible to exclude dust
(staub) at once, since dust particles would not possess the necessary
uniformity of size; and the assumption that such uniformity was
attained by eradually falling is inadmissable, because the phenomena
were seen immediately after the eruption. As between smoke and
water particles it is not easy to descriminate, and probably both were
engaged in the production of the phenomena.

Report of Royal Society on the Krakatoa Eruption.—The comenetiee ap-
pointed by the Royal Society to report upon the eruption of Krakatoa
have finished their work, and published a quarto volume of 490 pages,

a alll

PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 261

together with diagrams, charts, and colored plates. The report upon
the optical phenomena following the eruption has been made by Mr. E.
Douglas Archibald and Hon. Rollo Russell, and occupies over 300
pages. The following résumé of the report is taken from Nature. The
different sections contain discussions of the following topics :

(1) The proximate cause of the abnormal twilights, and an explana-
tion, as far as was possible, of the way in which they differed from ordi-
nary twilights, both in quality and intensity.

(2) The colored suns, large corona round the sun amd moon, calle the
sky-haze or eruption cloud which evidently caused them.

(3) The geographical distribution, the height and duration of the
glows, a list of analogous phenomena on former occasions, opinions put
forward to account for the present Series, and finally, a general analysis
of their connection with the eruptions of Krakatoa in detail, each in a
separate section.

To give some idea of the principal facts and conclusions, we will com-
mence with the abnormal twilights, considered as local phenomena.

A normal sunset consists of a series of bands of color parallel to the
horizon in the west in the order from below upwards—red, orange, yel-
low, green, blue, together with a purplish, glow in the east over the
earth’s shadow, called the ‘ counter-glow.” As the earth’s shadow
moves upwards towards the zenith, and passes invisibly across it, a
reddish or purplish glow suddenly appears above the colored layers in
the west, in a spot which previously appeared of a peculiarly bright
whitish color. This purple glow is substantially the ‘ primary glow,”
or more definitely “erste purpurlicht.” It is peculiar in appearing
above the horizontal colors, and in not extending far on either side of a
vertical plane through the sun and the spectator. As this glow sinks
on the horizon and spreads out laterally, it forms the first red sunset.
After its disappearance, under favorable conditions, a second edition of
twilight colors analagous to the first commences with a similar bright
spot (dimmerungschein), out of which a second purple light appears
to be suddenly developed, and sinks on the horizon as the secondary or
‘Cafter-glow.”

These are the normal phases of a complete sunset, according to Dr.
von Bezold, and the present series appear to be abnormal only in ex-
hibiting certain peculiar yellow and greenish tints, a less defined bound-
ary of the earth’s shadow, together with a much greater brilliancy, ex-
tension, and duration of the first, and particularly of the second, purple
glows. The horizontal layers were less conspicuous than usual, and
the abnormal extension of the purple light made it appear as though
there was an inversion of the usual order of tints from below upwards.

In order to explain these and other peculiarities, Mr. Russell starts
with the observed fact of a sky-haze which, in the tropics, tended to
transmit blue or green rays in preference to red, and assuming that al-
the usual elements which are included under the term ‘ optical diffu-
262 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

sion” were present, viz., diffraction, refraction, and reflection, describes
what should be the effects, (1) assuming a haze composed of opaque par.
ticles, and (2) one composed of very thin reflecting plates into which
condition a large proportion of the pumice ejected from Krakatoa is
shown ,to have been transformed. His conclusion is that the distinetive
features of the Krakatoa glows were due mainly to reflection from these
fine lamin, of rays already tinted in a certain order by diffraction
through the dust of the haze layer and the lower atmosphere, as well
as by the selectiye absorption which ordinarily takes place in the more
humid horizontal layers near the earth’s surface. The direct as well as
diffuse reflection by the plates and by the opaque dust, (which lay, as
Mr. Archibald has shown in Section Iv, at a height of from 50,000 to
100,000 feet,) of rays tinted in succession, as both the direct and reflected
twilight boundaries followed the descending sun, and the peculiar trans-
missive quality of the stratum for the more refrangible rays, appear to
afford a reasonable explanation of the peculiar silvery glare, the unusual
coloring, and the unusual extension of the purple glows.

It is admitted that diffraction played an important part, as it does
in ordinary sunsets (Lommel, for example, attributes all the red tints
to this cause); but both in this section and those that follow, many
considerations are urged against the view held by Professor Kiessling
that the development of the primary glow is chiefly due to diffraction,
while the secondary glow is as confidently asserted to be due to reflec-
tion. One of the principal objections to the reflection hypothesis in
explanation of both the ordinary, as well as the present extraordinary,
development of the purple glow is its limitation at first to a narrow
band, a fact which cannot be explained by absorption, and which is
equally at variance with Fresnel’s law of reflection from small globular
dust, which would be equal in all directions. On the lamina, and par-
ticularly the vitreous lamina assumption however, it is intelligible,
since the maximum reflection would then be like that from the sea, in
the vertical plane through the sun and the eye.

Moreover, the richly-colored and prolonged secondary glows, which
were the most characteristic feature of the Krakatoa twilights, are
shown by Mr. Archibald, when dealing with their secular duration, to
have reached a distinct minimum when the large diffraction corona
round the sun, from Professor Ricco’s observations, appeared at its
greatest brilliancy, while the curve of their duration, representing Dr.
Riggenbach and Mr. Clark’s observations, shows that they never again
reached the same brillianey or duration as in the two or three months
immediately succeeding their first appearance in Europe. Both these
facts aid the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Russell and indorsed by
Professor Kiessling, that they were reflections by the haze stratum
of the primary glows. But if these were reflections, the question
naturally arises, Why not the primary also? And until more effective
arguments are brought against this view, as well as Professor Ricco’s
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 265

objections to Professor Kiessling’s theory of diffraction alone, which
are detailed in Section I (¢), page 250, Mr. Russell’s view of the origin
of both glows seems to be the more probable, as well as reasonable,
of the two. The haze stratum appears to have been capable of exert-
ing two influences: One, diffraction of the sun’s rays by its smallest
particles, which, with the absorption and diffraction usually affected
by the dust and vapor present in the lower atmosphere, caused the
horizontal tinted layers; the other, reflection by itslarger particles or
lamine of the horizontal layers, particularly of the lowest red one, when
the earth’s shadow had arrived at about 25° above the western horizon
and into a position whence the maximum reflective effect could- be seen
unmasked by a diffusely illuminated background.

The question of the blue and green coloration of the sun is next dis-
cussed by Mr. Archibald, particularly with reference to its intrinsic
characteristics and physical origin. In Section vu, in which the dis-
tribution of the twilight glows and the blue suns on their first circuit
of the globe is compared, it is shown that the mean limit of the band
of colored suns was about 11° north and south of the latitude of Kra-
katoa right around the equator, while that of the glows lay 5° beyond
this on either side. Along the latitude of Krakatoa the colors were
mostly white or silvery, and in one or two cases coppery. The colors
thus evidently depended on the density of the stream, the glows ap-
pearing on its borders or fringes where it was less dense. A similar
relation to density appears from a study of the diurnal changes with
varying solar altitude, the sun appearing to change from blue near the
zenith, through green or yellow, or disappearance on the horizon. No
direct physical explanation of such phenomena appears forthcoming,
since, according to the physical laws enunciated by Lord Rayleigh and
Professor Stokes, the diffraction of light by particles of the same order
of magnitude as a wave length tends to sift out the shorter blue and
preserve the longer red waves of light. Repeated reflections by small
particles tend to the same result.

It can therefore only be explained as an effect of absorption, due to
some particular absorptive property of the materials which composed
the haze. The phenomenon of a blue or green sun has been observed
under natural conditions, many of which are quoted, and in most cases
where the air was filled with fine dust from a great variety of sources.
It has also been artifically reproduced by Professor Kiessling with dust-
filled air and vapor of water, and particularly of sulphur. Several ac-
counts are given in section V of blue suns seen in connection with
former eruptions, and Mr. Whymper’s observations during an eruption
of Cotopaxi are conclusive as to the ability of the finest volcanic ejecta
to cause such an appearance. The problem which still awaits solution
is, what was the precise nature of the particles or gases which produced
the absorption? It seems probable that they were metallic sulphides.

Mr. Archibald next deals with the sky-haze and its peculiar effects,
264 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

more particularly on astronomical definition. Here again it seems to
have possessed a selective absorption of the red rays, for in two separ-
ate lunar eclipses, 1884 and 1885, the usual coppery tint of the moon
was conspicuously absent. He then passes on to the peculiar large
corona round the sun and moon, which was first observed by Mr. Bishop,
at Honolulu, on September 5, and which, though less striking than the
twilight glow, was, if anything, more uncommon, more constant, and
more prolonged in duration. It was a true diffraction corona with a
reddish border, and of almost exactly the same size as the ordinary ice-
halo, viz, 45° in diameter. It lasted from September 5, 1883, up to
October 15, 1886, since which date it has entirely disappeared. Its di-
ameter has afforded an approximate determination of the mean radius
of the smaller dust particles composing the haze, which Mr. Archibald
calculates to be 0.00006 of an inch.

In section 111, Mr. Russell works out the geographical distribution of
the optical phenomena, including blue suns and glows, up to the end of
1883, by which time they had virtually covered the whole earth. The
general conclusion is that the phenomena all propagated themselves
(with the exception of a narrow offshoot towards Japan) at first due
west from Java, at a rate of about 76 miles an hour right round the
arth parallel to the equator, and in a band symmetrically disposed for
16° on either side of the latitude through Krakatoa. <A second circuit
with wider limits, 30° north and south of Krakatoa, was traced at the
same rate, after which the motion became indistinguishable. They then
gradually spread in latitude, and ultimately the haze which caused
them appears to have invaded our latitudes, like the anti-trade, from
southwest to northeast. These circumstances may be best realized
from a survey of Mr. Russell’s maps, especially that showing the sue-
cessive limits of the appearances for the first 9 days succeeding the
eruption. The march of the optical phenomena which is shown in Mr.
Russell’s maps is the only direct evidence we have of the fact that at,
100,000 feet above the earth, in-the immediate vicinity of the equator,
the air in August, and probably, as Mr. Archibald shows, at other times,
moves in a rapid and constant current from east to west. Both in see-
tion It (b), and section VII, he discusses this question in detail and
shows its agreement with the theory of the general circulation of the
atmosphere, as well as the motions of the upper clouds so far as they
have been observed.

In section Iv, Mr. Archibald investigates the height of the stratum,
from observations in all parts of the world where the durations of the
primary or secondary glow have been recorded with any attempt at
accuracy. Proceeding on the hypothesis that the primary glow was a
first reflection of the sun’s rays by the stratum, and the secondary a
reflection of the primary glow, for which ample evidence is adduced, he
concludes that the height of the upper or middle part of the stratum
above the earth diminished from 121,000 feet in August, 1883, to 64,000

» Ee iP oad 2
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 265

in January, 1884, the lower limits being practically indeterminate. Also,
since from Dr. Riggenbach’s and Mr, Clark’s observations, the glows
continued less brilliantly and less prolonged after the first few months
right up to the end of 1885, while a decided minimum in the duration,
and, therefore, presumably the height, of the reflecting layer, was reached
in April, 1884, the important conclusion is arrived at that by that date
the larger and more effectively reflecting particles had descended to a
lower level, leaving the finest particles suspended at nearly the same
elevation as at first. This is further corroborated by the remarkable
fact that the large corona reached its maximum intensity during the
same month. .

Finally, in section vu, Mr. Archibald gives a general analysis of the
connection between all the optical phenomena and the eruptions of Kra-
katoa, both in May and August, in which the various objections on the
ground of the initially rapid transmission of the appearances, insuffi-
ciency of fine, solid ejecta, length of time of its suspension, and the
occurrence of apparently similar phenomena on dates previous to the
great August eruption are discussed in turn. The time of suspension
of the finest dust in particular is shown—by an application of Profes-
sor Stokes’s formula, V9 ( ee |

9u'\_p

ticle descending in air, and in which viscosity is properly considered—
to be over two years between 50,000 and 100,000 feet, even assuming
the particles to be spherical, which is the most unfavorable supposition.
If, as is most probable, they were thin plates, the time would be much
longer. A final summary is then given of the direct and local connec-
tion between the optical phenomena and the eruptions, both of May
and August, which the subsequent discovery of the relative though
minor importance of the May eruption rendered necessary.

Sunset glows.—Prof. Cleveland Abbe has published a paper on the
sunset glows of 1884-85 (written in November, 1885), in which he
shows that the phenomena can not be produced by refraction and con-
sequent dispersion through small drops, but are explicable only as
diffraction effects in which the nature of the substance, whether minute
drops of water or non-transparent particles of dust, is immaterial.

The Bishop’s Ring is attributed to particles so far removed from the
earth’s surface as to remain sensibly permanent through many seasons,
while the red twilights are diffraction rings due to similar and slightly
larger particles in the lower atmospliere. Ina prefatory note written
February, 1889, Professor Abbe gives the following as his present con-
clusions :

(1) Vapor haze is more important than dust haze.

(2) A shallow layer, sparsely filled with such minute particles of
vapor haze generally accompanies every area of high pressure and clear
air, and appears to produce the diffraction necessary for the phenomena
that are still observable.

je, for the velocity of a small par-
266 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

(3) A deeper layer, more densely filled with minute and also with
still larger particles suffices to explain the phenomena of 1883~84.

(4) The dust and haze needed to produce red coloration of light by
selective absorption and reflection is always present in the lowest air

stratum.
(5) The Krakatoa eruption sufficed to throw sufficient moisture into

the atmosphere to explain the diffractive phenomena of 1883-84 and
its gradual subsidence since then.

(6) The daily weather reports printed in the Signal Service Bull. Int.
Simul. Obs. shows that the distribution of Krakatoa vapor must have
been largely influenced by disturbances in the lower atmosphere, and
we do not need to assume an exclusive influence of general upper cur-
rents, either easterly or westerly. (Am. Meteor. Journal, Vv, p. 529.)

Mr. 8. E. Bishop, in a letter dated Honolulu, July 25, 1889, reports a
re appearance, beginning on July 13, of sunset glows like those of 1883-
84, but of less brilliancy. The glows were brightest on the 14th and
the 15th and were visible until the 20th, with decreasing intensity. A
space of 15° radius around the sun was occupied by a whitish glow,
like thatin “‘ Bishop’s Ring.” A noticeable peculiarity of the present
glows is the occurrence of a tertiary glow in addition to the primary and
secondary. Another difference is the much earlier time at which the
glows take place, and the rapidity with which they follow each other,
indicating that the reflecting stratum of haze is very low down as com-
pared with the Krakatoa haze. The reflected rays of the sun, travers-
ing asmaller extent of the lower atmosphere, show less red, having less
of the other colors interrupted. For the same reason they retain force
enough for a third reflection, in which a very pure, though faint, red ap-
pears. (Nature, XL, p. 415.)

Mr. J. W. Backhouse reports a feeble re-appearance over western
Europe of a great corona around the sun during August and Septem-
ber, 1889. (Nature, XL, p. 519.)

Noctilucous clouds:—O. Jesse gives the following discription of the
luminous night clouds that have been visible in Europe during the
months of June and July since 1885. They are visible only in that por-
tion of the evening or morning sky which is illuminated by the twilight
and bounded by the twilight are. These clouds disappear as soon as
the twilight are passes over them. In the evening the clouds appear
when the sun is about 10° below the horizon, and continue visible
throughout the duration of twilight. In the morning the phenomena
are inverted. They are very similar to cirri in form and strueture, but
when an ordinary cirrus cloud is present it looks much darker than the
twilight sky surrounding it, while luminous clouds are brighter. (Me-
teorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, v1, p. 184.)

Prof. John Le Conte discusses in Nature the origin and source of the
light in noctilucous clouds, and refers to a collection of observations of
this phenomenon made by Arago, and to his conclusion that the clouds
are selfiaminous. Professor Le Conte has observed on the coast of
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889. 267

Georgia a luminosity sufficient to plainly indicate the road to the
traveller in instances when low-lying dense masses of clouds involved
the whole firmament. In some eases the noctilucous condition may be
caused by the prolonged twilights due to the reflection of sunlight
from attenuated solid particles suspended in the supra-cirrus strata of
the atmosphere, and in other cases may be traced to cloud-obscured
auroral lights. Whether these sources of luminosity are sufficient to
explain the various observed phenomena without supposing a condition
of self-luminosity is still a matter of question.

Mr. D. J. Rowan, Dublin, reports luminous night clouds appearing
between 10 Pp. M. and midnight, June 7, 1889, for the first time during the
present year. He has found them for several years to be an annual
phenomenon. (Natwre xu, p. 151.)

XII.—PERIODICITY AND SUN SPOTS; HYDROLOGY; FORESTS AND CLI-
MATE; CLIMATES OF GEOLOGIC EPOCHS.

Sun-spot period in Indian weather.—Mr. Eliot in his last Meteorological
teport for India, referring to sun spots and weather in India, says that
the period of minimum sun spots is apparently associated with the larg-
est and most abnormal variations of meteorological conditions. Thus
exceptionally heavy snow fell in the northwest Himalayas in 1866, and
again in 1876 and 1877: the most disastrous famines of recent years in
India have occurred near the period of minimum sun spots; and thelargest
and most intense cyclones apparently have a tendency to occur shortly
before the minimum. For example, in the great Calcutta cyclone of
1864, 60,000 people were drowned, and in the still larger Backerganj
cyclone of 1876, 100,000 lives were lost by drowning.

Hydrology in Galicia.—Annual tables of rain-fall and river heights in
Galicia for 1887 and 1888, have been published (see bibliography) under
the direction of Professor Karlinski, director of the Cracow observa-
tory. The volume for 1887 contains daily observations of river heights
at seventy-two stations and precipitation measures at one hundred and
thirty-five stations; that for 1888, ninety-tworiver stations and one hun-
dred and twenty-nine rain-fall stations. The daily rain-tall tables are
given only for June in 1887, and in 1888, for July, August, and Septem-
ber. Isohyetals are drawn presenting graphically the distribution of
rain-fall. The tables furnish a valuable contribution of data for the
study of the relation of surface and climatic conditions to the flow of
streams.

Hydrology of the Saale. —Dr. Ule (Halle) has investigated the relation
of the discharge of the Saale to the total precipitation over its water-
shed, as determined by reports from forty-five stations. He finds that
for the period from 1833 to 1886 only 30 per cent. of the precipitation
was discharged by the Saale. The total annual precipitation was 606
millimeters; no evaporation observations were made. (Meteorologische
Zeitschrift, 1889, V1, p. 272.)
268 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

Under-ground waters.—The supervising engineers of the coal-mines in
the lower Rhone basin have studied the relation of the flow of water in
the mines, to the rain-fall. In the copious rains of October and No-
vember the rain-water sinks into the strata, following fractures and
lines of erosion, and reaches the mine from twenty-four to thirty-six
hours after the rain-fall. Areas of different geological structure show
different periods of infiltration. In the mines of Fuveau and Gréasque
the water enters in two periods; the first some hours after the end of
the rain, proceeding from quite local infiltration, whilst the second,
arriving some days later and continuing much longer, comes from more
distant regions. (Ibid. p. 80.)

Commission météorologique du Department des Vosges ; Observations
faites en 1887-1888. Epinal, 1889.—In addition to a full summary of
meteorological observations this report contains important phenologi-
eal and hydrographic data. The rivers attain their flood heights in the
winter months. The Moselle carries off about 48 per cent. of the pre-
cipitation that falls within its catchment basin.- The united discharge
of the Meuse and Mouson at Neufchateau is 47 per cent. of the rain-
fall; that of the Vair at Soulouse 35 per cent.; that of the Meuse at
Maxey-sur-Meuse, 40 per cent. The Moselle rises on the average about
20 centimeters at Epinal, when the rain-fall in the upper part of the
water-shed amounts to 1 centimeter. Monthly averages of precipita-
tion at low level and mountain stations show the effect of elevation.
The mean annual rain-fall at 320 meters elevation is 840 millimeters ; at
450 meters is 1,347 millimeters, and at 750 meters elevation is 1,672
millimeters.

The hydrographic department of Russia has devoted, since 1837, a
good deal of attention to the secular rising of the coasts of the Baltic
Sea, and a number of marks have been made on the rocky coasts of the
Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland in order to obtain trust-worthy data as to
the rate of the upheaval of the coasts. Since 1869 observations have
been carried on in a systematic way for measuring the changes in the
level of the Baltic at several of these marks, and the results of the
observations are now summed up by Colonel Mikhailoff, in the [zvestia
of the Russ. Geographical Soc, xxtv, 3.

Taking only those stations at which the secular change could be de-
termined (from observations from 1839 to 1878), the rise of the coast in
a century would appear to be as follows: <Aspo, 20.3 inches; Island
of Kotké, 26.7; Island of Skotland, 12.5; Hangéudd, 33.7; Island of
Jussair, 31.6; Lehté, 11.5.

Forest and climate-—Dr. H. E. Hamberg has issued Part m1 of his
investigations on the relation of forests to climate in Sweden.

The following are his conclusions:

The excess of water supplied to the atmosphere by the forest vege-
tation, above that which would be supplied by the same area of bare
soil, is certainly considerable, and if that amount of vapor remained
PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889, 269

over the forest or was restored to the soil in the form of rain, it would
be of great utility, but the wind carries this vapor away and disperses
it on all sides, so that its useful effect to our own country is scarcely, if
at all, perceptible. Accordingly, the difference of absolute as well as
of relative humidity between the cultivated patches in our extensive
forest districts and the cultivated plains of our country is very slight or
almost nil. It is true that relative humidity is greater under trees,
and as the relation mentioned does not apply to open spaces surrounded
by wood, this difference in humidity can have no practical importance.

The lakes and large swamps as well as marshes have a much greater
influence on atmospheric humidity than the forests. The evapora-
tion from the latter, for equal areas, is far less than from the former.
The draining of lakes and swamps has not been regarded with serious
alarm.

One effect of forests on atmospheric humidity which seems to be useful
to vegetation and agriculture is the increase of dew in clearances ; but
this increase of dew is not attributable to a greater abundance of vapor
in the forests, but to the increase of terrestrial radiation induced by the
forest.

The agriculturists of Smaland and of Jemtland have preferred bare,
dry, elevated lands, exposed to wind, to fields at a lower level, wooded
and moist, but more subject to frost.

If all the forests were cleared what would be the result for the atmos-
pheric humidity in Sweden? Supposing that this clearance did not
materially modify the quantity of rain that falls, and it is not proved
that it would, it seems to us that the amount of vapor contained in the
stratum of air in which we live would not be altered in a way which
would materially influence vegetation. Probably relative humidity
would be slightly reduced in summer, because temperature would rise
slightly.

In Bulletin No. 2 of the Forestry Division of the Department of Ag-
riculture, Mr. G. H. Parsons discusses the relation of the climate of
Colorado to the growth of trees. The author finds that the great range
of temperature, the warmth of the sun’s rays in cold weather, the low
humidity, small rain-fall, rapid evaporation, small cloudiness, and the
northers and chinooks are unfavorable to tree growth. Even :rri-
gation can only partially supply the tree with the moisture it needs,
and can never give it the luxuriant foliage characteristic of moist cli-
mates.

Effects of forest destruction.—Mr. W. E. Abbott has observed that
de-forestation in New South Wales has been followed by a more abun-
dant flow of water in the streams; springs have broken out, dry water-
courses have begun to flow, and the change is apparently permanent.—
(Journ. Roy. Soc. New South Wales, xxi1, p. 59.)

Dr. O. Birkner finds that in Saxony the forests interpose an obstacle
to the rapid run-off of the rain-fall in heavy rains and thereby prevent
270 PROGRESS OF METEOROLOGY IN 1889.

floods in the river valleys. This result is effected in three different
ways:

(1) The foliage of the trees catches a portion of the rain and holds it
until evaporated.

(2) On steep slopes forests furnish a permeable covering of eae
which acts in a high degree as a protection against a rapid run-off and
prevents the rapid and complete denudation of the surface covering
itself.

Ruthless de-forestation in Lusatia has opened the way for disastrous
floods. (Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, v1, p. 261.)

Forests and rain-fall.—The annual report of the Commissioner of
Agriculture for 1888 contains an interesting review by Dr. B. E. Fernow
of the literature on forests and rain-fall. The numerous attempts to
prove Statistically the effect or the non-effect of forests in modifying the
precipitation are shown to be inconclusive.

Forestry in Burmah.—The first annual report of the conservator of
the forests of Upper Burmah shows that much has been done in a short
time towards the protection of forests. A staff of eleven assistants has
been employed, and in some cases escorts have protected these officers
in their work. Fifty-seven people have been convicted of offenses
against the forestry regulations, but serious loss has still resulted to the
forest revenue from the plundering of unmarked timber by local traders.

Forestry in China.—By a government proclamation, well directed and
determined efforts are to be put forth toward afforestation in China.
China is a treeless country, and to this are perhaps due the devastating
floods that have caused such repeated damage. Slight attempts have
previously been made to plant extensive tracts with forest trees, but
the strong northerly winds which prevail soon uprooted those that had
not been planted to a sufficient depth nor in well-chosen places.

The methods now to be adopted are those of education in forest
culture and local encouragement and reward for successful work.
(Nature, XXXIx, p. 594.)

Climate of geologic epochs.—Dr. Neumayer, in a paper before the So-
ciety for the Extension of the Natural Sciences, in Vienna, argues
against the theory of a uniform climate over the earth in any geological
epoch. He shows that the occurrence of any given flora or fauna does
not prove any definite climatic conditions, because plants are able to
adapt themselves to different environment. Again the theory of a uni-
form flora over the earth in the carboniferous age can not now be ad-
mitted. The climate of Greenland and Grinnell Land since tertiary
time has grown colder by an amount not much less than 30° C. Europe
also shows an important cooling. But in the opposite hemisphere at
the same latitudes the cooling since tertiary time has been strikingly
less. In the miocene flora of Japan there is no sure evidence of a
climate warmer than that of to-day and in the pliocene flora there are
indications of a colder climate. These facts point to a change in the

.

position of the earth’s axis of rotation, and this supposition is confirmed
by similar phenomena in the southern hemisphere. (JJeteorologische
Zeitschrift, 1889, p. [85].)

_ Mr. H. H. Uoworth adduces a variety of evidence going to prove that
Siberia during the mammoth age was possessed of a temperate climate
and was probably occupied by forests to the borders of the Arctic
Ocean. Schmidt and others have shown that rooted trunks of trees
are found in the beds containing mammoth remains far north of the
present range of trees.

HOW RAIN IS FORMED.*

By H. F. BLANFORD, F. B.S.

In certain villages in the Indian Central Provinces, besides the vil-
lage blacksmith, the village accountant, the village watchman, and the
like, there is an official termed the gapogari, whose duty it is to make
rain. So long as the seasons are good, and the rain comes in due sea-
son, his office is no doubt a pleasant and lucrative one. It is not very
laborious, and it is obviously the interest of all to keep him in good
humor. But if, as sometimes happens, the hot dry weather of April
and May is prolonged through Juneand July, and week after week the
ryot sees his young sprouting crops withering beneath the pitiless hot
winds, public feeling is wont to be roused against the peccant rain-
maker, and he is led forth and periodically beaten until he mends his
ways and brings down the much-needed showers.

You will hardly expect me, and I certainly can not pretend, to impart
to you the trade-secrets of the professional rain-maker. Like some other
branches of occult knowledge which Madam Blavatsky assures us are
indigenous to India, this art of rain-making is perhaps not to be acquired
by those who have been trained in European ideas; but we can at least
watch and interrogate nature, and learn something of her method of
achieving the same end; and if her scale of operations is too large for our
successful imitation, we shall find that not only is there much in it that
may well challenge our interest, but it may enable us to some extent to
exercise prevision of its results.

Stated in the most general terms, nature’s process of rain-waking is
extremely simple. We have its analogue in the working of the com-
mon still. First, we have steam or water vapor produced by heating
and evaporating the water in the boiler; then the transfer of this vapor
to a cooler; and finally we have it condensed by cooling, and recon-
verted into water. Heat is communicated to the water to convert it
into vapor, and when that heat is withdrawn from it, the vapor returns
to its original liquid state. Nature performs exactly the same process.

In the still, the water is heated until it boils ; but this is not essential,

for evaporation may take place at all temperatures, even from ice. A
common little piece of apparatus, often to be seen in the window of the
philosophical instrument maker, and known as Wollaston’s cryophorus,
is a still that works without any fire. It consists of a large glass tube
with a bulb at each end, one of which is partly filled with water; and,
all the air having been driven out of the tube by boiling the water, it is
hermetically sealed and allowed to cool. It then contains nothing but
water and water vapor, the greater part of which re-condenses when it
cools. Now, when thus cold, if the empty bulb be surrounded by ice, or,
better, a mixture of ice and salt, the water slowly distils over, aud is
condensed in the colder bulb, and this without any heat being applied
to that which originally contained the water. And this shows us that
all that is necessary to distillation is that the condenser be kept cooler
than the evaporator.

Nevertheless, at whatever temperature it evaporates, water requires
heat, and a large quantity of heat, merely toconvertit into vapor; and
this is the case with the cryophorus; for if the evaporating bulb be
wrapped round with flannel, and so protected from sources of heat
around, the water cools down until it freezes. That is to say, it gives
upits own heat to form vapor. A simple experiment that any one may
try with a common thermometer affords another illustration of the same
fact. If athermometer bulb be covered with a piece of muslin, and
dipped into water that has been standing long enough to have the same
temperature as the air, it gives the same reading in the water as in the
air. Butif when thus wetted it be lifted out and exposed to the air,
it begins to sink at once, owing to the evaporation of the water from
the wet surface, and it sinks the lower the faster it dries. In India,
when a hot wind is blowing, the wet bulb sometimes sinks 40° below the
temperature of the air.

Now this is a very important fact in connection with the formation of
rain, because it is owing to the fact that water vapor has absorbed a
large quantity of heat, (which is not sensible as heat, but must be
taken away from it before it can be condensed and return to the liquid
state,) that vapor can be transported as such by the winds for thou-
sands of miles, to be condensed as rain at some distant part of the
earth’s surface.

IT have said that the quantity of absorbed heat is very large. It
varies with the temperature of the water that is evaporating, and is the
greater the lower that temperature. From water that is on the point
of freezing it is such that 1 grain of water absorbs in evaporating as
much heat as would raise nearly 54 grains from the freezing to the boil-
ing point. This is called the latent heat of water vapor. As I have
said, it is quite insensible. The vapor is no warmer than the water
that produced it, and this enormous quantity of heat has been employed
simply in pulling the molecules of water asunder and setting them free
in the form of vapor, which is merely water in the state of gas. All

liquids absorb latent heat when they evaporate, but no other known
liquid requires so much as water.

Many things familiar in every one’s experience find their explanation
in this absorption of latent heat. Forinstance, we feel colder with a wet
skin than with adry one, and wet clothes are a fruitful source of chills
when the body is in repose; although, so long as it is in active exercise
and producing a large amount of heat, since the evaporation only car-
ries off the excess, no ill cousequence may ensue. Again, if a kettle
be filled with ice-cold water and put on a gas stove, suppose it takes
ten minutes to bring it to boil. In that ten minutes the water has ab-
sorbed as much heat as raises it from 32° to 212°, an increase of 180°.
Now, if it be left boiling, the gas-flame being kept up at the same in-
tensity, we may assume that in every succeeding ten minutes the same
quantity of heat is being absorbed by the water. “But it gets no hotter;
it gradually boils away. And it takes nearly an hour, or more than
five times as long as it took to heat it, before the whole of the water
has boiled away, since all this heat has been used up in converting it
into steam. It was by an experiment of this kind that Dr. Black in
the last century discovered the fact of latent heat, and determined its
amount; and it was the knowledge of this fact that led James Watt to
his first great improvement in the steam-engine.

One more example I may give, which those who have been in India
will be able to appreciate, and which those who intend to go there may
some day find useful to know. Nothing is more grateful in hot dry
weather than a drink of cold water. Now, ice is not always to be had,
but when a hot wind is blowing nothing is easier than to get cold water,
if you have a pot or bottle of unglazed earthenware, such as are for
sale in every bazaar, or what is better, a leather water-bottle, called a
Chhagal, or a water-skin, All these allow the water to soak through
and keep the outside wet, and if any one of them be filled with water
and hung up ina hot wind in the course of half an hour or an hour the
evaporatiou from the outside will have taken away so much heat that
the contents may be cooled 20° or 30°, notwithstanding that the ther-
mometer may stand at 110° or 115° in the shade. Sodawater may be
cooled in the same way if wrapped in straw and kept well wetted while
exposed to the wind. But itis of little use to do as I have seen natives
do sometimes, viz, put the bottles into a tub of water in a closed room.
It is the evaporation that carries off the heat, otherwise the water is
no cooler than the air around.

Now to return to our subject. The atmosphere always contains some
vapor which the winds have taken up from the ocean, lakes, rivers, and
even from the land, for there are but few regions so dry and devoid of
vegetation that there is no moisture to evaporate. The quantity of
water thus evaporated from large water surfaces is a question of some
importance to engineers, who have to take account of the loss from
reservoirs and irrigation tanks, and a good deal of attention has been

290 HOW RAIN IS FORMED.

given to measure the amount lost by evaporation. In England it has
been found to vary in different years from 17 to 27 inches in the year,
or to say from 14 to 24 inches per month on an average. Now, since
in the east of England the rain-fall is only about 24 inches in the year,
it follows that in that part of the Kingdom the loss by evaporation
from a water surface is not very much less than the rain falling directly
on the surface.

In dry countries the evaporation may exceed the local rain-fall. In
the tropics it has been found to average from 33 to 6 inches per month
in the dry season. In the case of a large tank at Nagpur, constructed
to supply the city with water, it was found that the loss by evaporation
in the hottest and dryest weather was two and a half times as great
as the quantity supplied for consumption.

These statisties will give some idea of the enormous evaporation that
goes onfrom the water surfaces of the globe, and to this must be added
all that takes place fromthe land. In the case of light showers nearly
the whole of the rain is re evaporated, and probably on an average half
of the total rain-fail on the land is thus lost sooner or later, leaving not
more than half for the supply of springs and rivers.

The quantity of vapor in the air is very variable. To us, in England,
the west and southwest winds are the dampest, coming direct from the
Atlantic, and northeast winds are the driest. The cause of their ex-
treme dryness I shall endeavor to explain presently. It is no doubt
partly due to the fact that they reach us from the land surface of Europe,
but partly also to another cause to which I shall have to advert later on.

The quantity of vapor in the air is usually ascertained by the hygrom-
eter, the ordinary form of which is a pair of thermometers, one hav-
ing the bulb wet, the other dry, and observing the depression of the
wet bulb. The principle of this I have already explained. But the
same thing may be ascertained more directly by passing a measured
quantity of air through a light apparatus containing sulphuric acid, or
some other substance that absorbs water vapor greedily, and weigh-
ing the whole before and afterwards. The increase of the second
weighment gives the weight of water absorbed. By such means it has
been ascertained that air at 60° can contain as much as 53 grains of
vapor in each cubic foot, and that air at 80° can contain rather less
than 11 grains in the same space. The quantity that air can hold in-
creases therefore very rapidly with the temperature. But it is seldom
that it contains this maximum amount, especially at the higher tem-
peratures.

In order to condense any part of this vapor we must take away its
latent heat. Itis not sufficient merely to cool it till it reaches the tem-
perature of condensation, but we have further to abstract 55 times as
much heat as would raise the condensed water from the freezing to the
boiling point. Before however proceeding to consider how this cool-
ing 1s effected, the question arises, What is the condensing point? For
HOW RAIN IS FORMED. 291

obviously, since water can evaporate at all temperatures, so we should
expect that it may condense at all temperatures. On what then does
the condensing point depend ?

I mentioned just now that air at the temperature of 60° can contain
as much as 53 grains of vapor, and at 80° rather less than 11 grains in
each cubic foot. Obviously then if air at 80°, containing this maxi-
imum quantity, be cooled to 60°, it must get rid of more than 5 grains,
or nearly half its vapor, and this excess must be condensed. I speak
of air containing these quantities, but in point of fact it makes no ap-
preciable difference whether air be present or not. Anexhausted glass
vessel of one cubic foot capacity can hold 5% grains of vapor at: 60° and
uo more, and nearly 11 grains at 80° and no more; and if, when thus
charged at 80°, its contents be cooled to 60°, more than 5 grains will
be condensed. If however it contain only 5? grains at 80°, none will
condense until the temperature falls to 60°, but any further cooling
produces some condensation. Thus then the condensing point depends
on the quantity of vapor present in the air, and is the temperature at
which this quantity is the maximum possible for that temperature.

This preliminary point being explained, we may now proceed to in-
quire what means Nature employs to condense the vapor in the air,
producing wt one time dew and hoar-frost, at another time fog and
cloud, and at another, rain, hail, and snow.

Let us take the case of dew and hoar-frosé first, as they are compara-
tively simple. And in connection therewith [ may relate a little inci-
dent that took place at Calcutta some years ago. A gentleman, who
had aot much acquaintance with physical science, was sitting one even-
ing witha glass of iced brandy and water before him. It was in the
rainy season, when the air, though warm, is very damp, and he had a
large lump of ice in his tumbler. On taking it up, he noticed to his
surprise that the glass was wet on the outside, and was standing in
quite a little pool of water on the table. At first he thought his tum-
bler was cracked, but putting his finger to his tongue he found the fluid
tasteless. ‘‘ Very odd,” he remarked; ‘‘ the water comes through the
glass but the brandy doesn’t.” :

Now however, with our present knowledge, we may be inclined to
smile at the simplicity of this remark, it so happens that up to the end
of the last century very much the same explanation was popularly held
to account for dew. It was supposed to be a kind of perspiration emit-
ted from the earth, and no satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon
had been arrived at by the physical philosophers of the day. It re-
mained for Dr. Wells to prove, by a long series of observations and
experiments, which have been quoted by Sir John Herschel and Mr.
John Stewart Mill as a typical instance of philosophical inquiry, that
the cold surface of grass and shrubs condenses the vapor previously
held in suspension in the air, these surfaces being cooler than the air,
and below its point of condensation. And such of course is also the
292 HOW RAIN IS FORMED.

case of the glass tumbler containing ice. Any one may try the experi-
ment for himself. To produce hoar-frost, it is only necessary to cool
the condensing surface below the freezing point, which may be done by
crushing some ice and mixing it with salt. A tin pot is better than a
glass to make this experiment.

When not only the ground, but also the air to a considerable height
above it, is cooled in like manner, we have the production of fog, fog
being the form in which the vapor is first condensed, and consisting of
water in drops too minute to be separately visible. The formation of
fog is very much aided if the air be laden withsmoke. Smoke consists
of extremely minute particles of unburnt coal or other fuel, and these
cool faster than the air at night, and so cool the air in contact with
them. Each one of them, too, condenses water on its surface, and
being thus weighted they sink and form that dense fog that Londoners
know so well.

Clouds are essentially the same as fog, but formed high up in the air.
But in their case, and that of rain, snow, and hail, another and differ-
ent cooling agency comes into play, and this will require some prelimi-
nary explanation.

I dare say that some of you may at some time or other have charged
an air-gun. And if so, you will be aware that when so charged the
reservoir becomes pretty warm. Now this heat is produced, not, as
might be supposed, by the friction of the piston in charging, but is due
to the fact that work has been done upon the air by compressing it into
a very small space; in other words, work has been converted into heat.
If the compressed air be allowed to escape at once, its heat is recon-
verted into work. It has to make room for itself by thrusting aside
the atmosphere into which it escapes, and when thus expanded it is no
warmer than before it was compressed. Indeed, not so warm, for it
will already have parted with some of its heat to the metal chamber
which contained it. And if when compressed it is allowed to cool down
to the ordinary temperature, and then to escape, it will be cooled below
that temperature just as much as it was heated by compression. Thus,
if in being compressed it had been heated 100°, say from 60° to 160°,
and then allowed to cool to 60°, on escaping it will be cooled 100° below
60°, or to 40° below zero, which is the temperature at which mercury
freezes. This is the principle of the cold air chambers now so exten-
sively employed on ship-board for the transport of frozen provisions
from New Zealand and Australia.

Bearing in mind, then, this fact—that air in expanding and driving
aside the air into which it expands is always cooled,—let us see how this
applies to the case before us, the production of cloud and rain.

The volume of a given weight of air—in other words, the space it oc-
cupies—depends on the pressure to which it is subject; the less this
pressure the greater its volume. If we suppose the atmosphere divided
into a number of layers superimposed on each other, the bottom layer
HOW RAIN IS FORMED 293

is clearly subject to the pressure of all those that rest on it. This is
equal to about 147 pounds on every square inch of surface. Another
layer, say 1,000 feet above the ground, will clearly be under a less press-
ure, since 1,000 feet of air are below it; and this 1,000 feet of air weighs
slightly less than half a pound for every square inch of horizontal surface.
At 2,000 feet the pressure will be less by nearly 1 pound per square inch,
and soon. If, then, any mass of air begins to ascend through the at-
mosphere it will be continually subject to less and less pressure as it
ascends, and therefore, as we have already seen, it expands and becomes
cooler by expansion. Cooling from this cause is termed dynamic cool-
ing. Its rate may be accurately computed from the work it bas to do
in expanding.

It amounts to 1° for every 183 feet of ascent if the air be dry or free
from vapor, and if, as is always the ease, it contains some vapor, the
height will not be very much greater so long as there is no condensa-
tion. But so soon as this point is passed, and the vapor begins to con-
dense as cloud, the latent heat set free retards the cooling, and the
height through which this cloud-laden air must ascend to cool 1° is
considerably greater and varies with the temperature and pressure.
When the barometer stands at 30 inches, and at the temperature of
freezing, the air must rise 277 feet to lose 1°, and if the temperature 1s
60° nearly 400 feet.

Conversely, dry air descending through the atmosphere and becoming
denser as it descends, since it is continually becoming subject to an in-
creased pressure, is heated 1° for every 183 feet of descent; and fog
and cloud-laden air at 30 inches of pressure and the freezing point will
be warmed 1° in 277 feet only, or if at 60° nearly 400 feet of descent,
owing to the re-evaporation of the fog or cloud and the absorption of
latent heat.

Now, let us see how these facts explain the formation of cloud, and
first I will take the case of the common cumulus or heap-cloud, which
is the commonest cloud of the day-time in fine weather.

When after sunrise the air begins to be warmed, the lowest stratum
of the atmosphere, which rests immediately on the ground, is warmed
more rapidly than the higher strata. This is because the greater part
of the sun’s heat passes freely through a clear atmosphere without
warming it, and is absorbed by the ground, which gives it out again to
the air immediately in contact with it. So soon as the vertical decrease
of temperature exceeds 1° in 183 feet the warm air below begins to as-
cend, and the cooler air above to descend, and this interchange gradu-
ally extends higher and higher, the ascending air being gradually
cooled by expansion, and ceasing to rise when it has fallen to the same
temperature as the air around it. This ascending air is more highly
charged with vapor than that which descends to replace it, since, as
was mentioned before, most land surfaces furnish a large amount of
moisture, which evaporates when they are heated by the sun, This
bo

294 HOW RAIN IS FORMED.

process goes on until some portion of the ascending air has become
cooled to the point of condensation. No sooner does it attain this than
a small tuft of cumulus cloud appears on the top of the ascending cur-
rent, and the movement which was invisible before now becomes visi-
ble. Ina calm atmosphere each tuft of cloud has a flat base, which
marks the height at which condensation begins, but it is really only
the top of an ascending column of air. No sooner is this cloud formed
than the ascent becomes more rapid, because the cooling which checked
its further ascent now takes place at a much slower rate, and therefore
the cloud grows rapidly.

On a summer afternoon when the air is warm and very damp such
cumulus cloud ascends sometimes to very great heights and develops
into a thunder-cloud, condensing into rain. Rain differs from fog and
cloud only in the sizeof the water drops. In fog and cloud these are so
minute that they remain suspended in the air. But as the cloud be-
comes denser a number of them coalesce to form a rain-drop, which is
large’ enough to overcome the friction of theair. It then begins to fall,
and having to traverse an enormous thickness of cloud below it grows
larger and larger by taking up more and more of the cloud corpuscules,
so that when finally it falls below the cloud it may have a considerable
Size.

Such then is the modein which rain is formed in an ordinary sum-
mer shower; and the more prolonged rain-fall of stormy wet weather is
the result of a similar process, viz, the ascent and dynamic cooling of
the moist atmosphere. Butin this case the movement is ona far larger
scale, being shared by the whole mass of the atmosphere, it may be,
over hundreds or thousands of square miles; and to understand this
movement we shall have to travel somewhat farther afield, and to in-
quire into the general circulation of the great atmospheric currents set
in movement by the sun’s action in the tropics, and modified by the
earth’s diurnal rotation and the distribution of the continents and
oceans on its surface.

Before however entering on this subject, which wili require some
preliminary explanation, and in which we shall have to take account
both of ascending and descending currents on a large scale, I will
draw your attention to another and simpler case, in which both these
classes of movements are prominently illustrated, and in which they
exhibit their characteristic features in a very striking manner.

In the valleys of the Alps, more especially those to the north of the
central chain, in Switzerland and the Tyrol, there blows from time to
time a strong, warm, dry wind, known as the Féhn. It blows down the
valleys from the central chain, melting the snows on its northern face,
and although there is more or less clear sky overhead, all the southern
slopes of the mountains are thickly clouded, and heavy rain falls on
the lower spurs and the adjacent plain, replaced by snow at the higher
levels up to the passes and the crest of the range. Cloudy weather also

prevails to the north in Germany, and the weather is stormy over some
part of western Europe.

It is only since the general introduction of telegraphic weather re-
ports and the construction of daily weather charts, have enabled us to
take a general survey of the simultaneous movements of the atmosphere
over the greater portion of Europe, that this Fébn wind has been satis-
factorily explained.* It is found that when a Fohn wind blows on the
north of the Alps, the barometer is low somewhere to the north or
northwest in Germany, northern France, or the British Isles, and
high to the southeast in the direction of Greece and the eastern Med-
iterranean. Under these circumstances, since the winds always blow
from a place of high barometer to one of low barometer, a strong south-
erly wind blows across the Alps. On their southern face it is forced to
ascend. and therefore, as just explained, it is cooled and gives rain in
Lombardy and Venetia, and snow at higher elevations. But having
reached the crest of the mountains, it descends to the northern valleys,
and being by this time deprived of a large part of its vapor, it becomes
warmed in its descent, owing to compression, absorbs and re-evaporates
the cloud carried with if, and is then further warmed at the rate of 1°
for every 1835 feet of descent. Thus it reaches the lower levels asa
warm, dry wind, its warmth being the effect of dynamic heating.

Other mountain chains afford examples of the same phenomenon. A
very striking instance, which much impressed me at the time, is one
that I witnessed many years ago in the mountains of Ceylon; and it
was afterwards mentioned to me by Sir Samuel Baker, who had been
equally struck by it. My own experience is as follows: In June, 1861,
I paid a week’s visit to the hill sanitarium of Newara Eliya, at an ele-
vation of 6,200 feet, on the western face of Pedro Talle Galle, the high-
est mountain in the island. The southwest monsoon was blowing
steadily on this face of the range; and during the whole time of my
stay it rained (as far as I am aware) without an hour’s intermission, and
a deuse canopy of cloud enveloped the hill face, and never lifted more
than a few hundred feet above the little valley in which Newara Eliya
is built. But on leaving the station by the eastern road that leads
across the crest of the range to Badulla, at a distance of 5 miles one
reaches the col or dip in the ridge near Hackgalle, and thence the road
descends some 2,000 feet to a lower table-land which stretches away
many miles to the east. No sooner is this point passed than all rain
ceases and clouds disappear, and one looks down on the rolling grassy
hills bathed in the sunshine of a tropical sun, and swept by the dry
westerly wind that descends from the mountain ridge. In little more
than a mile one passes from day-long and week-long cloud and rain to
constant sunshine and a cloudless sky.

As an almost invariable rule, or at least one with few exceptions,
ascending air-currents are those that form cloud and rain, and descend-

996 HOW RAIN IS FORMED.

ing currents are dry and bring fine weather. And this holds good
whatever may be the immediate cause of these movements. We may
now proceed to consider these greater examples to which I have already
referred.

In the great workshop of nature, in so far at least as concerns our
earth, with but few exceptions, all movement and all change, even the
movements and energies of living things, proceed either directly or
indirectly from the action of the sun. Nowhere is this action more
direct and more strikingly manifested than in the movements of the
atmosphere. Were the sun extinguished, and to become, as perhaps
it may become long ages hence, a solid cold sphere, such as Byron im-
agined, ‘‘ wandering darkling in eternal space,” a few days would suffice
to convert our mobile and ever-varying atmosphere into a stagnant
pall, devoid of vapor, resting quiescent on a lifeless earth, held bound
in amore than Arctic frost. From such a consummation, despite the
supposed decaying energy of our sun, we may however entertain a
reasonable hope that we are yet far distant.

Bearing in mind the all-embracing importance of the sun, let us see
how the great movements of the atmosphere are determined by the way
in which the earth presents its surface to the solar rays.

Since the quantity of solar heat received on each part of the earth’s
surface depends on the directness or obliquity of his rays—in other
words, on the height to which the sun ascends in the heavens at noon—
being greatest where he is directly overhead, as in summer in the trop-
ics, it follows that the hottest zone of the earth is thatin the immediate
neighborhood of the equator, and the coldest those around the poies.

Did time allow, and were the necessary appliances at hand, it would
be easy to show you that both as a matter of experiment, and also as a
deduction from physical laws, there must be under such circumstances
a flow of air from the colder to the warmer region in the lower atmos-
phere, and a return current above. And to a certain extent we have
these constant winds prevailing for about 30° on either side of the
equator in the trade-winds, which blow towards the equator in the lower
atmosphere, and the anti-trades blowing in the opposite direction at a
great height above the earth’s surface.

In the neighborhood of the equator there is a zone extending right
round the earth in which the barometer is lower than either to the north
or the south. It is due to the greater heat of the sun, and it is towards
this that the trade-winds blow. It shifts to some extent with the seasons,
being more northerly in the summer of the northern hemisphere, and
more southerly in that of the southern hemisphere; and its average
position is rather to the north of the equator, owing to the faet that
there is more land in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, and
that land is more heated by the sun than the ocean.

This simple wind system of the trades and anti-trades does not extend
right round the earth, nor beyond 30° or 40° of latitude in either hemi-
HOW RAIN IS FORMED. 297

sphere. Were the earth’s surface uniformly land or uniformly water,
there probably would be a system of trade-winds all round the globe,
blowing from both hemispheres towards the equator; but even in that
case they would not extend much, if at all, beyond their present limits.
In the first place, every great mass of land sets up an independent sys-
tem of air currents, since the land is hotter than the ocean in the sum-
mer and colder in the winter. In the summer, therefore, there is a
tendency to an indraught of air from the sea to the land in the lower
atmosphere, and an outflow above, and in the winter the opposite ; and
this tendency modifies or interrupts the system of the trades and anti-
trades. We have this tendency shown most distinctly in the monsoons
of southeastern Asia, where, both in the India and China seas, a south-
west wind in the summer takes the place which in the absence of the
Asiatic continent would be held by a northeast trade-wind. And it is
only in the winter that a northeast wind blows, and this is then termed
the northeast monsoon.

In the second place, as I have said, the system of trade-winds could
not in any case extend far beyond their present limits in latitude, owing
to the fact that the earth is a sphere and not a eylinder. Let us fix our
attention for a moment on the anti-trades—the upper winds which blow
from the equator towards the poles. The equator, from which they
start, is a circle about 24,900 milesin circumference; the poles are mere
points, and, therefore, the whole of the air that blows towards the poles
must turn back in any case before it reaches the pole, and must begin
to turn back before it has gone very faron its journey. And, as a fact,
a great part of it does turn back between 30° and 40° of latitude, which
I have already mentioned as being the limit of the trade-winds. A part
of the remainder descends to the earth’s surface, and sweeps the North-
ern Atlantic and the North Pacific as a southwest wind.

On the chart which represents the average distribution of atmospheric
pressure in January, there are two somewhat interrupted zones of high
pressure over the ocean in these latitudes. These mark the regions in
which the anti-trades descend to the eartl’s surface, and from which
the trade-winds start. Over the ocean in all higher latitudes, both in
the northern and southern hemispheres, the barometer is low—for the
most part, indeed, much lower than over the equator; and the region
intervening between the zones of high pressure and the seat of lowest
pressure is that of predominant southwest, or at all events westerly
winds, Since our islands are situated on the border of this region of
low pressure, southwest are our prevailing winds.

But now two questions arise: First, why are these winds westerly,
and not simply south winds? And second, low is it that the barometer
is so low over the North Atlantic and North Pacifie oceans, and also in
the southern hemisphere in high latitudes, seeing that in these latitudes,
at least in winter, the sun’s heat is so much less than at the tropics?
The chart represents the state of things in midwinter of the northern
298 HOW RAIN IS FORMED.

hemisphere, and yet everywhere to the north of latitude 40° the deep
biue tint indicates that the pressure is lower than even in the southern
tropic, where the sun shines vertically overhead. Clearly this low
pressure must be due to some other cause than the warmth of the air.

The explanation of this remarkable distribution of the atmospheric
pressure, of the existence of two zones of high pressure in latitudes 30°
to 40°, and of very low pressure in higher latitudes, except in so far
as they are modified by the alternations of land and water, was first
given by the American physicist, Professor Ferrel. Its full demonstra-
tion is to be obtained only from the consideration of somewhat recondite
mechanical laws, but a general idea of the causes operating may be
gathered from very simple considerations, which may be demonstrated
with a terrestrial globe.

Starting with the well-known fact that the earth revolves on its axis
once in the twenty-four hours, let us see what will be the consequence,
if we suppose a mass of any ponderable matter—that is, any substance
having weight, no matter whether light or heavy—to be suddenly trans-
ferred from the equator to latitude 60°.

As the circumference of the earth at the equator is about 24,900
miles, anybody whatever, apparently at rest at the equator, is carried
round the earth’s axis at the rate of 1,036 miles an hour. But in lati-
tude 60°, where the distance from the axis is only half as great as at
the equator, it is carried round at only half the same rate, or 518 miles
an hour; and at the pole it simply turns round on its own axis. Sup-
posing, then, a mass of air to be suddenly transferred from the equator
to latitude 60°, with the eastward movement that it had at the equator,
it would be moving twice as fast to the east as that part of the earth,
and, to any person standing on the earth, would be blowing from the
west with a force far exceeding that of a hurricane. It would be mov-
ing eastwards 518 miles an hour faster than the earth. Indeed, its
movement would really be far greater than this. In virtue of a me-
chanical principle known as the law of the conservation of areas, which
means that anybody revolving round a central point, under the influ-
ence of a force that pulls it towards that point, describes equal areas in
equal times, instead of only 518 miles, it would be revolving round the
earth’s axis 1,554 miles an hour faster than that part of the earth. I
need not, however, specially insist on this point, because, as a matter
of fact, the air which constitutes the anti-trades is not suddenly trans-
ferred, but takes a day or two to perform its journey, and in the mean-
time by far the greater part of its eastward movement is lost by friction
against the trade-wind which blows in the opposite direction under-
neath it. The point on which we have to fix our attention, is that when
the anti-trades descend to earth, they still retain some of their east-
ward movement, and blow, not as south, but as south-west or west-
southwest winds.

On the other hand, the trade-wind, which blows towards the equator,
HOW RAIN IS FORMED. 299

is coming from a latitude where the eastward movement is less than
at the equator, and its own movement eastward is therefore less than
that of the surface over which it blows. A person, therefore, standing
on the earth, is carried eastward faster than the air is moving, and the
wind seems to blow against him from the northeast. Similarly, to the
south of the equator, the trade-wind, instead of blowing from the south,
comes from the southeast.

_ Thus then we have in both hemispheres a system of westerly winds
in all higher latitudes than 40°, and a system of easterly winds—viz.,
the trade-winds—between about 30° and the equator; and if the globe
were either all land or all water, these systems would prevail right
round the earth.

Now, it is the pressure of these winds, under the influence of centrif-
ugal force, that causes the two zones of high barometer in latitudes 30°
to 40°, and the very low pressure in higher latitudes. It is not difficult
to understand how this comes about. You are probably aware that the
earth is not an exact sphere, but what is termed an oblate spheroid—
that is, it is slightly flattened at the poles and protuberant at the equa-
tor, the difference of the equatorial and polar diameters being about 26
miles. It has acquired this form in virtue of its rotation on its axis. If
you whirl a stone in a sling, the stone has a tendency to fly off at a tan-
gent, and so long as it is retained in the sling that tendency is resisted
by the tension of the cord. In the same way, every object resting on
the earth, and the substance of the earth itself, has a tendency to fly
off at a tangent, in consequence of its rotation on its axis, and this
tendency is resisted and overcome by gravity. Were the earth not re-
volving, its form under the influence of gravity alone would be a true
sphere. Ifit were to revolve more rapidly than at present, it would be
still more oblate, flatter at the poles, and more bulging in the tropical
zone; if less rapidly, the flattening and bulging would be less.

This is precisely what happens with the west and east winds of which
we have spoken. West winds are revolving faster than the earth, and
tend to make the atmosphere more protuberant at the equator than the
solid earth; hence they press towards the equator, to the right of their
path in the northern hemisphere, and the tendency increases rapidly in
high latitudes. Easterly winds, on the other hand, tend to render the
form of the atmosphere more nearly spherical, and they, too, press to
the right of their pathinthe northern hemisphere or towards the pole.
In the southern hemisphere, for the same reason, both press to the left.
The result of these two pressures in opposite directions is to produce the
two zones of high barometer in the katitudes in which we find them—
viz, between the easterly trade-winds and the westerly winds, which are
the anti-trades that have descended to the earth’s surface. And the
low barometer of higher latitudes is produced in like manner by the
westerly winds pressing away from those regions.

Thus then we find that all this system of winds, and the resulting
300 HOW RAIN IS FORMED.

distribution of atmospherie pressure as indicated by the barometer is
the result of the sun’s action in equatorial regions. It is this that gives
the motive power to the whole system, so far as we have as yet traced
it, and it is this that produces those great inequalities of atmospheric
pressure that I have so far described.

It remains now to see how storms are generated by these westerly
winds. In so far as they retain any southing, they are still moving
towards the pole in the northern hemisphere; that is to say, they are
advancing from all sides towards a mere point. Some portion of them
must therefore be continually turning back as the circles of latitude be-
come smaller and smalier. But they are now surface-winds, and in
order so to return they must rise and flow back as an upper current.
This they do by forming great eddies, or air-whirls, in the center of
which the barometer is very low, and over which the air ascends, and
these great air-whirls are the storms of the temperate zone and of our
jatitudes. It is the ascent and dynamic cooling of the air in these great
eddies that cause the prolonged rain-fall of wet stormy weather. How
the eddies originate, or rather what particuiar circumstance causes them
to originate in one place rather than another, we can scarcely say, any
more than we can say how each eddy originates in a rapidly-flowing
deep river. Some very small inequality of pressure probably starts
them, but when once formed, they often last for many days, and travel
some thousands of miles over the eartii’s surface.

Two such storms are represented on the charts of February 1 and 2,
1883, one on the coast of Labrador, the other to the southwest of the
British Isles. The first of these appears on the chart of January 28, in
the North Pacific, off the coast of British Columbia. On the 29th it had
crossed the Rocky Mountains, and was traversing the western part of
the Hudson’s Bay Territory. On the 30th it had moved to the south-
east, and lay just to the west of the Great Lakes, and on the 31st be-
tween Lake Superior and Hudson’s Bay. On February 1 it had reached
the position on the coast of Labrador shown in the chart, and on the
2nd had moved further to northeast, and lay across Davis’s Straits,
and over the west coast of Greenland. After this it again changed its
course to southeast, and on February 4 passed to the north of Scotland,
towards Denmark, and eventually on to Russia.

The second storm had originated off the east coast of the United States
between January 28 and 29, and on the following days crossed the At-
lantic on a course somewhat to north of east, till, on February 2, it lay
over England.

These storms always move in some easterly direction, generally be-
tween east and northeast, and often several follow in rapid succession
on nearly the same track. It is this knowledge that renders it possible
for the Meteorological Office to issue the daily forecasts that we see in
the newspapers. Were it possible to obtain telegraphic reports from a
few stations out in the North Atlantic, these storm warnings could be

issued with much more certainty, and perhaps longer before the arrival
of the storm than at present. In tbe case of such storms as that which
reached our islands on February 2, we often have such warnings from
America, but their tracks are often more to the northeast, in the di-
rection of Iceland, in which case they are not felt on our coasts, and
hence the frequent failure of these American warnings.

It is the region of low pressure in the North Atlantic that is the
especial field of these storms. As they pass across it, they produce
considerable modifications in the distribution of pressure, but some of
its main features remain outstanding. Thus there is always a belt of
high barometer between the storm region and the trade-winds, and in
the winter there is almost always a region of high barometer over North
America, and another over Europe and Asia, however much they may
shift their places, and be temporarily encroached on by the great storm
eddies.

These regions of high pressure are the places where the winds de-
scend, and,as I mentioned inthe earlier part of this lecture, these winds
are dry, and generally accompany fine weather. On the contrary, the
eddies, where the air ascends, are damp and stormy, and especially that
part of the eddy that is fed by the southwest winds that have swept
the Atlantic since their descent, and so have become charged with va-
por.

And now we are prepared to understand why east, and especially
northeast winds are generally so dry. They are air that has descended
in the area of high barometer that (especially in the winter and spring)
lies over Europe and Asia, and has subsequently swept the cold land-
surface, which does not furnish much vapor, and therefore they reach
us as dry cold winds. To begin with, the air comes from a considera-
ble height in the atmosphere, and in ascending to that height in some
other part of the world, it must have got rid of most of its vapor in
the way that has been already explained. In descending to the earth’s
levelit must, of course, have been dynamically heated by the compression
it has undergone, but all or nearly all this heat has been got rid of by radi-
ation into free space on the cold plains and under the clear frosty skies
of Northern Asia and Northern Europe, and it then blows outwards from
this region of high barometer over the land, towards the warmer region
of low barometer on the North Atlantic Ocean.

Thus we see that, in all cases, rain is produced by the cooling of the
air, and that in nearly all, if not all, this cooling is produced by the
expansion of the air in ascending from lower to higher levels in the at-
mosphere, by what is termed dynamic cooling. This last fact is not set
forth so emphatically as it should be in some popular text-books on the
subject, but if is an undoubted fact. It was originally suggested by
Espy some forty years ago, but the truth is only now generally recog-
nized, and it is one of the results which we owe to the great advance
in physical science effected by Joule’s discovery of the definite relation
of equivalence between heat and mechanical work.

ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION. *

By F. H. WENHAM.

The resistance against a surface of a defined area, passing rapidly
through yielding media, may be divided into two opposing forces ;
one arising from the cohesion of the separated particles and the other
from their weight and inertia, which, according to well-known laws,
will require a constant power to set them in motion.

In plastic substances the first condition, that of cohesion, will give
rise to the greatest resistance. In water this has very little retarding
effect, but in air, from its extreme fluidity, the cohesive force becomes
inappreciable, and all resistances are caused by its weight alone; there-
fore, a weight suspended from a plane surface, descending perpendicu-
larly in air, is limited in its rate of fall by the weight of air that can bé
set in motion in a given time.

If a weight of 150 pounds is suspended from a surface of the same
number of square feet, the uniform descent will be 1,300 feet per minute,
and the force given out and expended on the air, at this rate of fall,
will be nearly six horse-power; and, conversely, this same speed and
power must be communicated to the surface to keep the weight sus-
tained at a fixed altitude. As the surface is increased so does the rate
of descent and its accompanying power, expended in a given time,
decrease. It might therefore be inferred that, with a sufficient extent
of surface reproduced, or worked up to a higher altitude, a man might
by his exertions raise himself for a time, while the surface descends at
a less speed.

A man in raising his own body, can perform 4,250 units of work,
(that is, this number of pounds raised 1 foot high per minute,) and can
raise his own weight (say 150 pounds) 22 feet per minute. But at this
speed the atmospheric resistance is so small that 120,000 square feet

Annual Report for the year 1866, pp. 10-40.) Notwithstanding its date, this paper
contains so good a presentation of the problem of aéronauties, that it deserves a
wider circulation than it has received.

would be required to balance his exertions, making no allowauce for
weight beyond his own body.

We have thus reasons for the failure of the many mis-directed at-
tempts that have from time to time been made to raise weights perpen-
dicularly in the air, by wings or descending surfaces. Though the flight
of a bird is maintained by a constant re-action or abutment against an
enormous weight of air in comparison with the weight of its own body,
yet, as will be subsequently shown, the support upon that weight is
not necessarily commanded by great extent of wing-surface, but by the
direction of motion.

One of the first birds in the scale of flying magnitude is the pelican.
It is seen in the streams and estuaries of warm climates, fish being its
only food. Onthe Nile, after the inundation, it arrives in flocks of
many hundreds together, having migrated from long distances. <A
specimen shot was found to weigh 21 pounds and measured 10 feet
across the wings from end to end. The pelican rises with much diffi-
culty, but once on the wing appears to fly with very little exertion, not-
withstanding its great weight. Their mode of progress is peculiar and
graceful. They fly after a leader in one single train. As he rises or
descends so his followers do the same in succession, imitating his move-
ments precisely. Ata distance this gives them the appearance of a
long, undulating ribbon, glistening under the cloudless sun of an oriental
sky. During their flight they make about seventy strokes per minute
with their wing. This uncouth-looking bird is somewhat whimsical in
its habits. Groups of them may be seen far above the earth, at a dis-
tance from the river-side, soaring, apparently for their own pleasure.
With outstretched and motionless wings they float serenely high in the
atmosphere for more than an hour together, traversing the same locality
in circling movements. With head thrown back and enormous bills
resting on their breasts they almost seem asleep. A few easy strokes
of their wings each minute, as their momentum or velocity diminishes,
serves to keep them sustained at the same level. The effort required is
obviously slight and not confirmatory of the excessive amount of power
said to be requisite for maintaining the flight of a bird of this weight
and size. The pelican displays no symptom of being endowed with
great strength, for when only slightly wounded it is easily captured,
not having adequate power for effective resistance, but heavily flapping
the huge wings that should, as some imagine, give a stroke equal in
vigor to the kick of a horse.

During a calm evening flocks of spoonbills take their flight directly
up the river’s course, as if linked together in unison and moved by the
same impulse, they alter not their relative positions, but at less than
15 inches above the water’s surface, they speed swiftly by with ease
and grace inimitable, a living sheet of spotless white. Let one eir-
cumstance be remarked,—though they have fleeted past at a rate of
near 50 miles an hour, so little do they disturb the element in which
ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION. 305

they move that not a ripple of the placid bosom of the river, which
they almost touch, has marked their track. How wonderfully does their
progress contrast with that of creatures who are compelled to drag
their slow and weary way against the fluid a thousand-fold more dense,
flowing in strong and eddying current beneath them.

Our pennant drops listlessly, the wished-for north wind cometh not.
According to custom we step on shore, gun in hand. <A flock of white
herons, or “ buffalo-birds,” almost within our reach, run a short distance
from the pathway as we approach them. Others are seen perched in
social groups upon the backs of the apathetic and mud-begrimed ani-
mals whose name they bear. Beyond the ripening dhourra crops which
skirt the river-side, the land is covered with immense numbers of blue
pigeons, flying to and fro, in shoals, and searching for food with rest-
less diligence. The musical whistle from the pinions of the wood-doves
sounds cheerily as they dart past with the speed of an arrow. Ever
and anon are seen a covey of the brilliant, many-colored partridges of
the district, whose long and pointed wings give them a strength and
duration of flight that seems interminable, alighting at distances be-
yond the possibility of marking them down, as we are accustomed to do
with their plumper brethren at home. But still more remarkable is the
spectacle which the sky presents. As far as the eye can reach it is
dotted with birds of prey of every size and description. Eagles, vult-
ures, kites, and hawks of manifold species, down to the small, swallow-
like, insectivorous hawk common in the Delta, which skims the surface
of the ground in pursuit of its insect prey. None seem bent on going
forward, but all are soaring leisurely round over the same locality, as if
the invisible element which supports them were their medium of rest
as well as motion. But mark that object sitting in solitary state in the
midst of yon plain; what a magnificent eagle! An approach to within
80 yards arouses the king of birds from his apathy. He partly opens
his enormous wings, but stirs not yet from his station. On gaining a
few feet more he begins to walk away, with half-expanded but motion-
less wings. Now for the chance, fire! A charge of No. 3 from 11-bure
rattles audibly but ineffectively upon his densely feathered body; his
walk increases to a run, he gathers speed with his slowly-waving wings,
and eventually leaves the ground. Rising at a gradual inclination, he
mounts aloft and sails majestically away to his place of refuge in the
Libyan range, distant at least 5 miles from where he rose. Some frag-
ments of feathers denote the spot from where the shot had struck him.
The marks of his claws are traceable in the sandy soil, as, at first with
firm and decided digs, he forced his way, but as he lightened his body
and increased his speed with the aid of his wings, the imprints of his
talons gradually merged into long scratches. The measured distance
from the point where these vanished to the place where he had stood,
proved that with all the stimulus that the shot must have given to his
exertions he had been compelled to run full 20 yards before he could
raise himself from the earth.

Again the boat is under weigh, though the wind is but just sufficient
for us to stem the current. An immense kite is soaring overhead,
searcely higher than the top of our lateen yard, affording a fine oppor-
tunity for contemplating his easy and unlabored movements. The cook
has now thrown overboard some offal. With a solemn swoop the bird
descends and seizes it with his talons. How easily he rises again with
motionless expanded wings, the mere force and momentum of his de-
scent serving to raise him again to more than half-mast high. Observe
him next, with lazy flapping wings, and head turned under his body ;
he is placidly devouring the pendent morsel from his foot, and calmly
gliding onwards.

The Nile abounds with large aquatic birds of almost every variety.
During a residence upon its surface for nine months out of the year,
immeuse numbers have been seen to come and go, for the majority of
them are migratory. Egypt being merely a narrow strip of territory,
passing through one of the most desert parts of the earth and rendered
fertile only by the periodical rise of the waters of the river, it is proba-
ble that these birds make it their grand thoroughfare into the rich dis-
trict of Central Africa.

On nearing our own shores, steaming against a moderate head-wind,
from a station abaft the wheel the movements of some half-dozen gulls
are observed, following in the wake of the ship in patient expectation
of any edibles that may be thrown overboard. One that is more famil- *
iar than the rest comes so near at times that the winnowing of his wings
can be heard; he has just dropped astern, and now comes on again.
With the axis of his body exactly at the level of the eyesight, his every
movement can be distinctly marked. He approaches to within 10
yards, and utters his wild, plaintive note, as he turns his head from side
to side, and regards us with his jet black eye. But where is the angle
or upward rise of his wings, that should compensate for his descending
tendency, in a yielding medium like air? The incline can not be de-
tected, for, to all appearance, his wings are edgewise, or parallel to his
line of motion, and he appears to skim along a solid support. No
smooth-edged rails, or steel-tired wheels, with polished axles revolving
in well-oiled brasses, are needed here for the purpose of diminishing
friction, for nature’s machinery has surpassed them all. The retarding
effects of gravity in the creature under notice, are almost annulled, for
he is gliding forward upon a frictionless plane. There are various rea-
sons for concluding that the direct flight of many birds is maintained
with a much less expenditure of power for a high speed, than by any
mode of progression.

The first subject for consideration is the proportion of surface weight,
and their combined effect in descending perpendicularly through the
atmosphere. ‘The datum is here based upon the consideration of safety,
for it may sometimes be needful for a living being to drop passively,
without muscular effort. One square foot of sustaining surface for
every pound of the total weight, will be sufficient for security.
ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION. 307

According to Smeaton’s table of atmospheric resistance, to produce a
force of 1 pound on a square foot, the wind must move against the plane
(or, which is the same thing, the plane against the wind), at the rate of
22 feet per second, or 1,320 feet per minute, equal to 15 miles per hour.
The resistance of the air will now balance the weight on the descending
surface, and consequently it can not exceed that speed. Now 22 feet
per second is the velocity acquired at the end of a fall of 8 feet,—a
height from which a well-knié man or animal may leap down without
much risk or injury. Therefore, if aman with parachute weigh together
143 pounds, spreading the same number of square feet of surface con-
tained in a circle 144 feet in diameter, he will descend at perhaps an
unpleasant velocity, but with safety to life and limb.

It is a remarkable fact how this proportion of wing-surface to weight
extends throughout a great variety of the flying portion of the animal
kingdom, even down to hornets, bees, and other insects. {n some in-
stances however, as in the gallinaceous tribe, including pheasants, this
area is somewhat exceeded, but they are known to be very poor flyers.
Residing as they do chiefly on the ground, their wings are only required
for short distances or for raising them or easing their descent from their
roosting-places in forest trees, the shortness of their wings preventing
them from taking extended flight. The wing-surface of the common
swallow is rather more than in the ratio of 2 square feet per pound, but
having also great length of pinion, it is both swift and enduring in its
flight. When on a rapid course this bird is in the habit of furling its
wings into a narrow compass. The greater extent of surface is proba-
bly needful for the continual variations of speed and instant stoppages
requisite for obtaining its insect food.

On the other hand, there are some birds, particularly of the duck
tribe, whose wing-surface but little exceeds half a square foot, or 72
inches per pound; yet they may be classed among the strongest and
swiftest flyers. A weight of 1 pound suspended from an area of this ex-
tent would acquire a velocity due to a fall of 16 feet, a height sufficient
for the destruction or injury of most animals. But when the plane is
urged forward horizontally, in a manner analogous to the wings of a
bird during flight, the sustaining power is greatly influenced by the
form and arrangement of the surface.

In the case of perpendicular descent, as a parachute, the sustaining
effect will be much the same, whatever the figure of the outline of the
superficies may be, and a circle perhaps affords the best resistance of
any. Take for example a circle of 20 square feet (as possessed by the
pelican) loaded with as many pounds. This, as just stated, will limit
the rate of perpendicular descent to 1,320 feet per minute. But instead
of a circle 61 inches in diameter, if the area is bounded by a parallelo-
gram 10 feet long by 2 feet broad, and whilst at perfect freedom to de-
scend perpendicularly, let a force be applied exactly in a horizontal
direction so as to carry it edgeways, with the long side foremost, at a
308 ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION.

forward speed of 30 miles per hour, just double that of its passive de-
scent; the rate of fall under these conditions will be decreased most
remarkably, probably to less than one-fifteenth part, or 88 feet per min-
ute, or 1 mile per hour.

The annexed line represents transversely the plane 2 feet wide and 10
teet long, moving in the direction of the arrow | ............... Dect ete
with a Forard speed of 30 miles per hour, or - AME ee

2,640 feet per minute, and descending at 88 feet®

per minute, the ratio being as 1 to 30. Now, the particles of air caught
by the forward edge of the plane must be carried down eight-tenths of
an inch before they leave it. This stratum, 10 feet wide and 2,640 feet
long, will weigh not less than 134 pounds; therefore the weight has
continually to be moved downwards 88 feet per minute from a state of
absolute rest. If the plane, with this weight and an upward rise of
eight-tenths of an inch, be carried forward at a rate of 30 miles per
hour, it will be maintained at the same level without descending.

The following illustration, though referring to the action of surfaces
in a denser fluid, are yet exactly analogous to the conditions set forth
in air:

Take a stiff rod of wood and nail to its end at right angles a thin lath
or blade about 2 inches wide. Place the rod square across the thwarts
of a rowing-boat in motion, letting a foot or more of the blade hang
perpendicularly over the side into the water. The direct amount of
resistance of the current against the flat side of the blade may thus be
felt. Next slide the rod to and fro thwart-ship, keeping all square; the
resistance will now be found to have increased enormously ; indeed,
the boat can be entirely stopped by such an appliance. Of course the
same experiment may be tried in a running stream.

Another familiar example may be cited in the leeboards and sliding
keels used in vessels of shallow draught, which act precisely on the
same principle as the plane or wing-surface of a bird when moving in
air. These surfaces, though parallel to the line of the vessel’s course,
enable her to carry a heavy press of sail without giving way under the
side pressure, or making lee-way, so great is their resistance against
the rapidly passing body of water, which can not be deflected sideways
at a high speed.

The succeeding experiments will serve further to exemplify the action
of the same principle. Fix a thin blade, say 1 inch wide and 1 foot
long, with its plane exactly midway and at right angles to the end of
a spindle or rod. On thrusting this through a body of water, or im-
mersing it in a stream running in the direction of the axis of the spin-
dle, the resistance will be simply that caused by the water against the
mere superficies of the blade. Next put the spindle and blade in rapid
rotation. The retarding effect against direct motion will now be in-
creased near tenfold, and is equal to that due to the entire area of the
circle of revolution, By trying the effect of blades of various widths,
ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION. 309

it will be found that, for the purpose of effecting the maximum amount
of resistance, the more rapidly the spindle revolves the narrower may
be the blade. There is a specific ratio between the width of the blade
and its velocity. It is of some importance that this should be precisely
defined, not only for its practical utility in determining the best pro-
portion of width to speed in the blades of screw-propellers, but also for
a correct demonstration of the principles involved in the subject now
under consideration; for it may be remarked that the swiftest-flying
birds possess extremely long and narrow wings, and the slow, heavy
flyers short and wide ones.

In the early days of the secrew-propeller it was thought requisite, in
order to obtain the advantage of the utmost extent of surface, that the
end view of the screw should present no opening, but appear as a com-
plete disk. Accordingly, some were constructed with one or two
threads, making an entire or two half-revolutions ; but this was subse-
quently found to bea mistake. In the case of the two blades, the length
of the screw was shortened, and consequently the width of the blades
reduced, with increased effect, till each was brought down to consider.
ably less than one-sixth of the circumference or area of the entire
circle; the maximum spred was then obtained. Experiment has also
shown that the effective propelling area of the two-bladed screw is
tantamount to its entire circle of revolution, and is generally estimated
as such.

Many experiments tried by the author, with various forms of screws
applied to a small steam-boat, led to the same conclusion,—that the two
blades of one-sixth of the circle gave the best results.

All serews re-acting on a fluid such as water must cause it to yield to
some extent. This is technically known as “slip,” and whatever the
ratio or percentage on the speed of the boat may be it is tantamount
to just so much loss of propelling power, this being consumed in giving
motion to the water instead of the boat.

On starting the engine of the steam-boat referred to, and grasping a
mooring-rope at the stern, if was an easy matter to hold it back with
one hand, though the engine was equal in power to five horses, and the
serew making more than five hundred revolutions per minute. The
whole force of the steam was absorbed in “slip,” or in giving motion
to the column of water; but let her go and allow the screw to find an
abutment on a fresh body of water not having received a gradual mo-
tion, and with its inertia undisturbed when ranning under full way,
the screw worked almost as if in a solid nut, the “slip” amounting to
only 11 per cent.

The laws which control the action of inclined surfaces, moving either
in straight lines or circles in air, are identical, and serve to show the
inutility of attempting to raise a heavy body in the atmosphere by
means of rotating vanes or a Screw acting vertically ; for unless the ratio
of surface compared to weight is exceedingly extensive, the whole

~
310 ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION.

power will be consumed in “slip,” or in giving a downward motion to
the column of air. LEven if a sufficient force is obtained to keep a body
suspended by such means, yet, after the desired altitude is arrived at,
no further ascension is required; there the apparatus is to remain sta-
tionary as to level, and its position on the constantly yielding support
can only be maintained at an enormous expenditure of power, for the
screw can not obtain a hold upon a fresh and unmoved portion of air in
the same manner as it does upon the body of water when propelling the
boat at full speed; its action under these conditions is the same as when
the boat is held fast, in which case, although the engine is working up
to its usual rate, the tractive power is almost annulled.

Some experiments made with ascrew, or pair of inclined vanes acting
vertically in air, were tried in the following manner: To an upright
post was fixed a frame containing a bevel wheel and pinion, multiplying
in the ratio of three to one. The axle of the wheel was horizontal, and
turned by a handle of 5§ inches radius. The spindle of the pinion
rotated vertically, and carried two driving-pins at the end of a cross-
piece, so that the top resembled the three prongs ofa trident. The
upright shaft of the screw was bored hollow to receive the middle prong,
while the two outside ones took a bearing against a driving-bar, at right
angles to the lower end of the shaft, the top of which ended in a long
iron pivot, running in a socket fixed in a beam overhead ; it could thus
rise and fall about 2 inches with very little friction. Ihe top of the
serew-shaft carried a cross-arm, witb a blade of equal size at each ex-
tremity, the distance from end to end being six feet. The blades could
be adjusted at any angle by clamping-screws. Both their edges and
the arms that carry them were beveled away to a sharp edge to dimin-
ish the effects of atmoshperic resistance. A wire stay was taken from
the base of each blade to the bottom of the upright shaft, to give rigid-
ity to the arms, and to prevent them from springing upwards. With
this apparatus experiments were made with weights attached to the up-
right serew-shaft, and the blades set at different pitches, or angles
of inclination. When the vanes were rotated rapidly, they rose and
floated on the air, carrying the weights with them. Much difficulty
was experienced in raising a heavy weight by a comparatively small
extent of surface, moving at ahigh velocity; the “slip” in these cases
being so great as to absorb all the poweremployed. The utmost effect
obtained in this way was to raise a weight of 6 pounds on 1 square foot
of sustaining surface, the planes having been set at a coarse pitch. To
keep up the rotation required about half the power a man could exert.

The ratio of weight to sustaining surface was next arranged in the
proportion approximating to that of birds. Two of the experiments are
here quoted, which gave the most satisfactory results. Weight of wings
and shaft, 174 ounces; area of two wings, 121 inches—equal to 110

The power required to drive was nearly the same in both experi-
ments—about equai to one-sixteenth part of a horse-power, or the third
part of the strength of a man as estimated by a constant force on the
nandle of 12 pounds in the first experiment and 10 in the second, the
radius of the handle being 5$ inches, and making seventy revolutions
per minute in the first case and eighty in the other.

These experiments are so far satisfactory in showing the small pitch
or angle or rise required for sustaining the weight stated, and demon-
strating the principle before alluded to, of the slow descent of planes
moving horizontally in the atmosphere at high velocities ; but the ques-
tion remains to be answered, concerning the disposal of the excessive
power consumed in raising a weight not exceeding that of a carrier-
pigeon, for unless this can be satisfactorily accounted for there is but
little prospect of finding an available power of sufficient energy in its
application to the mechanism for raising apparatus, either experimental

or otherwise, in the atmosphere. In the second experiment, the screw-
shaft made two hundred and forty revolutions, consequently, one vane
(there being two) was constantly passing over the same spot four hun-
dred and eighty times each minute, or eight times in a second. This
caused a descending current of air, moving at the rate of near 4 miles
per hour, almost sufficient to. blow a candle out placed 3 feet under-
neath. This is the result of “slip,” and the giving both a downward
and rotary motion to this column of air will account for a great part of
the power employed, as the whole apparatus performed the work of a
blower. If the wings, instead of traveling in a circle, could have been
urged continually forward in a straight line in a fresh and unmoved
body of air, the “slip” would have been so inconsiderable, and the
pitch, consequently, reduced to such a small angle as to add but little
to the direct forward atmospheric resistance of the edge.

The small flying screws, sold as toys, are well known. It is an easy
matter to determine approximately the force expended in raising and
maintaining them in the atmosphere. The following is an example of
one constructed of tin-plate with three equidistant vanes. This was
spun by means of a cord wound round a wooden spindle, fitted into a
forked handle as usual. The outer end of the coiled string was attached
a2 ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION.

to a small spring steelyard, which served as a handle to pull it out by.
The weight or degree at which the index had been drawn was after-
wards ascertained by the mark left thereon by a pointed brass wire. It
jS not necessary to know the time occupied in drawing out the string,
as this item in the estimate may be taken as the duration of the ascent;
for it is evident that if the same force is re-applied at the descent, it
would rise again, and a repeated series of these impulses will represent
the power required to prolong the flight of the instrument. It is there-
fore requisite to know the length of string and the force applied in
pulling it out. The following are the data:

From thisit may be computed that, in order to maintain the flight of the
instrument, a constant force is required of near 60 foot-power per minute
—in the ratio of about 3 horse-power for each hundred pounds raised
by such means. The force is perhaps over-estimated for a larger screw,
for as the size and weight is increased the power required would be
less than in this ratio. The result would be more satisfactory if tried
with a sheet-iron screw impelled by a descending weight.

Methods analogous to this have been proposed for attempting aérial
locomotion ; but experiment has shown that a screw rotating in the air
is an imperfect principle for obtaining the means of flight and support-
ing the needful weight, for the power required is enormous. Suppose
a machine to be constructed having some adequate supply of force, the
screw rotating vertically at a certain velocity will raise the whole.
When the desired altitude is obtained, nearly the same velocity of rev-
olution and the same excessive power must be continued, and con-
sumed entirely in ‘‘slip,” or in drawing down a rapid current of air.

If the axis of the screw is slightly inclined from the perpendicular, the
whole machine will travel forward. The “slip,” and consequently the
power, is somewhat reduced under these conditions ; but aswift forward
seed can not be effected by such means, for the resistance of theinclined
disk of the screw will be very great, far exceeding any form assimilat-
ing to the edge of the wing of a bird. But, arguing on the supposition
that a forward speed of 30 miles an hour might thus be obtained, even
then nearly all the power would be expended in giving an unnecessary
and rapid revolution to an immense serew, capable of raising a weight,
say, of 200 pounds, The weight alone of such a machine must cause it
to fail, and every revolution of the screw is a subtraction from the much
desired direct forward speed. A simple narrow blade or inclined plane
propelled in a direct course at this speed (which is amply sufficient for
sustaining heavy weights) is the best—and in fact the only means of
giving the maximum amount of supporting power with the least possi-
ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION. So

ble degree of “slip” and direct forward resistance. Thousands of ex-
amples in nature testify its suecess and show the principle in perfee-
tion,—apparently the only one, and therefore beyond the reach of
amendment,—the wing of a bird, combining a propelling and supporting
organ in one, each perfectly efficient in its mechanical action.

This leads to the consideration of the amount of power requisite to
maintain the flight of a bird. Anatomists state that the pectoral mus.-
cles for giving motion to the wings are excessively large and strong;
but this furnishes no proof of the expenditure of a great amount of force
in the act of flying. The wings are hinged to the body like two powerful
levers, and some counteracting force of a passive nature, acting like a
spring under tension, must be requisite merely to balance the weight of
the bird. It can not be shown, that while there is no active motion,
there is any real exertion of muscular foree, for instance, during the
time when a bird is soaring with motionless wings. This must be con-
sidered as a state of equilibrium, the downward spring and elasticity
of the wings serving to support the body, the muscles in such a ease
performing like stretched india-rubber spring would do. The motion
or active power required for the performance of flight must be considered
exclusive of this.

It is difficult, if not impossible, by any form of dynamometer to ascer-
tain the precise amount of force given out by the wings of birds; but
this is perhaps not requisite in proof of the principle involved ; for when
the laws governing their movements in air are better understood it is
quite possible to demonstrate by isolated experiments the amount of
power required to sustain and propel a given weight and surface at any
speed.

If the pelican, referred to as weighing 21 pounds with near the same
amount of wing area (in square feet), were to descend perpendicularly,
it would fall at the rate of 1,320 feet per minute (22 feet per second),
being limited to this speed by the resistance of the atmosphere.

The standard generally employed in estimating power is by the rate
of descent of a weight. Therefore, the weight of the bird being 21
pounds, which falling at the above speed, will expend a force on the air
set in motion nearly equal to 1 horse (.84 horse-power) or that of five men;
and conversely, to raise this weight again perpendicularly upon a yield-
ing support like air, would require even more power than this expres-
sion, which it is certain that a pelican does not possess; nor does it
appear that any large bird has the faculty of raising itself on the wing
perpendicularly in a still atmosphere. A pigeon is able to accomplish
this nearly, mounting to the top of a house in a very narrow compass ;
but the exertion is evidently severe and ean only be maintained for a
short period. For its size, this bird has great power of wing; but this
is perhaps far exceeded in the humming-bird, which, by the extremely
rapid movements of its pinions, sustains itself for more than a minute
in still air in one position. The muscular force required for this feat is
314 ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION.

much greater than for any other performance of flight. The body of the
bird at the time is nearly vertical. The wings uphold the weight, not
by striking vertically downwards upon the air, but as inclined surfaces
reciprocating horizontally like a screw, but wanting in its continuous
rotation in one direction, and in consequence of the less arising from
rapid alternations of motions, the power required for the flight will ex-
ceed that specified in the screw experiment before quoted, viz, 3 horse-
power for every 100 pounds raised.

We have here an example of the exertion of enormous animal force
expended in flight, necessary for the peculiar habits of the bird, and
for obtaining its food; but in the other extreme, in large heavy birds,
whose wings are merely required for the purpeses of migration or loco-
motion, flight is obtained with the least possible degree of power, and
this condition can only becommanded by arapid straight-forward course
through the air.

The sustaining. power obtained in flight must depend upon certain
laws of action and re-action between relative weights; the weight of a
bird, balanced, or finding an abutment, against the fixed inertia of a
far greater weight of air, continuously brought into action in a given
time. This condition is secured, not by extensive surface, but by great
length of wing, which, in forward motion, takes a support upon a wide
stratum of air, extending transversely to the line of direction.

The pelican, for example, has wings extending out 10 feet. If the
limits of motion imparted to the substratum of air, acted upon by the
incline of the wing, be assumed as 1 foot in thickness, and the velocity
of flight as 30 miles per hour, or 2,640 feet per minute, the stratum of
air passed over in this time will weigh nearly 1 ton, or one hundred times
the weight oi the body of the bird, thus giving such an enormous sup-
porting power that the comparatively small weight of the bird has but
little effect in deflecting the heavy length of the stratum downwards,
and therefore the higher the velocity of flight the less the amount of
‘‘ slip” or power wasted in compensation for descent.

As noticed at the commencement of this paper, large birds may be
observed to skim close above smooth water without ruffling the surface,
showing that during rapid flight the air does not give way beneath them,
but approximates towards a solid support. ;

In all inclined surfaces, moving rapidly through the air, the whole
sustaining power approaches toward the front edge; and, in order to
exemplify the inutility of surface alone, without proportionate length
of wing, take a plane 10 feet long by 2 broad, impelled with the nar-
row end forward, the first 12 or 15 inches will be as efficient at a high
speed in supporting a weight as the entire following portion of the
plane which may be cut off, thus reducing the effective wing-area of a
pelican, arranged in this direction, to the totally inadequate equivalent
of 25 square feet.

One of the most perfect natural examples of easy and long-sustained

ee

flight is the wandering albatross. ‘“ A bird for endurance of flight
probably unrivalled. Found over all parts of the Southern Ocean, It
seldom rests on the water. During storms, even the most terrific, it is
seen now dashing through the whirling clouds, and now serenely float-
ing, without the least observable motion of its outstretched pinions.”
The wings of this bird extend 14 or 15 feet from end to end, and meas-
ure only 84 inches across the broadest part. This conformation gives
the bird such an extraordinary sustaining power, that it is said to sleep
on the wing during stormy weather, when rest on the ocean is impossi-
ble. Rising high in the air, it skims slowly down, with absolutely mo-
tionless wings, till a near approach tothe waves awakens it, when it
rises again for another rest.

If the foree expended in actually sustaining along-winged bird upon
a wide and unyielding stratum of air, during rapid flight, is but a small
fraction of its strength, then nearly the whole is exerted in overcoming
direct forward resistance. In the pelican referred to, the area of the
body, at its greatest diameter, is about 1u0 square inches; that of the
pinions, 80. But as the contour of many birds during flight approxi-
mates nearly to Newton’s solid of least resistance, by reason of this
form, acting like the sharp bows of a ship, the opposing force against
the wind must be reduced down to one third or fourth part; this gives
one-tenth of a horse-power, or about half the strength of a man, ex-
pended during a flight of 30 miles per hour. Judging from the action
of the living bird when captured, it does not appear to be more power-
ful than here stated.

The transverse area of a carrier pigeon during flight (including the
outstretched wings) a little exceeds the ratio of 12 square inches for
each pound, and the wing surface, or sustaining area, 90 square inches
per pound.

Experiments have been made to test the resisting power of conical
bodies of various forms, in the following manner: A thin lath was
placed horizontally, so as to move freely on a pivot set midway; at one
end of the lath a circular card was attached, at the other end a sliding
clip traversed, for holding paper cones, having their bases the exact
size of the opposite disk. The instrument acting like a steelyard ; and
when held against the wind, the paper cones were adjusted at different
distances from the center, according to their forms and angles, in order
to balance the resistance of the air against the opposing flat surface.
The resistance was found to be diminished nearly in the ratio that the
height of the cone exceeded the diameter of its base.

It might be expected that the pull of the string of a flying kite
should give some indication of the force of inclined surfaces acting
against a current of air; but no correct data can be obtained in this
way. ‘The incline of a kite is far greater than ever appears in the case
of the advancing wing surface of a bird. The tail is purposely made
to give steadiness by a strong pull backwards trom the action of the
316 ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION.

wind, which also exerts considerable force on the suspended cord, which
for more than half its length hangs nearly perpendicularly. But the
kite, as a means of obtaining unlimited lifting and tractive power, in
certain cases where it might be usefully applied, seems to have been
somewhat neglected. For its power of raising weights, the following
quotation is taken from vol. xLI of the Transactions of the Society of
Arts, relating to Captain Dansey’s mode of communicating with a lee-
shore. The kite was made of a sheet of holland exactly 9 feet square,
extended by two spars placed diagonally, and as stretched spread a
surface of 55 square feet: ‘‘The kite, in a strong breeze, extended
1,100 yards of line five-eighths of an inch in circumference, and would
have extended more had it been at hand. It also extended 360 yards
of line, 13 inches in circumference, weighing 60 pounds. The holland
weighed 34 pounds; the spars, one of which was armed at the head
with iron spikes for the purpose of mooring it, 63 pounds; and the tail
was five times its length, composed of 8 pounds of rope and 14 of elm
plank, weighing together 22 pounds.”

We have here the remarkable fact of 921 pounds carried by a surface
of only 55 square feet.

As all such experiments bear a very close relation to the subject of
this paper, it may be suggested that a form of kite should be employed
for reconnoitering and exploring purposes, in lieu of balloons held by
ropes. These would be torn to pieces in the very breeze that would
render a kite most serviceable and safe. In the arrangement there
should be asmaller and upper kite, capable of sustaining a weight of
the apparatus. The lower kite should be as nearly as practicable in
the form of a circular flat plane, distended with ribs, with a car attached
beneath like a parachute. Four guy-ropes leading to the car would be
required for altering the angle of the plane—vertically with respect to
the horizon, and laterally relative to the direction of the wind. By
these means the observer could regulate his altitude so as to command
a view of a country in a radius of at least 20 miles; he could veer to a
great extent from side to side, from the wind’s course, or lower himself
gently, with the choice of a suitable spot for descent. Should the cord
break or the wind fail, the kite would, in either case, act as a para-
chute and as such might be purposely detached from the cord, which
then being sustained from the upper kite, could be easily recovered.
The direction of descent could be commanded by the guy-rope, these
being hauled taut in the required direction for landing.

The author has good reasons for believing that there would be less
risk associated with the employment of this apparatus than the recon-
noitering balloons that have now frequently been made use of in war-
fare.*

*The practical application of these suggestions appears to have been anticipated
some years previously, In a small work, styled the ‘“‘ History of the Charvolant or
Kite Carriage,” published by Longman & Co., appears the following remarks:
ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION. Fd

The wings of all tlying creatures, whether of birds, bats, butterflies,
or other insects, have this one peculiarity of structure in common: The
front, or leading edge, is rendered rigid by bone, cartilage, or a thicken-
ing of the membrane ; and in most birds of perfect fight even the indi-
vidual feathers are formed upon the same condition. In consequence
of this, when the wing is waved in the air, it gives a persistent force in
one direction, caused by the elastic re-action of the following portion of
the edge. The fins and tails of fishes act upon the same principle: in
the most rapid swimmers these organs are termed ‘“lobated and
pointed.” The tail extends out very wide transversely to the body, so
that a powerful impulse is obtained against a wide stratum of: water,
on the condition before explained. This action is imitated in Macin-
tosh’s screw-propeller, the blade of which is made of thin steel, so as to
be elastic. While the vessel is stationary, the blades are in a line with
the keel, but during rotation they bend on one side more or less, accord-

“These buoyant sails, possessing immense power, will, as we have before remarked,
serve as floating observatories. - - - Elevated in the air, a single sentinel,
with a perspective, could watch and report the advance of the most powerful forces,
while yet at a great distance. He could mark their line of march, the composition
of their force, and their general strength, long before he could be seen by the enemy.”
Again, at page 53, we have an account of ascents actually made as follows: ‘‘ Nor
was less progress ade in the experimental department, when large weights were re-
quired to be raised or transposed. While on this subject, we must not omit to observe
that the first person who soared aloft in the air by this invention was a lady, whose
courage would not be Cenied this test of its strength. An arm-chair was brought on
the ground, then lowering the cordage of the kite by slackening the lower brace, the
chair was firmly lashed to the main line, and the lady took her seat. The main-brace
being hauled taut, the huge buoyant sail rose aloft with its fair burden, continuing
to ascend to the height of 100 yards. On descending, she expressed herself much
pleased with the even motion of the kite, and the delightful prospect she had enjoyed.
Soon after this, another experiment of a similar nature took place, when the invent-
or’s son successfully carried out a design not less safe than bold—that of scaling, by
this powerful aerial machine, the brow of a cliff 200 feet in perpendicular height.
Here, after safely landing, he again took his seat in a chair expressly prepared for
the purpose, and, detaching the swivel-line, which kept it at its elevation, glided
gently down the cordage to the hand of the director. The buoyant sail employed on
this occasion was 30 feet in height, with a proportionate spread of canvas. The rise
of the machine was most majestic, and nothing could surpass the steadiness with
which it was maneuvered, the certainty with which it answered the action of the
braces, and the ease with which its power was lessened or increased. - - - Sub
sequently to this, an experiment of a very bold and novel character was made upon
an extensive down, where a wagon with a considerable load was drawn along, whilst
this huge machine, at the same time, carried an observer aloft in the air, realizing
almost the romance of flying.”

It may be remarked that the brace-lines here referred to were conveyed down the
main-line and managed below; but it is evident that the same lines could be managed
with eqnal facility by the person seated in the car above; and if the main-line were
attached to a water-drag instead of a wheeled car, the adventurer could cross rivers,
lakes, or bays, with considerable latitude for steering and selecting the point of
landing, by hauling on the port or starboard brace-lines as required. And from the
uniformity of the resistance offered by the water drag, this experiment could not be
attended with any greater amount of risk than a land flight by the same means,
318 ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION.

ing to the speed and degree of propulsion required, and are thus self-
compensating; and could practical difficulties be overcome would prove
to be a form of propeller perfect in theory.

In the flying mechanism of beetles there is a difference of arrange-
ment. When the elytra, or wing-cases, are.opened, they are checked
by a stop, which sets them ata fixed angle. It is probable that these
serve as ‘‘aero-planes,” for carrying the weight of the insect, while a
delicate membrane that folds beneath acts more as a propelling than a
supporting organ. A beetle can not fly with the elytra removed.

The wing of a bird or bat is both a supporting and propelling organ,
and flight is performed in a rapid course, as follows: During the down-
stroke it can be easily imagined how the bird is sustained; but in the
up-stroke the weight is also equally well supported, for in raising the
wing it is slightly inclined upwards against the rapidly passing air, and
as this angle is somewhat in excess of the motion due to the raising of
the wing, the bird is sustained as much during the up as the down
stroke—in fact, though the wing may be rising, the bird is still pressing
against the air with a force equal to the weight of its body. The fac-
ulty of turning up the wing may be easily seen when a large bird
alights, for after gliding down its aerial gradient, on its approach to the
ground it turns up the plane of its wing against the air; this checks its
descent, and it lands gently.

It has before been shown how utterly inadequate the mere perpen-
dicular impulse of a plane is found to be in supporting a weight when
there is no horizontal motion at the time. There is no material weight
of air to be acted upon, and it yields to the slightest force, however great
the velocity of impulse may be. On the other hand, suppose that a
large bird in full flight can make 40 miles per hour, or 3,520 feet per
minute, and perform one stroke per second. Now, during every frac-
tional portion of that stroke the wing is acting upon and obtaining an
impulse from a fresh and undisturbed body of air, and if the vibration
of the wing is limited to an arc of 2 feet, this by no means represents
the small force of action that would be obtained when in a stationary
position, for the impulse is secured upon a stratum of 58 feet in length
of air at each stroke. Sothat the conditions of weight of air for obtain-
ing support, equally well apply to weight of air and its re-action in pro-
ducing forward impulse.

So necessary is the acquirement of this horizontal speed, even in
commencing flight, that most heavy birds, when possible, rise against
the wind, and even run at the top of their speed to make their wings
available, as in the example of the eagle, mentioned at the commence-
ment of this paper. It is stated that the Arabs on horseback can
approach near enough to spear these birds, when on the plain, before
they are able to rise. Their habit is to perch on an eminence where
possible.

The tail of a bird is not necessary for flight. A pigeon can fly per-
ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION. 319

fectly with this appendage cut short off; it probably performs an im-
portant function in rapid steering, for it is to be remarked that most
birds that have either to pursue or evade pursuit are amply provided
with this organ.

The foregoing reasoning is based upon facts, which tend to show that
the flight of the largest and heaviest of all birds is really performed
with but a small amount of force, and that man is endowed with suffi-
cient muscular power to enable him also to take individual and extended
flights, and that success is probably only involved in a question of suit-
able mechanical adaptations. But if the wings are to be modelled in
imitation of natural examples, but very little consideration will serve
to demonstrate its utter impracticability when applied in these forms.
The following diagram, Fig. 1, would be about the proportions needed for

aman of medium weight. The wings @ @ must extend out 60 feet from
end to end and measure 4 feet across the broadest part. The man, ),
should be in a horizontal position, incased in a strong frame-work, to
which the wings are hinged at cc. The wings must be stiffened by
elastic ribs extending back from the pinions. These must be trussed
by a thin band of steel, e e, Fig. 2, for the purpose of diminishing the

Fig: 2.

PtSi (2 ne

weight and thickness of the spar. At the front, where the pinions are
hinged, there are two levers attached and drawn together by a spiral
spring, d, Fig. 2, the tension of which is sufficient to balance the weight
of the body and machine and cause the wings to be easily vibrated by
the movement of the feet acting on the treadles. This spring serves
the purposeof the pectoral muscles in birds. But with all such arrange-
ments the apparatus must fail; length of wing is indispensable! and a
spar 30 feet long must be strong, heavy, and cumbrous; to propel this
along through the air at a high speed would require more power than
any man could command.

In repudiating all imitations of natural wings, it does not follow that
the only channel is closed in which flying mechanism may prove suc-
cessful. Though birds do fly upon definite mechanical principles and
with a moderate exertion of force, yet the wing must necessarily be ¢
vital organ and member of the living body. Itimust havea marvellous
self-acting principle of repair in case the feathers are broken or torn;
it must also fold up in a small compass and form a covering for the
body.
320 ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION.

These considerations bear no relation to artificial wings; so in de-
signing a flying-machine, any deviations are admissible, provided the
theoretical conditions involved in flight are borne in mind.

Having remarked how thin a stratum of air is displaced beneath the
wings of a bird in rapid flight, it follows that in order to obtain the
necessary length of plane for supporting heavy weights, the surfaces may
be superposed, or placed in parallel rows, with an interval between
them. A dozen pelicans may fly one above the other without mutual
impediment, as if framed together; and it is thus shown how 2 hun-
dred-weight may be supported in a transverse distance of only 10 feet.

In order to test this idea, six bands of stiff paper, 3 feet long and 3
inches wide, were stretched at a slight upward angle, in a light rectan-
gular frame, with an interval of 3 inches between them, the arrange-
ment resembling an open Venetian blind. When this was held against
a breeze, the lifting power was very great, and even by running with
it in a calm it required much force to keep it down. The success of
this model led to the construction of one of a sufficient size to carry the

Fig.3.

weight of a man. Fig. 3 represents the arrangement: aa is a thin
plank, tapered at the outer ends, and attached at the base to a triangle,
b, made of similar plank, for the insertion of the body. The boards
aa were trussed with thin bands of iron, cc, and at the ends were ver-
tical rods, dd. Between these were stretched five bands of holland, 15
inches broad and 16 feet long, the total length of the web being 80 feet.
This was taken out after dark into a wet piece of meadow land, one
November evening, during a strong breeze wherein it became quite
unmanageable. The wind acting upon the already tightly-stretched
webs, their united puli caused the central boards to bend considerably,
with a twisting, vibratory motion. During a lull, the head and shoul-
ders were inserted in the triangle, with the chest resting on the base-
board. A sudden gust caught up the experimenter, who was carried
some distance from the ground, and the affair falling over sideways
broke up the right-hand set of webs.

In all new machines we gain experience by repeated failures, which
frequently form the stepping. stone to ultimate success. The rude con-
trivance just described (which was but the work of a few hours) had
taught first that the webs, or aero-planes, must not be distended in a
frame, as this must of necessity be strong and heavy, to withstand
their combined tension; second, that the planes must be made so as
either to furl or fold up, for the sake of portability.
ON AERIAL LOCOMOTION, a2

in order to meet these conditions the following arrangement was after-
wards tried: aa, Figs. 4 and 5, is the main spar, 16 feet long, half an

Fig.4.

inch thick at the base, and tapered both in breadth and thickness to the
end; to this spar was fastened the panels bb, having a base-board for
the support of the body. Under this and fastened to the end of the
main spar is a thin steel tie-band, ee, with struts starting from the spar.
This serves as a foundation of the superposed aero planes, and though
very light, was found to be exceedingly strong, for when the ends of
the spar were placed upon supports, the middle bore the weight of the
body without any strain or deflection; and further, by separation at
the base-board, the spars could be folded back with a hinge to half their
length. Above this were arranged the aero planes, consisting of six
webs of thin holland 15 inches broad ; these were kept in parallel planes
by vertical divisions 2 feet wide, of the same fabric, so that when dis-
tended by a current of air, each 2 feet of web pulled in opposition to
its neighbor; and finally, at the ends (which were each sewn over laths)
a pull due to only 2 feet had to be counteracted, instead of the strain
arising from the entire Jength, as in the former experiment. The end-
pull was sustained by vertical rods, sliding through loops on the trans-
verse ones at the ends of the webs, the whole of which
could fall flat on the spar till raised and distended by a
breeze. The top was stretched by a lath, /, and the
system kept vertical by stay cords taken from a bow-
sprit carried out in front, shown in Tig. 6. All the
front edges of the aero-planes were stiffened by bands
of crinoline steel. This series was for the supporting =

arrangement, being equivalent to a length of wing of 96 feet. Exterior
to this, two propellers were to be attached, turning on spindles just
above the back. They are kept drawn up by a light spring, and pulled

down by cords or chains running over pulleys in the panels bb, and
fastened to the end of a swiveling cross-yoke, sliding on the base-board.
By working this cross-piece with the feet, motion will be communicated
to the propellers, and by giving a longer stroke with one foot than the
other a greater extent of motion will be given to the corresponding pro-
peller, thus enabling the machine to turn just as oars are worked in a
rowing-boat. The propellers act on the same principle as the wing of a
bird or bat; their ends being made of fabric, stretched by elastic ribs,
a simple waving motion up and down will give a strong forward impulse.
In order to stop, the legs are lowered beneath the base-board, and the
experimenter must run against the wind.

An experiment recently made with this apparatus developed a cause
of failure. The angle required for producing the requisite supporting
power was found to be so small, that the crinoline steel would not keep
the front edges in tension. Some of them were borne downward and
more on one side than the other, by the operation of the wind, and this
also produced a strong fluttering motion in the webs, destroying the
integrity of their plane surfaces, and fatal to their proper action.

Another arrangement has since been constructed, having laths sewn
in both edges of the webs, which are kept permanently distended by
cross-stretchers. All these planes are hinged to a vertical central
board, so as to fold back when the bottom ties are released; but the
system is much heavier than the former one, and no experiments of any
consequence have as yet been tried with it.

It may be remarked that although a principle is here defined, yet
considerable difficulty is experienced in carrying the theory into prac-
tice. When the wind approaches to 15 or 20 miles per hour, the lifting
power of these arrangements is all that is requisite, and by additional
planes, can be increased to any extent; but the capricious nature of the
ground-currents is a perpetual source of trouble.

Great weight does not appear to be of much consequence, if carried
in the body ; but the aero-planes and their attachments seem as if they
were required to be very light, otherwise they are awkward to carry,
and impede the movements in running and making a start. In a
dead calm it is almost impracticable to get sufficient horizontal speed
by mere running alone to raise the weight of the body. Once off the
ground, the speed must be an increasing one, if continued by suitable
propellers. The small amount of experience as yet gained appears to
indicate that if the aero-planes could be raised in detail, like a super-
posed series of kites, they would first carry the weight of the machine
itself, and next relieve that of the body.

Until the last few months no substantial attempt has been made to
construct a flying-machine in accordance with the principle involved
in this paper, which was written seven years ago. The author trusts
that he has contributed something towards the elucidation of a new
theory, and shown that the flight of a bird in its performance does net

require that enormous amount of force usually supposed, and that in
fact birds do not exert more power in flying than quadrupeds in run-
ning, but considerably less; for the wing movements of a large bird,
travelling at a far higher speed in the air, are very much slower; and
where weight is concerned, great velocity of action in the locomotive
organs is associated with great force.

It is to be hoped that further experiments will confirm the correct-
ness of these observations, and with a sound working theory upon
which to base his operations man may yet command the air with the
same facility that birds now do.

By Ay BLYrr
Translated by W. 8. Daas, F. L. 8.

This memoir is an attempt to further develop and establish ideas
which I put forward five years ago. It contains an attempt to establish
a chronology in geology. It sets forth what the English call ‘a work-
ing hypothesis,” without claiming to be anything else. It was the dis-
tribution of plants which first introduced the author to this great ques-
tion; but the problem of a chronology in geology can not be solved
without the co-operation, it may perhaps be said, of all naturalists. It
certainly can not finally be solved by any one man. In putting forth
my hypothesis I must in the first place beg for indulgence for the many
faults and imperfections with which such an attempt must be affected,
and express a hope that in any case the hypothesis may be found worthy
of being further tested.

Having endeavored in several memoirs on the distribution of plants,
on peat-mosses, shore-lines, terraces, and morainic ridges, to show that
climates undergo periodical changes, I published in the Transactions
of the Society of Sciences for 1883 (No.9) a memoir on alternation of
strata and its possible significance for the chronology of geology and
the theory of the modification of species. The essential contents of this
paper, as regards the present question of geological chronology, were
as follows:

Alternations of strata, under which term is understood an alternation
of geological formations of different constitution, can be produced by
local conditions of rapidly passing change, without the action of general
and persistent causes. But there are also causes of the latter kind
which effect an alternation of the strata. Two such periodically acting
vauses are traceable in the geological series of deposits—a_ shorter,

somewhat regular one, and a longer, more irregular one. The former
effects a change of climate, the strength of the marine currents alter-
nately diminishing and increasing during thousands of years; the latter
longer period effects a rise or fall of the sea in relation to the land, and
an alternation of deep-sea formations with shore-formations or fresh-
water deposits. The opinion has been expressed that these periods,
which are traced in the series of deposits, might possibly stand in con-
nection with the two cosmical periods revealed by astronomy—the pre-
cession of the equinoctial points, and variations in the eccentricity of
the earth’s orbit; although in the memoir referred to it is not attempted
to show in what manner such a connection could be established. But
if, with the aid of these two hypotheses, we construct an “artificial”
series of strata, we find that one with no less than forty-six changes of
deposit may be recognized, bed by bed, in the Tertiary formations of
the Paris basin.

The result may encourage us to test still further the correctness of
the two suppositions. As regards the precession this has been at-
tempted in my paper “On the probable cause of the periodical change
in the strength of the marine currents.”*

The contents of this memoir are essentially as follows: The preces-
sion of the equinoctial lines causes the summers in about 10,500 years
to be longer, and in the following 10,500 years shorter, than the win-
ters. The conditions are opposite in the northern and southern hemis-
pheres. The difference between the number of winter and summer
days increases with the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit.

The cooling of continents under high latitudes, in the winter, produces
a diminished pressure of air over the sea. This low pressure draws air
from lower latitudes. For this reason, in the Atlantic, southwest winds
prevail. Thus, in the winter, the southwest winds of the North At-
lantic are on an average three times as strong as in the summer, in con-
sequence of the great refrigeration of the mainland. In the semi-period
when the winter falls in aphelion the average annual wind-force is con-
sequently greater. Now itis the prevalent wind that produces the
powerful marine currents, such as the warm current in the Atlantic
Ucean. The strength of the marine currents is dependent upon the
average wind-force for the last great time period. Now as this aver-
age wind-force is periodically variable in consequence of the precessions,
the strength of marine currents and the temperature of the sea must
also be subject to a periodical variability. For about 10,500 years the
warm sea-current will increase, to diminish in the next similar period,
and so on constantly through all time. When the winter falls in
aphelion, the difference between the littoral and inland climates will
increase. The propelling force of currents in the sea will increase and
diminish by 1 to 5 per cent. upon their total annual value according as

the winter falls in aphelion or perihelion, and according as the eceen-
tricity of the carth’s orbit is small or great.

Such an alteration in the strength of the marine currents will pro-
duce an alteration of the climate, which however wil! not be very im-
portant, but which will nevertheless be great enough to leave its traces
in the deposits. During colder and drier seasons the streams are fed in
great part by spring water. This water has drained slowly through
the beds and is charged with dissolved materials; but the small quan-
tity of water and the feebler streams carry less clay, sand, and gravel.
During rainy seasons, the rain carries down quantities of such materi-
als, but it flows off rapidly, and as it for the most part runs only over
the surface it has not time to dissolve somuch. Although the springs
flow more abundantly during rainy seasons, their.water only mingles
with the rain-water. The streams are therefore poorer in dissolved
material, but they contain more water, and their more powerful current
carries more clay, sand, and gravel into the basin. Hence the drier
seasons will be richer in purely chemical deposits, which will be trans-
ported in the clearer water; the wet seasons in mechanical deposits.
Strata of both kinds are formed, of course, at all times, but they are
deposited at different places in accordance with the variation in the
quantity of rain. Thus, Lassume that when thick deposits of river-
sand and clay alternate with each other, when soft clay and marl alter-
nate with hard marl or liinestone, when thick strata of loose sand alter-
nate with sandstone, which is bound together by chemically produced
cement (iron, silica, lime), when clay alternates with Septaria-beds, ete.,
then, in each case, the first-named deposit shows itself to belong to
seasons with a warmer sea and a greater quantity of rain, which, as
regards western Europe, will mean seasons with the winter in aphelion.

That this alternation of deposits implies a period of several thousand
years’ duration is shown by the fact that the fossils change rapidly
through the strata. In the Tertiary formations there are only a few,
often only four to five, such changes of deposits in each stage. The
whole Oligocene period has only about thirty, the Miocene still fewer,
and the Pliocene barely twenty such changes.

In this way, in my opinion, the precessions stamp themselves upon
the strata, and this should therefore furnish a means of measuring
tine. The greater the eccentricity of the orbit, the more strongly
marked will the periods be; when the orbit approaches the circular
form, they are less recognizable.*

* But the perihelion also shifts to and fro. The time between two aphelia in the
winter solstice varied thus in post-glacial times by fully 4600 years. This must have
some influence. The longer a period with winters in aphelion lasts the longer will
the warm currents in the Atlantic increase in strength, and the greater will be the
changes of climate. The mild period during which Bergenian sea-animals lived in
the Christiania Fjord, and which has left its traces elsewhere in our hemisphere, was
in my opinion, a consequence of such an unusually long period with the winter in
328 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST.

teferring for other things to the two memoirs cited and to my paper
‘¢‘On Variations of the Weather in the course of time” (Letterstedtske
Nordisk Tidskrift, 1885, in English, in Fork. Vid. Selsk. i Christiania,
1886, No. 8) I will pass on to examine whether there is any probable
ground for supposing that the other proposition is also correct, whether
it is conceivable that under high latitudes the sea-level rises and sinks
with the eecentricity of the earth’s orbit.

Great part of the earth’s surface consists of strata which still lie un-
disturbed in their original horizontal position. These parts are called
“Stables” by Suess. But in many places the crust of the earth is so
traversed by clefts and fissures that it may be compared to a breccia.
Fragments are often displaced relatively by thousands of feet. Strata
which originally lay horizontally are folded, thicknesses of 7,000 to 8,000
feet are bent asif they were straws (Kjerulf, Udsigt over Norges Geologi,
1879, p. 76). Moreover, the folded strata are upheaved far above their
original level. Even marine formations so recent as the Kocene are up-
lifted to heights of 21,000 feet above the sea (Suess, Antlitz der Erde, I,
p. 564). Sometimes they stand vertically, or are inverted, so that oMer
strata cover the younger ones. Through fissures eruptive masses are
brought forth, and have covered thousands upon thousands of square
kilometers. The distribution of land and sea also varies. It is indeed
supposed that the great depths of the ocean and the great continents
have essentially retained their original distribution from the most an-
cient times, but the shore-lines wander periodically to and fro; and these
changes of the earth’s surface have taken place from earliest times, and
are still in action at the present day.

Geologists in general seek the explanation of these phenomena in the
cooling and contraction of the body of the earth. The earth’s crust
folds, just as the skin of an apple wrinkles as the apple dries. The lead-
ing geologists of the present day adopt this theory, and A. Geikie in his
“Text-book of Geology” (London, 1882, p. 287) says truly: ‘ With
modifications, the main cause of terrestrial movements is still sought in
secular contraction.”

According to this doctrine changes in the crust of the earth are due
to the interior contracting more strongly than * the crust,” so that the
latter is too large for it. Its weight drags it down. By this means
great horizontally acting pressure is produced in the crust, which must
then become folded and cracked in places. The fragments sink down.

3y this means are formed what Suess has called “ Hinbriiche.” When
a part of the crust remains in position while all around it sinks, there
is produced what Suess has called a “ Horst.” The old theory of forces

aphelion. The winter solstice fell in aphelion (according to Croll) 61,300, 33,300, and
11,700 years ago. Themiddle of the Atlantic period with Bergenian sea-animals in
the Christiania Fjord fell, from the testimony of the peat-mosses 33,000 to 34,000 years
ago, therefore in accordance with the period of 28,000 years.

acting vertically from below is most decidedly rejected by Suess. He
and Heim have shown, by their investigations of the Alps, that the
foldings of the Alps are caused by lateral pressure, and that such Jat-
eral pressure is sufficient to lift great chains of mountains into the air.
But Suess goes still further, for ina memoir, ** Ueber die vermeintlichen
sicularen Schwankungen einzelner Theile der Erdoberfliiche” (in Verh.
K. K. Geol. Reichs., 1880, pp. 171 et seq.), he even denies any elevation by
forces acting vertically from below ;—neither mountain nor continent is
elevated in this manner. He says (I. ¢. p. 180): “There are no vertical
movements of the solid ground, with the exception of those which pro-
ceed directly from the formation of folds. We shall have to resolve to
abandon the doctrine of secular oscillations of continents.”

A. de Lapparent, who sharply criticises Suess’s, theory of ‘¢ Horste”
(Bull. Soc. Géol. France, sér. 3, tome XV, pp. 215 et seq.), nevertheless
agrees with him that the cooling of the earth has formed great folds in
the crust, and denies that any elevations are not caused by foldings.
Thus he says (Ll. ¢. p. 217): “Itis no longer necessary to oppose to the
doctrine of absolute elevations produced by forces acting directly from
below upwards, a protestation which has lost its object. For the par-
tisans of vertical impulsions are nowadays more than scattered, and with
the exception of a very few belated persons no one would now venture
to ascribe to such an action an important part in the formation of
mountains.” As he makes no limitations, if must be assumed that he
will not recognize any forces acting from below to elevate whole land-
masses. . .

According to a statement of Suess’s, in his Antlite der Hrde (1885, Bd.
I, p. 741), he seems to find an essential reason for denying elevation by
forces acting perpendicularly from below, in that we are quite ignorant
of any force which could be capable of causing such an elevation.

The theories of Hutton and von Buch as to the action of sueh forces
seem therefore to be rejected by geologists of the present day. Nev-
ertheless there are still a few who hold similar opinions. Thus J.
C. Russel (U.S. Geological Survey, Fourth Annual Report, Washing-
ton, 1884, pp. 452, 453,) says that the fractures in “ the Great Basin”
are not in consequence of any lateral pressure, but are caused by an
extension in a horizontal direction: ‘“ The fractures are closely related
to an extension of the strata by upheaval.” It seems to me improba-
ble that such a relation should be explicable by a folding. C.E. Dutton
also (U.S. Geological Survey, Sixth Annual Report, 1885, p. 198,) at the
same time that he recognizes that many chains are folded by lateral
pressure, says, with regard to the mountain-masses in Western North
America: “The mountains of the West have not been produced by
horizontal compression, but by some unknown forces beneath which
have pushed them up.”*

*The current doctrines with regard to refrigeration and compression are discussed
by Pierce in a discourse before the American Academy on the 11th»May, 1869 (see
330 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

It is not my intention to maintain that refrigeration has not at all
contributed to give the surface of the earth the form which it now pos-
sesses. But I think that an auxiliary theory is required, which, while
it will not entirely supersede the old theory, may yet serve to explain
things which the old theory can not render comprehensible.

Henry H. Howorth has written two memoirs, namely, ‘“ Recent Ele-
vations of the Earth’s Surface in the Northern Circumpolar Regions”
(Journ. Roy. Geogr. Soc., 1873, vol. XLIM, p. 240) and “ Recent Changes
in the Southern Circumpolar Regions” (op. cit., 1874, vol. XLIV, p. 252),
in which he has brought together what was at that time known as to the
displacement of shore-lines in the last section of geological time, and the
principal result of his investigations is summed up in the following
words: ‘* The South Pole, as well as the North, is a focus of protrusion,
the land around it is being gradually elevated.” In the last section of
geological time, ¢. e., in the Post-glacial period, the land has in general
sunk under lower and risen under higher latitudes.

Suess arrived at a similar result in his above-cited memoir (Verh. K.
K. Geol. Reichs. 1880, pp. 174-175). He has likewise studied the dis-
placement of coast-lines over the whole earth during the period nearest
to the present time, and sums up the result as follows: * Terraced land
i.e. land whieh has recently risen in relation to the sea] appears every-
where in the high northern latitudes, so far as man has hitherto penetrated
into these solitudes. It also extends far, although not everywhere
equally far, down into the temperate latitudes, but generally decreasing
in height. In other words, around the North Pole, and far down, the
sum of the negative [7. e., descending] movements of the coast-lines is
greater than the positive; towards the south, however, these two sums
approximate more and more. In tropical seas, in the regions of the coral
formations, the opposite condition occurs, the sum of the positive move-
ments preponderates. Further towards the south, beyond 25° to 35°
south latitude, the terraced land of the north begins againin South America,
South Africa, South Australia, and New Zealand, i. e., the same prepon-
dlerance of the negative movements, with the same oscillating * charac-
ter as in the north.” The exceptions (according to Suess) are few and
of little importance.

Proc. Amer. Acad, Arts and Sci., 1873, vol. viul, p. 106), as also by O. Fisher (‘‘ Physics
of the Karth’s Crust,” 1881) and Dutton (‘‘A Criticism upon the Contractional Hypoth-
esis,” in Amer. Journ. Sci., 1874, ser. 3, vol. vitt, pp. 113 et. seq.). They all consider
that contraction is not sufficient to explain the known phenomena; nay, the last-
named even thinks that the phenomena are opposed to this. A. de Lapparent, on the
other hand, in his memoir ‘‘ Contraction et refroidissement du globe ” (Bull. Soc. Géol.
l'rance, 1887, sér. 3, vol. XV, pp. 333 et seq.) seeks to prove that they are quite suffi-
cient.

* With this word Suess alludes to the circumstances that the coast-lines and terraces
occur at various levels one above the other. He thinks that each of these levels in-
dicates an oscillation of the sea. I believe that the greater part of these levels are

merely a consequence of climatic changes due to the precessions. (See Forh. Vid.
Selsk. Christ, 1881, No. 4.)
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST. 331

Howorth and Suess have therefore both come to the same result. But
their explanations are directly opposite. Howorth thinks that it is the
land which has arisen under higher latitudes ; that the earth, as it were,
swells up towards the poles and contracts under the tropics. Suess,
who will not admit any other elevations than those which are the con-
sequences of foldings, is of the opinion that it is the sea which has flowed
towards the lower latitudes. He indicates as a possible explanation
changes in the length of the day and the centrifugal force. But this
change should then only have acted upon the sea, and therefore, since
the sea has flowed towards the equator, the day should have been con-
siderably shorter in the last geological period. We shall see hereafter
that there is no known cause which could have produced such a short-
ening of the sidereal day as would serve to explain what Suess wants
to explain. The old theory of refrigeration is scarcely fitted to explain
these conditions indicated by Howorth and Suess. Even Suess, who is
a zealous adherent of the theory of contraction, is obliged here to seek
for another explanation.

Another theory however has come forth in our day, a theory which,
no doubt, is destined to play a great part in geology. It is derived
originally from the celebrated philosopher J. Kant. In 1754 he wrote
a memoir entitled **‘ Untersuchung der Frage: ob die Erde eine Verin-
derung ihrer Achsendrehung erlitten habe?” In this it is shown that,
by reason of the attraction of the moon and sun, the sea is constantly
in a2 movement opposite to the daily revolution of the earth. The fric-
tion of the tidal waves against the bottom and coasts of the sea dimin-
ishes the force of the axial revolution and works constantly in the same
direction, so that the sidereal days must for this reason always become
longer and longer. The moon always turns the same side towards the
earth because the earth’s tidal action on the mass of the moon while still
fluid, constantly rendered the axial revolution of the moon slower, until
at last the moon was compelled to turn always the same side toward the
earth.* In this way also, at some far distant period the earth will come
to turn the same side always to the moon. This opinion of Kant’s has
been recognized as correct by the first physicists of the present day, by
men such as Robert Mayer, Helmholtz, and W. Thomson.

There are certain peculiarities in the moon’s movements which astron-
omers are inclined to explain by the assumption that the sidereal day
gradually increases by reason of the friction of the tidal wave. But
with regard to this we will merely refer the reader to Thomson and
Tait’s “‘ Treatise on Natural Philosophy,” and to a memoir by the first-
named author, “ On Geological Time” ( Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow, 1868,
vol. (11. pp. 1 et seq.)

In their “ Natural Philosophy,” Thomson and Tait treat the problem

“Is it possible that the great abundance of old volcanoes in the moon may be ex-
plained by the great change which its axial rotation, and therefore probably also its
compression, has undergone ?
Doz ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

of the earth’s axial rotation. They state that there are various forces
which may be efficient in altering it,—some make the sidereal day
shorter, others make it longer. The latter are preponderant, and among
them the tidal wave plays the greatest part, so that for this reason in
the course of time the sidereal day becomes always longer and longer.
Refrigeration is the most powerful force which contributes towards the
shortening of the sidereal day, but its action is caleclated by Thomson
(Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow, l. e. p. 28) at only one six-thousandths of the
tidal wave; and this last action cannot be annulled by any of the other
forces, which act sometimes in one, sometimes in another, direction
(transport of material from higher to lower latitudes, or vice versa, ac-
cumulation of ice at the poles, ete.), and which in course of time cease
to act, the tidal wave acting always for millions of years in the same
direction (Thomson, “‘Geological Dynamics,” Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow,
1869, vol. III, part 2, p. 223).

In this way, therefore, the sidereal day must in course of time always
become longer and longer. Now what influence has this upon tie
earth? If this were fluid throughout, it is clear that it must at once
change its form. According as the sidereal day became longer and the
centrifugal force diminished, its compression must have decreased.
But the old theory of a fiery fiuid interior is now rejected by physicists,
and Thomson assumes that the earth is on the whole a solid body.
Now, will this solid body. retain its form without reference to the length
of the sidereal day, or will it yield and accommodate itself? The sea,
as a matter of course, will at once yield, and, as the centrifugal force
decreases, it will sink under lower, and rise under higher latitudes.
We know that the earth’s present form agrees, at all events in some de-
gree, with the length of the sidereal day. It has at present a com-
pression which about agrees with that which it should have from cal-
culation with its present axial rotation. As it may now be rendered
probable that the earth, since it acquired a solid surface, has lost so
much of its axial rotation that the sidereal day has become several
times longer, the circumstance that the compression suits that agreeing
with the axial rotation seems to show that the solid earth has really
changed its form. Jupiter and Saturn have a sidereal day respectively
of 9° 55™ and 10" 15", and a compression of one-seventeenth and
one-tenth. In Mars, the sidereal day of which is about 24° 37”, ob-
servations have not been able to prove definitely any compression.
There would seem, therefore, to be a connection between compression
and axial rotation. But it may indeed be objected that Jupiter and
Saturn are still possibly melted masses.

W. Thomson and Tait seem to be of opinion that the earth will not
change its form. They assume that it must have become solid not so
many millions of years since, seeing that the compression nearly coin-
cides with the axial rotation.

J. Croll (‘Climate and Time,” 1875, p. 335; see also Amer. Jour. Sci.,

ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTIUS CRUST. g30

1876, ser. 3, vol. x11, p. 457) thinks that the sidereal day lengthens so
slowly that denudation will have time to adjust the form of the earth
so as to coincide with the length of the sidereal day. Just as the sea
sinks under low latitudes, the continents in the same latitudes will also
become lower by denudation, but under higher latitudes the rising sea
will protect the land instead of denuding it; and in this way the earth
must then, by denudation alone, acquire a form always suitable to its
axial rotation. But this is evidently erroneous. Imagine the earth
formed of ellipsoidal layers with increasing solidity inwards. When the
centrifugal force diminished, equilibrium would be disturbed throughout
the whole mass, and in the interior tension would constantly increase.
Nay, not even at the surface can denudation alter the compression.
For we know from the recent investigations of the deep sea that in
this deep sea, far from the continents, no products of weathering are
present; only volcanic ashes and cosmical dust are deposited. Thus
denudation is not even capable of obliterating the inequalities of the
surface, still less the internal tension produced by the lengthening of
the sidereal day. And as the day has become considerably longer, the
sea ought to be collected towards the poles and the land under the
equator, in case the solid earth had not changed its form.

Others think that the earth may actually change its form. ‘The first
who expressed this opinion, so far as 1 ean find, is Herbert Spencer. In
the Philosophical Magazine (1847, vol. xxx, p. 194) he published a
small memoir, entitled “The Form of the Earth no proof of original
Fluidity,” in which he maintains that even the solid earth may change
its form, according as the centrifugal force changes. When a body in-
creases in size, the power of resistance to external forces increases only
as the square of the dimensions, while the wasting and destructive
forces (weight, centrifugal force) increase in the same proportion as the
mass of the body, and therefore as the cube of the dimensions. <As the
size increases we therefore come to a point at which even the most solid
body must yield to the forces. We must therefore assume, says Spencer,
that the earth, by reason of its size, must yield and change its form, in
case the centrifugal force, for example, changes; for the most solid
matter known to us, exposed to the same forces which act upon the
earth, would overstep the bounds of solidity before attaining a thousand-
inillionth part of the earth’s size. This argument, in Professor Schid¢tz’s
opinion, is not tenable. At any rate, I believe that Spencer is the first
who expressed the opinion that even a solid earth can change its form.
In the above-cited discourse of 1869,* Peirce says that the lengthening
of the sidereal day may be supposed to have altered the form of the
solid earth. And Principal Dawson, in his “Story of the Barth and
Man” (ed. 9, 1887, p. 291), says that this alteration of form by reason
of the lengthening of the sidereal day must have taken place at longer
or shorter intervals. So long as the crust of the earth did not yield,

* See ante, p. 329, foot-note,
334 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

the sea will have flowed towards the poles; but when the tension be-
comes so great that the solid crust bursts, the equatorial regions will
sink in and the sea will flow again towards the equator. *

In the Philosophical Transactions for 1879, parts I and It, Prof. G.
Darwin has published a memoir the results of which are briefly as fol-
lows. He assumes that the earth possesses a small degree of plasticity,
and calculates the internal friction which the tidal action of the moon
and sun produce in such a body. He finds that both the sidereal day
and the month have become much longer, that the distance of the moon
has increased, that the obliquity of the ecliptic has diminished, and that
a great part of the internal heat is developed by the internal friction.
Forty-six million three hundred thousand years ago, according to his
calculation, the sidereal day was 15" 30™, and the moon’s distance 46.8
terrestrial radii (against 60.4 at present). But 56,180,000 years ago the
sidereal day was only 6" 45™ long, the moon’s distance only 9 terrestrial
radii, and the month only 1.58 day (one-seventeenth of its present
amount). The interior heat produced by friction in 57,000,000 years,
if applied at once, would suffice to heat the whole earth 17009 Fahr.t
He concludes that the compression has constantly diminished: ‘ the
polar regions must have been ever rising, and the equatorial ones falling
though as the ocean followed these changes they might quite well have
left no geological traces.t The tides must have been very much more
frequentand larger, and accordingly the rate of oceanic denudation much
accelerated. The more rapid alternation of day and night [57,000,000
years ago, according to Darwin, the year had 1,300 days] would proba-
bly lead to more sudden and violent storms; and the increased rota-
tion of the earth would augment the violence of the trade-winds, which,
in their turn, would affect oceanic currents. §

* Similar opinions are expressed by Dr. E. Reyer (‘‘ Die Bewegung im Festen,” in
Jahrb. K. K. Geol. Reichs. Wien, 1880, vol. Xxx, pp. 543 et seq.). W. B. Taylor, in a
memoir On the Crumpling of the Earth’s Crust” (Amer. Journ. Sci., 1885, ser 3, vol.
XXX, pp. 249 et seq.), expresses himself against the theory of the earth’s contraction,
and thinks that the lengthening of the sidereal day is the cause of the changes in the
crust. A. Winchell, in a memoir on the ‘Sources of Trend and Crustal Surplusage ”
(Amer. Journ, Sci. l. c. p. 417), endeavors to show that the diminishing centrifugal force
has produced foldings in a north and south direction. J. E. Todd, in a paper entitled
“Geological Effects of a Varying Rotation of the Earth” (Amer. Naturalist, 1883,
vol, XVII, pp. 15 e¢ seq.), first enumerates the various forces which may actin acceler-
ating and retarding the axial rotation. He assumes that the axial rotation decreases
and increases abruptly, that it acts first upon the sea and afterwards upon the solid
crust, and that for this reason the sea rises and sinks abruptly in relation to the land.

tThis heat, produced by the internal friction, must contribute considerably to
diminish the secular refrigeration. Lapparent has not taken account of this in the
above-cited memoir on the contraction and cooling of the earth.

{In a subsequent article, however, Darwin supposes that the coast-lines will shift
in consequence of the lengthening of the sidereal day (Nature, Sept. 2, 1886, p. 422).

that ice, lead, and also cast-iron, even at ordinary temperatures, may
be squeezed so strongly that their interior parts change their relative
positions like particles in a fluid. Iron, in the solid state, by strong
pressure, is squeezed into cavities and adapts its form to the surround-
ings. On cutting through such pressed pieces it has been found that
the particles or crystals have arranged themselves by a flow-like move-
ment suited to the form of the cavity into which the piece has been
pressed.

We must here also refer to the interesting investigations of Reusch
upon pressed conglomerates. Under the strong pressure which has
acted in the earth’s crust, the pebbles in conglomerates are squeezed
out into lance-shaped bodies, and these bodies have even become folded.
(See Reusch, Stlurfossiler og pressede Konglomerater i Bergensskiferne,
Univ. Progr. Christiania, 1882, pp. 15, 117.)

By reason of the enormous pressure which prevails in the interior of
the earth, it must be supposed that masses from a certain depth are
more or less in a plastic state. A constant lengthening of the sidereal
day will cause the equatorial parts to increase in weight. So long as
the earth does not change its form, aconstantly increasing weight will
act upon the internal mass from lower towards higher latitudes. There
is, aS Darwin indicates (Nature, September 2, 1886, p. 422), reason to
believe, that finally, when the tension has reached a certain amount,
the earth will yield. A flow of plastic mass will be directed towards
higher latitudes, and persist until the earth has approximated to the
form suitable to the length of the sidereal day. When we consider the
numerous testimonies as to changes in the solid crust of the earth, and
the frequent elevations and depressions of the solid land relatively to
the sea, we may well agree with Darwin, that this view may claim more
probability than that of Thomson and Tait.

Wertheim has proved by experiment (according to Fock, Ldrobok i Fysi
ken, Stockholm, 1861, pp. 202, 219) that there is really no definite limit
of elasticity for any matter, but that they all, by the action even of
quite feeble forces, undergo small persistent changes, especially if these
forces have acted for a somewhat long time. When with feeble press-
ures we find no permanent change of form, this is because the force
has not acted long enough. The action of the force, therefore, when it
has a greater resistance to overcome, depends upon time. By “tension,”
says Schigtz (Larebog i Fysik, Christiania, 1881, p. 65), ‘lengthening
constantly increases, although very slowly, after it first commences ;
therefore a weight which has acted for a short time will not produce
persistent elongation such as it would be if it were allowed to act for
a longer time. This applics not only to tension, but generally ; and
hence it comes about that wires slacken in course of time, and that
beams bend little by little. A thread is worn out by less force when
the pressure is long continued than when it is applied for a shorter time.”

It seems to me that here we have a force which may be capable of
336 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

effecting displacements in the solid earth. I believe that this is ‘the
unknown foree from below” which has elevated the mountains of west-
ern North America, and to which Dutton appeals. The sidereal day
increases very slowly. The sea adjusts itself in accordance witb the
smallest change in the length of the day and rises slowly under high
latitudes. But the solid earth offers resistance to change of form, and
begins to give way only when the tension reaches a certain amount.
When this period has arrived the crust also begins to rise under high
latitudes. Under lower latitudes the movement takes place in the oppo-
site direction. The solid earth probabiy is a little behind the sea in its
movements, and while the sea moves evenly and uninterruptedly, the
change of form in the solid earth must perhaps take place more spas-
modically, with intervening periods of rest, during which new tension
is set up.

‘The elevation of mountains,” says A. Geikie (‘ Text-book of Geology,’
1882, p. 917), is in most cases due to a long succession of such move-
ments ;” and (I. ¢ p. 919) ** the elevation of mountains, like that of con-
tinents, has been occasional, and so to speak, paroxysmal.” Upheavals
of the crust take place repeatedly along the same fissure (see, e. g.,
Brégger, Bildungsgeschichte des Kristianiafjords, 1886, p. 78). Some-
thing of the same kind occurs in volcanic eruptions. Volcanoes rest
for a shorter or longer time between the different eruptions. Basaltic
jayers alternate with sedimentary deposits. Harthquakes are a couse-
quence of a tension set up, to which the crust suddenly yields. All
this indicates that the crust of the earth does not immediately accom-
modate itself to the forces, but that it yields only when the constantly
increasing pressure has approximated to a certain amount. It seems
moreover to follow from geological investigations that there are periods
in the earth’s history when changes have taken place on a larger scale
than usual. In his “ Text-book” above cited (pp. 197, 198) A. Geikie
refers to the great eruptions (“ fissure-eruptions ”) which have taken
place in both the Old and the New World, in which melted masses
burst forth from numerous fissures and overflowed thousands of square
miles. The Vulcanism of the present day seems feeble in comparison
with these gigantic eruptions.

We will now pass to the inquiry whether these changes in the form
of the earth may stand in any relation of dependency to the periodical
variations of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. We start from
the fact that Thomson and Tait are right when they say that the tidal
wave is the most powerful of the forces which contribute to change the
length of the day. But besides the tidal wave of the sea, the interior
friction accepted by Darwin, (‘ the bodily tides ”) is also effective. Both,
of course, are dependent upon the distance of the sun and moon; and
we therefore examine whether the tidal action of these bodies upon the
earth varies with the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. It appears from
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF’ THE EARTH’S CRUST. Bat

Darwin’s investigations that the lunar tides in very distant periods
must have been much greater than now. I disregard this, as the time
in question is so long ago, and because the profiles, which later on will
combine in curves for the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, come down
from a past geologically so near. When I perceived that the depend-
ence of the tidal wave upon the eccentricity might be of geological im-
portance, I applied to the observer, H. Geelmuyden, who with his usual
kindness has given me the following answer:

‘The action of the eccentrictity of the earth’s orbit, e, upon the force
which produces tide and ebb, and which, for the sake of brevity, I will
call the tidal force, is as follows:—Let r be the sun’s distance, then

“The monthly mean value of the moon’s tidal force will of course, in
the same way, be dependent upon the eccentricity of the moon’s orbit;
but as this is not subject to any noticeable secular variation, it does not
come under consideration. On the other hand, the moon’s mean dis-
tance is dependent, although only to an extremely small extent, upon
the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, namely so that the moon’s tidal
force becomes

proportion to the solar tides most nearly as 5: 2), its action upon the
whole tidal wave is ;35.3=;'; of the former.”

Thus we see that the tidal force rises and sinks with the eccentricity
of the earth’s orbit. It varies by about =4;, of its value from the highest
to the lowest eccentricity. This force is the most important foree for the
alteration of the day, and it makes itlonger. The most important force
for shortening the day, according to Thomson, will be the refrigeration
of the earth, but he has calculated its value at only ,,i;> of the tidal force
and (he has only taken into account the marine tidal wave). If, therefore,
the tidal force diminishes and increases by ;3; ofits value, this period-
ical variation can not compete with forces which act in the opposite
direction; and we may therefore conclude that the sidereal day is con-
stantly becoming ionger, but that its increase is periodically stronger
and weaker. It increases in length more and more rapidly so long as
the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit increases, more and more slowly so
long as the ecccentricity diminishes. In other words, the centrifugal
force diminishes and the equatorial regions increase in weight more and
more rapidly under an increasing, and more and more slowly under a
diminishing, eccentricity.

As has been stated, there prevails, even among physicists, a disa-
greement as to how far the earth will change its form in case the cen-
trifugal force varies. Thomson is most inclined to believe that it will
not; Darwin is of opinion that it will. And among other physicists
whom I have consulted a similar divergence prevails upon this point.
One thinks that a lengthening of the day even by several hours will be
incapable of altering the form of the solid earth; another believes that
the solid earth will probably change its form just as easily as the sea.
And with regard to the rapidity with which the sidereal day lengthens,
opinions are just as much divided. Darwin regards as possible, varia-
tions much greater than those which agree with the action of the tidal
waves calculated by Thomson for recent times. It is therefore clear
that this problem can hardly yet be finally solved, and that different
hypotheses will be for the present admissible. We will therefore select
that which is best fitted to explain the facts, assuming that the varia-
tion of the tidal wave with the eccentricity of the orbit may possibly
be the canse of the periodical displacement of coast-lines. But we put
forth this hypothesis with all possible reserve. Divergencies of opin-
ion between the most esteemed physicists upon this matter, and the
neat manner in which the hypothesis is supported by many facts, alone
give us the courage to put forward conjectures which many will proba-
bly regard as not only bold, but even improbable,

ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 339

The motive force of alterations in the form of the earth should there-
fore be periodically variable with the eccentricity of the orbit. The sea,
which is fluid, adjusts itself at once in accordance with the smallest
change in the length of the day. But the solid earth offers resistance ;
and the day lengthens slowly and imperceptibly. With such small
forces, as we have already seen, it becomes a matter of time. Even
small forces can produce an effect, if they only have time to workin. It
is therefore probable that the solid earth will be behind the sea in its
movements. Some time will elapse before the “crust” and the inner
plastic mass begin to yield. The ground under a building often begins
to give way only when the building has stood for some time. If then
the solid body of the earth lags behind the sea in its movements, and
the movements both of the sea and ofthe solid earth occur periodically
more strongly and more feebly, because the motive force is stronger and
weaker according as the eccentrivity of the orbit increases or diminishes,
it was conceivable that the coast-lines would come to be displaced up
and down once for every time that eccentricity increases and dimin-
ishes. For there must be the greatest probability that the solid earth
may yield at one place or another when the tension in the interior be-
comes strongest.

It is important now to examine whether the action of the tidal wave
and variations in its strength are great enough to explain the displace-
ment of the coast-lines. This is a mathematico-physical problem, and
it is not for me to solve it. I put it asa question for the decision of
competent men, and shall confine myself to the following remarks:

If the sidereal day has once been several times shorter, and the earth
at the time was a solid body, the tension and pressure in its interior
will increase with the length of the sidereal day, until finally the tension
becomes so great that the earth begins to yield. It will then accommo-
date itself, if not in its entirety, at least partialiy, until the tension is
equalized, at any rate in part. Perhaps then a state of repose will
occur, during which a new tension will accumulate, which may introduce
a new change of form. And these spasmodic changes of form in the
body of the earth when strained to the limit of its power of resistance
would occur precisely when the eccentricity had approached its highest
value, and the tension increased most rapidly, or some time afterwards.
Under such circumstances, possibly, the small variation which the tidal
force undergoes with the eccentricity would turn the scale, and deter-
mine the time for the changes of the solid earth.

Thomson says ( Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow, 1868) that it is still hope-
less to attempt to solve the question of how rapidly the sidereal day
lengthens, by means of tidal action. By way of trial he calculates (J. ¢.
p. 26) the action of the existing tidai wave to be so great that the earth
in one hundred years should be retarded one hundred and eighty sec-
onds, with which corresponds a lengthening of the day of 0.01 second ;
and if we take this retarding power, for the sake of simplicity, as con-
340 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

stant, the day, in one hundred thousand years (the time which is on the
average occupied by an oscillation of the eccentricity) should become
ten seconds longer. Moreover, Thomson reckons only the marine tidal
wave. To this should now be added Darwin’s ‘interior tide,” his
“bodily tides,” which I know no means of calculating. For many mill-
ions of years, when the moon was nearer and the tidal action consid-
erably stronger, the day also increased more rapidly. But nowadays
its increase is undoubtedly much slower, and we can not expect great
general changes of level in a short time from this cause.

To a lengthening of the day by ten seconds (according to Todd,*)
corresponds a shortening of the equatorial radius by 5.6 meters and a
double lengthening of the polar radius, therefore, by 11.2 meters.
What value the lengthening of the day had in Tertiary times we do not
know. It can not well have been remarkably greater than in recent
times. And it seems, therefore, in any case to follow, as stated above,
that the vertical displacement of coast-lines can scarcely have been in
genera more than a few meters under any oscillation, in case our at-
tempted explanation is correct. Therefore we must now see whether
the displacement of coast-lines was so very considerable.

We must first examine how much is deposited in each precessional
period and how great is the thickness of the stages. The thickness of
the deposit depends, in the first place, upon the situation of the place,
whether it lies near or far from the land or the mouths of rivers, and
upon the nature of the deposit. Chemical deposits are commonly thin-
ner than mechanical ones. As a mean number for each precessional
period (twenty to twenty-one thousand years), I have obtained the fol-
lowing values for the different kinds of alternating deposits:

Marl and siliceous limestone, from 0.6 to 2.2 meters.

Clay and siliceous limestone, 1.5 meters.

Marl, gypsum, siliceous limestone, (marine,) 1.5 to 1.4 meters.

Ditto, fresh water, 2.8 to 2.9 meters.

Limestone and marl, 1.8 to 2.5 meters.

Marl, argillaceous limestone, (ironstone,) sandy marl, 2 meters.

Sand, caleareous sandstone, (marine,) 2 to 2.3 meters.

Ditto, fresh water, 3 meters.

Sand, clay, ferruginous sandstone, (marine,) 5 to 6 meters.

Clay, limestone, ironstone, sand, 5 to 7 meters.

Sand, marly clay, ferruginous sandstone, lignite, up to 30 to 60
meters.

In each stage, when there has only been one oscillation of the sea,
there are usually four or five such alternating deposits, so the thick-
ness of the stages is generally but small. I may cite the following ex-
amples. First, from the Paris basin: The Caleaire Grossier, which

“dmerican Naturalist, 1883, vol. Xvu. p. 18. (Or as stated, 1 minute of daily
lengthening is equivalent to 110 feet of equatorial depression. )

represents twenty-five deposits and several (five to six) oscillations, is
only 31.5 meters thick; Sables de Beauchamp, 13 to 14 meters; the
Caleaire de St. Ouen, with ten alternating deposits, is only 6 to 7 meters ;
marine gypsum, 16 to 17 meters; palustrine gypsum, 20 meters; Sables
d’Etampes, 11 to 12 meters.

In the Isle of Wight the beds are thicker, but also richer in mechani-
cal deposits: Plastic clay, 26 meters; London clay, 61 meters; Lower
Bagshot (sand, clay, lignite, and ferruginous sandstone, with seven
alternating deposits), in all, 200 meters; Bracklesham, of the same kind
as the preceding and without any alternation, 33.5 meters; Middle
Bagshot, 91 meters; Upper Bagshot, (sand, without alternations), 37
meters; Lower Headon, 21 meters; Middle, 7 meters, and Upper
Headon, 26 meters; Osborne Series, 19 meters; Bembridge limestone,
7.6 meters; Bembridge marl, 23 meters; and Hempstead Series, 52
meters.

From Belgium we have the following thicknesses: Montien (coarse
limestone with foraminifera), 93 meters; Heersien, 32 meters; Land-
enien, about 60 meters; Yprésien, 140 meters; Bruxellien, 50 meters;
Laekenien, 10 meters; Wemmelien, up to 80 meters (only determined
by boring); Tongrien, 21 meters; Rupelien, 60 meters; Anversien, 3
to 4 meters (but near Utrecht, in an artesian well, 130 meters).

The thicknesses in the basin of Mayence are as follows: Alzeyer sand,
50 meters; Septaria clay, 50 meters; Elsheimer sands, 60 meters; Oy-
rena marls, 40 meters; Cerithium limestones, 25 meters; Corbicula lime-
stones, 25 meters; Litorinella clay, 20 meters. In Italy, Seguenza gives
the following thicknesses: Bartonien (in part conglomerates, and per-
haps several oscillations), 300 meters; Tongrien, 50 meters; Langhien,
Astien, and Saharien, each 200 meters; Zancleen, 300 meters. The
Swiss Mollasse, which is a shore formation, is so thick that it forms
whole mountains; but, according to Charles Mayer-Eymar, the Aqui-
tanian has a much greater and, indeed, quite exceptional thickness
near Bormida, in Tuscany. Here we find (probably inclined from the
first) fresh-water and superiorly marine shore formations with manifold
alternations of sandstone and shales, the thickness of which, although
it has not been exactly measured, is believed to be 3,000 meters, and
all supposed to be formed in the Aquitanian period. And the same
stage, according to Giimbel, has a similar thickness in Bavaria. Etna,
which is 12,000 feet high, has been built up by voleanic eruptions in
the most recent geological period, and since the Mediterranean had
acquired a fauna essentially the same as at the present day.

The formation of the Mediterranean, with its strong vuleanism, has
been distinguished, according to Suess and Neumayr, by very consider-
able displacements of the earth’s body. The Egean Sea and the Adri-
atic have been formed by depressions in the latest geological period.
Under such circumstances very thick deposits may be formed near land
in a short time. Eocene marine deposits are uplifted 21,000 feet above
the sea in folded ranges (e. g., in Upper Asia). But all these are only
342 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

local disturbances. If we turn, on the other hand, to localities where
the conditions have been more quietly developed, we find, as may be
seen from the preceding statements, that the stages have only a small
thickness. The deposits which form them are partly fresh-water forma-
tions, partly formations from shallow seas; there are no well-marked
deep-sea formations among them. They are to a great extent--perhaps
for the most part—formed in inland seas and bays, in basins which were
separated by banks from the open sea. We may arrive at this conclu-
sion from the circumstance that salt-water and fresh-water formations so
frequently alternate in the Tertiary deposits; for it is only when strati-
fied formations take place in basin-shaped depressions that fresh-water
basins can be formed when the sea retires.

And if we have deep basins which are separated by banks from the
open sea, a rising or sinking of the shore-line by some few meters will
be sufficient to submerge or lay dry the banks. The deep basin will
then alternately be salt and fresh. And a rising of the sea by a few
meters will likewise suffice to cause the formation of thick salt-water
deposits in the basin. If the bank then again rises a few meters, the
basin will remain fresh, and thick fresh-water beds can be deposited
above the marine beds. In this way the formation of alternating salt
and fresh-water beds may continue, under small displacements of the
coast-line, until the basin is filled up.

It would seem to be more difficult to reconcile the hypothesis with
the very considerable elevations which particular countries have un-
dergone in the period which has elapsed since the Glacial period. Thus
near Christiania and Trondheim the highest trace of the sea from the
Post-glacial time is situated 188 meters above the sea. But in other
parts of our country the highest marine terraces are much lower, so
that it would seem as if the elevation has not been every where equally
great. It seems to have been weaker and weaker outwards from the
center of the country. In southern Sweden and Denmark it has also
been inconsiderable in the same period. Penck has shown (‘ Schwan-
kungen des Meeresspiegels,” in Jahrb. Geogr. Ges. Miinchen, Bd. Vii.)
that an inland ice exerts an attraction upon the sea, which, for this
reason, stands higher on the coast of a country, when the land is cov-
ered with ice. The melting of the inland ice may therefore have caused
the sea on our coasts to sink somewhat, but the difference between the
situations of the highest marine traces in the different parts of Scan-
dinavia is so great,* even in neighboring localities, that it could not
be explained in this way; and the most probable explanation would
be that the land has risen in different degrees at different places.t It

f. Erdkunde in Berlin, 1887, Bd. xxi1, pp. 169 e¢ seq.

t A similar unequal elevation has probably also taken place during earlier periods of
elevation. In the Bergen conglomerate, the old shales are situated at a higher level,
the farther one goes from the shore. (See Kjerulf, Udsigt over det sydl. Norges Ge-
ologi, Christiania, 1879, pp. 154-156, ete. ; and Helland in Arch. f. Math. og Nature,
Christiania, 1881, Bd. v1. p. 222.) :
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 343

is also a probable supposition that the crust has not everywhere the
same power of resistance to the interior pressure, and especially that
the plastic mass may press in under the more yielding parts of the sur-
face. We have a striking example of this in the laccolites noticed in
North America. Eruptive matter is here pressed up from below, and
has lifted the bed into dome-shaped vaults, so that the elevations have
been different in degree in different places, and greatest in the middle
of the domes. We may imagine that similar forces, but on a much lar-
ger scale, have contributed to the elevation of Scandinavia ;—that Sean-
dinavia is, sifvenia verbo, as it were a laccolite on a larger scale. We
must in the next place remember that the changes of the earth’s surface
which have taken place in the Tertiary and Quaternary periods, how-
ever great they seem to be in our eyes, are inconsiderable in relation to
the whole mass of the earth. Even sinall forces, where they act upon
a great mass, may produce very considerable local effects, provided
that the changes do not everywhere occur upon the same scale. If we
consider that in this way the elevations are not everywhere equally
great, then a depression of the equatorial belt of only a couple of meters
will suffice to cause many such countries as Scandinavia to rise many
meters, and there will still remain pressure which is not exhausted.
Of course it is not said that whenever the eccentricity has attained
a high value, Scandinavia will rise to an equally great amount. If the
elevation has been great in a given period, it is probable that the next
period of elevation will have more difficulty in upheaving the previously
elevated land. The position of the weakest points will vary. The next
time, perhaps, the elevation will chiefly affect other localities. If we
consider the Tertiary formations in Europe, we see that the series of
deposits is nowhere complete. It is only by combining all the deposits
formed at different places that we can obtain a complete outline. In
part, this is certainly due to the fact that the changes of form in the solid
earth have not taken place simultaneously everywhere. The great ec-
centricities produced upheavals at different times in different places.
There is lastly a circumstance of great importance which may here
be indicated, and which shows how quietly oscillations take place under
normal conditions. Although according to our hypothesis, the radii of
the higher latitudes constantly lengthen, while those of lower latitudes
are shortened, yet through long geological periods coast-lines return re-
peatedly, during their displacements, to their old position. Thus A. de
Lapparent (Bull. Soc. Géol. France, sér. 3, vol. XV. p. 400) says: “ Lhave
indicated, in the Cotentin, an agreement between the actual shores and
those at which the sea stopped at various epochs of geological history.
I have there shown shore-lines reproduced, almost without variations of
altitude, in the Hettangian, Sinemurian, Liassian, Cenomanian, Danian,
Parisian, Tongrian, Pliocene, and present epochs, - - - and that
eight or nine times at least, since the Primary era, the coincidence of
the shores has been reproduced at the same point;” and in the same
344 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

work (p. 277) he says: “ It is only by tens of meters that on the coast
of the Cotentin we must reckon the differences between the successive
levels of the seas, from the Trias down to the present day.” Here we
see that the variations of level have taken place with great regularity.
The sea has risen, and later on the land has been elevated; and these
alternate risings and sinkiugs have occurred with such =a that
the coast-line again and again, at long intervals, has returned about to
its old place.

After this there seems really to be a possibility that our hypothesis
is sufficient to explain the displacements of the shore-lines which have
taken place. We have hitherto considered the conditions under high
latitudes. Under lower latitudes all may sink. Here “Horste” may
be formed such as’ Suess supposes, and as to the occurrence of these
localities Lapparent’s eriticism is unsatisfactory. He has attacked
Suess’s theory of “ Horste” in its entirety, but he has criticised it spe-
cially only for such localities (Colorado, Vosges, Black Forrest, and the
central plateau of France) as lie under high latitudes. The localities
named have (according to Lapparent) risen more than their environ-
ment, which also is quite in accordance with the opinion above devel-
oped. But under lower latitudes, when a general sinking takes place
in the course of time, resistant parts will form true ‘“Horste” in Suess’s
sense. And it scarcely goes against our hypothesis to assume, with
Suess, that the Indian Ocean is formed by depression, and that Africa,
Madagasear, India, &c., are “Horste,” parts of the crust which have
remained in position, or which have sunk less than the neighboring
regions. In these countries, so far as their geology is known at present,
there seem to be few marine formations of the Mesozoic and Cainozoic
epochs.

I have said above that the different parts of the crust may be assumed
to have different powers of resistance against the interior pressure.
This may indeed be coneluded from the fact that the surface is uneven,
and that old (originally horizontal) formations have been upheaved un-
equally at different spots. In other words, there is an inequality of the
surface, which has a deeper cause than the operation of eroding forces,

Changes of the earth’s crust in reality happen in the most various
degrees at different times. The greatest convulsions occur in the folded
mountain-chains, and this has been the case in all geological periods.
It is worthy of note that places where great foldings took place in an-
cient times seem to have been subsequently unaffected by processes of
folding.* For upon the abraded sumuinits of old foids there often lie
other old formations in an undisturbed horizontal position. The most
highly folded chains are also those in which photons have been con-

tinued to the latest time. Along both sides of the Pacific Ocean from
Cape Horn to the Aleutian Islands, and opposite to this along the east
coast of Asia as far as the Sunda Islands, strike mighty chains asso-
ciated with series of volcanoes; and from the Himalaya through the
Caucasus, Balkans, Pyrenees, and Atlas a similar series of vast chains
stretches through localities which are often voleanic. These highest
mountains of the earth are also the youngest; they are still the least
affected by the tooth of time.*

But these strongly folded localities are of smali extent in comparison
with the other parts of the earth’s surface. On both sides of these
folds there are great plateaux and plains, quite or nearly without any
plications, and on the whole with undisturbed horizontal beds. These
are Suéss’s tables” (Tafeln). Africa, Western North America, (in the
Kastern there are no younger plications than from Carboniferous times, )
Brazil, Australia, Arabia, Persia, India, Siberia, and Russia, are such
“ tables,” in which the crust is much Jess disturbed. And no doubt the
same thing applies to the sea-basins, or at any rate to the greater part
of them.

When the sidereal day lengthens, the sea at once adjusts itself to the
new conditions. It sinks under the lower, and rises under the higher
latitudes. According as the interior pressure upon the crust increases
towards the poles, the opposite pressure upon the sea-bottom also in-
creases in the same regions, because the sea rises. But the parts not
covered by the sea are exposed alone to the increasing pressure from
the interior without any exterior counterpressure being developed.
Under lower latitudes the same thing takes place. According as the
crust increases in weight the sea sinks, and the pressure upon the in-
terior increases more rapidly in the continents, where nothing is re-
moved, than in the sea, where the level of the water sinks. Therefore
I think that the continents are weak points. The sea’s movements
weaken the effects of the diminishing centrifugal force for all parts
covered by the sea, but the pressure acts with undiminished force
everywhere on the solid land, both under low and under high latitudes.
Whatever the cause may have been that originally determined the dis-
tribation of land and sea upon our globe, it seems to me that we may
reasonably assume that the sea’s mobility is a preservative force, which
perhaps has contributed to make the continents and oceans, broadly
speaking, retain their form from the most ancient times until now.

There is also reason to believe that the continents may yield more
easily than the bottom of the deep sea, and that they may rise and sink
more readily. And they are also separated from the depths of ocean
by lines abounding in volcanoes, lines of weakness, where the connec-
tion between the parts of the crusts seems to be weaker than elsewhere.

*'The summary here given is founded upon Suess’s interesting studies in his great
work ‘ Antlitz der Erde.”
346 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST.

Processes of plication may also perhaps be a consequence of the move-
ment of “tables” not being of the same kind on both sides.

But the boundaries between the deep ocean and the foot of the con-
tinents do not everywhere coincide with the existing shore. Along the
coasts there are often shallow tracts in the sea. These are the foot of
the land which the sea has flooded, and the great deep sea only com-
mences farther out.

The Trias period has received its name because it shows a distinct
triple division. It commences with fresh-water and littoral formations,
upon which follow formations of deeper water, and then closes with
fresh-water and shore formations. At its commencement the land was
high relatively to the sea; as it went on the sea rose higher and higher ;
then the land again began to rise, and at the end of the period it was
again high in relation to the sea. And these great changes in the situ-
ation of the coast-line were no doubt effected by means of many smaller
oscillations.

But just as it is with the Trias, so is it also with other geological
formations. They commence with littoral formations (there is often a
conglomerate at the bottom); these are followed by deeper marine
formations, and at the close we have again shore formations. The name
of Trias would therefore really apply to all of them. The first person
to call attention to this remarkable triple division of formations would
seem to have been Eaton. It was subsequently discussed by J.S. New-
berry in his memoir entitled “ Circles of Deposition in American Sedi-
mentary Recks” (Proc. Amer. Assoc., 1873, vol. XXU, p. 185), and Hull
(Trans. Geol, Soc. Glasgow, 1868, I11., pt. 1, p. 39); see also A. Geikie,
‘“ Text-book of Geology,” p. 498, where further references to literature
will be found. Principal Dawson called these tripartite periods “ cycles,”
and in his ‘Story of the Earth and Man” he established the following
cycles of this kind: (1) Cambrian ; (2) Lower Silurian; (3) Upper Silu-
rian; (4) Devonian; (5) Carboniferous; (6) Permian; (7) Trias; (8)
Lower Jurassic ; (9) Middle Jurassic; (10) Upper Jurassic; (11) Creta-
ceous; and (12) Tertiary.* It appears therefore that these cycles are
periods of long duration; each of them has certainly lasted several
hundred thousand years. And in the middle of each cycle the great
overflows of the sea have attained their highest point. The cycles
alternate with continental periods. During the elevation of the land
the horizontal position of the strata was often disturbed, so that the
deposits of the new cycle lie unconformably upon the older ones.

In this way the development has gone on, at any rate in the northern
hemisphere. Mojsisowics, Suess, and others have pointed ont that it
has taken place simultaneously in the same direction in Europe, Asia,
and North America. These great changes have taken place over the
whole of the northern hemisphere, and on both sides of the oceans they

“We shall see hereafter that this formation includes two cycles.
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 347

have constantly had the same direction. And the same geologists have
justly insisted that this law is one of the most remarkable results of
geological investigations.

The development of organic life, as we now know, has gone on unin-
terruptedly from the earliest times. There has certainly never been any
general destruction, never any completely new creation. The new has
developed from the old through transitional forms and in the course of
millions of years. If we knew all the deposits which have been formed
it would be impossible to draw any boundaries between geological
formations. One would imperceptibly pass over into the other. The
boundaries between formations correspond with great gaps in the series
of beds. In the time which intervened between the youngest bed in an
older and the oldest in a younger cycle, the land in the northern hemi-
sphere lay so high that no marine deposits were formed in the parts of
the earth’s crust which are accessible to our investigations. Neverthe-
less the development of living forms went on its even course. But
when, after a long time, the land was again submerged, the life in the
sea had changed, and beds with new fossils were deposited upon the
old ones. And it is from the animal remains of marine deposits that
the formations are determined. Hence, the sudden change of fossils
where a new formation commences is not due to any catastrophe, but
simply to a shorter or longer interruption in the formation of deposits
in the parts of the earth which we are able to examine. There is no
doubt that there are transition beds between formations, but they lie
concealed from us at the bottom of the sea. Itis only incertain strongly
plicated chains that these beds are upheaved and can be examined.
Thus in the Alps there are transitional beds between the Cretaceous
and Tertiary, between the Permian and Trias, ete.*

If we should attempt to establish geological formations by the aid of
the kuown remains of terrestrial animals and plants, the boundaries of
these would not coincide with those which are defined by marine ani-
mals.t Thus, to mention an example, the appearance of Dicotyledons
does not coincide with the boundary of any formation; but they first
appear with a number of forms in the Upper Cretaceous period (Ceno-
manian).

* “ As long ago as 1846, Darwin, in his observations in South America, showed that
certain assemblages of fossils presented a blending of characters which are of Jurassic
and Cretaceous age, respectively. Since that date, the study of the fossil faunas of
South Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the Western Territories of North
America has furnished an abundance of facts of the same kind, showing that no
classification of geological periods can possibly be of world-wide application.” (J.
W. Judd, presidential address to the Geological Society, 1888, and Nature, March 1,
1888, p. 426). See also Mojsisowics, Die Dolomitriffe Siidtirols und Venetiens, Vienna,
1879, p. 36; and von Hauer, Die Geologie, Vienna, 1875, p. 515.

t “The growth of our knowlege concerning the terrestrial faunas and floras of an-
cient geological periods has constantly forced upon the minds of many geologists the
necessity of a duplicate classification of geological periods, based on the study of
marine and terrestrial organisms respectively.” (J. W. Judd, loc, cit, p. 427.)
348 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

From Tertiary times, with the exception of the deposits in the great
mountain-chains, we know only formations of shallow seas. The Ter-
tiary deposits which correspond to the deep-sea strata of older forma-
tions, and which were deposited farther from the land during that
period without their formation being interfered with by the numerous
minor oscillations of the coast-lines, still remain for the most part con-
cealed from us in the sea.

Land-formations, fresh-water and littoral formations such as we have
in abundance in our Tertiary basins, are greatly exposed to destruction,
for they are more frequently elevated above the protecting sea. Inthe
older cycles such formations are more rare, probably to a great extent
because they have been destroyed by denudation. We may therefore
conclude that the Tertiary formations would much more resemble those
of the older cycles if our knowledge of them all were equal. Of the older
cycles we often know especially the deep-water formations, of the young-
est chiefly those of more shallow waters. At some far-distant period
the exposed Tertiary formations will come to equal those which are now
visible from older cycles.

Dawson (l. ¢. pp. 176-179) expresses the notion that the remarkable
regularity with which such cycles recur may perhaps have a cosmical
cause and be conditioned by one or another astronomical period. But
he seems afterwards to reject this idea, because the Paleozoic cycles
have deposits which are four or five times as thick as the Mesozoic (I. ¢.
p. 195), and we might therefore believe that more time must have been
occupied in their formation. But, on the other hand, he notes that in
Paleozoic times changes in the organic world went on much more slowly
in relation to the formation of deposits than subsequently, so that the
fossils extend through greater thicknesses of strata than in the thinner,
newer cycles. If I were to judge from these facts adduced by Dawson,
I should come to a different conclusion; I should regard it as a proba-
ble supposition that the formation of deposits went on more rapidly in
Paleozoic times than lateron. If the moon at that time were nearer to
us and the sidereal day shorter, as Darwin thinks, the tidal wave must
both have been stronger and have acted more frequently than at pres-
ent. The coasts would be destroyed much more rapidly, and the sez
would have much more material to deposit. A cycle of this period
would be thicker than the younger cycles, and the fossils would extend
through a greater thickness of strata than in the latter. For I see at
present no probable ground for the supposition that the development of
new species would be accelerated in the same degree as the formation
of deposits.

There is therefore reason to assume that it is owing to these great
changes in the form of the earth, occurring at long intervals, that we
‘an distinguish between geological formations. But such great changes
in the distribution of land and sea must necessarily also bring with them
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. d49

considerable changes of climate, and at the same time also changes of
living forms. I have already, in one of my memoirs, put forward the
opinion that the glacial period had its origin in a change of the distri-
bution of land and sea. If the land gained a great extension in the
middle and higher latitudes, especially if there should be a formation
of bridges across the sea such as the supposed bridge through the Farées
and Iceland from Scotland to Greenland, the warm sea-curreuts would
be excluded from the higher latitudes. The northern seas would then
become icy seas, and where the snow-fall is sufficiently inland ice would
be formed. In a memoir entitled “ Natiirliche Warmwasserheizung als
Princip der klimatischen Zustiinde der geologischen Formationen” (in
Abhandl. Senckenb, Gesellsch. vol. X111, p. 277 et seq.), J. Probst (like Sar-
torius von Waltershausen, in his Untersuchungen tiber die Klimate der
Gegenwart und Vergangenheit, 1865) has with justice pointed out the
great importance which warm sea-currents have, and have had, in ren-
dering milder the climate of high latitudes.

It has been generally accepted among geologists that during the older
formations animal and plant life was more uniform over the whole earth
than at present. But this opinion must be changed according to recent
investigations. Thus J. W. Judd says (Nature, March 1, 1888, pp. 424
et seq.), with regard to the oldest fossiliferous deposits (the Cambrian) :
“ Even at that early period there were life-provinces with a distribu-
tion of organisms in space quite analogous to that which exists at the
present day.” Examples of geographical provinces are indicated by
him in the Silurian, Trias, Jura, and Cretaceous; and he says further:
‘‘ [| believe that the study of fossils from remote parts of the earth’s sur-
face has abundantly substantiated Professor Huxley’s suggestion that
geographical provinces and zones may have been as distinctly marked
in the Paleozoic epoch as at present.”

Most deposits of ancient times belong to periods in which the land
lay low in relation to the sea, and the difference between the geograph-
ical provinces is far less in the great depths of the sea than near the
shores and on the solid ground. It has also hitherto been a general
theory that the climate in old times was warmer and more uniform over
the whole earth than now. The further we go back, it is said, the
warmer it was, and this has been regarded as connected with the inte-
rior heat of the earth. The Glacial period was an interruption of the
continuity of its gradual cooling. In periods of overflow, when the
land lay low and the sea had great extension under high latitudes, warm
marine currents had much easier access to the poles than during conti-
nental periods. As we now know most about the deposits formed dur-
ing periods of overflow, and as most of the deposits of continental periods
are either removed by denudation or concealed under the sea, it is still
probable that the deposits of older cycles might show less strongly
marked geographical provinces, and, as a rule, bear witness to warmer
350 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

climates even under high latitudes. But the great changes in the dis-
tribution of land and sea compel us to assume that, hand in hand with
them, occurred a periodical alternation of climate, which has been far
greater and more radical than the change produced by the precessional
periods.

Ramsay, Croll, J. Geikie, and others have thought that they found
more or less certain traces of Glacial periods in the older formations
(see, ¢. g., J. Geikie, ‘The Great Ice Age,” ed. 2, 1887, pp. 566 et seq.).
Some of these traces seem to prove that, at any rate, there have been
more Glacial periods than the Post-tertiary one. Nevertheless von
Richthofen remarks (Fiihrer fiir Forschungsreisende, p, 362) that these
supposed traces of Glacial periods are perhaps only a phenomenon of
abrasion, and that the actien of the waves upon the shore could pro-
duce conglomerates with striated stones. As regards these supposed
old Glacial periods, the most certain traces (see J. Geikie, l. ¢.) appear
to be furnished by the Devonian Sandstone, “Old Red,” in England and
Scotland, by the commencement of the Carboniferous period (Scotland),
by the Permian conglomerate (England), and by the Eocene (Switzer-
land). The most striking evidence (with striated stones) is from the
periods when the land had great extension.

As regards these great overflows, it must be remembered that it is
only in folded chains and in strongly elevated regions (e.g. in the Alps,
Himalaya, Colorado, etc.) that sea-formed deposits of the later and lat-
est geological periods occur at very considerable elevations above the
sea. These great elevations, if we consider them in relation to the
whole, can only be regarded as quite local phenomena. At the time
when the deposits were formed they lay much lower, and when we now
find an alternation of marine and fresh-water deposits in such forma-
tions we must not suppose that the sea rose and sank in relation to the
land by thousands of feet at each oscillation. During the period of
formation the shore-line need only have moved up and down a few me-
ters. Afterward the whole system of strata was lifted high above its
original level by locally acting “ geotectonic” forces.

Therefore I assume that even the great overflows do not depend upon
any very considerable displacement of coast-lines in a vertical direc-
tion. When there are large flat countries with basin-shaped depres-
sions, a small elevation may suffice to produce great geographical
changes.

Possibly also these overflows may be due to changes in the eccen-
tricity of the orbit.

We will now test our hypothesis by a comparison between the astro.
nomical periods and the geological series of deposits.

The curve of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit has been calculated
from Leverrier’s formule by J. Croll (‘‘ Climate and Time,” 1875, p. 312)

Jhiium
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 351

for a period of four millions of years ; three millions of years backward
and one million forward from the present time. The curve is also eal-
culated according to the same formule by McFarland (Amer. Journ. Sci.,
1880, [3], vol. Xx, pp. 105-111). His calculation extends from 3,250,000
years backward, to 1,250,000 years forward in time.* He has calculated
with shorter intervals of time than Croll (Croll 50,000, McFarland 10,000
years), which however has had no particular influence in altering the
form of the curves. McFarland has in the same place calculated the
curve for the same period of time from new formule of Stockwell’s.
The two curves, taken in the gross, show a uniform course throughout
their length, but as regards the first half Leverrier’s curve is thrown
somewhat backward. Stockwell’s formul# are considered to be more
accurate than Leverrier’s.

Both curves are given by McFarland. If we compare them together
it appears—

(1) The curves coincide with only a small essential difference from
the present day until one million years back.

(2) If we omit the portion between 7’ and 8/ of Leverrier’s curve,
Leverrier’s and Stockwell’s curves are in all essential points identical
also as regards the older part, although the agreement is not so complete
as for the last million of years. The reason of this is that the caleula-
tions are less certain with regard to the older periods ; when the number
of years enters as a factor in the formula, smallerrors in the values
adopted for the planets’ masses will be enlarged in proportion to the
time, and the result becomes less certain.

(3) A very remarkable consequence proceeds from these calculations.
The curve repeats itself after the lapse of 1,450,000 years, when it is cal-
culated according to Stockwell’s formule. In the period of 4,500,000
years for which McFarland has calculated it, it repeats itself in this
way with remarkable regularity a little more than threetimes. In each
of these cycles there are 16 ares of the curve. Thus the ares which in
the accompanying plate are indicated by 1 to 16 correspond with 1/
to 16’and 1” to 16”. Mr. Geelmuyden, from calculations which he made
at my request, has declared that the course of the curve will probably
be sufficiently correct to be adopted with safety as the foundation for
geological considerations, and that uncertainties in the curve caused
by errors in the masses employed by Stockwell will probably not be of
any importance.

(4) The mean value of the eccentricity is least at the limits of two
cycles; it rises in the first and sinks in the last half of each eyele, and
therefore attains its greatest value about the middle of each cycle.

*[On the scale shown in the accompanying diagram, the interval of 2,000 years
would oceupy only ;}5 of an inch on the base line. The epoch of the table (1850)—
marked ‘‘0” in the third line of curves (cycle 10, just under the are 4’”)—may there-
fore as well be assumed to be the present year. ]

Thus for the first and second of the caleulated cycles and their subdi-
visions it is as follows:

Cycle 1. +3,250,000—2,720,000 vears, 0.0304.
— 2,720,000—2,150,000 years, 0.0332.
—2,150,000—1,810,000 years, 0.0203.

Cycle 11. +1,810,000—1,250,000 years, 0.0247.
+1,250,000— 700,000 years, 0.0340.
= 700,000— 350,000 years, 0.0280.

Cycle 111. + 350,000 to the present time, 0.0291.

Now as, according to our hypothesis, the sea-level under high lati-
tudes will rise and fall with the eccentricity, then it must not only rise
and fall onee for each are of the curve, but the ‘‘ mean sea-level” for
longer periods must also rise and fall with the mean value of the eecen-
tricity, and such cycles as cycles I and Ir must then correspond to two
cycles in the geological sequence of deposits. The limits between the
eycles of the curve must correspond to the periods of denudation which
divide the geological cycles, and the middle must correspond to the
periods of overflow.

The correctness of the two hypotheses put forward in my memoir on
the Alternation of Strata may (as already indicated) be tested in one
way by the comparison of geological profiles with the curves of the
eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. <A first attempt was made at the time
with the Upper Eocene and Oligocene beds of the Paris-basin.

Many difficulties, however, stood in the way of this work. First and
foremost the calculation of the curve is less certain for distant periods.
This difficulty is to a certain extent got rid of by the circumstance that,
as the curves repeat themselves, it may be less essential.

Another difficulty is in the finding of long and accurately described
profiles without gaps in the series of deposits. Survey-profiles are not
sufficient. Geologists often only state that there are few, some, or
many alterations of strata, without giving definite numbers.

A third difficulty is the distinguishing between the alternations of de-
posits which are due to precessions and those which have their cause in
other more transitory and local conditions. In the case of shore-forma-
tions this difficulty is especially perceptible; but it has proved to be
less than I supposed at first.

A fourth difficulty consists in the determination of the number of
oscillations of coast-lines. The higher a place was situated, the more
rarely was it overflowed; the lower it lay, the more rarely was it up-
lifted above the sea. And movements of the solid body of the earth, as
might be supposed, have not been so uniform everywhere as those of
the sea.

A fifth difficulty lies in the finding of perfectly typical profiles of the
' stages produced by the oscillations. When the sea rose and sank
slowly the number of marine alternations of strata will be less, and of

H. Mis. 224-23
354 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

land and fresh-water formations greater, the higher the place lay, and
the shorter the time which it remained submerged in the sea, during each
oscillation. But this difficulty is of importance only when the continu-
ous profiles are so short that they do not embrace several oscillations.

In the absence of longer, connected, and accurately traced profiles I
have first endeavored to determine the number of oscillations of coast-
lines as regards the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. Each of these
oscillations, of which there have been about thirty-six from the com-
mencement of the Tertiary period until now, has, in temporarily sub-
merged localities, produced an alternation of marine beds with fresh
water or terrestrial formations. To each more considerable oscillation
corresponds a geological “stage.” In these “ stages” there is a certain
number of alternations. By studying the literature of the Tertiary
basins of Europe [ have in this way formed a combined profile, which, as
regards the alternations of strata, is not yet completed throughout, but
which goes from the commencement of the Tertiary to the present time,
and which I shall now proceed to describe.

The mode in which profiles can be compared with the curve to tes-
the correctness of the hypotheses is as follows: Each are in the curve
will correspond to an oscillation of the sea. It is supposed that under
high latitudes the coast-lines move up and down with thecurve. Such
an oscillation J call a “ geological stage.” Each arc will therefore
have its corresponding oscillation or “ stage,” and in each “stage” there
will be as many alternations of strataas there are precessional periods in
the corresponding are. When the eccentricity only sinks inconsiderably
between two or more arcs, the ares run into one another, and form as it
were, ranges with two or three small summits. We have then “stages”
with more oscillations and more alternations of strata than the ordinary
ones. Weshall see examplesof this in what follows. We can draw aline
which indicates the boundary between marine and fresh-water forma-
tions. This line may be nearly or quite horizontal. Whether it is to
be drawn high or low depends upon how much above the sea the place
was situated where the deposits were formed at the time when the depo-
sition took place. The higher it lay, the higher must the line be drawn.
The place may have been so elevated that it never was submerged.
Then the lines are situated higher than the curve, and all the deposits
are fresh-water or terrestrial formations. But it may have lain so low
that it never rose above the sea, and all the deposits are marine forma-
tions. But the line may cut the curve. Then marine formations alter-
nate with land and fresh-water formations. The former correspond to
those ares of the curve which project above the line; the latter to
those which lie below it. And when there are no gaps in the series of
deposits, there will be as many alternations of deposits in the marine,
fresh-water, and terrestrial formations as there are precessional periods
in the corresponding ares of the curve,
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. B00

As a starting-point I will take the profile of the Paris basin*, which
I will endeavor to join on to recent times. Afterwards I will refer to
the lower and middle parts of the Eocene period.

The section of the Paris basin about Méry-sur-Oise (Bull. Soc. Géol.
Fr. 1878, pp. 243 et seq.) shows the following oscillations and alterna-
tions of strata, and may, as regards the continuous portion, fit into
Stockwell’s curve, as appears from the arc numbers cited for each oscil-
lation:

Sabies de Cuise, marine.

Caleaire grossier inférieur et moyen, marine, with seven alter-
nations. .

tions, and between them a deposit with fresh-water shells.

posit (Summit of are 16), then six fresh-water alternations.

There is only one discrepancy: Arc 16, the summit of which should
correspond to the marine deposit in the middle of the Caleaire de St.
Ouen, does not go so high that we should expect an inundation of the
sea. But the oscillation is at any rate also indicated in Stockwell’s
curve, and the marine formation consists of a single bed, and is so faintly
marked that it has only recently heen recognized.

Another profile from another place in the Paris basin (la Frette, Bull.
Soc. Goél. Fr. 1876, pp. 471 et seq.) has the same number of alternations
as the above, and extends from 13/ to 2’.. The marine bed at 16 is want-
ing in this profile, otherwise the same oscillations are indicated.

The profile at Méry-sur-Oise has in all seventy-one alternations of
strata, of which twenty-five are in the Calcaire grossier. A great part

‘of the calculated curve is therefore filled up by the occurrence of thirty-
seven alternations, without a gap in the series of deposits. With are
7’ the marine formationsof the basin terminate. In Miocene times came
the voleanic outbursts in Auvergne.

These oscillations‘of the coast-lines were not confined to the Paris-
basin. The sequence of deposits in the basin of the Gironde, which
seems to have been connected with the Paris-basin only through the
Atlantic Ocean, is as follows (according to Vasseur, Ann. Sci. Géol. vol.
XIII, pp. 398 et seq.) :

The Tertiary formations commence with the Middle Eocene: Num-
mulitic sand and coarse limestone, marine. After this, elevation and
erosion. Then again followed a depression: clay with Ostrea cucullaris
(ares 14 and 15), and another elevation : lacustrine limestone of Plassac,
and simultaneously with this brackish- water limestone of Bégadan (16/
to 1’). Then a new depression: marine limestone of St. Estéphe and
limestones and marls with Anomia girondica (2' to 4’). Elevation and
erosion: Mollasse (fresh water) of Fronsadais (6/2). Depression :—Cal-
caire 4 Astéries de Bourg (marine, 7’). Elevation: lacustrine lime-
stone of ’Agenais, level 1 (between 7’ and 8’). This is contempora-
neous with the Caleaire de Beauce of the Paris-basin. In the basin of
the Gironde fresh oscillations took place, namely, the following, which
are Miocene: Faluns de Bazas, mariue, 8’; elevation: lacustrine lime-
stone of PAgenais, level 2 (between 8/ and 9’); depression: Faluns de
Léognan et Merignac, marine (9’). The so-called Mollasse of Anjou,
which is wanting in the basin of the Gironde, is, according to Tour-
nouer (Ann. Sci. Géol. l. c. p. 62) younger than 9’, but older than the
Faluns de Salles of the Gironde; both are marine, and probably indi-
cate two oscillations, 10/11’. Then followed another Miocene oscilla-
tion, which has left its traces in the basin of the Loire, in the marine
Faluns of la Dixmerie (are 12’).

Thus the Miocene period in France had five oscillations. I have not
however been able to obtain detailed profiles of all these series of de-
posits.

We now pass to England. In the Memoirs of the Geological Survey
of Great Britain, 1856, we have accurate profiles of the Tertiary forma-
tions of the Isle of Wight (by Forbes and Bristow). The series of
beds, from below upwards, has the following oscillations and alterna-
tions* :—

Plastic Clay (brackish ?), four alternations.

London Clay, marine, at least eleven alternations.

Lower Bagshot, (in part?) fresh water, seven alternations.

Middle Bagshot (Bracklesham and Barton), the tirst fresh water,
the second marine, and with five alternations.

Upper Bagshot, without alternations.

* See Postscript to this article, post, p, 370,
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 357

This part of the series is in part older than the Caleaire grossier, and
there are at least one,— probably two gaps in it. The following series,
on the contrary, is continuous:

Lower Headon, fresh water and brackish, seven to eight alterna-
tions (are 15 and the first part of 14).

Middle Headon, marine, one alternation, at 14.

Upper Headon, fresh water and brackish, five alternations, be-
tween arcs 14 and 15.

Osborne, fresh water, three alternations, between ares 15 and 1’.

Bembridge limestone, fresh water, three alternations, between
ares 1’ and 2’.

Bembridge oyster-bed, marine, at least one alternation, at 2/

Bembridge marl, fresh water, six alternations, ares 2/ and 3.

Hempstead marl, fresh water and brackish, two alternations, 4’
or 5’?

Hempstead Corbula-beds, marine, imperfect above by denuda-
tion, one alternation.

The profiles of the different stages are taken at different parts of the
island which have lain at different levels. Bearing this in mind, the
series may be fitted into the curve, and at any rate correspond with
them pretty closely.

The number of alternations in this last continuous part of this series
of deposits is about the same as in the contemporaneous deposits of the
Paris-basin, although the beds are more than three times as thick (48
meters in the Paris-basin, 156 meters in the Isle of Wight).

With the marine deposits of Hempstead the marine formations of
England are interrupted, and it is only in the Pliocene that we have
indications of a new marine submergence. The basalts and voleanie
eruptions of Ireland and the Hebrides are probably, at any rate in
part, Miocene. Basaltic dikes extend in places across the whole of
England; but the chief outbreaks were on the western side, and hence
they can be traced through the Farées to Iceland.

We will now see whether we can fill up the curve from 7’, where the
continuous profile from the Paris-basin closes, up to recent times. The
uppermost bed of the Paris-basin lies upon the boundary between Oli-
gocene and Miocene. As we have already seen, the Miocene period in
France had five oscillations. In Transylvania (according to Koch, in
the Féldtani Kézliny) there are five Miocene stages, namely: Koroder
beds, Kett6smezé beds, Hidalmas beds, Mezéseger beds, and Feleker
beds. All these stages are marine. Even if they are not throughout
separated by fresh-water formations, as in the case of several, at any
rate, of the French Faluns, they may nevertheless be regarded as -cor-
responding to five oscillations. In the deeper seas the bottom will not
always be upheaved above the sea under low eccentricities; but the
oscillations will nevertheless operate in changing the fauna, and also
frequently the constitution of the deposits.
358 . ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST.

The Miocene deposits of the Vienna basin are divided into three prin-
cipal stages,—the first and second Mediterranean, and the Sarmatian.
But if we study the detailed profiles more closely, there appear to have
been here also five Miocene oscillations. Thus (according to Suess, Sttz-
ungsb. Wiener Akad., 1866) the first Mediterranean stage shows the fol-
lowing sequence of strata from below upwards :

Beds at Molt, with oyster-shells (broken), at the top with lignite,
four alternations, are 8’.—Supposed by Suess to be on the same
horizon with the Faluns of Bazas.

Beds near Loibersdorf, Gauderndorf, and Eggenburg, marine,
probably with eight alternations, at any rate in part younger
than the beds at Molt (ares 8’? and 9’).

“ Schlier” with gypsum, at the top with land-plants.—Suess calls
it ‘ein ersterbendes Meer,” and seems inclined to regard it as
a peculiar stage. Alternations, but scarcely more than two.
The last part of are 9’.

Beds at Grund, marine, with few (three to four) alternations, to
judge from Suess’ profiles.—The fauna forms a transition from
the first to the second Mediterranean stage, and this deposit at
Grund is with reason regarded by several Viennese geologists
as representing a distinct stage. Are 10’.

This was followed by the greatest submergence, the second Mediter-
ranean stage (are 11’), contemporaneous with the French Faluns de
Salles. The sea rose quite up into the inner Alpine Vienna basin. I
have been unable to make out the number of alternations in this stage.
I have only seen sections of the littoral formations described.

Finally, the last Miocene oscillation, the Sarmatian stage, are 12’.
In some localities (e. g., near Constantinople) this stage commences with
fresh water covered by marine formations (see Suess, Antlitz der Erde,
I.p. 419). According to a profile from Hungary (by Peters in Sitzwngsb.
Wiener Akad., 1861) the stage has four alternations.

This stage is followed by the Pliocene Congeria-beds, which in the
Vienna basin are represented only by brackish-water formations, accord-
ing to Fuchs (Jahrb. k.k. Geol. Reichs., 1875) with four alternations ; are
13’.. And with these the marine formations of the Vienna basin, Hun-
gary, and Transylvaniacome to a close. Volcanic outbursts commenced
in these countries even in the Oligocene period; they became very
frequent in the Miocene, and during this period the Alps rose to great
altitudes.

In the basin of Mayence the marine Oligocene formations (Wein-
heimer marine sand and Septaria-clay) are followed first by a fresh-water
formation; then the Miocene period commenced with a depression.
But during voleanic eruptions the basin was upheaved and became
more and more fresh-water. A continuous formation of beds took place.
Over the Cerithium-limestone, the Corbicula-limestone and Littorinella-
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 359
.
clay were deposited, in all with twenty or more alternations (according
to Lepsius, Das Mainzerbecken). All these deposits are Miocene.

We now pass further forward in time. The Pliocene has four oscilla-
tions, 13’, 14’, 15’, and 16’. We have already mentioned the Congeria-
beds of the Vienna basin. In England there are three oscillations:
Coralline Crag (14’), Red Crag (15’), and Cromer Clay or Westleton
Shingle (16’). Profiles of these are to be found in Quart. Journ. Geol.
Soc. Lond., 1871 (by Prestwich). The climate of Europe began to become
colder in the Pliocene. Even the oldest deposit in the Pliocene of En-
gland contains stones which may have been grooved by ice, and at the
close of the Pliocene there were already great glaciers ; the Pliocene was
followed by the Glacial epoch. We have seen how, during strong and
extensive volcanic action, previously marine basins were during Oligo-
cene, and especially Miocene, times uplitted above the sea not to be
depressed afterwards (Paris, Vienna, Hungary, the Mayence basin, and
we may add Switzerland), and we have seen that the Alps were up-
heaved in Miocene times. The Farées and Iceland were built up, at
any rate in great part, at the same time by basalts and lavas; perhaps,
moreover, the submarine bank which connects Europe with Greenland
was uplifted during the last portion of the Miocene period. In the Medi- -
terranean, according to Neumayr (see Suess, Antlitz der Erde, 1. p., 425)
the coast-lines at the close of the Pliocene lay even lower than at the
present day. No doubt all these elevations have had much influence
upon climate. Changes in the length of the day are dependent upon
variations of the eccentricity. Geographical changes follow upon the
increase of the day, and climate changes with the distribution of land
and sea.

The Coralline Crag in England (according to Prestwich) has a thick-
ness of only 25 meters, and can not have many alternations. After this
stage was formed the land rose, but was again partially depressed under
the sea. During this depression was formed the Red Crag, with the
Chillesford Clay. In the Coralline Crag two shore-lines were hollowed
out one over the other and the new stage lies now on the old shore plat-
forms. The Red Crag is thinner than the Coralline Crag and can not
include many alternations.

in Belgium, also, we have two Pliocene stages, which correspond to the
two English Crag-stages: the Scaldisien, étages supérieur et inférieur.
To these two oscillations of the North Sea correspond two contempo.
raneous ones of the Mediterranean. Suess calls them the third and
fourth Mediterranean stages. And even in the earliest part of the Pli-
ocene the Mediterranean fauna indicates a somewhat colder climate
(Suess, l. c. I. p. 431).

Italy possesses thick Pliocene formations. Seguenza describes de-
posits 500 to 600 meters in thickness from this period. I have been
unable to obtain profiles of these deposits. They are in part conglom-
erates and shore formations, like the great Miocene Mollasse of Switz-
360 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTI’S CRUST.

erland, and near the shore thick deposits can be formed in a short
time.

The profiles of Roussillon (by Depéret, in Ann. Sci. Géol. vol. Xvi.
1885) show four alternations in the stage contemporaneous with the
Coralline Crag (are 14’). The overlying stage in Roussillon is a fresh-
water formation. The land had risen. The fresh-water stage has sev-
eral alternations, probably six to eight, so far as I can see from the
profiles given, which, however, are not quite accurately described (ares
15’, 16’).

We now turn again to England. The fossils of the Red Crag show
a colder climate than that of the Coralline Crag, and the Chillesford
beds, which belong to the last portion of the Red Crag, have distinetly
arctic shells. The Glacial epoch was advancing. After the Red Crag
was formed, England again rose and became united by land with the
continent. Extinct mammals wandered in its forests, which consisted
of existing trees (spruce, pines, etc.) and show a temperate climate,
milder than that of the Chillesford beds, and about as at present. ‘‘ The
forest bed of Cromer” was overlain by marine deposits—Westleton
Shingle and Cromer Clay (are 16’). In the latest terrestrial formation
at Cromer Nathorst has found Arctic plauts (Salix polaris, ete.), and
the Cromer Clay indicates the vicinity of inland ice. With this the
Pliocene closes.

As regards the Quaternary oscillations, we will take the English de-
posits as described by J. Geikie (‘Great Ice Age,” ed. 2, pp.387 et seq.)
as our guide.

The Quaternary period commences with the retrogression of the iceand
with a considerable denudation. Then the sea again rose and covered
a great part of the east of England. The inland ice again extended
itself and formed a bottom-moraine, “ the great chalky bowlder-clay ”
(are 1’). After this glacial period an elevation of the land seems to
have followed, and the ice retreated. But a new depression followed
(Bridlington Crag) and a new glacial period (purple bowlder-clay, are
2’). A fresh elevation seems to have followed, with a new interglacial
period. Then came a new depression, which was very considerable,
and which at Moel Tryfaen in Wales, at Macclesfield, and in Ireland
has left marine shells at heights of 1,000 to 1,300 feet above the sea
(nearly approaching that at which the old “ seter” or beach-lines ‘in
Osterdalen, Liesje, ete. occur). Like the preceding depression, this was
also followed by a glacial period, the last (Hessle bowlder-clay, arc 3”).
Finally the land rose and the ice melted. The Post-glacial period came
with its four peat-beds (the last portion of 3 and 4”). To are 4” cor-
responds a small oscillation of the sea immediately before the recent
period. In Seania, Giravallen, a raised beach-formation, rests upon
peat; in Gotland, in the British Islands (Carse Clay, ete.), and even in
North America, we may trace the same oscillation of the sea; it was no
doubt too great to be capable of explanation by local conditions, com-
pression of peat-beds by: shifting sand-dunes, ete.
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 361

We have already seen that the land (according to Howorth and Suess)
in many places under high latitudes rose considerably in the Post-glacial
period, and that a corresponding depression took place in the warm coral-
seas. The last oscillations therefore affected a great part of the earth.
From tiis we may conclude that this was the case also with the oscilla-
tions of former times, and that they have their cause in general cosmi-
cal conditions. The small oscillation (are 4’’) forms an interruption in
this great upheaval under bigh latitudes. A similar interruption of the
depression, if our theory be correct, must be exhibited under the trop-
ics; and in reality in the equatorial parts both of America and the Old
World, there are numerous evidences of such a small post-glacial oseil-
lation in coral-reefs, which have been upraised several meters and are
now lying dry (see Suess, Antlitz der Hrde, 11. pp, 630 et seq). These
coral-reefs may date from the same time when the northern peat-beds
were submerged. The sunken peat-beds with the marine deposits
formed during the depression have been again uplifted, and the raised
coral-banks have probably again begun to sink (at Bombay there is a
sunken forest), but the depression has not yet brought them down be-
neath the sea.

We may make one or two further observations upon the Glacial
period and its formations. Contemporaneous with ‘the forest-bed of
Cromer” (according to Heer) are thelignites of Diirnten in Switzerland,
The fossils show this. They have nearly the same plant-remains, and
the same extinct animals. The lignites rest upon and are covered by
bottom-moraines, and are therefore ‘“inter-glacial.” They have seven
alternations of peat and forest-beds, and may be fitted into the curve
between the ares 15/ and 1’... From this the Alps must have had large
glaciers even during the time of the Red Crag. And there is no im-
probability in this if we remember that Leda arctica and other Arctic
animals were already living on the English coast at this period, and that
the Chillesford beds indicate a much colder climate than the subsequent
forest-bed of Cromer.

It is instructive to see how each rising of the sea in England during
the Quaternary period had as its consequence the increase of the inland
ice. This seems to agree with Croll’s theory, that glacial periods are a
consequence of great eccentricities. But the scanty traces of glacial
periods in the older formations, and aboveall the distribution of glaciers
at the present day, show that geographical conditions have the greatest
influence. It is only when these are favorable that a high eccentricity
can cause the glaciers to increase; if they are very favorable, there
may be a glacial period even during a small eccentricity, as in Green-
land at the present day. When the eccentricity increases, the precipi-
tation during rainy periods also increases. If the sea is cold, the pre-
cipitation will fall as snow, and in this way the glaciers will grow as
the eccentricity increases.

North Germany (according to Jentzsch) has also had three glacial
362 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

periods with corresponding bottom-moraines (and oscillations?) ; and
in the Alps there have been (according to Penck, Vergletsch. d. deutsch.
Alpen) at least three glacial periods.

We have thus filled up the curve to the present time, and connected
the profile of the Paris basin therewith. We will now trace the oscilla-
tions back to the close of the Cretaceous period in order, if possible, to
see how many oscillations are included in the Geological period known
as the Tertiary.

The Cretaceous period is separated from the Tertiary by a period of
denudation, during which the land was high relatively to thesea. The
oldest marine formation of the Tertiary period in Europe is considered
to be the limestone of Mons,in Belgium. This indicates the first oscilla-
tion; but this submergence appears not to have left traces in the other
Tertiary basins. The first marine inundation of the Paris-basin during
Tertiary times formed the conglomerate of Rilly and Nemours. It was
followed by an elevation of the land, and the marine conglomerate was
covered by the fresh-water limestone of Rilly. This oscillation in the
Paris-basin is perhaps represented in Belgium by the so-called ‘sys-
teme Heersien,” which is at the bottom a purely marine formation, but
has remains of land-plants at the top. Then came a new oscillation,
and now England also was partially submerged. Here was deposited
the marine Thanet Sand, and upon this the Woolwich and Reading
Series (=Plastic Clay), the latter partly a brackish and fresh-water for-
mation, and which shows that the shore-line had again retreated. In
Belgium the “systéme Landenien” was formed during this oscillation, —
below purely marine, above brackish. In the Paris basin there was
formed the ‘marine sand of Bracheux, which was followed by a fresh-
water formation with lignite (the Lignites de Soissonnais). Then fol-
lowed a new depression, and again an upheaval. This has left no
traces in the Paris-basin; but in England the London Clay was formed,
and in Belgium the “ syst¢me Yprésien.” The London Clay commences
with a shore formation of shingle or gravel (Oldhaven Beds), and the
upper part of the stage shows that the sea again became shallower, in
consequence of a new elevation of the land.* The “ systeme Yprésien ”
in Belgium is divided into two sub-stages,—the older, a clay with
Foraminifera,—the younger sandy, with numerous fossils, and therefore
probably indicating a shallower sea. A new submergence formed, in
Belgium, the marine “ systéme Panisélien” (sand), and in the Paris-
basin the marine sand of Cuise. With this the Lower Eocene closes.
It has therefore in all probability, six oscillations.

The Middle Kocene is represented in France chiefly by the “ Caleaire
grossier.” In this stage there are five to six sub-stages, and in sev-
eral places breaks in the series of deposits. The Middle Eocene is, on
the whole, marine, but with EO fresh-water beds, and it probably

his stage, as was eae n atone contains at least 11 alternations, and therefore
probably corresponds with at least two ares of the curve.

* T
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 363

also represents six oscillations. In Transylvania it commences (accord-
ing to Koch in Foldtani Kézliny, 1883, pp. 118 et seq.) with alternations
of clay and marl, upon which follow alternations of gypsum and marl
(“ lower gypsum horizon,” first oscillation). Above it, marine deposits,
the Perforata-beds—from below upwards—(«) an oyster-bed, (/7) argilla-
ceous marl (7) calcareous marl (“ lower striata horizon”), (0) a shell-bed
(‘lower perforata-horizon”), (2) clay (‘upper striata horizon,” second
oscillation ?), (¢) clay with a few hard marly beds and the same fossils
as in , (7) another oyster-bed, (7) clay with oysters, (:) caleareous marl
(‘upper perforata horizon,” third oscillation? ); above this the Ostrea-
clay, a thick clay with oysters and marly beds, and with a sandy ealea-
reous bed in the middle (fourth oscillation). Over this again the Lower
Coarse limestone, generally in two thick beds (fifth oscillation), covered
by athick bed of clay varied with layers of sand, probably a fresh-water
formation, and covered by fresh-water limestone. Finally, the last
(sixth) oscillation, the Upper Gypsum horizon, gypsum alternating with
clay ; and above it coarse limestone alternating with gypsum ; in other
places, clay with Foraminifera (marine),—the Upper Coarse limestone. I
have cited all of these details in order to show that these beds, which
are all contemporaneous with the ‘‘ Calcaire grossier” of Paris, seem to
indicate six oscillations.

Above the “Caleaire grossier” the Upper Eocene commences with
the continuous series of the Paris basin, which has already been de-
scribed.

The Lower and Middle Eocene therefore appear to include twelve
oscillations, six of which pertain to each of the two divisions of the
formation. By this the first cycle of the curve is filled up, so that the
beginning of the cycle will about fall upon the boundary between Creta-
ceous and Eocene. Inthe Paris basin the Middle Eocene has twenty-five
alterpations of strata and perhaps one or two breaks. Six oscillations
about correspond to twenty-five or thirty precessional periods.

At the commencement of the cycles the mean value of the eccentrie
ity is low; it rises in the middle of the cycle and sinks again towards
the conclusion. The position of the shore-lines must also depend upon
the mean value of the eccentricity. But as it increases very slowly
through very long periods, it will be very long before its action is to be
seen on the solid earth. The middle of the cycles ought thus to corre-
spond to the overflows of the sea, the beginning and close to the periods
of denudation which separate the formations. Breaks in the series of
beds may therefore be expected under high latitudes, especially at the
limits between the cycles.

The boundary between Cretaceous and Eocene is indicated by what
Suess (Antlitz der Erde, u, Tter Abschn., p. 376) calls a negative phase;
the sea had retreated in higher latitudes. During the Eocene it rose
again, and the Hocene sea had a great extension; we find its formations
even in the heart of Upper Asia. The limit between the Eocene and
364 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

Oligocene is again distinguished by a negative phase. In the latter
part of the Oligocene period, and still more during the Miocene, the
Sea again rose; between the Miocene and Pliocene it retreated far, and
at the beginning of the Quaternary epoch it rose again. Similar great
oscillations are also to be traced in North America and in Patagonia.
But marine Miocene deposits are wanting in the last-mentioned locality,
where the Miocene fresh-water beds are associated with great quantities
of volcanic products.

At the commencement of the Tertiary period, when the sea had re-
treated far under high latitudes, the climate of Europe was temperate
rather than tropical (see Saporta, Le Monde des Plantes avant Vappari-
tion de Vhomme, 1879). According as the sea rose and the Eocene over-
flow advanced the climate became warmer, and at the close of the
Eocene period the climate of Southefn Europe was hot and dry. The
abundant Tertiary flora of the Arctic lands is (according to Saporta
and Gardner) rather Eocene than Miocene (as Heer supposed). Atthe
boundary between Eocene and Oligocene the sea retreated, and the
Arctic Tertiary flora began to migrate into Europe, supplanting the
more southern plants. Then came the Miocene overflow, and with it a
rich tropical or sub-tropical flora. Butin proportion as the Miocene sea
retreated, the European flora also, little by little, lost in richness and
beauty and the tropical elements became more and more rare. During
the Pliocene epoch the sea retreated still farther, and the climate be-
came colder and colder until the Glacial period came in. But the last
Quaternary overflow has again, after several oscillations, caused the
ice to retreat, and our climate has again become temperate. There is
thus clearly a relation of dependency between the climate and geo-
graphical conditions. Great seas under high latitudes produce warm
climates, and vice versa.

Now we have seen that these great geographical changes were in all
probability a consequence of the rising and sinking of the mean value of
the eccentricity, and we must therefore believe that these great changes
of the climate had a cosmical origin, and occurred at the same time
over the whole earth. We still know too little of the geology of tropical
countries ; but there is ground for the belief that here also great changes
have taken place in the distribution of land and sea, and that these
changes must also have had an influence upon the climate of the warm
countries.

It is further probable that the force of vuleanicity stands in relation
to the changes in the eccentricity. Each of the great geological forma-
tions, from the Pre-Cambrian itself, has had its voleanoes (see A. Geikie,
“Textbook,” pp. 259-260); and we have already seen that the same
author states that there have been periods in the earth’s history when
vulcanicity was much more powerful and widely distributed than at
other times. We have seen how the upheaval of the land was accom-
panied by volcanic outbursts; and as regards the Tertiary period, at
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 365

any rate, it appears that the great overflows of the sea were followed
by periods during which the solid ground began to rise during violent
and wide-spread volcanic eruptions.

For easy reference we will finally enumerate all the ares in the curve,
and name the geological stages supposed to correspond to them. Teo
some extent we adopt the names given by Charles Mayer Eymar.*

the precession of the equinoxes is the cause of the changes in the level of the sea.

a duration of only a little over 300,000 years. He founds his views upon Schmick’s

Ares 1-3’, Etage Saharien, with three oscillations.

The limits between the cycles of the curve are not drawn arbitrarily.
The beginning and the close of the first two cycles are distinguished by
their unusually low eccentricity. The last are in one cycle and the first
in the following one have together a duration of about 150,000 years;
and in all this time the eccentricity was very low. In these two cycles,
likewise, the highest mean eccentricity occurs in the middle of the
cycle.

The Eocene period seems to have had sixteen oscillations, and should
correspond to the first cycle; the Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene
have likewise together sixteen oscillations, and correspond to the sec-
ond cycle. The Lower Eocene corresponds to ares 1 to 6, the Middle
Eocene to 7 to 12, and the Upper Eocene to 15 to 16. In the same way
the Oligocene corresponds to ares 1/-7’, the Miocene to 8/-12’, and the
Pliocene to 15/-16’.. There is thus a certain analogy between the oider
and the younger Tertiary periods. We have here six divisions which
nearly correspond to each other in the following manner:

Lower Eocene to the Oligocene: the former with six, the latter
with seven oscillations.

Middle Eocene to the Miocene: the former with six, the latter
with five oscillations.

Upper Eocene to the Pliocene: both with four oscillations.

The great overflows of the sea occur in the middle of the cycles, in the
Middle Eocene, the Upper Oligocene, and the Miocene. In the middle
of the cycles the mean value of the eccentricity was greatest. At the

commencement and the last part of the cycles, when the mean value of
the eccentricity was small, the sea retreated far, as between the Creta-
ceous and the Eocene, and in the Upper Eoceneand Pliocene. Thenotion
therefore presents itself with great probability that there is a connection
between the cycles in the curve representing the eccentricity of the
earth’s orbit and what is called a geological epoch, or what has also been
ealled a “cycle” or “circle of deposition.” The two Tertiary cycles
are as it were great stages, each composed of sixteen smaller ones. Just
as each of these sixteen represents a small oscillation of the sea, so does
each cycle represent a great oscillation; but this great oscillation has
been accomplished by means of the sixteen small ones. In the same
way the mean value of the eccentricity rises and falls in each eyele with
sixteen oscillations; it islow at the commencement of the cycle, attains
its greatest value in the middle of the cycle, and falls again towards the
close. These agreements between the cycles of the curve and the forma-
tions, between the ares of the curve and the stages, and between the
number of the ares’ precessions and the alternations of the strata in the
stages wherever these could be checked, appear to me to be so striking
as to exclude the notion of an accidental coincidence, and distinctly
point to a causal relation.

If we would test the correctness of our hypotheses by means of the
older formations, the following points must be borne in mind: After in-
vestigating the laws of the variations of eccentricity, Geelmuyden told
ine that it is probable that a cycle of about 1,500,000 years must appear
in the curve, but that without more extended investigation we can not
conclude that this will continue unchanged for unlimited periods. Even
in the calculated curve, the Cycle 11 is distinguished from the other two
by a much lower eccentricity in the ares 4//-9/’.

If the polar compression in old times was greater, then the preces-
sional period was also shorter. According to Geelmuyden it would be
very nearly proportional to the square of the time of rotation. For ex-
ample, toa rotation time of sixteen hours corresponds a (synodic) pre-
cessional period of 10,000 years, consequently only half the present period.
The shorter the period the less marked (other things being equal) must
the climatic period be, and the more indistinct the alternation of the
strata.

Farther, it must be remembered that in Paleozoic and Mesozoic times
the moon was probably much nearer. In that case the lunar tide was
much stronger, and stronger in proportion to the solar tide than at
present. The day was shorter, and the stronger tidal wave acted more
frequently. The shores were more rapidly destroyed. Deposition, no
doubt, took place more rapidly. The sidereal day increased more
quickly in length than at present. All these circumstances must have
had an influence upon the form of the earth, upon the distribution of
land and sea, upon the displacement of shore-lines, upon the changes of
climate, upon the ocean-currents, upon the distribution of chemical and
368 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

mechanical sediments and the alternations of strata, so that without
taking these and perhaps other circumstances into consideration, we
can not prove the applicability of the hypotheses to the Paleozoic and
Mesozoic series.

In conclusion, I will briefly notice the chief points in my hypothesis.

The precession of the equinoxes and the periodical change in the eccen-
tricity of the earth’s orbit, are reflected in the series of strata and furnish
the key to the calculation of the duration of geological epochs.

Precession causes winter and summer to be alternately longer and
shorter. In the semi-period when the winter is longer than the summer,
the difference between the inland and coast climate becomes more
marked. The atmospheric current becomes stronger. As aconsequence
of this, the currents of the ocean increase in strength, and this again
re-acts on the climate. The periodical change of the climate caused by
precession is not very considerable, but still great enough to leave its
mark in the alternations of strata, and in the formation of shore-lines,
terraces, series of moraines, etc. One alternation of strata corresponds
to each precessional period.

The eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is periodically variable. Its mean
value rises and falls in periods of about 1,500,000 years, with sixteen
oscillations. Such arise and fall I call a cycle, and each cycle, in the
calculated curve, is composed of sixteen ares.

The tidal wave, which is the most important agent in altering the
sidereal day, and which makes it longer, rises and falls to acertain ex-
tent with the eccentricity. It so predominates over the other forces
which alter the length of the sidereal day, that the day steadily lengthens
on the average more rapidly in the middle of the cycles when the mean
value of the eccentricity is greatest. and more slowly at the boundaries
between them, when it is least, and, as regards the individual arcs,
with increasing rapidity during rising, and decreasing rapidity during
falling eccentricity.

The interior of the earth is plastic in consequence of the great pres-
sure. Thesurface or “ crust,” opposes the greatest resistance to change
of form. But as the sidereal day lengthens, and the equatorial parts of
the earth increase in weight, a constantly increasing strain acts out-
ward toward higher latitudes, and this strain increases until the re-
sistance is overcome. It must also be remembered that forces which
are too small to effect any sudden alteration in a solid body, may
nevertheless produce a change of form when they act for a long time.

Hence the lengthening of the sidereal day does not act only upon the
sea, but also upon the form of the solid earth. The earth constantly
approaches more and more to the spherical form; but the solid earth,
in its movements, lags behind the sea, which accommodates itself at
once to the altered time of rotation.

As the motive power of these movements of the sea and the solid

ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 369

earth is periodically variable in accordance with the eccentricity of the
orbit, these movements also take place periodically more rapidly and
more slowly. And as the sea always adjusts itself to the forces before
the solid earth, it is probable that the shore-lines oscillate up and down
once for each rising and sinking of the eccentricity of the orbit. This
applies both to the individual ares of the curve and to the cycles. In
such a cycle “the mean level of the sea” rises and falls once during
sixteen oscillations.

According to Darwin the sidereal day has become several hours
longer. It is therefore probable that so great a strain must have ac-
cumulated in the mass of the earth, that a slight increase of the strain
would suffice to effect changes of form at the weakest points. It is also
probable that these partial changes in the solid body of the earth must
oceur especially during great eccentricities, or some time after them,
when the motive power increases most rapidly.

The change in the tidal wave with the eccentricity is supposed to be
sufficiently great to explain the displacement of shore-lines. A vertical
displacement of the shore-line by a few meters is sufficient to produce,
in the deeper basins, an alternation of many meters of thick marine and
fresh-water deposits. And as regards the changes of the solid mass of
the earth, we must remember that the series of strata is not complete
at any single place. In other words, the oscillations were not general
to such an extent as to render them contemporaneous everywhere. It
is only by partial changes of form, sometimes here, sometimes there, at
those points which were weakest at each period, that the solid earth
has approached the spherical form. To each are of the curve therefore
there corresponds only a partial—not a general—alteration of the form
of the solid earth. And the oscillation of the shore-lines corresponding
to the ares therefore can not be demonstrated everywhere, but only in
the basins where the forces at the time exerted their action. Hence we
can only obtain a complete profile by combining the beds of all the
Tertiary basins. Nor were the changes of the solid earth everywhere
equally great, but they were greatest at the most yielding parts ofthe
surface, so that very considerable local upheavals may be consequent
upon small changes in the length of the sidereal day. This applies to
the individual oscillations ; but even the great overtlows of the sea (of
which one falls in each cycle) need not be due to any very great rise in
the level of the sea, for great plains may be flooded and drained by a
comparatively small vertical displacement of the shore-line. But these
great changes in the distribution of land and sea were undoubtedly
great enough to cause considerable alterations of climate. Great seas
in high latitudes render their climate mild, and vice versa.

If now, keeping these principles in view, we compare the curve of the
eccentricity with the geological series of strata, we find an agreement
which indicates that the hypotheses are correct. The two cycles of the
calculated curve correspond to two geological cycles. Each of these

eycles has sixteen ares, which correspond to sixteen smaller oscillations
of the shore-lines, or sixteen geological stages. In each of these stages
there are as many alternations of strata as there are precessions in the
corresponding are. And the ‘‘ mean sea-level” rises with the mean ec-
centricity in the middle of the cycles, and falls at the boundary between
them, and hand in hand with the mean sea-level the temperature in the
higher latitudes also rises and falls.

The theory here discussed agrees with Lyell’s great principle. Slow
changes in the length of winter and summer and in the force of the
tidal wave produce periodical changes of climate and displacements of
shore-lines. The changes take place so slowly that the effects begin to
appear distinctly only after the lapse of many thousands of years.
There are two astronomical periods which are the cause of the great
and fundamental changes of which geology bears testimony to us from
long past days, and which will still continue, for millions of years, to
effect similar changes in the geography of our globe, in its climate, and
its animal and vegetable life.

POSTSCRIPT.

With reference to the profile of the Isle of Wight above cited (ante,
p. 356), I must make a fewremarks. Although with some doubt, I have
referred the Headon beds to the Upper Eocene. But the difference
between the faunas of the Grés de Beauchamp and the middle Headon
is far too great for these beds to be synchronous.

The cause of the error is that [reckoned too many alternations of cli-
mate in the Isle of Wight beds. In these fluvio-marine deposits there
is by no means the same regularity as in beds which are formed in
basins with less sedimentation. The river eroded its borders and
shifted its bed, banks were formed and carried away, according as the
direction of the stream varied and the channel changed. Hence lentic-
ular interecalations were often formed in the beds, and as precipitous
cliffs of the Isle of Wight break down, the minor details of the profiles
change in appearance. But with all this irregularity there are certain
beds which appear far more constantly, and which we can recognize in
the different profiles even although their condition is somewhat altered.
By the aid of these constant beds we find order in the variations, and
it appears that the great features of the profiles are maintained unal-
tered ; and it is these great features that we must follow when we wish
to determine the number of climatic alternations. In the Paris Basin,
where sedimentation was much less, chemically deposited beds play a
much more prominent part. In the Isle of Wight the stages are of
much greater thickness. The Oligocene deposits of the Isle of Wight
are 156 meters in thickness, aud more than three times as thick as the
contemporaneous beds in the Paris Basin, which have a thickness of
only 48 meters.

In the dry periods the deposition of clay and mud was much less, the
ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST. 371

water of the river was purer, and chemically formed beds had time to be
deposited. Instead of clay and marl,—limestone, Septaria beds, iron-
stone, ete., were formed. These beds were undoubtedly formed much
more slowly than the sand, clay, and marl deposits which alternate
with them. They are analogous to the forest beds in peat-mosses.
Forest beds often separate peat deposits with different species of plants.
This shows that the forest beds indicate long dry periods, during which
the formation of peat ceased aud the flora became changed ;* when the
quantity of rain again increased and the formation of peat commenced
anew, the forest trees which grew around the mosses were changed, and
the forest beds thus make divisions between different sub-stages or zones
in the peat.

Among the beds deposited in water (whether fresh or salt-water for-
mations) it is chiefly the above mentioned chemically formed beds that
are formed in dry periods. And just as in the peat mosses forest beds
often separate peat deposits with a different flora, so limestone and
Septaria beds aiso frequently intervene between clay, marl, and sand
deposits with a more or less different fauna, so that these chemically
produced deposits often form boundaries between geological stages and
sub-stages. This is the case, for example, in the Fluvio-marine series of
the Isle of Wight, the main features of which we shall now pass on to
describe with the aid of Forbes’s detailed and classical statements. We
shall then see that we have fewer climatic changes than I previously
supposed, and that the series of beds in the Isle of Wight coincides as
admirably with the curve of eccentricities as the Parisian deposits,
although somewhat later on in time than was hitherto supposed; thus
the agreement with the paleontological results becomes complete.

We begin from below, with the Upper Eocene Barton Clay. Judging
from the fossils this is synchronous with the Grés de Beauchamp in
the Paris Basin. It has five Septaria beds, and corresponds to are 14
of the curve, which has the same number of precessional periods. The
Barton Clay is covered by the Headon Sands (previously referred to the
Upper Bagshot), which have no alternations, and which were probably
formed in a comparatively short time

A great gap now follows in the series in the Isle of Wight. In the
Paris Basin the fresh-water Caleaire de St. Ouen was formed at this
time. This is only 6to7 meters thick, but it has ten alternations, which
should represent 200,000 years according to my calculation. It might
seem that this was a long time for the formation of a stage of so little
thickness ; but while this stage was deposited the marine fauna was
changed to such an extent that a great geological boundary has been
drawn through this point, the boundary between the Eocene and Oligo-
cene. The first marine Oligocene bed in the Isle of Wight (the Marine
Ee) has a fauna of which only 30 to 50 per cent. of the species

372 ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.

occur in the Barton Beds. The 6 to 7 meters of the fresh-water lime-
stone in the Paris Basin probably represents more than half the time
which elapsed between the formation of the Marine Barton and Headon.

Then the sea rose again; and the Oligocene period commenced. The
oldest Oligocene stage in the Isle of Wight is the Lower Headon ; it is
a fresh and brackish water formation, showing one oscillation of the
shore-line. I have given it seven to eight alternations. The stage con-
tains five limestones, separated by deposits of sand and clay, and be-
sides these, two horizons with ferruginous concretions. Reckoning
these, it has seven periods. Marine fossils (Cytherea, Mytilus) some-
times occur in the middle of the stage; fresh-water and brackish forms
above and below. The Lower Headon thus represents one oscillation
of the shore-line (or a little more) with seven climatic changes.

The next stage or oscillation is the Middle and Upper Headon. These
have together six alternations of strata, four limestones, and two beds
with iron concretions separated by clays and sands. The Middle
Headon is brackish at the base, but soon becomes a purely marine for-
mation, with an abundant fossil fauna. The Upper Headon contains
fresh and brackish water animals.

Above the Headon come the Osborne Beds, a nearly pure fresh-water
formation. It has eight to ten alternations: Two Septaria beds, two
ironstone bands, and six horizons with concretions of argillaceous lime-
stone, separated by clay and marl. Ten alternations represent two
oscillations and two ares of the curve.

Over the Osborne comes the Bembridge Stage. The Bembridge beds
consist of :—first, a fresh-water limestone, which has three well-marked
alternations of compact limestone with clay and marl; these three
alternations recur in profiles from the most different localities; over
this the marine Bembridge Oyster-bed, and immediately above this a
Septaria bed, of which Forbes says that it is “ very remarkable and
constant.” Above this come the Lower Bembridge Marls with brackish
and fresh water animals, but without alternations; upon this a Septaria
bed, “sometimes siliceous, sometimes calcareous,” which forms the
boundary between the two substages, the Lower and Upper Bembridge
Marls. In these Upper Marls, which likewise contain brackish and
fresh-water shells and even lignites, I have assumed four climatic alter-
nations: There are two pyritous bands and a marly bed, and at the top,
at the limit of the overlying Hamstead * stage, a bed with ferruginous
concretions capped with marl. But the two pyritous bands and the
first of the above-mentioned marls constitute no paleontological bound-
ary, and are far from being so prominent as the Septaria bed. I there-
fore regard it as the most probable assumption that the whole of the
Bembridge Marls indicate only three alternations of climate, and thus
for the whole stage we have six climatic periods.

ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST oto

consist of brackish and fresh water marls, in which, besides a pyritif-
erous horizon of little importance, and which forms no paleontological
horizon, we find indications of two dry periods. One of these, the so-
called ‘** White Band,” a more or less hardened ferruginous bed rich in
fossils, forms the boundary between the two substages, the lower and
Middle Hamstead Marls; and higher up there is a bed of ironstone
concretions, which nearly coincides with the limit between the sub-
stages of the Middle and Upper Hamstead Marls. The uppermost part
of the Hamstead stage is formed by the marine Cerbula bed, in which
there is a bed with Septaria. The stage therefore represents one oscil-
lation with three climatic alternations; but it is not completely pre-
served, the top having been removed by denudation.

If we now sum up the above statements, we obtain the following
numbers of oscillations of shore-lines and climatic alternations :

Barton, one oscillation, with five climatic alternations.

Headon Hill Sand, without alternations.

Break in the series.

Lower Headon, one oscillation (or a little more), seven alterna-
tions.

Middle and Upper Headon, one oscillation, with six alternations.

Osborne, with eight to ten alternations, corresponding to two
oscillations.

Bembridge, one oscillation, with six alternations.

Hamstead, one (incomplete) oscillation, with three alternations.

Besides the Eocene Barton there are three well-marked marine Oli-
gocene horizons in this series: The Middle Headon, Bembridge
Oyster-bed, and Hamstead Corbula beds. The Middle Headon is re-
garded by paleontologists as synchronous with the marine gypsum in
the Parish basin. I have fitted the Paris beds, so that the marine
gypsum coincides with the are 5’, and the Fontainebleau Sands with
the arc 7’. If we now arrange the equivalent beds in the Isle of Wight
in the same ares, we see that the Isle of Wight profile fits perfectly
into the curve of eccentricity, as follows:

Lower Headon to the are 2’ and perhaps the last part of 1’, with
seven alterations and seven precessions.

Middle and Upper Headon, with five alterations, to the are 3/,
with five precessions.

Osborne, with ten alterations, to the ares 4/ and 5’, with ten pre-

cessions.
Bembridge, with six oscillations, to the are 6/, with five or six
precessions.

Hamstead, with three alterations, to the first part of are 7’, with
three precessions.

It thus appears that the three marine horizons coincide with the three
highest eccentricities, the summits of the ares 3’, 6’, and 7’, while the

loweraresand parts of ares correspond to brackish and fresh-water beds.
The most unmixed fresh-water formation, the Osborne, coincides with
the two lowest ares, 4’ and 5’.

For the sake of comparison, we will again carefully go through the
profile of the Paris Basin, and compare this with Stockwell’s curve,
commencing from the bottom. The beds are numbered in the same way
as in the original description of Dollfus and Vasseur (Bull. Soc. Géol.
Fr., 1878, sér. 3, tom. VI, pp. 243, et seq.).

Sables de Beauchamp et Mortefontaine, etc., beds 89 to lll. Are 14
and first half of 15. In this series we have, first five marine sandstones
alternating with sand; then a limestone and a calcareous marl, with in-
tercalated sand and marl. ‘Thus in all six or seven alterations.

Calcaire de St. Ouen, beds 112 to 142. <A fresh-water formation which
is divided by a marine deposit (128) into two subdivisions. In the
lower part (from the summit of are 15 to the summit of are 16) there are
four horizons of hard limestone and siliceous limestone with interecal-
ated marls. Then comes the marine bed (at the summit of 16). It
must be remarked that the corresponding are in Leverrier’s curve
reaches higher up. In the upper division of fresh-water limestones we
have six alterations of hard limestone and siliceous limestone with marl
and clay. This division therefore finishes a little to the left of the sum-
mit of arc 2’.

Sablas de Monceaux, beds 145 to 145. Marine sand with three Septaria
layers. The rest of are 2’.

Marnes & Pholadomya, beds 146 to 154. Marine, with two alterations
of siliceous limestone and marl. The first part of are 3’.

ternation, and Marne a Luciana, bed 159. The rest of are 3’,

(The beds 146 to 159 thus have together three alternations and corre-
spond to the are 3’.)

part. Butit must be remarked that no fossils have been cited from the
last part of this series. Gypsum ‘alternating with marls about five
times. The most important gypsiferous horizons are the beds 161, 171
to 176, 178 to 188, 191 and 194.

fresh-water marls alternating with marly limestones and ferruginous
marls about four or five times. Are 5/ and the first third of are 6’.

Marne verte, beds 210 to 217, a brackish-water formation with two al-
ternations of clay with marl and siliceous limestone. The upper part
of are 6’.

Caleaire de Brie, beds 218 to 220, a fresh-water limestone. Perhaps
we have here indications of several climatic alternations, for limestones
oceur alternating with marl three or four times, though certainly in
very thin beds. Its place is in the hollow between ares 6/ and 7’.

sults, as shown by the following comparison of the equivalent forma-

It will be seen that the number of alterations of strata is about the
same in the synchronous formations in the Paris and Hampshire Basins.
This shows that this alternation of strata was due to a general cause ;
and that this cause is the precession of the equinoxes, seems highly
probable.

As moreover the curve of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit ap-
pears at the same time to be a curve of the variations of the sea-level,
we may also conclude with probability that for one reason or another
the sea rose and fell with the eccentricity.
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.*

By F. A. SEELY, of the U. S. Patent Office.

In my room in the Patent Office there hangs a Connecticut clock of
ordinary pattern and quite imperfectly regulated. Its variation of per-
haps half a minute in a day, however, gives me no concern, since being
connected by wire with the transmitting clock at the Naval Observatory,
it is every day, at noon, set to accurate time. At the moment of 12
o’clock there comes a stroke on a little bell and simultaneously the
three hands, hour, minute, and second—whether they may have gained
or lost during the preceding twenty-four hours, fly to their vertical po-
sition. Immediately after I hear a chorus of factory whistles, sounded
in obedience to the same signal, dismissing the workmen to their mid-
day meal. At the same moment and controlled by the same impulse,
the ball, visible on its lofty staff from all the ships in New York Har-
bor, drops, and the seamen compare their chronometers for their com-
ing voyage. The same signal is sent to railway offices and governs the
clocks on thousands of miles of track and determines the starting and
stopping and speed of their trains. It goes to the cities of the Gulf and
of the Pacific as well as to those of the Atlantic coast—noted every-
where as an important element in the safe, speedy, and accurate conduct
_ of commerce; and so the work of the regulating clock of the Observa-
tory, sent out by means which note the minutest fraction of a second of
time, is playing its important part in the economy of our century. I
can not follow it out in detail; every one will do so to some extent in
his own mind. But if we were to divide human history into eras ac-
cording to the minuteness with which the passage of time is observed
in the ordinary affairs of life, we should find ourselves to have arrived, .
and very lately, in what might be called the era of seconds.

At the opposite extreme is the period when the passage of day and
night reveals itself to the dullest intellect. Perhaps no savage people
have ever been so dull as not to have noted more than this. We can
hardly conceive a state in which the brutal hunter did not take note of
the declining sun and observe that the close of the day was approach-

ing. The lengthening of his own shadow was an always present phe-
nomenon, and men must have observed shadows almost as soon as they
became capable of observing anything. But this kind of observation
went on for ages without any attempt to sub-divide the day, and none
but the great natural periods marked off by sunrise and sunset were
recognized.

Between this period, marked by the observation of the natural day
only, and that in which we live, there have been many steps of progress,
the very dates of which may in some cases be quite distinctly observed.
We find an era where noon begins to be noted, and the natural day is
equally divided by its observation. Then we find an erain which either
the entire day or its great natural fractions are again divided into
smaller fractions of rather indefinite length, as is now done by some
savages and as was done in the earlier history of Greece and Rome.
Next to this comes the era in which definite artificial fractions of the
day are observed, which may be ealled the era of hours. It was many
centuries after this before men in the ordinary transactions of life
counted their time by minutes, but the time when this began is quite
distinctly marked.

I would not say that these eras are contemporaneous in all nations,
nor could I assert that they correspond closely with any recognized
stages in civilization and culture; in fact, the observation of hours of
the day does not appear to obtain until civilization is reached. This is
true however,—men measure most carefully that which they value most,
and the value of time is enhanced just in proportion to the multiplicity
of the demands upon it which the existing state of society involves.
The man who has engagements at the bank, the custom-house, his own
warehouse or factory, and in a court-room, and a dozen or more indi-

viduals to meet, each of whom, perhaps, has similar pressing engage-
ments, and then must reach an express train at 4:30 in order to dine at
6, fifty miles away, must allot his time with the greatest care and meas-
ure it with the utmost minuteness. To the savage, the sun rises and
sets, and rises again ;—one day is as another; nothing presses but hun-
ger, and that he endures till fortune brings food. He needs no clock to
tell him it is dinner-time, for itis always dinner-time when there is food.
When people travelled leisurely by stage-coach, walking up the hills to
rest the horses, stopping at the wayside inns to dine, and well content
at the close of the day if 50 or 60 miles had been covered, seconds of time
and even minutes were of little account; but when trains are run ona
complex schedule, and for a whole season in advance it is set down at
just what place each train must be at each moment of every day, and
the safety of lives and property depends on exact adherence to the pre-
scribed order, then the station clocks must be invariable and synchro-
nous and the conductor’s watch true to the second. Civilization is
marked at every step of its progress by the multiplication of the varied
relations between men, and since the importance of time is enhanced
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 379

by the same multiplication, it may fairly be asked whether the accuracy
with which time is observed in ordinary life, may not after all aftord one
of the most perfect indications of the social condition of a people.

The material is not gathered for a full discussion of a question like
this, and I shall not oceupy myself with it, but as incidental to and sug-
gested by the topic I have chosen, some tight seems to be thrown on it
by the attempt to place in their true correlation facts of history not
hitherto brought together. I have proposed to myself only a study of
the growth of the common clock, noting the various steps in its devel-
opment with reference to their period in history, and to the social condi-
tions which inspired or demanded them, as well as to the state of science
and mechanic arts which made their consummation possible. The sub-
ject is too large for a single paper, and I have therefore taken for pres-
ent consideration that part which relates to time keeping among the
ancient peoples from whom we chiefly derive our civilization and to a
period of history which, by a sort of coincidence, practically terminates
with the beginning our of era. My guide in this inquiry will be the prin-
ciples in eurematies that inventions always spring from prior inventions
or known expedients, and that they come iu response to recognized
wants. It need not be repeated that these principles find copious illus-
trations in the progress of every art; but the truth can not be too
strongly enforced that the progress of no art can be intelligently studied
or thoroughly comprehended without keeping them in mind.

The few barren and isolated facts that have been preserved to us re-
garding time-keeping: prior to about six hundred years ago are not
enough in themselves, however carefully collated, to constitute an in-
telligible or consecutive history. But I need not say that no event is
in fact isolated from all others in cause and effect; and if we can not
have direct light we may look to the concurrent events of history for
side lights upon our meager facts which will perhaps throw them into
stronger relief than the direct narration of unphilosophical historians.
Hence, it [shall seem to any one to lean too much upon the synchronisms
and sequences of history, it is not that I do not realize the possible fal-
laciousness of an argument which has no other foundation; but in the
progress of inventions such sequences are to be sought for. Invention
responds to want, and the want may originate in some crisis or event
having no apparent affinity in character with the want it engendered or
the invention that sprang to meet it. And these are not mere accidents;
they are the natural course of what I venture to call the fixed laws of
eurematics. At the same time these laws do not necessarily always call
for original invention, since importation of an invention already known
elsewhere may equally supply the want, and historical crises are as likely
to lead to importation, where it is possible, as to invention. It is with
these principles in view, and always looking for such side light as con-
temporary events can give, that I have attempted to frame the consec-
utive history of time-keeping, of which this paper is a part.
380 TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.

There are three primitive forms of time-keeping instruments—the sun-
dial, the clepsydra or water clock, and the graduated candle. The last
plays no part in the evolution of the modern time-keeper, and I shall
pass it by without further notice, notwithstanding some interesting his-
torical associations connected with it. But the sun-dial was at the be-
ginning the only time-keeper, and man’s ideas, developing into wants,
led to its greater perfection till these wants passed far beyond what,
with its limitations, it could supply. Its contribution to the present
state of the art was not large, mechanically considered, but it was enough
to create the demand for something better, and without this contribu-
tion the art could not have been. The rude utensil which the Greeks
called a clepsydra had no resemblance to.the perfected time-piece of
this century, but nothing in history is surer than that out of it, by slow
accretions, science and art, by turns mistress and handmaid, have pro-
duced the masterpiece of both.

This history is, therefore, the history of a human want and of a me-
chanical structure developed in response to it. But wants grow, and
this has grown; and in tracing it we do not find it always in the same
likeness. Sometimes the want of the moment is satisfied, and then it
appears in a novel and unexpected form, altered in its whole complexion
by that which has just appeased it. And as we recognize this Protean
character, we need pot suppose that the Babylonian astrologer who
made some improvement in a sun-dial had a single idea or purpose in
common with those of a railway manager who last week connected his
regulator by wire with the Observatory. We trace our wantin the de-
velopment of institutions, in the creation of new demands upon time, in
the growing complexity of human relations, in political crises, and we
may determine its character or intensity by the means used to supply it
and the generality of their adoption. The story of the growth of the in-
strument is inseparable from that. of the growth of civilization.

Writers on the history of the clock (and they are not few) have gen-
erally begun by a reference to the sun-dial as a Babylonian or Chaldean
invention. We can trace it no further, and have no means of determin-
ing when the invention was made. We iearn from the Old Testament
Scriptures that it was known at Jerusalem as early as seven centuries
before our era, and the manner of its mention indicates that in that city
it was a novelty. King Ahaz, by whose name this dial is called, had
introduced other novelties into his capital on his return from Damascus,
whither he had gone to make his submission to Tiglath-Pileser II, King
of Assyria; and it is not unreasonable to suppose that the dial had the
Sane origin. However this may be, it was a graduated instrument,
having degree marks of some kind which showed the daily course of
the sun. We may infer that it was at least of a Babylonian pattern,
and it points to a remote period when a graduated dial indicating the
time of day by a shadow passing over it was known to Oriental peoples.

Presumably it was their invention. The suggestion that they derived
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 381

it from Egypt is a guess only, based on the supposed earlier growth of
Egyptian science. To such a guess might be opposed the fact that in
all the Egyptian monuments yet explored there is no hint of such an
instrument.

The Assyrian monuments are equally silent; and the same specula-
tion which attempts to account for the absence of all representation of
a sun-dial in the scuiptures which have revealed to us so much of the
domestic life of the Assyrian people applies to Egypt also. We may
believe that it was not a device generally known or commonly used.
Very likely the knowledge of it was confined to the priests and magi,
who were not only ministers of the religion of each country, but the
masters of its science. This device constituted a part of their mystery
and was religiously kept from the public knowledge. In support of this
conjecture it may be said that the Phoenicians, who penetrated every
land, dealt in every merchantable commodity, and from their active com-
mercial habits were the very persons who would have found the use of
a time-piece most valuable, do not appear to have known of any such
instrumentality; but the inner temples of Thebes and Babylon were not
open to those hardy mariners, and the exhumations of Cyprus reveal
no more to us than those of Nimroud and Memphis.

It is scarcely profitable to grope in the darkness for the origin of the
sun-dial; but certain facts are apparent and may be briefly indicated.
In Egypt and Assyria observation of the heavenly bodies was a part of
the religious cult. The regulation of the calendar belonged to the min-
isters of religion. For the regulation of the calendar, which of course
involved the determination of the length of the year, the recurrence of
the solstices must be noted; and these could only be noted by observa-
tion of the day when the shadow cast by the sun at noon was at its
maximum or minimum. The observation of shadows for the determi-
nation of noon led (it could searcely be avoided) to their further ob-
servation during the entire period of the sun above the horizon, and, at
last, to marking the surface on which the shadow was east by perma-
nent lines dividing the day into some kind of regular parts. All this
might be done as a matter of scientific observation without conscious
need of a time-piece.

The sun-dial took many forms, and more than one of these may have
been known to the Babylonians. The art of dialing involved mathe-
matical problems of considerable complexity, and the study of this art
very likely contributed to the knowledge of mathematics that the world
possessed at that early period. The consideration of these forms is not .
germane to my present purpose, which is for the moment only to show
that long before the appearance of the sun-dial in Greece the instru-
ment had been apparently perfected by the wise men of the Hast,

Historians have agreed in fixing the period of the introduction of the
sun-dial into Greece in the latter part of the sixth century B.c. Herod-
otus says it was derived from the Babylonians, from whom he also
382 TIML-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.

declares the Greeks to have derived the twelve parts (dv@deza pépea) of
the day. Others however ascribe its invention to Anaximander, who
is said to have set it up in Lacedzemon. It is evident that he need not
have invented it, but might have brought it from some country where
its use was already known. It is significant that Anaximander and
Anaximenes (to whom some writers ascribe the honor of the invention),
were both fellow-citizens and pupils of Thales of Miletus, and that the
date of this introduction synchronizes with the extensive and intimate
acquaintance between Egypt and Greece, which, commencing in the
reign of Psammetichus, reached its culmination under Amasis, the
fourth king of that dynasty, and in which the people of Miletus bore
the most prominent part. Under this last king, whom they assisted in
throwing off the yoke of Assyria, Greeks swarmed in the Egyptian
court, filled her armies, manned her fleets. They passed to and fro
continually; Greek philosophers pursued their studies in Egyptian
schools; and who shall say how many of the secrets of art and science
found their way at that time from the land of the Pharaohs to the
spirited and versatile people just emerging from barbarism across the
Mediterranean? Surely, if under such conditions anything of Egyptian
origin or likely to have been in Egyptian possession is found to have
made its appearance among the Greeks, we need not speculate as to
how it got there.

It does not appear that the sun-dial was introduced to the Greeks in
any perfected form. On the contrary, it was at first a mere staff or
pillar (yyépov), destitute of any graduated dial which could indicate
the passage of an hour or any definite fraction of a day. The length
of the shadow, measured in feet, determined the time for certain regu-
lar daily duties, as a shadow 6 feet long indicated the hour for bathing
and one 12 feet long that for supper. More accurate and convenient
forms were perhaps known to philosophers; but if so, they did not
come into common use. This simple device was sufficient for the sim-
ple habits of the people. The twelve parts of the day of which Herod-
otus speaks had no meaning to the Athenians, who had no word meaning
specifically an hour; and as late as the time of Alexander, the old system
seems to have been followed. This kind of observation, it may be re-
marked, was perfectly feasible in the shadow of an Egyptian obelisk,
which may partly account for the absence of the instrument from other
monuments of that country. As a matter of history, an obelisk at
Rome was actually used for a sun-dial in the time of Augustus.

We learn from this history at what period and in what stage of prog-
ress the Greeks first had the idea of measuring time. If we associate
it with the period of Solon, the Athenian law-giver who died about 570
B. C., we may form some idea of the condition of the people of Athens
from the character of his legislation and the miseries he attempted to
mitigate. The Greeks had written language and they had literature,—
Homer, Hesiod, Sappho. They had a system of weights and measures,
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 383

and a coinage. They were prolific in political ideas. But the period
just previous to Solon was marked by the tyranny of the oligarchs, the
severity of whose legislation gave the term ‘ Draconian” its signifi-
cance, by widespread poverty, by slavery, by the decline of agriculture
and industry, and by the unceasing war of factions. Athens was
emerging from such conditions as these, under the reign of Pisistratus,
at the time when the Milesian philosopher is said to bave introduced
the sun-dial. We may conceive that the conditions were not favor-
able to the general adoption of any novelty of this character, but it is
noticeable that this period was followed immediately by one of dem-
ocratic ascendency under the constitution of Cleisthenes, in which the
naval power and commercial importance of Athens were vastly aug-
mented, and which continued without interruption until his invincible
phalanxes laid all Greece at the feet of Philip of Macedon.
’ It was during this era of maritime vigor, of commercial prosperity,
and of dominating influence at home and abroad, that Athens achieved
that splendor in art which has made her a beacon-light for all subse-
quent peoples and ages; and in this period, time-keeping in common
life had its first development. But the sun-dial is an instrument of
limited capacity ; however perfected, it was valueless in the hours of
night and in the days of cloud and storm that even sunny Greece does
not always escape. But more than this, it was incapable of in-door
use; and in the outgrowth of institutions under democratic order and
among a litigious and voluble people a new and singular want had
arisen demanding some means of checking time which, from its limita-
tions, the sun-dial could nut supply. With her other arts, that of ora-
tory had developed in Athens; but every orator was not a Pericles,
and whatever may have been the merits or defects of their perform-
ances the inordinate length of these was too great a tax on the tribu-
nals. It therefore became necessary to limit avd apportion the time
of public speakers in the courts, and to do this equitably some practical
means of indicating time was necessary. Hence arose the demand for
another instrumentality whose origin and history are now to be traced.
It is proper to pause for a moment here to note a distinction between
two kinds of instruments used to measure time. A continuous instru-
ment like a clock, which marks off the hours of the day and night as
they pass successively away, is what is called in Gommon language a
time-keeper ; but there is a class of instruments which do not keep the
record of continuous time, but are used only for the checking of brief
periods ; such an instrument is the glass by which the seaman observes
his log or the cook boils her eggs. To such instruments, for the want
of a better term, I give the name time-checks, to distinguish them from
time-keepers. Their use is quite distinct from that of observing the
time of day, and yet it is apparent at once, that by careful attendance,
as by turning the hour-glass at the moment when its last sand has run
out, the time-check may be made to perform the office of a time-keeper,
384 TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.

The allusions of ancient writers and of some modern ones to devices of
these two classes are sometimes mis-leading and confusing because this
distinction has not been kept in view. It is particularly important in
the study of the clepsydra, which is originally a time-check only, while
the sun-dial is a true time-keeper.

The clepsydra or water clock, in its simplest form, is traced by his-
torians no further than Greece, about 430 B. C., in the time of Aristo-
phanes, whose familiar references to it show its use for certain purposes
to have been common.

I confess I have been far from satisfied with stopping at this half-way
house in seeking for the origin of this instrument. I have sought fur-
ther, and what I have found, if conclusive of nothing, is at least sug-
gestive. :

If, taking our lives in our hands, we could step on board a Malay proa,
we should see floating in a bucket of water a cocoanut shell having a
small perforation, through which the water by slow degrees finds its
way into the interior. This orifice is so proportioned that the shell will
fill and sink in an hour, when the man on watch calls the time and sets
it afloat again. This device of a barbarous, unprogressive people, so
thoroughly rude in itself, I conceive to be the rudest that search of any
length can bring to light. It is in all aspects rudimentary. One can
scarcely conceive of anything back of it but the play of children, and
as a starting point for this history, it is much more satisfactory than
what is disclosed in the polished ages of Greece. There is nothing in
its structure, if we were to consider that only, to prevent it from being
a survival of an age long antecedent to the use of metal. The pro-
tolithic age might have originated it if can conceive that protolithic man
could have had use for it.

Leaving our piratical friends, to whom we are so much indebted, and
passing to their not remote neighbors in Northern India, we find the
rude cocoanut shell developed into a copper bow]. Its operation is the
same; but the attendant who stands by and watches the moment of its
sinking, now strikes the hour on the resonant metal. It is easy to see—
in fact it would be difficult to doubt—that this has been an improve-
ment on an apparatus like that of the Malay and the natural result of
improvements in other arts, eminently that of metal-working. It is
more enduring, more perfectly accomplishes its purpose, and is in the
precise direction that improvement on the ruder appliance might be ex-
pected to pursue.

Passing from Southern Asia to a people geographically remote, I next
observe the water clock in use up to this day in China. We find the
metal vessel with its minute perforation as before, but it has undergone
a radical change in respect to its manner of use. It is now filled and
the water flows from it in drops. Obviously enough the flight of time
might be indicated by merely observing when the vessel has emptied
itself, and then re-filling it, which, as will presently appear, was exactly
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 385

the simplest Greek and Roman clepsydra and differs in no mechanical
respect from the ordinary sand-glass.

But in the days when the Chinese were a progressive people and de-
veloped inventions for which Kurope had many centuries to wait, this
water-clock advanced far beyond the crude thing we have been con-
sidering. It would seem that the problem was to increase its usefulness
by sub-dividing the unreasonably long intervals required for the com-
plete emptying of the vessel. If this was done by marking graduations
on the inside of the vessel and so noting the decline of the level the
difference in its rate could not fail quickly to make itself manifest.. The
solution of this problem, not obvious at first, was found in so arranging
the vessel that it should discharge into another, where the indication
would be read in the rise of the surface, and contriving to hold the
water in the upper vessel at a constant level. This was done by employ-
ing a third source, from which there was a constant flow into the first
equal to its discharge. As the head in the middle vessel is thus main-
tained constant, the rise in the lowest is made uniform. Another radical
improvement enhancing the practical utility of the device was the ar-
rangement of a float on the surface of the water in the lowest vessel.
Upon this was an indicator or hand, which in its rise travelled over an
adjacent scale, and so gave a time indication visible at a distance.

To show what progress this structure implies in the development of
the mechanical clock it is worth while to glance a moment at the essen-
tial elements of such an instrument. Reduced to its lowest terms a
clock consists of three elements only. These are a motor, or source of
power, represented in our clocks by a spring or weight; an escape-
ment, or a means by which the stored power in the motor is let off at a
measured rate; and a dial, which is but the means by which the rate
at which the power is let off is made visible to the eye. In this
Chinese water-clock we discover all these elements. Water, acted on
by gravity, is a familiar form of motor; the small perforation through
which it slowly trickles drop by drop is a true escapement, doing in
its place just what our complicated mechanisms are doing in theirs;
and, rude as it may appear, it is one which mechanicians of our
time are not ready to dispense with. The visual indication is given
by the rise of the float, causing the pointer to pass over the scale.
Going backward from this Chinese clock we perceive, but less dis-
tinctly, the same elements in the Indian and Malay devices, in which
the operation is reversed. In these the weight of the vessel, held
up by the resistance of the water in which it floats, is the power;
the perforation admitting the water by slow degrees is the escape-
ment, and the only indicator is the visible sinking of the vessel
itself.

The three devices Gescribed correspond in the degree of their per-
fection with the conditions of art and culture among the peoples to
which they belong; and, as these conditions appear to have been

386 TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.

unchanged for a long period, we hazard little in assuming that they
date from a remote epoch. A description of the Hindoo instrument
appears in a Sanscrit work on astronomy in which it is adopted for
astronomical observations, and Chinese writers do not hesitate to
ascribe the invention to Hwang-ti, who flourished, according to their
chronology, more than twenty-five centuries before our era, and its
later improvement by the introduction of the float to Duke Chau,
fourteen centuries later.

In describing these three devices in the order in which I have placed
them I do not mean to be understood as intimating that they have
followed the same order in respect to the time of their development
nor that they have been transmitted from one people to another in the
same order. I have, for convenience, proceeded from the lowest form
to the highest; but it may well be true that the lower was an adapta-
tion from the higher, fitting it for coarser needs, and so being in a
certain sense an improvement. Consideration of the lines of commerce
might in fact lead to the suspicion that the Malay got his notions
from the Chinese, since they must for many centuries have sailed the
same waters and been in frequent contact.

But we may come further west. Writers on this subject, while
attributing to the Chaldeans the invention of the sun-dial, do not
generally accredit them with the knowledge of any other instrument
for measuring time. But if we may take as an authority Sextus Em-
piricus, who wrote near the end of the second century of our era,
they had, as he tells quite minutely, the same device, and used it in
their astronomical observations. ‘They divided,” says this author,
“the zodiac into twelve equal parts, as they supposed, by allowing
water to run out of a small orifice during the whole revolution of a
star, and dividing the fluid into twelve equal parts, the time answer-
ing for each part being taken for that of the passage of a sign over
the horizon.” I see no reason for doubting this. In fact the division
of the zodiac into twelve signs seems to require a means of measuring
the passage of time at night, and this fact and the story just quoted
tally with the conclusion that an instrument of the common generic
character borne by all the forms I have described was known among
widely distinct peoples of Asia before the dawn of European civiliza-
tion.

Such an invention is not likely to be lost by political changes while
supremacy in the exact sciences is maintained. We know that down
to the Medo-Persian conquerors of Babylon each successive dominant
race adopted, as has often happened in history, the dress, the manners,
and the arts of the conquered; and we need not doubt that this instru-
ment was in use in the Persian Empire when its sword first crossed
that of the Greeks.

No record exists of the introduction of the clepsydra into Greece.
We might infer from the absence of all reference to it by Herodotus
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 357

that up to the period when his history ends, 478 B. c., it was not
known. Fifty or sixty years later, when Aristophanes was writing his
comedies, it was absolutely familiar in Athens. The interval named
seems short in accounting for so radical a change in the habits of a
people as is implied by the general introduction of such an appliance ;
and yet, if we ask ourselves as to the condition of the electric tele-
graph or the sewing-machine fifty years ago or of the telephone ten
years ago, it need not startle us to conceive that a versatile people like
the Greeks were capable of as swift changes in their habits of life, as
these inventions have induced in ours. That this epoch saw more than
one change in Athens, in the aspect of the city, in the habits of the
people, and above all in their advance in culture and refinement and
the arts of peace, we may be sure when we remember that it includes
all the years of Pericles’ administration. It ineludes also the aban-
donment by Sparta, always unprogressive, of the leadership of the
Greek commonwealths, and with this abandonment the removal of the
re-actionary influences hitherto a clog to the enterprise and prosperity
of Athens and of all Greece.

In the absence of data on this subject it seems not unreasonable to
believe that the knowledge of the clepsydra, vhich was widely spread
among Oriental peoples, was introduced int) Athens from the East
during—or at the termination of—the second Persian war; and if we
choose to surround its introduction with the halo of romance, it is not
hard to conceive that these useful devices of civilization were gathered
up among the spoils of Platza or washed ashore with the wrecks of
Salamis. A more commonplace and not less likely conjecture would be
that the instrument was already becoming known in the Creek colonies
of Asia, and perhaps even in Athens herself, through intercourse with
the Persians and other Oriental peoples. It came into common use in
obedience to the want, not of a time-keeper, which was already supplied,
but of a time-check,—a want created by the conditions of Athenian so-
ciety which I have already described, and which the only known time-
keeper could not satisfy.

If the increasing burden and tediousness of litigation led to the en-
actment of a statute restricting and apportioning the time of speakers
in the courts, and providing this means for its regulation, it is easy to
seé that the use of such means must become at once familiar. I have
found no trace of such enactments, but that strict ordinances existed
there is no doubt. We know that the time of speakers was carefully
proportioned to the importance of the case; and trials of importance
enough to have the time apportioned were known as zpos édwp, while
those of trifling importance, in which perhaps no lawyer appeared,
were known as davev Sdatos, two terms which may be freely rendered
wet and dry, the dry case being as it happens most quickly disposed of.

50 gallons of water. Nothing however seems to be known of the
actual length of time indicated by this quantity of water. A passage
in Aristotle gives some idea of the form of the clepsydra as commonly
used. It was a spherical bottle with its minute opening at the bottom
and a short neck at the top, into which the water was poured. The
running out of the water at the bottom could be stopped by closing this
neck. In using the word bottle I do not mean to imply that this
clepsydra was of glass. Glass vessels of a suitable size could not be
made at that period.

The familiar association of this device with the courts is shown in
many ways. Aristophanes throughout his comedies is in the habit of
using the word clepsydra as a synonym for court of justice, and in a
humorous passage in The Wasps the impossibility of conducting a trial
without it is quite forcibly set forth, by the introduction, to supply its
place, of a vessel intended for less refined purposes. In fact, 5d0p be-
came a synonym for time. We find Demosthenes charging his oppo-
nent with talking 2y ré 2yna 5date, “in my water ;” and on another occa-
sion he shows the value he attached to the time allotted to him by turn-
ing to the officer, when interrupted, with a peremptory ob 6: éxthaBe 70
Bdwp, “You there! Stop the water !”

I shall again have to refer to this use of the clepsydra when I come
to the Roman period of this history, and will not follow it further now;
nor shall I consider its use as a time-keeper, which, if ever general in
Greece, was not until a very late period, belonging rather to the Roman
chapter also. The story that Plato had a clepsydra which indicated the
hours of night is of little moment, although it is frequently taken as in-
dicating some kind of a striking apparatus; but the language of the
author who is the only authority for the statement contains no allusion
to an audible signal, nor in fact any intelligible allusion except to a
larger clepsydra than usual.

In fact, all the improvements by which this instrument was converted
into a time-keeper belong to so late a period of Greek history that it is
more convenient to consider them further on.

Where Greek colonies were founded, and where Greek influence pre-
dominated Greek acts and culture flourished also. Under the Ptolemies,
Alexandria became a second home of art and science, not inferior to
Athens herself. Toa greater or less extent the same must have been
true of the great cities which dotted the northern coast of the Mediter-
ranean, such as Tarentum, Agrigentum, and Syracuse. With kindred
people, similar culture and needs, and with unceasing commercial in-
tercourse, there is no reason to doubt that whatever was in common use
in the mother cities found its way to them also. It was in Alexandria
that in the shape of what is appropriately termed the water-clock the
clepsydra attained its highest development, in the inventions of Ctesi-
bius, who is placed by some writers in the third century B. Cc. and by
others with more probability in the second, I reserve these inventions
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 389

also for the latest epoch in this history, to which they seem more prop-
erly to belong, and will now pass to Rome.

There is no reason to believe that the Etruscan people, with all their
proficiency in certain arts and a vigorous and extensive maritime com-
merce, possessed any artificial means of indicating time. If they had,
it could hardly have failed to come into use among the Romans, whose
relations with them for centuries were close, even if generally hostile.
But it was not till a late period, long after Etruria had been crushed
under the successive assaults of her northern and southern enemies,
that any device of this character was known to the people of Rome.

Indeed, the condition of society and of the arts in Rome at that era
was not such as to require any reckoning of the time of day beyond
the observation of sunrise and sunset. In the. twelve tables, which
date from the middle of the fifth century B. C., noon also is mentioned.
But the facts that history has preserved to us show that the Romans of
that time were a thoroughly rude and almost barbarous people. It was
not till two centuries later than this, in the year of Rome 485 (268 B.
c.), that silver coinage was first struck. Pliny says that barbers were
first introduced about the same time, and that till then the Romans had
gone unshorn, Cicero says the arts which had reached some degree of
perfection in Etruria were even allowed to retrograde. He says the
Romans had some knowledge of arithmetic and land surveying, but
they could not improve their calendar, and were not even in condition
to erect a common sun-dial. As to the state of commerce and agricult-
ure, we are told that in the fourth century of Rome, private enterprise
was so inadequate to the provisioning of the city, that state commis-
sioners were placed in charge of it.

It would seem that Rome was at that period a capital, populous in-
deed, but without arts or sciences, without industries and without culti-
vation. War was the only trade and pJunder the only source of public
or private revenue. For the civil purposes of such a people the natural
divisions of time were all that were necessary. They marked the pe-
riods for toil and repose, and that was enough.

These were a ruder people than those of Athens in the time of Solon ;
but if they had less of culture they had less of tyranny and less of in-
testine warfare to contend with at home than had the Greeks, and they
were always reaching out, widening their domain, absorbing neighbor-
ing peoples, and making each in its turn add to the strength and glory
of their capital. Whatever the art and science of the subdued nations
could contribute to the prosperity of Rome, came by the enforced levy
of the conqueror.

The time system of early Rome was, like everything else, of the
rudest character. Growing out of their military habits and adapted to
them, it divided the day and night each into four watches, the periods
of which must have been roughiy determined by observation of the
courses of the sun and stars. In the city, according to Pliny, noon be-

gan to be accurately observed some years after the publication of the
law of the twelve tables. The accensus watched for the moment when,
from the Senate House, he first caught sight of the sun between the
Rostra and the Grieco-Stasis, when he proclaimed publicly the hour of
noon. From the same point he watched the declining sun and pro-
claimed its disappearance.

Authorities differ as to the date of the introduction of the sun-dial
into Rome. Pliny attributes it to the consul L. Papirius Cursor, who
set it up at the temple of Quirinus. This has been supposed to be a
trophy from the Samnite war, but, as the Samnites were a ruder people
even than the Romans, that seems scarcely credible. Varro, as reported
by Pliny, gives a clearer story, that the first public sun-dial erected in
Rome was fixed upon a column near the Rostra in the time of the first
Punie war by the Consul Valerius Messala, and adds that it was brought
from the capture of Catina. The date given by Varro, 491 A. U. ¢.,
corresponds to 262 B. c., and is about thirty years later than that
ascribed by Pliny to the dial of Cursor. As a source for this instru-
ment, Sicily with her Greek arts and refinements, is much more prob-
able than the rude Samnite people, and with real appreciation of Pliny’s
frankness, we may accept the story he quotes from Varro in preference
to his own.

What were the social conditions in Rome at this period, the middle
of tie third century before our era? It needs scarcely more than a
glance at a chronological table to see that it was a period of swift ad-
vance from the primitive rudeness that has been described. In the
year 283 B. c. Etruria and her allies, hitherto perpetual foes to Rome,
were totally defeated at the Vadimonian Lake, and about 265 B. 0.
Etruscan independence disappeared forever, simultaneously with the
subjugation of all Italy. The whole peninsula her own, Rome reaches
out beyond. The Grieco-Egyptian monarchy, then at the very height
of its power and magnificence under Ptolemy Philadelphus, seeks her
alliance. The Greek cities across the Adriatic court her favor. She
pushes her conquering arms across into Sicily, which, in 241 B. C., be-
comes a Roman province, followed a little later by Corsica and Sar-
dinia. No longer prima inter pares among the warring tribes and na-
tions of Italy, she has sprung as if at a single bound into her position
as one of the great powers of the world.

The absorption of Magna-Grvecia and Sicily brought under her do-
minion for the first time a cultured people and populous cities, filled
with and habituated to Grecian art and the appliances of refinement
and luxury, and the sun-dial of Catina is but one instance of what was
borne away to embellish the Imperial City. Doubtless the fame and
wealth of the capital offered strong inducements to the skilled artisans
of dismantled Tarentum, while the captives of Agrigentum may in
their turn have contributed in no small degree to her industrial popu-
lation.
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. ool

The colonists planted by thousands far and wide over the conquered
territory of Italy formed a sturdy rural population,—a strong reliance
in peace and war. And the great highways built for the march of the
legions, and hitherto searcely resounding but to their armed tread, now
became the arteries of a steady and growing traffic. The needs of a
circulating medium in her domestic and foreign trade were ill supplied
by the copper coins she had struck hitherto, and the products of vari-
ous foreign mints that had come to her with her otber acquisitions ; and
in 258 B. C., she began to coin silver of her own. Carthagenian jeal-
ousy of her aggressive rivalry led to the necessity of maintaining a
fleet, and (after some disasters) to maritime supremacy.

‘‘The ten years preceding the first Punic war,” says Dr. Thomas Ar-
nold, ‘+ were probably a time of the greatest physical prosperity which the
mass of the Roman people had ever seen,” and it is in this very decade,
with enlarging industries, with a growing commerce, with multiplying
complications in public and private business, that Rome stepped from
the spring time of her history into her vigorous summer, and with this,
step time-keeping began.

The Catanian sun-dial was no mere gnomon such as had been intro-
duced into Greece three centuries earlier. Greek science and genius had
been at work on it, and it was an improved instrument, constructed for
a particular latitude, and that 5° south of Rome. But there was no
science yetin Rome to detect its imperfections, and, in spite of them,
for ninety-nine years it served as the regulator of time for the city.
Searcely credible as it may seem, it was not therefore till about a cen-
tury anda half betore the Christian era that Rome possessed: her first
accurate time-keeper in the form of a sun-dial constructed especially
for her own latitude, which was set up at the instance of the Censor
Marcius Phillippus. Meanwhile dials of imperfect construction had
become common in the city; so common indeed, that as new inven-
tions nowadays afford material for the American paragrapher, they be-
came the happy sourceof quipsandepigrams. Thus Plautus, in what I
admit is rather a liberal version :

When I was young, no time-piece Rome supplied,
jut every fellow had his own—inside ;

A trusty horologe, that—rain or shine—

Ne’er failed to warn him of the hour—to dine.

Then sturdy Romans sauntered through the Forum,

Tat, hale, content; for trouble ne’er came o’er them.

But now these cursed dials show their faces

All over Rome, in streets and public places ;

And men, to know the hour, the cold stone question,

That has no heart, no stomach, no digestion.

They watch the creeping shadows—daily thinner—

Shadows themselves, impatient for their dinner.

Give me the good old time-piece, if you please,

Confound the villain that invented these !
392 TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.

As formerly, in Greece, the clepsydra came to supply the deficiencies
of the sun-dial, so history repeated itself in Rome. Pliny ascribes its
introduction to Scipio Nasica in the year of Rome 595 (158 B. c.). Of
the form of this clepsydra we have no knowledge, butit was no longer a
mere time-check, such as was used in the Athenian courts, but a true
time-keeper, capable of indicating continuously the hours both of day
and night. There were many adopted for this purpose, as will pres-
ently beshown. In Pompey’s third consulship (52 B. c.), he introduced
the custom of apportioning the time of orators in the courts by the
clepsydra, after the Greek fashion. The decline of Roman oratory has
been attributed to this restriction, which, after all, seems to have left
the speaker a fair amount of time. Pliny says: “I spoke for almost
five hours, for to the twelve clepsydre of the largest size which I re-
ceived, four were added.” Some read twenty in place of twelve, which
seems to be the preferable reading, and out of it we get some idea of
the time consumed by one discharge of the vessel. If twenty-four
clepsydras 1s ‘almost five hours,” it appears likely that the discharge
was at the rate of five to the hour; and this helps us to better under-
stand Martial’s epigram to a tedious lawyer who had been permitted to
exhaust the clepsydra seven times. It makes something less than an
hour and a half; but the orator’s mouth was as dry as his discourse,
and he drank copiously, whereupon the witty poet suggests that he can
satisfy his thirst and his audience at once by drinking out of the
clepsydra.

In Rome at this period the use of the clepsydra, in the form both ofa
time-check and time-keeper, was quite general,—not as the house clock
is common to-day—but generally known, and serving to regulate the
hours of business and pleasure. Menof means had them in their houses,
and slaves were kept whose special duties were to watch them and re-
port the hour. Idlers meeting in the market-place or forum accosted
each other with “* Hora quota est,” by way of opening conversation, as
they now comment on the weather or compare watches. Generals took
the water-clock with them to the field and relieved the watch by it dur-
ing the hours of night. An allusion by Cesar has been the source of a
curious misconception, that he found this instrument in use among the
Britons at the time of hisinvasion. Evidently referring tothe phenom-
enon now so familiar of the Arctic night hesays some had reported that
at Mona the night at the winter solstice lasted fora month. “ Our in-
quiries,” he continues, ‘* did not confirm this, but by careful measure-
ments ex aqua we saw that the nights were shorter than on the conti-
nent.” To draw from this the conclusion that the early Britons had
water-clocks is about as if we were to infer from the Signal Service
observations at Point Barrow that the Eskimos of that region were
found in possession of the thermometer.

Greece too had by this time fallen under Roman rule, and the clep-
sydra as a time-keeper was well known in Athens. The most eminent
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 393

instance of it probably for all time, was in the Tower of the Winds,
which, fifty years before our era, was erected in the market-place in that
city. A running stream kept at a constant level the water in an upper
vessel, the discharge from which raised a float in a lower one, like that
in the Chinese water-clock before described. This was the public time-
piece of Athens, and its indications could always be compared with
those of the sun-dials on the frieze of the octagonal building by which
it wasinclosed. At the top of the roof was a weather-vane in the form
of a Triton, who pointed with his trident towards the prevailing wind.
This institution served for Athens the combined purpose of a naval
observatory and a weather bureau.

With time-keeping so generally observed, and with a fair degree of
accuracy secured by means of mechanical contrivances, this history
closes, but in reciting it I have omitted or only incidentally touched
upon the growth of the idea of dividing the day into hours and the me-
chanical elaboration of what—in its perfected form—is properly termed
the water-clock. These elements, in the complete history, are too im-
portant to be omitted.

Since we are only concerning ourselves with time-keeping in common
life, we need not go back to Egypt or Babylon, where there is no evi-
dence that it was known except to the initiated few. Whatever ideas
are conveyed to us by the twelve divisions of the day known to the
Babylonians, or by the graduated dial set up by the Hebrew king in his
palace, it is evident that if the Greek philosophers derived from their
Eastern contemporaries any notions of common or domestic time-keep-
ing, these failed to take root in their soil until Greece, by her own pro-
gress, had prepared it to receive them.

The divisions of the day known to Homer were three: js, for the
period from sunrise till noon; péoov juap, for mid-day ; and de¢idy, for
afternoon till sunset. These divisions were employed in Greece to the
latest period and long after others more exact were inuse. Even with
our nice observance of time we have similar general expressions for
parts of the day, such as morning, mid-day, afternoon, and many others
often having only local use.

If the Babylonian “twelve parts” of the day were made known to
the Greeks, as Herodotus tells us, it was a knowledge for which they
had no use at that period. With the introduction of the gnomon they
began to observe time more closely, but they had no names for its arbi-
trary divisions.

When the shadow was 6 feet long it was time to bathe; when twice
that length it was time tosup. It is not even certain, to my mind, that
they clearly appreciated the varying length of the day. There is no
possibility of setting a summer and winter day side by side and com-
paring them, and the difference between them can only be determined
by some means of measuring time quite distinct from observation of
the sun or shadows. The great difference between the days of winter
394 TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.

and summer in our latitude, which is nearly that of Athens, seems to
us to be plainly discernable; but if we could divest ourselves of our ac-
quired knowledge and of our means for keeping time, and put ourselves
in the place of the Greek of 600 B. C., we should probably fail to ob-
serve the fact except very dimly.

Accurate division begins with the observation of noon, and we have
seen pretty clearly when this began in Greece. The next step in sub-
division consists in dividing the day into quarters by dividing equally
the periods before and after noon. This division was at least known to
the Greeks, but I see no evidence that it was in common use; nor in
fact does it appear that they in daily life made use of close sub-divisions,
until Roman influences prevailed and the Roman divisions of the day
were adopted.

In Rome the division of both the day and night into four watches re-
sulted naturally from the military character of her people and remained
in use down to the latest period. These divisions of the day corre-
sponded with what were afterwards the third, six, and ninth hours, and
it was customary for one of the subordinate officers of the praetor to
proclaim them. They bad also a three-part division corresponding to
that of the Greeks.

Artificial means of measuring time came to the Romans so much later
than to the Greeks that great improvements had been wrought in them.
Science had gone so far in Egypt and Sicily that sun-dials were con-
structed for particular latitudes; but it is not clear that, as at first in-
troduced, they were graduated. The same sub-division of the day into
four watches that has just been noticed might obviously give the first
suggestion of such graduation by bisecting the angle between the noon-
mark and those of sunrise and sunset. As a closer sub-division was re-
quired the Romans appear to have taken one already known in Egypt
and better adapted to the latitude of Thebes and Memphis than to that
of Italy. This was the division of the day and night into twelfths
(which varied in their length as the seasons changed) and is commonly
known as the Roman system. Before intimate relations began between
Rome and Egypt, Greece had already been annexed and the same sys-
tem was introduced there, as also in Palestine, and wherever the Roman
eagles penetrated. This division adapted itself perfectly to the older
one already in use in Rome and its adoption was natural. The only
change in the sun-dial that it involved was a further sub-division of the
spacing. Being an improvement that cost nothing and could be
adopted without any radical changes in the habits of daily life, it was
one to commend itself to the people, who were slow to change; and when
a few years later, in the middle of the second century B. C., Hippar-
chus proposed the division into equinoctial hours, the same as used
now, the proposition met no weleome. This accurate and convenient
system did not adapt itself to the established notions of the times, and
the Roman hours secured a firmer and firmer grip, resulting, as I am
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 395

inclined to believe, in one of the most remarkable instances of retarda-
tion of invention that history records. It was not until Europe had
emancipated herself from slavery to this most awkward of time systems
that modern time-keeping became possible. For many centuries in-
vention was as it were thrown off the scent by the necessity of con-
verting the regular and uniform motions which could be given to
mechanism into means for displaying the ever-varying hours of the Ro-
man system.

The word “hora,” proposed by Hipparchus to express these divisions
of the day, was adopted inits new sense by Greeks and Romans simul-
taneously and has ever since held its place in all the languages of
Europe. In fact it was used in two senses; in its significance of the va-
rying Roman hour it could not be employed to define exact intervals of
time; when employed for that purpose itexpressed exactly what we ex-
press by it now,—the twenty-fourth part of a civil day. The passage in
Pliny I have quoted is not intelligible unless the word ‘* hour” is em-
ployed in this sense.

Enough was said in the early part of this paper to show the line in
which the clepsydra developed, the water-clock at Canton and that in
the Tower of the Winds at Athens being examples of it in a fairly per-
fected state as a time-keeper. Invention had succeeded in giving to the
rising pointer a regular motion, and adapting it well to its purpose.
Other advances were made in it, and of these it remains to speak.
Improvement, handicapped by the clumsy Roman hours, found in this
fact a stimulus to ingenuity. To adapt it to indicate these hours one
rude scheme was to reduce the capacity of the vessel from which the
water flowed by coating it with wax in the winter time. The orifice
remaining unchanged it emptied more quickly. The wax was gradually
removed as the days lengthened. Of course the same instrument
could not serve for both day and night. Less clumsy means for regu-
lating the flow, as by adjusting the size of the orifice, were afterwards
invented. One of these involved the passage of the water through a
hollow cone or funnel, in which was an interior cone capable of adjust-
ment. for each day in the year; another, invented by Ctesibius, left the
water-flow, and consequently the rise and fall of the float—constant,
but included an automatic device by which the graduated scale over
which the marker travelled was changed daily.

This difficulty in adapting the clepsydra to keep Roman time is pre-
cisely the same that the early Dutch navigators met with on their in-
troduction of the clock into Japan, where the division of the day is
into ten hours of varying length. The plan they adopted is a clumsy
one, but of the same character as that of Ctesibius, since they did not
attempt to alter the rate of the ciock, but attached movable indications
to the dial so that they might be changed with the season. One of
these clocks is in the possession of the Bureauof Education, a gift from
the Japanese Government after the Centennial Exposition of 1876,
396 TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME.

But improvements in the clepsydra such as have been described, not-
withstanding the ingenuity and mechanical skill they displayed, are of
little consequence to us, since they were not towards the accomplish-
ment of the final result but away from it. The actual steps towards
the modern clock appear to be these: First, the employment of the or-
dinary rack and pinion device. If we are right in attributing the in-
vention of gear-wheels to Archimedes, this application could not have
been made earlier than the middle of the third century B. Cc. (287 to
212). Itis attributed to Ctesibius, who, for many reasons as I have
said already, is placed a century later than this. A series of teeth,
commonly called a rack, was attached to the side of the rod, which was
supported by the float, and had heretofore served only as an index.
Fixed on a horizontal shaft above the vessel was a small toothed wheel,
with which the toothed rack engaged, and which was, therefore, caused
to turn by therise of the float. On this shaft was a pointer attached
like the hour-hand of a clock and travelling over a similar dial. To make
this hand complete a circuit in twelve or twenty-four hours, is obviously
only a question of the proportion of parts. The next step forward dis-
pensed with the rack and pinion, and really was in the line of greater
simplicity. In place of the toothed wheel a grooved pully was used,
over which passed a cord from the float, being kept tight by a weight
at the other end. The hand remained on the wheel shaft as before, and
with the gradual rise of the float, traversed the dial.

We have reached the point where we may say “ presto, change,” and
behold, a clock springs into view, for it is instantly apparent that with
this structure it is no longer the water that advances the hand ; water
is not the motor now. The weight is the motor, and its fall is retarded
by the float, which only permits its descent as fast as the rise of water
in the vessel permits its own rise. We have an actual weight clock,
with what we must be content to regard as a water escapement; it is
far enough from our perfected time-piece, but in respect to its essential
elements it differs in but one, and henceforth the problem of the clock
is only that of escapements. But we need not expectit to be solved at
once. It will be centuries before the actual problem will be recognized,
so great is the obscurity with which the Roman time system has be-
clouded the subject.

There is a long and mournful perspective before us. The golden age
of Roman literature is here, but she has yet to see the greatest extent
of her empire and the summit of her own magnificence. A long line of
Ciesars will come, base and noble alternating. Her decline will follow
her glory; her palaces are to be plundered by barbarous northern in-
vaders; her empire is to be shattered; out of her vast domain new
peoples and nations and empires scarcely less mighty than her own are
to spring, while she herself sinks to the paltry dimensions of a village.
Her polished speech shall die from men’s lips, but the rude dialects of
her provinces, mingling with the uncouth tongues of illiterate Franks
TIME-KEEPING IN GREECE AND ROME. 397

and Goths, shall develop into new languages, in time to become as per-
fect vehicles of thought as their original. New forms of government and
of social order shall spring from her laws and institutions and philoso-
phies ; and from the hills of credulous and despised Judea is to burst
a new religion, before whose bright beams the perpetual fires of Vesta
shall pale and the whole train of Olympian gods vanish like the mist.
But amongst these unconceived changes, and through the storms that
shall sweep away—and the cataclysms that shall engulf—all the objects
of her pride and glory and reverence, there shall still endure what she
cared least for (constant in all their inconstancy), the Roman hours.

The problem of improving the time-keeper is one with which cloistered
scholars and mechanicians will not cease to contend, but the barrier
that Rome has set up will continue to baffle their ingenuity; and when
thirteen centuries shall have passed since Hipparchus in vain urged the
advantages of the equinoctial system and Ctesibius strove to solve the
riddle of Roman time by some practical mechanism, we shall still find
Bernardo Monachus recording how the monks of Cluny perplexed their
pious souls with the old, old question, and how the good sacristan must
needs to go out into the night to learn—from the stars—if it were time
to call the brethren to prayer.

BOTANICAL BIOLOGY.*

By W. T.. THISELTON-DYER, F. R. S.

It is not so very long ago, that at English universities, at least, the
pursuit of botany was regarded rather as an elegant accomplishment
than as a serious occupation. This is the more remarkable, because at
every critical point in the history of botanical science, the names of our
countrymen will be found to occupy an honorable place in the field
of progress and discovery. In the seventeenth century, Hooke and
Grew laid the foundation of the cell-theory, while Millington, by dis-
covering the function of stamens, completed the theory of the flower.
In the following century, Morison first raised ferns from spores, Lind-
say detected the fern prothallus, Ray laid the foundations of a natural
classification, Hales discovered root-pressure, and Priestley the absorp-
tion of carbon dioxide and the evolution of oxygen by plants. In the
early part of the present one, we have Knight’s discovery of the true
cause of geotropism, Daubeny’s of the effect upon the processes of plant-
life of rays of light of different refrangibility, and finally, the first de-
scription of the cell-nucleus by R. Brown. i need not attempt to carry
the list through the last half century. I have singled out these discov-
eries as striking landmarks, the starting-points of important develop-
ments of the subject. It is enough for my purpose to show that we
have always had an important school of botany in England, which has
contributed at least its share to the general development of the science.

I think at the moment however, we have little cause for anxiety.
The academic chairs throughout the three kingdoms are filled for the
most part with young, enthusiastic, and well-trained men. Botany is
everywhere conceded its due position as the twin branch with zoology—
of biological science. We owe to the enlightened administration of
the Oxford University Press the possession of a journal which allows
of the prompt and adequate publication of tbe results of laboratory
research. The excellent work which is being done in every part of the
botanical field has received the warm sympathy of our colleagues abroad.
I need only recall to your recollection, as a striking evidence of this,

‘the remarkable gathering of foreign botanists which will ever make the
meeting of this association at Manchester a memorable event to all of
us. The reflection rises sadly to the mind that it can never be repeated.
Not many months, as you know, had passed before the two most prom-
inent figures in that happy assemblage had been removed from us by
the inexorable hand of death.

In Asa Gray we miss a figure which we could never admit belonged
wholly to the other side of the Atlantic. In technical botany we recog-
nized him as altogether in harmony with the methods of work and
standard of excellence of our own most distinguished taxonomists. But
apart from this, he had the power of grasping large and far-reaching
ideas, which I do not doubt would have brought him distinction in
any branch of science. We owe to him the classical discussion of the
facts of plant distribution in the northern hemisphere, which is one of
the corner-stones of modern geographical botany. He was one of the
earliest of distinguished naturalists who gave his adhesion to the theory
of Mr. Darwin. A man of simple and sincere piety, the doctrine of de-
scent never presented any difficulty to him. He will remain in our
memories as a figure endowed with a sweetness and elevation of char-
acter which may be compared even with that of Mr. Darwin himself.

In De Bary we seem to have suffered no less a personal loss than in
the case of Gray. Though, before last year, I do not know that he had
ever been in England, so many of our botanists had worked under him
that his influence was widely felt amongst us. And it may be said that
this was almost equally so in every part of the civilized world. His po-
sition as a teacher was in this respect probably unique, and the tradi-
tions of his methods of work must permanently affect the progress of
botany, and indeed have an even wider effect. This is not the occasion
to dwell on each of his scientific achievements. It is sufficient to say
that we owe to him the foundations of a rational vegetable pathology.
He first grasped the true conditions of parasitism in plants, and not
content with working out the complex phases of the life-history of the
invading organism, he never lost sight of the conditions which permit-
ted or inhibited its invasion. He treated the problem, whether on the
side of the host or of the parisite, as a whole—as a biological problem
in fact, in the widest sense. It is this thorough grasp of the conditions
of the problem that gives such a peculiar value to his last published
book, the ‘‘ Lectures on Bacteria,” an admirable translation of which we
owe to Professor Balfour. To this I shall have again to refer. I must
content myself with saying now, that in this and all his work there is that
note of highest excellence which consists in lifting detail to the level of
the widest generality. To a weak man this is a pitfall, in which a firm
grasp of fact is lost in rash speculation. But when, as in De Bary’s
case, a true scientifie insight is inspired by something akin to genius,
the most fruitful conceptions are the result. Yet De Bary never sacri-
ficed exactness to brilliancy, and to the inflexible love of truth which
BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. 401

pervaded both his work and his personal intercourse we may trace the
secret of the extraordinary influence which he exerted over his pupils.
As the head of one of the great national establishments of the country
devoted to the cultivation of systematic botany, I need hardly apologize
for devoting a few words to the present position of that branch of the
science. Ofits fundamental importance I have myself no manner of
doubt. But as my judgment may seem in such a matter not wholly free
from bias, I may fortify myself with an opinion which ean hardly be
minimized in that way. The distinguished chemist Prof. Lothar Meyer,
perhaps the most brilliant worker in the field of theoretical chemistry,
finds himself, like the systematic botanist, obliged to defend the posi-
tion of descriptive science. And he draws his strongest argument from
biology. ‘The physiology of plants and animals,” he tells us, *‘requires
systematic botany and zoology, together with the anatomy of the two
kingdoms; each speculative science requires a rich and well-ordered
material, if it is not to lose itself in empty and fruitless fantasies.” No
one of course supposes that the accumulation of plant specimens in
herbaria is the mere outcome of a passion for accumulating. But to do
good systematic work requires high qualities of exactitude, patience,
and judgment. As I attempted to show on another occasion, the world
is hardly sensible of the influence which the study of the subject has
had on its affairs. The school of Jeremy Bentham has left an indelible
mark on the social and legislative progress of our own time. Mills
tells us that “the proper arrangement of a code of laws depends on
the same scientific conditions as the classifications in natural history ;
nor could there,” he adds, ‘ be a better preparatory discipline for that
important function than the principles of a natural arrangement, not
only in the abstract, but in their actual application to the class of phe-
nomena for which they were first elaborated, and which are still the
best school for learning their use.” He further tells us that of this,
Jeremy Bentham was perfectly aware, and that his “ Fragment on Gov-
ernment” contains clear and just views on the meaning of a natural ar-
rangement which reflect directly the influence of Linnweus and Jussieu.
Mill himself possessed a competent knowledge of systematic botany,
and therefore was well able to judge of its intellectuai value. For my

course what I say of botany.is no less true of other branches of natural
history. Mr. Darwin devoted eight or nine years to the systematic
study of the Cirripedia. ‘‘ No one,” he himself tells us, ‘has a right to
examine the question of species who has not minutely described many.”
And Mr. Huxley has pointed out, in the admirable memoir of Mr. Dar-
win which he has prepared for the Royal Society, that “the acquire-
ment of an intimate and practical knowledge of the process of species-

making” - - - was “of no less importance to the author of the
‘Origin of Species’ than was the bearing of the Cirripede work upon
the principles of a natural classification.”

At present the outlook for systematic botany is somewhat discourag-
ing. France, Germany, and Austria, no longer possess anything likea
school on the subject, though they still supply able and distinguished
workers. That these are however few, may be judged from the fact
that it is difficult to fill the place of the lamented Kichler in the diree-
tion of the botanic garden and herbarium at Berlin. Outside our cwn
country, Switzerland is the most important seat of general systematic
study, to which three generations of De Candolles have devoted them-
selves. The most active centers of work at the moment are, however,
to be found in our own country, in the United States, and in Russia.
And the reason is in each case no doubt the same. The enormous area
of the earth’s surface over which each country holds sway brings to
them a vast amount of material which peremptorily demands discus-
sion.

No country however affords such admirable facilities for work in
sytematic botany as are now to be found in London. The Linnean So-
ciety possesses the herbarium of Linneeus; the Botanical Department
of the British Museum is rich in the collections of the older botanists ;
while at Kew we have a constantly-increasing assemblage of material,
either the results of travel and expeditions, or the contributions of cor-
respondents in different parts of the Empire. A very large proportion
of this has been worked up. But I am painfully impressed with the
fact that the total of our available workers bears but a small proportion
to the labor ready to their hands.

This is the more a matter of concern, because for the few official posts
which are open to botanists at home or abroad, a practical knowledge of
systematic botany is really indispensable. For suitable candidates for
these, one naturally looks to the universities. And so far, I am sorry
to say, in great measure one looks in vain. It would be no doubt a
great impulse to what is undoubtedly an important branch of national
scientific work if fellowships could occasionally be given to men who
showed some aptitude for it. But these should not be mere prizes for
under-graduate study, but should exact some guaranty that during the
tenure of the fellowship the holder would seriously devote himself to
some definite piece of work. At present, undoubtedly, the younger
generation of botanists show a disposition to turn aside to those fields
in which more brilliant and more immediate results can be attained.
Their neglect of systematic botany brings to some extent its own Ne-
mesis. A first principle of systematic botany is that a name should de-
note a definite and ascertainable species of plant. Butin physiological
literature you will find that the importance of this is often overlooked.
Names are employed which are either not to be found in the books, or
they are altogether mis-applied. But if proper precautions are taken te

ascertain the accurate botanical name of a plant, no botanist throughout
the civilized world is at a loss to identify it.

But precision in nomenclature is only the necessary apparatus of the
subject. The data of systematic botany, when properly discussed, lend
themselves to very important generalizations. Perhaps those which
are yielded by the study of geographical distribution are of the most
general interest. The mantle of vegetation which covers the surface of
the earth, if only we could rightly unravel its texture, would tell us a
good deal about geological history. The study of geographical distri-
bution, properly handled, affords an independent line of attack upon the
problem of the past distribution of land and sea. It would probably
never afford sufficient data for a complete independent solution of the
problem; but it must always be extremely useful as a check upon other
methods. Here however we are embarrassed by the enormous amount
of work which has yet to be accomplished. And unforturately this is
not of a kind which can be indefinitely postponed. The old terrestrial
order is fast passing away before our eyes. Everywhere the primitive
vegetation is disappearing as more and more of the earth’s surface is
brought into cultivation, or at any rate denuded of its forests.

A good deal, however, has been done. We owe to the indomitable
industry of Mr. Bentham and of Sir Ferdinand Mueller a comprehen-
sive flora of Australia, the first Jarge area of the earth’s surface of which
the vegetation has been completely worked out. Sir Joseph Hooker, in
his retirement, has pushed on within sight of completion the enormous
work of describing so much of the vast Indo-Malayan flora as is com-
prised within the British possessions. To the Dutch botanists we owe
a tolerably complete account of the Malayan flora proper. But New
Guinea still remains botanically a terra incognita, and till within the
last year or two the flora of China has been an absolute blank to us.
A committee of the British Association) has, with the aid of a small
grant of money, taken in hand the task of gathering up the scanty
data which are available in herbaria and elsewhere. This has stim-
ulated European residents in China to collect more material, and the
fine collections which are now being rapidly poured in upon us, will—if
they do not overwhelm us by their very magnitude—go a long way in
supplying data for a tentative discussion of the relations of the Chinese
flora to that of the rest of Asia. I do not doubt that this will in turn
explain a good deal that is anomalous in the distribution of plants in
India. The work of the committee has been practically limited to central
and eastern China. From the west, in Yunnan, the French botanists
have received even more surprising collections, and these supplement
our own work in the most fortunate manner. I have only to add, for
Asia, Boissier’s ‘‘ Flora Orientalis,” which practically includes the Med-
iterranean basin. But I must not omit the invaluable report of Brigade-
Surgeon Aitchison on the collections made by him during the Afghan
delimitation expedition, This has given an important insight into the
404 BOTANICAL BIOLOGY.

vegetation of a region which had never previously been adequately ex-
amined. Nor must! forget the recent publication of the masterly report
by Prof. Bayley Balfour on the plants collected by himself and Schwein-
furth in Socotra, an island with which the ancient Egyptians traded,
but the singularly anomalous flora of which was almost wholly unknown
up to our time.

The flora of Africa has been at present but imperfectly worked up,
but the materials have been so far discussed as to afford a tolerably
correct theory of its relations. The harvest from Mr. Johnston’s ex-
pedition to Kilimanjaro was not as rich as might have been hoped.
Still, it was sufficient to confirm the conclusions at which Sir Joseph
Hooker had arrived, on very slender data, as to the relations of the high-
level vegetation of Africa generally. The flora of Madagascar is per-
haps, at the moment, the most interesting preblem which Africa pre-
sents to the botanist. As the rich collections, for which we are indebted
to Mr. Baron and others, are gradually worked out, it can hardly be
doubted that it will be necessary to modify in some respects the views
which are generally received as to the relation of the island to the African
continent. My colleague, Mr. Baker, communicated to the York meet-
ing of the association the results which, up to that time, he had arrived
at, and these, subsequent material has not led him to modify. The flora
as a whole presents a large proportion of endemic genera and species,
pointing to isolation from a very ancient date. The tropical element is
however closely allied to that of tropical Africa and of the Mascarene
Islands, and there is a small infusion of Asiatic types which do not
extend to Africa. The high-level flora, on the other hand, exhibits an
even closer affinity with that temperate flora, the ruins of which are
scattered over the mountainous regions of Central Africa, and which
survives in its greatest concentration at the Cape.

The American botanists at Harvard are still systematically carrying
on the work of Torrey and Gray in the elaboration of the flora of North-
ern America. The Russians are, on their part, continually adding to
our knowledge of the flora of Northern and Central Asia. The whole
flora of the north temperate zone can only be regarded substantially as
one. The identity diminishes southwards, and increases in the case of
the Arctic and Alpine regions. A collection of plants brought us from
high levels in Corea, by Mr. James, might (as regards a large propor-
tion of the species) have been gathered on one of our own Scotch hills.

We owe to the munificence of two Englishmen of science the organ-
ization of an extensive examination of the flora and fauna of Central
America and the publication of the results. The work when completed
can hardly be less expensive than that of the results of the Challenger
voyage, which has severely taxed the liberality of the English Govern-
ment. The problems: which geographical distribution in this region
presents will doubtless be found to be of a singularly complicated
nature, and it is impossible to overestimate the debt of gratitude which

—— ae
BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. 405

biologists of all countries must owe to Messrs. Godman and Salvin when
their arduous undertaking is completed. Iam happy to say that the
botanical portion, which has been elaborated at Kew, is all but finished.

In South America, I must content myself with referring to the great
“Flora Brasiliensis,” commenced by Martius half a century ago, and
still slowly progressing under the editorship of Professor Urban, at

3erlin. Little discussion has yet been attempted of the mass of material

which is enshrined in the mighty array of volumes already published.
But the travels of Mr. Ball in South America have led him to the
detection of some very interesting problems. The enormous pluvial
denudation of the ancient portions of the continent has led to the
gradual blending of the flora of different levels with sufficient slowness
to permit of adaptive changes in the process. The tropical flora of
Brazil therefore presents an admixture of modified temperate types
which gives to the whole a peculiar character not met with to the same
degree in the tropics of the Old World. On the other hand, the com-
paratively recent eievation of the southern portion of the continent
accounts in Mr. Ball’s eyes for the singular poverty of its flora, which
we may regard indeed as still in progress of development.

The botany of the Challenger expedition, which was also elaborated
at Kew, brought for the first time into one view all the available facts
as to the floras of the older oceanic islands. To this was added a dis-
cussion of the origin of the more recent floras of the islands of the
Western Pacific, based upon material carefully collected by Professor
Moseley, and supplemented by the notes and specimens accumulated
with much judgment by Dr. Guppy. For the first time we were enabled
to get some idea how a tropical island was furnished with plants, and
to discriminate the littoral element due to the action of oceanic currents
from the interior forest almost wholly due to frugivorous birds. The
recent examination of Christmas Island by the English Admiralty has
shown the process of island flora-making in another stage. The plants
collected by Mr. Lister prove, as might be expected, to be closely allied
to those of Java. But the effect of isolation has begun to tell; and I
learn from my colleague, Professor Oliver, that the plants from Christ-
mas Island can not be for the most part exactly matched with their
congeners from Java, but yet do not differ sufficiently to be specifically
distinguished. We have here therefore it appears to me, a manifest
case of nascent species.

The central problem of systematic botany I have not as yet touched
upon: this is to perfect a natural classification. Such a classification,
to be perfect, must be the ultimate generalization of every scrap of
knowledge which we can bring to bear upon the study of plant affinity.
In the higher plants, experience ‘has shown that we can obtain results
which are sufficiently accurate for the present, without carrying our
structural analysis very far. Yet even here, the correct relations of the
Gymnosperms would never have been ascertained without patient and
406 BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. |

minute microscopic study of the reproductive processes. Upon these,
indeed, the correct classification of the Vascular Cryptogams wholly
depends, and generally, as we descend in the scale, external morphology
becomes more and more insecure as a guide, and a thorough knowledge
of the minute structure and life history of each organism becomes in-
dispensable to anything like a correct determination of its taxonomic
position. The marvellous theory of the true nature of lichens would
never have been ascertained by the ordinary methods of examination
which were held to be sufficient by lichenologists.

The finai form of every natural classification—for I have no doubt
that the general principles I have laid down are equally true in the
field of zoology—must be to approximate to the order of descent. For
the theory of descent became an irresistible induction as soon as the
idea of a natural classification had been firmly grasped.

In regard to flowering plants we owe, as I have said, the first step in
a natural classification to our own great naturalist, John Ray, who
divided them into Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons. The celebrated
classification of Linnzeus was avowedly purely artificial. It was a tem-
porary expedient, the provisional character of which no one realized
more thoroughly than himself. He in fact himself gave us one of the
earliest outlines of a truly natural system. Such a system is based on
affinity, and we know of no other explanation of affinity than that
which is implied in the word,—namely, common parentage. No one
finds any difficulty in admitting that where a number of individual
organisms closely resemble one another, they must have been derived
from the same stock. I allow that in cases where external form is
widely different, the conclusion to one who is not a naturalist is by no
means so obvious. But in such cases it rests on the profound and con-
stant resemblance of internal points of structure. Anyone who studies
the matter with a perfectly open mind finds it impossible to draw a
line. If genetic relationship or heredity is admitted to be the explana-
tion of affinity in the most obvious case, the stages are imperceptible
when the evidence is fairly examined, by which the same conclusion is
seen to be inevitable, even in cases where at the first glance it seems
least likely. ;

This leads me to touch on the great theory which we owe to Mr. Dar-
win. That theory, I need hardly say, was not merely a theory of
descent. This had suggested itself to naturalists in the way I have
indicated,—long before. What Mr. Darwin did was to show how by
perfectly natural causes the separation of living organisms into races |
which at once resemble and yet differ from one another so profoundly,
came about. Heredity explains the resemblance; Mr. Darwin’s great
discovery was that variation worked upon by natural selection ex-
plained the difference. That explanation seems to me to gather strength
every day, and to continually reveal itself as a more and more efficient
solvent of the problems which present themselves to the student of
BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. 407

natural history. At the same time, Iam far from claiming for it the
authority of a scientific creed or even the degree of certainty which is
possessed by some of the laws of astronomy. I only affirm that as a
theory it has proved itself a potent and invaluable instrument of re-
search. It is an immensely valuable induction; but it has not yet
reached such a position of certitude as has been attained by the law of
gravitation; and I have myself, in the field of botany, felt bound to
protest against conclusions being drawn deductively from it without
being subjected to the test of experimental verification. This attitude
of mine, which I believe I share with most naturalists, must not how-
ever be mistaken for one of doubt. Of doubt as to the validity of Mr.
Darwin’s views I have none: [ shali continue to have none till I come
across faets which suggest doubt. But that is a different position from
one of absolute certitude.

It is therefore without any dissatisfaction that I observe that many
competent persons have—while accepting Mr. Darwin’s theory—set
themselves to criticize various parts of it. But I must confess that I
am disposed to share the opinion expressed by Mr. Huxley, that these
criticisms really rest on a want of a thorough comprehension.

Mr. Romanes has put forward a view which deserves the attention
due to the speculations of a man of singular subtlety and dialectic skill.
He has startled us with the paradox that Mr. Darwin did not after all,
put forth—as I conceive it was his own impression he did—a theory
of the origin of species, but only of adaptations. And inasmuch as Mr.
Romanes is of opinion that specific differences are not even generally
adaptive, while those of genera are, it follows that Mr. Darwin only
really accounted for the origin of the latter, while for an explanation of
the former we must look to Mr. Romanes himself. For my part how-
ever, | am altogether unable to accept the premises, and therefore fail
to reach the conelusion. Specific differences, as we find them in plants,
are for the most part indubitably adaptive, while the distinctive charae-
ters of genera and of higher groups are rarely so. Let anyone take the
numerous species of some well characterized English genus—for exam-
ple, Ranunculus ; he will find that one species is distinguished by having
creeping stems, one by a tuberous root, one by floating leaves, another
by drawn-out submerged ones, aud so on. But each possesses those
common characters which enable the botanist almost at a glance, not-
withstanding the adaptive disguise, to refer them to the common genus
Ranunculus. It seems to me quite easy to see, in fact, why specific
characters should be usually adaptive, and generic not so. Species of
any large genus must, from the nature of things, find themselves ex-
posed to any but uniform conditions. They must acquire therefore as
the very condition of their existence, those adaptive characters which
the necessities of their life demand. But this rarely affects those marks
of affinity which still indicate their original common origin. Probably
these were themselves once adaptive, but they have long been overlaid
408 BOTANICAL BIOLOGY.

by newer and more urgent modifications. Still, Nature is ever con-
servative, and these reminiscences of a bygone history persist; signifi-
cant to the systematic botanist as telling an unmistakable family story,
but far removed from the stress of a struggle in which they no longer
are called upon to bear their part.

Another episode in the Darwinian theory is however likely to occupy
our attention for some time to come. The biological world now looks
to Professor Weismann as occupying the most prominent position in
the field of speculation. His theory of the continuity of the germ-plasm
has been put before English readers with extreme lucidity by Professor
Moseley. That theory, I am free to confess, I do not find it easy to
grasp clearly in all its concrete details. At any rate, my own studies
do not furnish me with sufficient data for criticizing them in any ad-
equate way. It is however bound up with another theory—then non-
inheritance of acquired characters—whicb is more open to general
discussion. If with Weismann we accept this principle, it can not be
doubted that the burden thrown on natural selection is enormously in-
creased. But I do not see that the theory of natural selection itself is
in any way impaired in consequence.

The question however is: Are we to accept the principle? It appears
to me that it is entirely a matter of evidence. It is proverbially diffi-
cult to prove a negative. In the analogous case of the inheritance of
accidental mutilations, Mr. Darwin contents himself with observing
that we should be ‘‘cautious in denying it.” Still, I believe, that though
a great deal of pains has been devoted to the matter, there is no case in
which it has been satisfactorily proved that a character acquired by an
organism has been transmitted to its descendants; and there is of
course an enormous bulk of evidence the other way.

The consideration of this point has given rise to what has been called
the new Lamarckism. Now Lamarck accounted for the evolution of
organic nature by two principles,—the tendency to progressive advance-
ment and the force of external circumstances. The first of these prin-
ciples appears to me, like Néiigeli’s internal modifying force, te be simply
substituting a name for a thing. Lamarck, like many other people
before him, thought that the higher organisms were derived from others
lower in the seale, and he explained this by saying that they had a
tendency to be so derived. This appears to me much as if we explained
the movement of a train from London to Bath by attributing it to a
tendency to, locomotion. Mr. Darwin lifted the whole matter out of the
field of mere transcendental speculation by the theory of natural
selection, a perfectly intelligible mechanism by which the result might
be brought about. Science will always prefer a material modus operandi
to anything so vague as the action of a tendency.

Lamarek’s second principle deserves much more serious consideration.
To be perfectly fair, we must strip it of the crude illustrations with which
he hampered it. To suggest that a bird became web-footed by per-

NN —— — _--. .

Ee
BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. 409

sistently stretching the skin between its toes, or that the neck of a
giraffe was elongated in the perpetual attempt to reach the foliage of
trees, seems almost repugnant to common sense. But the idea that
changes in climate and food—i. e. in the conditions of nutrition gen-
erally—may have some slow but direct influence on the organism seems,
on a superficial view, so plausible, that the mind is very prone to accept
it. Mr. Darwin has himself frankly admitted that he thought he had
not attached sufficient weight to the direct action of the environment.
Yet it is extremely difficult to obtain satisfactory evidence of effects
produced in this way. Hoffmann experimented with much pains on
plants, and the results were negative. And Mr. Darwin confessed that
Hoffmann’s paper had “ staggered” him.

Organic evolution still seems to me therefore to be explained in the
simplest way as the result of variation controlled by natural selection.
Now, both these factors are perfectly intelligible things. Variation is
a mere matter of every-day observation, and the struggle for existence,
which is the cause of which natural selection is the effect, is equally so.
If we state in a parallel form the Lamarckian theory, it amounts to a
tendency controlled by external forces. It appears to me that there is
no satisfactory basis of fact for either factor. The practical superiority
of the Darwinian over the Lamarckian theory is (as a working hypothe-
sis) immeasurable.

The new Lamarckian school, if I understand their views correctly,
seek to re-introduce Lamarck’s “ tendency.” The fact has been admitted
by Mr. Darwin himself that variation is not illimitable. No one, in
fact, has ever contended that any type can be reached from any point.
For example, as Weismann puts it, ‘‘ Under the most favorable cireum-
stances, a bird can never become transformed into a mammal.” It is
deduneed from this that variation takes place in a fixed direction only,
and this is assumed to be due to an innate law of development, or as
Weismann has termed it, a “ phyletic vital force.” But the introduction
of any such directive agency is superfluous, because the limitation of
variability is a necessary consequence of the physical constitution of
the varying organism.

It is supposed however by many people that a necessary part of
Mr. Darwin’s theory is the explanation of the phenomenon of variation
itself. But really this is not more reasonable than to demand that it
should explain gravitation or the source of solar energy. The investi-
gation of any one of these phenomena is a matter of first-rate importance.
But the cause of variation is perfectly independent of the results that
flow from it when subordinated to natural selection.

Though it is difficult to establish the fact that external causes pro-
mote variation directly, it is worth considering whether they may not
do so indirectly. Weismann, like Lamarck before him, has pointed out,
as others have also done, the remarkable persistence of tne plants and
animals of Egypt; and the evidence of this is now even stronger. We,
410 BOTANICAL BIOLOGY.

at Kew, owe to the kindness of Dr. Schweinfurth, a collection of speci-
mens of plants from Egyptian tombs, which are said to be as much as
four thousand years old. ‘They are still perfectly identifiable, and as
one of my predecessors in this chair has pointed out, they differ in no
respect from their living representatives in Egypt atthis day. The ex-
planation which Lamarck gave of this fact ‘may well,” says Sir
Charles Lyell, ‘‘ lay claim to our admiration.” He attributed it, in effect,
to the persistence of the physical geography, temperature, and other
natural conditions. Theexplanationseems to me adequate. The plants
and animals, we may fairly assume, were four thousand years ago, as
accurately adjusted to the conditions in which they then existed, as the
fact of their persistence in the country shows that they must be now.
Any deviation from the type that existed then would either therefore
be disadvantageous or indifferent. In the former case it would be
speedily eliminated, in the Jatter it would be swamped by cross-breed-
ing. But we know that if seeds of these plants were introduced into
our gardens we should soon detect varieties amongst their progeny.
Long observation upon plants under cultivation has always disposed
me to-think that a change of external conditions actually stimulated
variation, and’so gave natural selection wider play and a better chance
of re-establishing the adaptation of the organism to them. Weismann
explains the remarkable fact that organisms may for thousands of years
reproduce themselves unchanged by the principle of the persistence of
the germ-plasm. Yet it seems hard to believe that the germ-.plasm,
while enshrined in the individual whose race it is to perpetuate, and
nourished at its expense, can be wholly indifferent to all its fortunes.
It may be so, but in that case it would be very unlike other living ele-
ments of organized beings.

I am bound however to confess that I am not wholly satisfied with
the data for the discussion of this question which practical horticulture
supplies. That the contents of our gardens do exhibit the results of vari-
ation in a most astonishing degree no one will dispute. But for scien-
tific purposes, any exact account of the treatment under which these
variations have occurred is unfortunately usually wanting. A great deal
of the most striking variation is undoubtedly due to wide crossing, and
these cases must of course be eliminated when the object is to test
the independent variation of the germ-plasm. Hoffmann, whose ex-
periments I have already referred to, doubts whether plants do as a
matter of fact vary more under cultivation than in their native home
and under natural conditious. It would be very interesting if this could
be tested by the concerted efforts of two cultivators, say, for example,
in Egypt and in England. Let some annual plant be selected, native
of the former country, and let its seed be transmitted to the latter.
Then let each cultivator select any variations that arise in regard to
some given character; set to work, in fact, exactly as any gardener
would who wanted to “improve” the plant, but on a preconcerted plan.

——————— se lle Lh,

A comparison of the suecess which each obtained would be a measure
of the effect of the change of the environment on variability. If it
proved that as Hoffmann supposed, the change of conditions did not
affect the what we may call the rate of variation, then, as Mr. Darwin
remarks in writing to Professor Semper, ‘“ the astonishing variations of
almost all cultivated plants must be due to selection and breeding from
the varying individuals. This idea,” he continues, *“‘ crossed my mind
many years ago, but I was afraid to publish it, as I thought that people
would say, ‘How he does exaggerate the importance of selection.”
From an independent consideration of the subject I also find my mind
somewhat shaken about it. YetI feel disposed to say with Mr. Darwin,
“T still must believe that changed conditions give the impulse to varia-
bility, but that they act in most cases in a very different manner.”

Whatever conclusions we arrive at on these points, every one will
agree that one result of the Darwinian theory has been to give a great
impulse to the study of organisms, if I may say so, as “ going concerns.”
Interesting as are the problems which the structure, the functions, the
affinity, or the geographical distribution of a plant may afford, the living
plant in itself is even more interesting still.

Every organ will bear interrogation to trace the meaning and origin
of its form and the part it plays in the plant’s economy. That there is
here an immense field for investigation there can be no doubt. Mr.
Darwin himself set us the example in a series of masterly investiga-
tious. But the field is well-nigh inexhaustible. The extraordinary va-
riety of form which plants exhibit has led to the notion that much of it
may have arisen from indifferent variation. No doubt, as Mr. Darwin
has pointed out, when one of a group of structures held together by
some morphological or physiological nevus varies, the rest will vary
correlatively. One variation then may, if advantageous, become adapt-
ive, while the rest will be indifferent. But it appears to me that sucha
principle should be applied with the greatest caution ; and from what I
have myself heard fall from Mr. Darwin, I am led to believe that in
thelater years of his life he was disposed to think that every detail of
plant structure had some adaptive significance, if only the clue could
be found to it. As regards the forms of flowers, an enormous body of
information has been collected, but the vegetative organs have not
yielded their secret to anything like the same extent. My own impres-
sion is that they will be found to be adaptive in innumerable ways which
at present are not even suspected. At Kew we have probably a larger
number of species assembled together than are to be found anywhere
on the earth’s surface. Here then is ample material for observation
and comparison.- But the adaptive significance will doubtless often be
found by no means to lie on the surface. Who, for example, could pos-
sibly have guessed by inspection the purpose of the glandular bodies
on the leaves of Acacia spherocephala and on the pulvinus of Cecropia
peltata which Belt in the one case and Fritz Miiller in the other have
41? BOTANICAL BIOLOGY.

shown to serve as food for ants? So far from this explanation being
far-fetched, Belt found that the former “ tree is actually unable to exist
without its guard,” which it could not secure without some attraction
in the shape of food. One fact which strongly impresses me with a be-
lief in the adaptive significance of vegetative characters is the fact
that in almost identical forms they are constantly adopted by plants of
widely different affinity. If such forms were without significance one
would expect them to be infinitely varied. If however they are really
adaptive, it is intelligible that different plants should independently
avail themselves of identical appliances and expedients.

Although this country is splendidly equipped with appliances for the
study of systematic botany, our universities and colleges fall far be-
hind a standard which would be considered even tolerable on the Con-
tinent, in the means of studying morphological and physiological botany,
or of making researches in these subjects. There is not at the moment
anywhere in London an adequate botanical laboratory, and though at
most of the universities, matters are not quite so bad, still I am not
aware of any one where it is possible to do more than give the rou-
tine instruction, or to allow the students, when they have passed
through this, to work for themselves. It is not easy to see why this
should be, because on the animal side the accommodation and appli-
ances for teaching comparative anatomy and physiology are always
adequate and often palatial. Still less explicable to me is the tend-
eney on the part of those who have charge of medical education to
eliminate botanical study from the medical curriculum, since histori-
cally the animal histologists owe everything to botanists. In the sev-
enteenth century, as I have already mentioned, Hooke first brought
the microscope to the investigation of organic structure, and the tissue
he examined was cork. Somewhat later, Grew, in his “Anatomy of
Plants,” gave the first germ of the cell-theory. During the eighteenth
century the anatomists were not merely on a hopelessly wrong tack
themselves, but they were bent on dragging botanists into it also. It
was not until 1837, a little more than fifty years ago, that Henle saw
that the structure of epithelium was practically the same as that of the
parenchyma plantarum which Grew had described one hundred and fifty
years before. Two years later Schwann published his immortal theory,
which comprised the ultimate facts of plants and animal anatomy
under one view. But it was to a botanist, Von Mohl, that in 1846, the
biological world owed the first clear description of protoplasm, and to
another botanist, Cohn (1851), the identification of this with the sar-
code of zoologists. 4

Now the historic order in discovery is not without its significance.
The path which the first investigators found most accessible is doubt-
less that which beginners will also find easiest to tread. I do not my-
self believe that any better access can be obtained to the structure
and functions of living tissues than by the study of plants. However,

I am not without hopes that the serious study of botany in the lab-
oratory will be in time better cared for. I do not hesitate to claim
for it a position of the greatest importance in ordinary scientific edu-
cation. All the essential phenomena of living organisms can be read-
ily demonstrated upon plants. The necessary appliances are not so
costly, and the work of the class room is free from many difficulties
with which the student of the animal side of biology has to contend.

Those however who have seriously devoted themselves to the pur.
suit of either morphological or physiological bctany need not now be
wholly at a loss. The splendid laboratory on Plymouth Sound, the
erection of which we owe to the energy and enthusiasm of Prof. Ray
Lankester, is open to botanists as well as to zoologists, and affords
every opportunity for the investigation of marine plants, in which little
of late years has been done in this country. At Kew we owe to private
munificence a commodious laboratory in which much excellent work
has already been done. And this association has made a small grant
in aid of the establishment of a laboratory in the Royal Botanie Garden
at Peradeniya, in Ceylon. it may be hoped that this will afford facil-
ities for work of the same kind as has yielded Dr. Treub such a rich
harvest of results in the Buitenzorg Botanic Garden in Java.

Physiological botany, as I have already pointed out, is a field in
which this country in the past has accomplished great things. It has
not of late however obtained an amount of attention in any way pro-
portionate to that devoted to animal physiology. In the interests of
physiological science generally, this is much to be deplored; and I
believe that no one was more firmly convinced of this than Mr. Dar-
win. Only ashort time before his death, in writing te Mr. Romanes on
a book that he had recently been reading, he said that the author had
made “ a gigantic oversight in never considering plants; these would
simplify the problem for him.” This goes to the root of the matter.
There is, in my judgment, no fundamental biological problem which is
not exhibited in a simpler form by plants than by animals. It is possi-
ble, however, that the distaste which seems to exist amongst our biolo-
gists for physiological botany, may be due in some measure to the ex-
tremely physical point of view from which it has been customary to
treat it on the Continent. It is owing in great measure to the method
of Mr. Darwin’s own admirable researches that in this country we
have been led to a more excellent way. The work which has been
lately done in England seems to me full of the highest promise. Mr,
Francis Darwin and Mr. Gardiner have each in different directions
shown the entirely new point of view which may be obtained by treat-
ing plant phenomena as the outcome of the functional activity of pro-
toplasm. I have not the least doubt that by pursuing this path En-
glish research will not merely place vegetable physiology, which has
hitherto been too much under the influence of Lamarckism, on a more
rational basis, but that it will also sensibly re-act, as it has done often
before, on animal physiology.
414 BOTANICAL BIOLOGY.

There is no part of the field of physiological botany which has yielded
results of more interest and importance than that which relates to the
action of ferments and fermentation; and I could hardly give you a
better illustration of the purely biological method of treating it. I
believe that these results, wonderful and fascinating as they are, afford
but a faint indication of the range of those that are still to be accom-
plished. The subject is one of extreme intricacy, and it is not easy to
speak about it briefly. To begin with, it embodies two distinct groups
of phenomena, wuich have in reality very little which is essential in
common.

What are usually called ferments are perhaps the most remarkable
of all chemical bodies, for they have the power of effecting very pro-
found changes in the chemical constitution of other substances, although
they may be present in very minute quantity ; but—and this is their
most singular and characteristic property—they themselves remain
unchanged in the process. It may be said without hesitation that the
whole nutrition of both animals and plants depends on the action of
ferments. Organisms are incapable of using solid nutrient matter for
the repair and extension of their tissues; this must first be brought
into soluble form before it can be made available, and this change is
generally brought about by the action of a ferment. Animal physi-
ology has long been familiar with the part played by ferments, and
it may be said that no small part of the animal economy is made up
of organs required either for the manufacture of ferments or for the
exposure of ingested food to their action. It may seem strange at
first sight to speak of analogous processes taking place in plants.
But it must be remembered that plant nutrition includes two very
distinct stages. Certain parts of plants build up, as everyone knows,
from external inorganic materials, substances which are available for
the construction of new tissues. It might be supposed that these are
used up as fast as they are formed. But it is not so; the life of the
plant is not a continuous balance of income and expenditure. On the
contrary, besides the general maintenance of its structure, the plant
has to provide from time to time for enormous resources to meet such
exhausting demands as the renewal of foliage, the production of flow-
ers, and the subsequent maturing of fruit.

In such cases the plant has to draw on accumulated store of solid
food which has rapidly to be converted into the soluble form in which
alone it is capable of passing through the tissues to the seat of con-
sumption. And I do not doubt for my part that in such cases ferments
are brought into play of the same kind and in the same way as in the
animal economy. Take such a simple case as a potato-tuber. This is a
mass of cellular tissue, the cells of which are loaded with starch. We
may either dig up the tuber and eat the starch ourselves, or we may
leave it in the ground, in which case it will be consumed in providing
material for the growth of a potato-plant for next year. But the pro-
BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. 415

cesses by which the insoluble starch is made available for nutrition are,
I can not doubt, closely similar in either case.

When we inquire further abont these mysterious and all-important
bodies, the answer we can give is extremely inadequate. It is very
difficult to obtain them in amount sufficient for analysis, or in a state
of purity. We know however that they are closely allied to albumi-
noids, and contain nitrogen in varying proportion. Papain, which is a
vegetable ferment derived from the fruit of the papaw, and capable of
digesting most animal albuminoids, is said to have the same ultimate
composition as the pancreatic ferment and as peptones, bodies closely
allied to proteids ; the properties of all three bodies are however very
different. It seems clear nevertheless that ferments must be closely
allied to proteids, and like these bodies, they are no doubt directly
derived from protoplasm.

I need not remind you that, unlike other constituents of plant tissues,
protoplasm, asa condition of its vitality, is in a constant state of molec-
ular activity. The maintenance of this activity involves the supply of
energy, and this is partly derived from the waste of its own substance.
This “‘self-decom position ” of the protoplasm liberates energy, and in
doing so gives rise to a number of more stable bodies than protoplasm.
Some of these are used up again in nutrition; others are thrown aside,
and are never drawn again into the inner cirele of vital processes. In
the animalorganism, where the strictest economy of bulk isa paramount
necessity, they are promptly got rid of by the process of excretion. In
the vegetable economy these residual products usually remain. And itis
for this reason, I may point out, that the study of the chemistry of plant
nutrition appears to me of such,immense importance. The record of
chemical change is so much more carefully preserved ; and the proba-
bility of our being able to trace the course it has followed is conse-
quently far more likely to be attended with success.

This preservation in the plant of the residual by-products of proto-
plasmic activity no doubt accounts for the circumstance which otherwise
is extremely perplexing,—the profusion of substances which we meet
with in the vegetable kingdom to which it is hard to attribute any use-
ful purpose. It seems probable that ferments, in a great many cases,
belong to the same category. I imagine that it is in some degree acci-
dental that some of them have been made use of, and thus the plant
has been able to temporarily lock up aceumulaitons of food to be
drawn upon in future phases of its life with the certainty that they
would be available. Without the ferments, the key of the storehouse
would be lost irretrievably.

Plants moreover are now known to possess ferments, and the num-
ber will doubtless increase, to which it is difficult to attribute any use-
ful function. Papain, to which I have already alluded, abounds in the
papaw, but it is not easy to assign to it any definite function ; still less
is it easy, on teleological grounds, to account for the rennet ferment

contained in the fruits of an Indian plant, Withania coagulans, and ad-
mirably investigated by Mr. Sheridan Lea.

Having dwelt so far on the action of ferments, we may now turn to
fermentation, and that other kind of change in organic matter called
‘s putrefaction,” which is known to be closely allied to fermentation.
Ferments and fermentation, as I have already remarked have very little
to do with one another; and it would saveconfusion and emphasize the
the fact if we ceased to speak of ferments but used some of the altern-
ative names which have been proposed for them, such as zymases or
enzymes.

The classical case of fermentation, which is the root of our whole
knowledge of the subject, is that of the conversion of sugar into alcohol.
Its discovery has every where accompanied the first stages of civilization
in the human race. Its details are now taught in our text books; and
I should hardly hope to be excused for referring to it in any detail if it
were not necessary for my purpose to draw your attention more partic-
ularly to one or two points connected with it.

Let us trace what happens in a fermenting liquid. It becomes turbid,
it froths and effervesces, the temperature sensibly increases ; this is the
first stage. After this it begins to clear, the turbidity subsides as a
sediment; the sugar which the fluid at first contained, has in great
part disappeared, and a new ingredient, alcohol, is found in its place.

It is just fifty years ago that the great Dutch biologist Schwann made
a series of investigations which incontroverctibly demonstrated that both
fermentation and putrefaction were due to the presence of minute or-
ganisms which live and propagate at the expense of the liquids in
which they produce as a result these extraordinary changes. The
labors of Pasteur have confirmed Schwanw’s results, and—what could
not have been foreseen—have extended the possibilities of this field of
investigation to those disturbances in the vital phenomena of living
organisms themselves which we include under the name of “ disease,”
and which, no one will dispute, are matters of the deepest concern to
every one of us.

Now, at first sight, the conversion of starch into sugar by means of
diastase seems strikingly analogous to the conversion of sugar into
alcohol. It is for this reason that the phenomena have been so long
associated. But it is easy to show that they are strikingly different.
Diastase is a chemical substance of obscure composition it is true, but
inert and destitute of any vital properties, nor is it affected by the
changes it induces. Yeast, on the other hand, which is the active agent
in alcoholic fermentation, is a definite organism; it enormously increases
during the process, and it appears to me impossible to resist the con-
clusion that fermentation is a necessary concomitant of the peculiar con-
ditions of its life. Let me give you a few facts which go to prove this.
In the first place, you can not ferment a perfectly pure solution of sugar.

The fermentable fluid must. contain. saline and nitrogenous matters,

— =. ee
BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. - 417

necessary for the nutrition of the yeast protoplasm. In pure sugar the
yeast starves. Next, Schwann found that known protoplasmie poisons,
by killing the yeast-cells, would prohibit fermentation. He found the
same result to hold good of putrefaction, and this is the basis of the
whole theory of antiseptics. Nor can the action of yeast be attributed
to any ferment which the yeast secretes. It is true that pure cane-
sugar can not be fermented, and that yeast effects the inversion of this,
as it is called, into glucose and lwevulose. It does this by a ferment
which can be extracted from it, and which is often present in plants.
But you can extract nothing from yeast which will do its pecular work
apart from itself. Helmholtz made the crucial experiment of suspend-
ing a bladder full of boiled grape-juice in a vat of fermenting must; it
underwent no change; andeven a film of blotting: paper has been found
a sufficient obstacle to its action. We are driven then necessarily to
the conclusion that in the action of * ferments” or zymases we have
to do with a chemical—7. e., a purely physical process ; while in the case
of yeast we encounter a purely physiological one.

How then is this action to be explained? Pasteur has laid stress on
a fact which had some time been known, that the production of aleohol
from sugar is a result of which yeast has pot the monopoly. If ripen-
ipg fruits—such as plums—are kept in an atinosphere free from oxygen,
Bérard found that they too exhibit this remarkable transformation;
their sugar is converted appreciably into alcohol. On the other hand,
Pasteur has shown that, if yeast is abundantly supplied with oxygen,
it feeds on the sugar of a fermentable fluid without producing alcohol.
But under the ordinary circumstance of fermentation, its access to
oxygen is practically cut off; the yeast then is in exactly the same
predicament as the fruit in Bérard’s experiment. Sugar is broken up
into carbon dioxide and alcohol in an amount far in excess of the needs
of mere nutrition. In this dissociation it can be shown that an amount
of energy is set free in the form of heat equal to about one-tenth of what
would ke produced by the total combustion of an equivalent of grape-
sugar. If the protoplasm of the yeast could, with the aid of atmos-
pheric oxygen, completely decompose a unit of grape sugar, it would
get ten times as much energy in the shape of heat as it could get by
breaking it up into alcohol and carbon dioxide. It follows then that
to do the same amount of growth in either case, it must break up ten
times as much sugar without a supply of oxygen as with it. And this
throws light on what has always been one of the most remarkable facts
about fermentation—the enormous amount of change which the yeast
manages to effect in proportion to its own development.

There are still two points about yeast which deserve attention before
we dismiss it. When a fermenting liquid comes to contain about 14 per
cent. of alcohol, the activity of the yeast ceases, quite independently of
whether the sugar is used up or not. In other cases of fermentation
the same inhibiting effect of the products of fermentation is met with.

Thus lactic fermentation soon comes to an end unless calcium carbon-
ate orsome similar substance be added, which removes the lactic acid
from the solution as fast as it is formed.

The other point is that in all fermentations, besides what may be
termed the primary products of the process, other bodies are produced.
In the case of alcoholic fermentation the primary bodies are aleohol and
carbon dioxide; the secondary, succinic acid and glycerine. Delpino
has suggested that these last are residual products derived from that
portion of the fermentable matter which is directly applied to the nutri-
tion of the protoplasm.

Yeast, itself the organism which effects the remarkable changes on
which I have dwelt, is somewhat of a problem. It is clear that itis a
fungus, the germs of which must be ubiquitous in the atmosphere. It
is difficult to believe that the simple facts, which are all we know about
it, constitute its entire life-history. It is probably a transitory stage of
some more complicated organism.

Tecan only briefly refer to putrefaction. This is a far more complex
process than that which I have traced in the ease of alcoholic fermenta-
tion. In that, nitrogen is absent, while it is an essential ingredient
in albuminoids, which are the substances that undergo putrefactive
changes. But the general principles are the same. Here, too, we owe to
Schwann the demonstration of the fact that the effective agents in the
process are living organisms. If we put into aflask a putrescible liquid
such as broth, boil if for some time, and during the process of boiling
plug the mouth with some cotton-wool, we know that the broth will re-
main long unchanged, while if we remove the wool putrescence soon be-
gins. Tyndallhas shown that, if we conduct the experiment on one of
the high glaciers of the Alps, the cotton-wool may be dispensed with.
We may infer then that the germs of the organisms which produce put-
refaction are abundant in the lower levels of the atmosphere and are
absent from the higher. They are wafted about by currents of air; but
they are not imponderable, and in still air they gradually subside. Dr.
Lodge has shown that air is rapidly cleared of suspended dust by an
electric discharge, and this no doubt affords a simple explanation of
the popular belief that thunderous weather is favorable to putrefac-
tive changes.

Cohn believes that putrefaction is due to an organism ealled Bacter-
zum termo, which plays in it the same part that yeast does in fermenta-
tion. Thisis probably too simple astatement; but the general phenomena
are nevertheless similar. There is thesame breaking down of complex
into simpler molecules; the same evolution of gas, especially carbon
dioxide; the same rise of temperature. Themore or less stable products
of the process are infinitely more varied, and it is difficult, if not im-
possible, to say, in the present state of our knowledge, whether in most
cases they are the direct outcome of the putrefactive process, or resid-
ual products of the protoplasmic activity of the organisms which in-

———
BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. 419

duce it. Perhaps, on the analogy of the higher plants, in which some
of them also occur, we may attribute to the latter category certain bodies
closeiy resembling vegetable alkaloids; these are called ptomaines, and
are extremely poisonous. Besides such bodies, Bacteria undoubtedly
generate true ferments and peculiar coloring-matters. But there are in
most cases of putrefaction a profusion of other substances, which repre-
sent the various stages of the breaking up of the complex proteid mole-
cule, and are often themselves the outcome of subsidiary fermenta-
tions.

These results are of great interest from a scientific point of view. But
their importance at the present moment in the study of certain kinds of
disease can hardly be exaggerated. Ihave already mentioned Henle
as having first found the true clue to animal histology in the structure
of plants. Asearly as 1840, the same observer indicated the grounds for
regarding contagious diseases as due to living organisms. I willstate
his argument in the words of De Bary, whose “ Lectures on Bacteria,”
the last work which we owe to his gifted hand, [ can confidently recom-
mend to you as a luminous but critical discussion of a vast mass of dif-
ficult and conflicting literature.

It was of course clear that contagion must be due to the communica-
tion of infectious particles or contagia. These contagia, although at the
time no one had seen them, Henle pointed out, ‘‘have the power, pos-
sessed, as faras we know, by living creatures only, of growing under
favorable conditions, and of multiplying at the expense of some other
substance than their own, and therefore of assimilating that substance.”
Henle enforced his view by comparison with the theory of fermentation,
which hadthen been promulgated by Sehwann. But for many years his
views found no favor. Botanists however as in so many other eases,
struck on the right path, and from about the year 1850 steady progress,
in which De Bary himself took a leading part, was made in showing that
most of the diseases of plants are due to parasitic infection. The reason
of this success was obvious; the structure of plants makes them more
accessible to research, and the invading parasites are larger than aui-
mal contagia. Onthe animal side all real progress dates from about 1860,
when Pasteur, having established Schwann’s theory of fermentation on
an impregnable basis, took up Henle’s theory of living contagia.

The only risk now is that we may get on too fast. To put the true
theory of any one contagious disease on as firm a basis as that of aleo-
holic fermentation is no easy matter to accomplish. But I believe that
this is (notwithstanding a flood of facile speculation and imperfect re-
search) slowly being done.

There are two tracts in the body which are obviously accessible to
such minute organisms as Bacteria, and favorable for their develop-
ment. These are the alimentary canal and the blood. In the ease of
the former there is evidence that every one of us possesses quite alittle
flora of varid forms and species. They seem for the most part, in
health, to be comparatively innocuous; indeed it is believed that they
420 BOTANICAL BIOLOGY. ~ Spe

,
are ancillary to and aid digestion. But it is easy to see that other kinds
may be introduced, or those already present may be called into abnor-
mal activity, and fermentative processes may be set up of a very incon-
venient kind. These may result in mere digestive disorder, or in the
production of some of those poisonous derivatives of proteids of which I
have spoken, the effect of which upon the organism may be most disas-
trous.

The access of Bacteria to the biood is a far more serious matter.
They produce phenomena the obvious analogy of which to fermentative
processes has led to the resulting diseases being called zymotic. Take
for example, the disease known as “ relapsing fever.” This is contagious.
After a period of incubation, violent fever sets in, which lasts for some-
thing less than a week, is then followed by a period of absence, to be
again followed in succession by one or more similar attacks, which ulti-
mately cease. Now you will observe that the analogy to a fermentative
process is very close. The period of incubation is the necessary Inter-
val between the introduction of the germ and its vegetative multiplica-
tion in sufficient numbers to appreciably affect the total volume of the
blood. The rise in temperature and the limited duration of the attack
are equally, as we have seen, characteristic of fermentative processes, ;
_while the bodily exhaustion which always follows fever is the obvious
result of the dissipation by the ferment organisms of nutritive matter
destined for the repair of tissue‘waste. During the presence of this
fever there is present in the blood an organism, Spirochete obermeiert,
so named after its discoverer. This disappears when the fever subsides.
It is found that if other individuals are inoculated with blood taken
from patients during the fever attack, the disease is communicated, but
that this is not the case if the inoculation is made during the period of
freedom. The evidence then seems clear that this disease 1s due to a
definite organism. The interesting point however arises, why does
the fever recur, and why eventually cease? The analogy of fermenta-
tion leads to the hypothesis that as in the vase of yeast the products of
its action inhibit after a time the further activity of the Spirochete. The
inhibiting substance is no doubt eventually removed partially from the
blood by its normal processes of depuration, and the surviving individ-
uals of Spirochete can then continue their activity, as in lactic fermenta-
tion. With regard to the final cessation of the disease, there are facts
which may lead one to suppose that in this as in other cases sufficient of
the inhibiting substance ultimately remains in the organism to protect
it against any further outbreak of activity on the part of the Spirochete.

Here we have an example of a disease which, though having a well-
marked zymotic character, is comparatively harmless. In anthrax,
which is known to be due to Bacillus anthracis, we have one which is,
on the contrary, extremely fatal. I need not enter into the details. It
is sufficient to say that there is reason to believe that the Bacillus pro-
duces, as one of those by-products of protoplasmic destruction to which
I have already alluded, a most virulent poison. But the remarkable _

*

ee a

ila tai ad

thing is that this Bacillus, which can be cultivated externally to the
body, if kept at a heightened temperature, can be attenuated in its viru-
lence. It drops in fact the excretion of the poison. It is then found
that, if injected into the blood, it does no mischief, and, what is more
extraordinary, if the Bacillus in its most lethal form is subsequently in-
troduced, it too has lost its power. The explanation of the immunity
in this case is entirely different from that which was suggested by a
consideration of the facts of relapsing fever. The researches of Met-
schnikoff have led to the hypothesis that in the present case the white
blood-corpuscles destroy the Bacillus. When they first come into con-
tact with these in their virulent form, they are wnable to touch them.
But if they have been educated by first having presented to them the
attenuated form, they find no difficulty in grappling with the malignant.
This isa very remarkable view. I should not have put it before you had
there not been solid reasons for regarding the idea of the education of
protoplasm with scientific respect. The plasmodia of the Myxomycetes,
which consist of naked protoplasm, are known to become habituated to
food which they at first reject, and the researches of Beyerinck on the
disease known as “ gumming” in plants have apparently shown that
healthy cells may be taught, as it were, to produce a ferment which
otherwise they would not exerete.

If Metschnikoff’s theory be true, we have a rational explanation of
vaccination and of preventive inoculation generally. It is probably
however not the only explanation. And the theory of the inhibitive
action upon itself of the products of the ferment-organisin’s own activity
is still being made the basis of experiment. In fact, the most recent
results point to the possibility of obtaining protection by injecting into
the blood substances artificially obtained entirely independent of the
organisms whose development they inhibit.

It is impossible for me to touch on these important matters at any
greater length, but I doubtif the theory of fermentation, as applied to
the diseases of organisms, has as yet more than opened its first page.
It seems to me possibile, that besides the rational explanation of zymotie
disease, it may throw light on others where owing to abnormal condi-
tions, the organisin, as in the case of Bérard’s plums, is itself the agent
in its own fermentative processes.

And now I must conclude. Ihave led you, I am afraid, a too lengthy
and varied a journey in the field of botanical study. Butto sum up my
argument: I believe I have shown you that at the bottom of every
great branch of biological inquiry it has never been possible to neglect
the study of plants; nay move, that the study of plant-life has gener-
ally given the key to the true course of investigation. Whether you
take the problems of geographical distribution, the most obscure points
in the theory of organic evolution, or the innermost secrets of vital
phenomena, whether in health or disease,—not to consider plants is still,
in the words of Mr. Darwin, “a gigantie oversight, for these would
simplify the problem.”
ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY.*

By Prof. J. 8S. BURDON SANDERSON.

The work of investigating the special functions of organs, which
during the last two decades has yielded such splendid results, is still
proceeding, and every year new ground is being broken and new and
fruitful lines of experimental inquiry are being opened up; but the fur-
ther the physiologist advances in this work of analysis and differentia-
tion, the more frequently does he find his attention arrested by deeper
questions relating to the essential endowments of living matter of which
even the most highly differentiated funetions of the animal or plant
organism are the outcome. In our science the order of progress has
been hitherto and will continue to be the reverse of the order of nature.
Nature begins with the elementary and ends with the complex (first the
amoeba, then the man). Our mode of investigation has to begin at
the end. And this not merely for the historical reason that the first
stimulus to physiological inquiry was man’s reasonable desire to know
himself, but because the differentiation actually involves simplification.

Physiology therefore first studies man and the higher animals, and
proceeds to the higher plants, then to invertebrates and cryptogams,
ending where development begins. -— -

It is not difficult to see whither this Method must eventually lead us.
For inasmuch as funetion is more complicated than structure, the
result of proceeding, as physiology normally does, from structure to
function, must inevitably be to bring us face to face with funetional
differences which have no structural difference to explaim them. Thus,
for example, if the physiologist undertakes to explain the function of
a highly differentiated organ like the eye, he finds that up to a certain
point, provided that he has the requisite knowledge of dioptrics, the
method of correlation guides him straight to his point. He can men-

tally or actually construct an eye which will perform the functions of
the real eye, in so far as the formation of a real image of the field of
vision on the retina is concerned, and will be able thereby to under
stand how the retinal picture is transferred to the organ of concious-

ness. Having arrived at this point he begins to correlate the known
structure of the retina with what is required of it, and finds that the
number of objects which he can discriminate in the fieid of vision is as
numerous as, but not more numerous than, the parts of the retina, é.e.,
the cones which are concerned in discriminating them. So far he has
no difficulty ; but the method of correlation fails him from the moment
that he considers that each Object point in the field of vision is colored,
and that he is able to discriminate not merely the number and relations
of all the object points to each other, but the color of each separately.
He then sees at once that each cone must possess a plurality of en-
dowments for which its structure affords no explanation. In other
words, in the minute structure of the human retina we have a mechan-
ism which would completely explain the picture of which I am con-
scious, were the objects composing it colorless, 7. €., possessed of one
objective quality only, but it leaves us without explanation of the dif-
ferentiation of color.

Similarly, if we are called upon to explain the function of a secreting
gland, such, é. g., aS the liver, there is no difficulty in understanding
that inasmuch as the whole gland consists of lobules which resemble
each other exactly, and each lobule is likewise made up of cells which
are all alike, each individual cell must be capable of performing all the
functions of the whole organ. But when by exact experiment we learn
that the liver possesses not one function but many,~when we know
that it is a storehouse for animal starch, and that each cell possesses
the power of separating waste coloring matter from the blood, and of
manufacturing several kinds of crystallizable products, some of which
it sends in one direction and others in the opposite, we find again that
the correlation method fails us, and that all that our knowledge of the
minute structure has done for us is to set before us a question which
though elementary, we are quite unable to answer.

By multiplying examples of the ‘same kind, we should in each case
come to the same issue, namely, plurality of function with unity of
structure, the unity being represented by a simple structural elenent—
be it retinal cone or cell—possessed of numerous endowments. When-
ever this point is arrived at in any investigation, structure must for the
moment cease to be our guide, and in general two courses or alterna-
tives are open to us. One is to fall back on that worn-out Deus ex ma-
china—protoplasm, asif it afforded a sufficient explanation of everything
which cannot be explained otherwise, and accordingly to defer the con-
sideration of the functions which have no demonstrable connection with
structure as for the present beyond the scope of investigation; the other
is, retaining our hold of the fundamental principle of correlation, to
take the problem in reverse, i. ¢., to use analysis of function as a guide
to the ultra-microscopical analysis of structure. |

I need scarcely say that of these two courses the first is wrong, the
second right, for in following it we still hold to the fundamental prin-

= ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 425

ciple that living material acts by virtue of its structure, provided that
we allow the term structure to be used in a sense which carries it be-
yond the limits of anatomical investigation, 7. e., beyond the knowledge
which can be attained either by the scalpel or the microscope. We
thus (as I have said) proceed from function to structure, instead of the
other way. - - -

At present the fundamental questions in physiology,—the problems
which most urgently demand solution, are those which relate to the
endowments of apparently structureless living matter, and the problem
of the future will be the analysis of these endowments. With this
view, what we bave to do is first, to select those cases in which the vital
process offers itself in its simplest form, and is consequently best under-
stood; and secondly, to inquire how far in these particular instances
we may, taking as our guide the principle I have so often mentioned as
fundamental, viz, the correlation of structure with function, of mech-
anism with action, proceed in drawing inferences as to the mechanism
by which these vital processes are in these simpiest cases actually car-
ried out.

The most distinctive peculiarity of living matter, as compared with
non-living, is that it is ever changing while ever the same, 7. ¢., that life
is a state of ceaseless change. For our present purpose I must ask
you, first, to distinguish between two kinds of change which are equally
characteristic of living organisms, namely, those of growth and decay
on the one hand, and those of nutrition on the other. Growth, the
diologist calls evolution. Growth means the unfolding, 2. e., develop-
ment of the latent potentialities of form and structure which exist in
the germ, and which it has derived by inheritance. A growing organ-
ism is not the same to-day as it was yesterday, and consequently not
quite the same now as it was a minute ago, and never again will be.
This kind of change I am going to ask you to exclude from considera-
tion altogether at this moment, (for in truth it does not belong to
Physiology, but rather to Merphology,) and to limit your attention to
the other kind which includes all other vital phenomena. 1 designated
it just now as nutrition, but this word expresses my meaning very in-
adequately. The term which has been used for half <. century to des-
ignate the sum or complex of the non-developmental activities of an
organism is “exchange of material,” for which Professor Foster bas
given the very acceptable substitute metabolism. Metabolism is only
another word for ‘‘change,” but in using it we understand it to mean
that although an organism in respect of its development may never be
what it has been, the phases of alternate activity and repose which
mark the flow of its life-stream are recurrent. Life is a cyclosis in
which the organism returns after every cycle to the same point of de-
parture, ever changing—yet ever the same.

It is this antithesis which constitutes the essential distinction between
the two great branches of biology, the two opposite aspects in which
426 ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

the world of life presents itself to the inquiring mind of man. Seen —
from the morphological side, the whole plant and animal kingdom con-
stitutes the unfolding of a structural plan which was once latent in a
form of living material of great apparent simplicity. From the phys-
iological side this apparently simple material is seen to be capable of
the discharge of functions of great complexity, and therefore must
possess corresponding complexity of mechanism. It is the nature of
this invisible mechanism that physiology thirsts to know. Although
little progress has as yet been made, and little may as yet be possible,
in satisfying this desire, yet, as I shall endeavor to show you, the exist-
ing knowledge of the subject has so far taken consistent form in the
minds of the leaders of physiological thought, that it is now possible to
distinguish the direction in which the soberest speculation is tending.

The non-developmental vital functions of protoplasm are the absorp-
tion of oxygen, the discharge of carbon dioxide and water and am-
monia, the doing of mechanical work, the production of heat, light, and
electricity. All these, excepting the last, are known to have chemical
actions as their inseparable concomitants. As regards electricity, we
have no proof of the dependence of the electrical properties of plants
and animals on chemical action. But all the other activities which
have been mentioned are fundamentally chemical.

Let us first consider the relation of oxygen to living matter and vital
process. For three quarters of a century after the fundamental discov-
eries of Lavoisier and Priestley (1772-76) the accepted doctrine was
that the effete matter of the body was brought to the lungs by the cir-
culation and burnt there, of which facet the carbon dioxide expired _
seemed an obvious proof. Then came the discovery that arterial blood
contained more oxygen than venous blood, and consequently that oxy-
gen must be conveyed as such, by the blood stream to do its purifying
work in all parts of the body.

3etween 1872 and 1876, as the result of an elaborate series of investi-
gations of the respiratory process, the proof was given by Pfitiger*
that the function of oxygen in the living organism is not to destroy
effete matter either here or there, but rather to serve as a food for pro-
toplasm, which so long as it lives is capable of charging itself with this
gas, absorbing it with such avidity, that although its own substance
retains its integrity, no free oxygen can exist in its neighborhood. The
generally accepted notion of effete matter waiting to be oxidized, was
associated with a more general one, viz, that the elaborate structure of
the body was not permanent, but constantly undergoing decay and re-
newal. What we have now learnt is that the material to be oxidized
comes as much from the outside, as the oxygen which burns it, though
the re-action between them, 7. e., the oxidation, is intrinsic, 7. e., takes
place within the living molecular frame-work.

ologische Verbrennung in den lebendigen Organismen.”
ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 427

Protoplasm therefore (understanding by the term the visible and
tangible presentation to our senses of living material) comes to consist
of two things, namely, of frame-work and of content,—of channel and
of stream,—of acting part which lives and is stable,—of acted-on part
which has never lived and is labile, that is, in a state of metabolism, or
chemical transformation.

If such be the relation between the living frame-work and the stream
which bathes it, we must attribute to this living, stable, acting part a
property which is characteristic of the bodies called in physiological
language ferments or enzymes, the property which, following Berzelius,
we have for the last half century expressed by the word catalytic,
which we use, without thereby claiming to understand it, to indicate a
mode of action in which the agent which produces the change does not
itself take part in the decompositions which it produces.

I have brought you to this point as the outcome of what we know as
to the essential nature of the all-important relation between oxygen
and life. In botanical physiology the general notion of a stable cata-
lysing frame-work, and of an interstitial labile material, which might be
called catalyte, has been arrived at on quite other grounds. This no-
tion is represented in plant physiology by two words, both of which
correspond in meaning,—Micell, the word devised by Niigeli, and the
better word, Tagmata, substituted for it by Pfeffer. Niigeli’s word has
been adopted by Professor Sachs as the expression of his own thought
in relation to the ultra-microscopical structure of the protoplasm of the
plant cell. His view is that certain well-known properties of organized
bodies require for their explanation the admission that the simplest vis-
ible structure is itself made up of an arrangement of units of a far in-
ferior order of minuteness. It is these hypothetical units that Nigeli
has called Micelle.

Now, Nigeli*, in the first instance, confounded the micelle with mole-
cules, conceiving that the molecule of living matter must be of enor-
mous size. But inasmuch as we have no reason for believing that any
form of living material is chemically homogeneous, it was soon recog-
nized, perhaps first by Pfeffer,t but eventually also by Niigeli himself,
that a micelle, the ultimate element of living material, is not equiva-
lent to a molecule, however big or complex, but must rather be an
arrangement or phalanx of molecules of different kinds. Hence the
word Tagma, first used by Pfeffer, has come to be accepted as best ex-
pressing the notion. And here it must be noted that each of the physi-
iologists to whom reference has been made, regards the micelle, not as
a mere aggregate of separate particles, but as connected together so as
to form a system ;—a conception which is in harmony with the view I
gave you just now from the side of animal physiology, of catalysing
frame-work and interstitial catalysable material.

A428 ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

To Professor Sachs, this porous constitution of protoplasm serves to
explain the property of vital turgescence, that is, its power of charg-
ing itself with aqueous liquid ;—a power which Sachs estimates to be
so enormous that living protoplasm may, he believes, be able to con-
dense water which it takes into its interstices to less than its normal
volume. For the moment it is sufficient for us to understand that to
the greatest botanical thinkers, as well as to the greatest animal physi-
ologists, the ultimate mechanism by which life is carried on is not as
Professor Sachs* puts it, “slime,” but ‘a very distensible and exceed-
ingly fine net-work.”

Aud now let us try to get a step further by crossing back in thought
from plants to animals. At first sight the elementary vital processes
of life seem more complicated in the animal than in the plant, but they
are on the contrary simpler; for plant protoplasm, though it may be
structurally homogeneous, is dynamically polyergic,—it has many en-
dowments—whereas in the animal organism there are cases in which a
structure has only one function assigned to it. Of this the best examples
are to be found within so-called excitable tissues, viz, those which are
differentiated for the purpose of producing (along with heat) mechanical
work, light. or electricity. In the life of the plant these endowments,
if enjoyed at all, are enjoyed in common with others.

By the study therefore of muscle, of light organ and of electrical
organ, the vital mechanism is more accessible than by any other portal.
About light organs we as yet know little, but the little we do know is
of value. Cf electrical organs rather more, about muscle a great deal.

To the case of muscle, Engelmann, one of the best observers and
thinkers on the elementary questions which we have now before us, has
transferred the terminology of Niigeli and Pfeffer as descriptive of the
mechanism of its contraction. Muscular protoplasm differs from those
kinds of living matter to which I have applied the term “polyergic,” in
possessing a molecular structure comparable with that of a erystal in
this respect that each portion of the apparently homogeneous and trans-
yarent material of which it consists resembles every other.

With this ultra-microscopical structure, its structure as investigated
by the microscope, may be correlated, the central fact being that, just
as a muscular fiber can be divided into cylinders by Grose secneres so
each such cylinder is made up of an indefinite number of inconceivably
minute cylindrical parts, each of which is an epitome of the whole.
These Engelmann, following Pfeffer, calls ino-tagmata. So long as life
Jasts each minute phalanx has the power of keeping its axis parallel
with those of its neighbors, and of so acting within its own sphere as

to produce, whenever it is awakened from the state of rest to that of

activity, a fluxion from poles to equator. In other words, muscle, like
ae protoplasm, consists of a stable framework of living ecatalysing

substance, which governs the mechanical and chemical changes that
occur in the interstitial catalysable material, with this difference, that
here the ultra-microscopical structure resembles that of a uniaxial
crystal, whereas in plant protoplasin there may be no evidence of such
arrangement.*

According to this scheme of muscular structure, the contraction, ¢. e.,
the change of form which, if allowed, a muscle undergoes when stimu-
lated, has its seat not in the tagma, but in the interstitial material
which surrounds it, and consists in the migration of that labile material
from pole to equator, this being synchronous with explosive oxidation,
sudden disengagement of heat, and change in electrical state of the
living substance. Let us now see how far the scheme will help us to
‘an understanding of this marvellous concomitance.of chemical, elec-
trical, and mechanical change,

It is not necessary to prove to you that the discharge of carbon diox-
ide and the production of heat which we know to be associated with
that awakening of. a muscle to activity which we call stimulation are
indices of oxidation. If we take this fact in connection with the view
that has just been given of the mechanism of contraction, it is obvious
that there must be in the sphere of tagma an accumulation of oxygen
and oxidizable material, and that concomitantly with or autecedently
to the migration of liquid from pole to equator these must come into
encounter. Let us for a moment suppose that a soluble carbe-hydrate
is the catalysable material, that this is accumulated equatorially, and
oxygen at the poles, and consequently that between equator and poles
water and carbon dioxide, the only products of the explosion, are set
free. That the process is really of this nature is the conclusion to which
an elaborate study of the electrical phenomena which accompany it, has
led one of the most eminent physiologists of the present time, Professor
Bernstein.t To this I wish for a moment to ask your attention.

Professor Bernstein’s view of the molecular structure of museular
protoplasm is in entire accordance with the theory of Pfliiger and with
the scheme of Engelmann, with this addition, that each ino-tagma is
electrically polarized when in a state of rest, depolarized at the moment
of excitation or stimulation, and that the axes of the tagmata are so
directed that they are always parallel to the surface of the fiber, and
consequently have their positive sides exposed. In this amended form
the theory admits of being harmonized with the fundamental facts of
muscle-electricity, namely, that cut surfaces are negative to sound sur-
faces, and excited parts to inactive, provided that the direction of the
hypothetical polarization is from equator to pole, ¢.e., that in the rest.
ing state the poles of cach tagma are charged with negative ions, the

equators with positive, and consequently that the direction of the dis-
charge in the catalyte at the moment that the polarization disappears, ~
is from pole to equator.

Time forbids me even to attempt to explain how this theory enables
us to express more consistently the accepted explanations of many col-
lateral phenomena, particularly those of electrotonus. I am content to
show you that it is not impossible to regard the three phenomena, viz,
chemical explosion, sudden electrical change, and change of form, as
all manitestations of one and the same process,—as products of the same
mechanism.

In plants, in certain organs or parts in which movement takes place
as in muscles in response to stimulation, the physiological conditions are
the same or similar, but the structural very different; for the effect is
produced not by a charge of form, but by a diminution of volume of the
excited part, ana this consists not of fibers but of cells. The way in
which the diminution of volume of the whole organ is brought aboutis
by diminution of the volume of each cell, an effect which can obviously
be produced by flow of liquid out of the cell. At first sight therefore
the differences are much more striking than the resemblances.

But it is not so in reality. For the more closely we fix our attention
on the elementary process rather than on the external form, the stronger
appears the analogy—the more complete the correspondence. The state
of turgor, as it has been long called by botanical physiologists, by virtue
of which the frame-work of the protoplasm of the plant retains its con-
tent with a tenacity to which I have already referred, is the analogue
of the state of polarization of Bernstein. As regards its state of aggre-
gation, it can scarcely be doubted that inasmuch as the electrical con-
comitants of excitation of the plant cell so closely correspond with
those of muscle, here also the tagmata are cylindrical, and have their
axes parallel to each other. Beyond this we ought perhaps not to allow
speculation to carry us, but it is scarcely possible to refrain from con-
necting this inference with the streaming motion of protoplasm, which
in living plant cells is one of the indices of vitality. If, as must I think
be supposed, this movement is interstitial, 7. e., due to the mechanical
action of the moving protoplasm on itself, we can most readily under-
stand its mechanism as consisting in rhythmically recurring phases
of close and open order in the direction of the tagmatic axes.

I have thus endeavored—building on two principles in physiology,—
firstly, that of the constant correlation of mechanism and action, of
structure and function,—and secondly, the identity of plant and animal
life—both as regards mechanism and structure, and on two experiment-
ally ascertained elementary relations, viz, the relation of living matter
or protoplasm to water on the one hand and to oxygen and food on the
other,—to present im part the outline or sketch of what might (if Thad
time to complete it) be an adequate conception of the mechanism and
process of life as it presents itself under the simplest conditions.
ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 451

To complete this outline, so far as I can to-day, I have but one other
consideration to bring before you, one whici is connected with the last
of my four points of departure,—that of the relation of oxygen to proto-
plasm, a relation which springs out of the avidity with which, without
being oxidized or even sensibly altered in chemical constitution, it seizes
upon oxygen and stores it for its own purposes. The consideration
which this suggests is that if the oxygen and oxidizable material are
constantly stored, they must either constantly or at intervals be dis-
charged; and inasmuch as we know that in every instance, without
exception, in which heat is produced or work is done, these processes
have discharge of water and of carbon dioxide for their concomitants,
we are justified in regarding these discharges as the sign of expenditure,
the charging with oxygen as the sign of restitution. In other words, a
new characteristic of living process springs out of those we have already
had before us, namely, that it is a constantly recurring alternation of
opposite and complementary states, that of activity or discharge, that
of rest or restitution.

Is itso or is itnot? Inthe minds of most physiologists the distinetion
between the phenomena of discharge and the phenomena of restitution
(Prholung) is fundamental, but beyond this, unanimity ceases. One dis-
tinguished man in Germany and one in England—Professor Hering and
Dr. Gaskell—have taken, on independent grounds, a different view to
the one suggested, according to which life consists not of alternations
between rest and activity, charge and discharge, loading and exploding,
but between two kinds of activity, two kinds of explosion, which differ
only in the direction in which they act, in the circumstance that they
are antagonistic te each other.

Now when we compare the two processes of rest, Which as regards
living matter means restitution, and discharge which means action,
with each other, they may further be distinguished in this respect, that
whereas restitution is autonomic, 7. é., goes on continuously like the ad-
ministrative functions of a well-ordered community, the other is occa-
sional, 7. e., takes place only at the suggestion of external influences;
that, in other words, the contrast between action and rest is (in1 elation
to protoplasm) essentially the same as between waking and sleeping.

It is in accordance with this analogy between the alternation of wak-
ing and sleeping of the whole organism, and the corresponding alterna.
tion of restitution and discharge, of every kind of living substance, that
physiologists by common consent use the term stimulus (Retz, Prikkeling),
meaning thereby nothing more than that it is by external disturbing or
interfering influence of some kind that energies stored in living material
are (for the most part suddenly) discharged. Now, if I were to main-
tain that restitution is not autonomic, but determined, as waking is, by
an external stimulus,—that it differed from waking only in the direction
of which the stimulation acts, 7. ¢., in the tendeney towards construction
on the one hand, towards destruction on the other, | should fairly and
as clearly as possible express the doctrine which, as I have said, the two

432 ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

distinguished teachers I have mentioned, viz, Dr. Gaskell and Professor
Hering,* have embodied in words which have now become familiar to
every student. The woids in question, anabolism, which being inter-
preted means winding up, and catabolism, running down, are the crea-
tion of Dr. Gaskell. Professor Hering’s equivalents for these are assim-
ilation, which of course means storage of oxygen and oxidizable
material, and disassimilation, discharge of these in the altered form of
carbon dioxide aud water. But the point of the theory which attaches
to them lies in this, that that wonderful power which living material
enjoys of continually building itself up out of its environment is, as I
have already suggested, not autonomic, but just as dependent on ocea-
sional and exterual influences or stimuli, as we know the disintegrating
processes to be; and accordingly Hering finds it necessary to include
under the term stimuli not only those which determine action, but to
create a new class of stimuli which he calls Assimilations- Reize, those
which, instead of waking living mechanism to action, provoke it to
rest.

It is unfortunately impossible within the compass of an address like
the present, to place before you the wide range of experimental facts
which have led two of the strongest intellects of our time to adopt a
theory which, when looked at @ priori, seems so contradictory. I must
content myself with mentioning that Hering was led to it chiefly by the
study of one of the examples to which I referred in my introduction,
namely, the color-discriminating functions of the retina, Dr. Gaskell by
the study of that very instruc’ive class of phenomena which reveal to us
that among the channels by which the brain maintains its sovereign
power as supreme regulator of all the complicated processes which go
on in the different parts of the animal organism, there are some which
convey only commands to action, others commands to rest, the former
being called by Gaskell catabolic, the latter anabolic. - - -

I have indicated to you that although scientific thought does not, like
speculative, oscillate from side to side, but marches forward with a con-.
tinued and uninterrupted progress, the stages of that progress.may be
marked by characteristic tendencies; and I have endeavored to show
that in physiology the questions which concentrate to themselves the
most lively interests are these which lie at the basis of the elementary
mechanism of life. The word life is used in physiology in what, if you
like, may be called a technical sense, and denotes only that state of
change with permanence which I have endeavored to set forth to you.
In this restricted sense of the word therefore, the question ‘ What is
Life?” is one to which the answer is approachable; but I need not say
that in a higher sense—higher because it appeals to bigher faculties in
our nature—the word suggests something outside of mechanism, which
may perchance be itS cause rather than its effect.

ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 433

The tendency to recognize such a relation as this, is what we mean by
vitalism. An anti-vitalistic tendency accompanied the great advance
of knowledge that took place at the middle of the century. But even
at the height of this movement there was a re-action towards vitalism,
of which Virchow,* the founder of modern pathology, was the greatest
exponent. Now,a generation later, a tendency in the same direction is
manifesting itselfin various quarters. What does this tendency mean?
It has to my mind the same significance now that it had then. Thirty
years ago the discovery of the cell as the basis of vital function was
new, and the mystery which before belonged to the organism was trans-
ferred to the unit, which, while it served to explain everything, was
itself unexplained. The discovery of the cell seemed to be a very close
approach to the mechanism of life, but now we are striving to get even
closer, and with the same result. Our measurements are more exact,
our methods finer; but these very methods bring us to close quarters
with phenomena which, although within reach of exact investigation,
are as regards their essence involved in a mystery which is the more
profound the more it is brought into contrast with the exact knowledge
we possess of surrounding conditions.

If what I have said is true, there is little ground for the apprehension
that exists in the minds of some, that the habit of scrutinizing the mech-
anism of life tends to make men regard what can be so learned as the
only kind of knowledge. The tendency is now certainly rather in the
other direction. What we have to guard against is the mixing of two
methods, and so far as we are concerned, the intrusion into our subject
of philosophical speculation. Let us willingly and with our hearts do
homage to “divine philosophy,” but let that homage be rendered out-
side the limits of our science. Let those who are so inclined, cross: the
frontier and philosophize; but to me it appers more conducive to pro-
gress that we should do our best to furnish professed philosophers with
such facts relating to structure and mechanism as may serve them as
aids in the investigation of those deeper problems which concern man’s
relations to the past, the present, and the unknown future.

ON BOSCOVICH’S THEORY.*

By Sir WILLIAM THOMPSON.

Without accepting Boscovich’s fundamental doctrine that the ulti-
mate atoms of matter are points endowed each with inertia and with
mutual attractions or repulsions dependent on mutual distances, and
that all the properties of matter are due to equilibrium of these forces,
and to motions, or changes of motion produced by them when they are
not balanced, we can learn something towards an understanding of the
real molecular structure of matter, and of some of its thermo-dynamie
properties, by consideration of the static and kinetic problems which
it suggests. Hooke’s exhibition of the forms of erystals by piles of
globes, Naviers’ and Poisson’s theory of the elasticity of solids, Max-
well’s and Clausius’ work in the kinetic theory of gases, and Tait’s
more recent work on the same subject—all developments of Boscovich’s
theory pure and simple—amply justify this statement.

Boscovich made it an essential in his theory that at the smallest dis-
tances there is repulsion, and at greater distances attraction; ending
with infinite repulsion at infinitely small distance, and with attraction
according to Newtonian law for all distances for which this law has
been proved. He suggested numerous transitions from attraction to
repulsion, whieh he illustrated graphically by a curve—the celebrated
Boscovich curve—to explain cohesion, mutual pressure between bodies
in contact, chemical affinity, and all possible properties of matter—ex-
cept heat, which he regarded as a sulphureous essence or virtue. It
seems now wonderful that after so clearly stating his fundamental pos-
tulate which included inertia, he did not see inter-molecular motion as
a necessary consequence of it, and so discover the kinetic theory of heat
for solids, liquids, and gases; and that he only wsed his inertia of the
atoms to explain the known phenomena of the inertia of palpable masses,
or assemblages of very large numbers of atoms.

It is also wonderful how much towards explaining the crystallogra-
phy and elasticity of solids, and the thermo-elastic properties of solids,
liquids, and gases, we find without assuming more than one transition
from attraction to repulsion. Suppose for instance the mutual force
between two atoms to be repulsive when the distance between them is <
Z; zero when it is= Z; and attractive when it is > Z; and consider
the equilibrium of groups of atoms under these conditions.

A group of two would be in equilibrium at distance Z, and only at
this distance. This equilibrium is stable.

A group of three would be in stable equilibrium at the corners of an
equilateral triangle, of sides Z; and only in this configuration, There
is no other configuration of equilibrium except with the three in one
line. There is one, and there may be more than one, configuration of
unstable equilibrium, of the three atoms in one line.

The only configuration of stable equilibrium of four atoms is at the
corners of an equilateral tetrahedron of edges Z. There is one, and
there may be more than one configuration of unstable equilibrium of
each of the following descriptions:

(1) Three atoms at the corners of an equilateral triangle, and one at
its center.

(2) The four atoms at the corners of a square.

(3) The four atoms in one line.

There is no other configuration of equilibrium of four atoms, subject
to the conditions stated above as to mutual force.

In the oral communication to Section A, important questions as to
the equilibrium of groups of five, six, or greater finite numbers of
atoms were suggested. They are considered in a communication by the
author to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of July 15, to be published
in the Proceedings before the end of the year. The Boscovichian foun-
dation for the elasticity of solids with no inter-molecular vibrations was
slightly sketched, in the communication to Section A, as follows:

Every infinite homogeneous assemblage* of Boscovich atoms is in
equilibrium. So therefore is every finite homogeneous assemblage, pro-
vided that extraneous forces be applied to all within influential dis-
tance of the frontier, equal to the forces which a homogeneous continu-
ation of the assemblage through influential distance beyond the frontier
would exert on them. The investigation of these extraneous forces for
any given homogeneous assemblage of single atoms, or of groups of
atoms, as explained below, constitutes the Boscovich equilibrium-theory
of elastic solids.

To investigate the equilibriam of a homogeneous assemblage of two

‘Homogeneous assemblage of points, or of iroupeernee or of fe or of sien of
bodies,” is an expression which needs no definition, because it speaks for itself un-
ambiguously. The geometrical subject of homogeneous assemblages is treated with
perfect simplicity and generality by Bravais, in the Journal de UV Ecole Polytechnique,
cahier xix, pp. 1-128. (Paris, 1850.)

or more atoms, imagine in a homogeneous assemblage of gronps of 4
atoms, all the atoms except one held fixed. This one experiences zero
resultant force from all the points corresponding to it in the whole as-
semblage, since it and they constitute a homogeneous assemblage of
single points. Hence it experiences zero resultant force also from all
the other i—1 assemblages of single points. This condition, fulfilled
for each one of the atoms of the compound molecule, clearly suffices for
the equilibrium of the assemblage, whether the constituent atoms of the
compound molecule are similar or dissimilar.

When all the atoms are similar—that is to say, when the mutual force
is the same for the same distance between every pair—it might be sup-
posed that a homogeneous assemblage, to be in equilibrium, must be of
single points; but this is not true, as we see synthetically, without ref-
erence to the question of stability, by the following examples, of homo-
geneous assemblages of symmetrical groups of points, with the condition
of equilibrium for each when the mutual forces act.

Preliminary.—Consider an equilateral* homogeneous assemblage of
single points, O, O’, ete. Bisect every line between nearest neighbors
by a plane perpendicular to it. These planes divide space into rhombie
dodekahedrons. Let A,OA;, A,OA,, A;,OA,;, A,OAs, be the diagonals
through the eight trihedral angles of the dodekahedron inclosing O, and
let 2a be the length of each. Place atoms Q,, Q;, Q., Q6, Qs, Q7, Qu. Qs,
on these lines, at equal distances, r, from O; and do likewise for every
other point, O’, O”, ete., of the infinite homogeneous assemblage. We
thus have, aronnd each point A, four atoms, Q, Q’, Q”, Q’”, contributed
by the four dodekahedrons of which trihedral are are contiguous in
A, and fill the space around A. The distance of each of these atoms
from A is a—?.

Suppose, now, 7 to be very small. Mutual repulsions of the atoms of
the groups of eight around the points O will preponderate. But sup-
pose a—r to be very small: mutual repulsions of the atoms of the
groups of four around the points A will preponderate. Hence for some
value of 7 between O and a, there will be equilibrium. There may (ac-
cording to the law of force) be more than one value of r between O and
a giving equilibrium; but whatever be the law of force, there is one
value of r giving stable equilibrium, supposing the atoms to be con-
strained to the lines OA, and the distances r to be constrainedly equal.
It is clear from the symmetries around O and around A, that neither of
these constraints is necessary for mere equilibrium ; eee without them,
the equilibrium might be unstable. Thus we have found a homogene-
ous equilateral distribution of eight-atom groups, in equilibrium. Simi-
larly, by placing atoms on the three diagonals, B,OB,, B,OB;, B,OB,

*This means such an PeisWians as Guat of ne centers of equal s lobes ale sd ane
geneously, as in the ordinary triangular-based, or square-based, or oblong-rectangie-
based pyramids of round shot or of billiard balls.
438 ON BOSCOVICH’S THEORY.

through the six tetrahedral angles of the dodekahedron around O, we
find a homogeneous equilateral distribution of six-atom groups, in equi-
librium.

Place now an atom at each point O. The equilibrium will be dis-
turbed in each case, but there will be equilibrium with a different
value of y (still between o and a). Thus we have nine-atom groups and
seven-atom groups.

Thus in all, we have found homogeneous distributions of six-atom, of
seven-atom, of eight-atom, and of nine-atom groups, each in equilibrium,
Without stopping to look for more complex groups, or for five-atom, or
four-atom groups, we find a homogeneous distribution of three-atom
groups in equilibrium by placing an atom at every point O, and at each
of the eight points A,, A;, As, Ag, As, A;, Ay, Ag. Thus we see by ob-
serving that each of these eight A’s is common to four tetrahedrons of
A’s, and is in the center of a tetrahedron of O’s; because it is a common
trihedral corner point of four contiguous dodekahedrons.

Lastly, choosing A», A3, Ay, so that the angles A,OA:, A,JOA;, A;OA4,,
areeach obtuse,* we makea homogeneous assemblage of two-atom groups
in equilibrium by placing atoms at O, Ay, Ay, A3, Ay There are four
obvious ways of seeing this as an assemblage of di-atomic groups, one
of which is as follows: Choose A; and O as one pair. Through A», A;,
A, draw lines same-wards parallel to A,O, and each equal to A,O.
Their ends lie at the centers of neighboring dodekahedr oo which pair
with A», A3, Ay, respectively.

For the Boscovich theory of the elasticity of solids, the consideration
of this homogeneous assemblage of double atoms is very important.
Remark that every O is at the center of an equilateral tetrahedron of
four A’s; and every A is at the center of an equal and similar, and
same-ways oriented, tetrahedron of O’s. The corners of each of these
tetrahedrons are respectively A and three of its twelve nearest A neigh-
bors; and O and three of its twelve nearest O neighbors.

[By aid of an illustrative model showing four of the one set of tetra-
hedrons with their corner atoms painted blue, and one tetrahedron of
atoms in their centers, painted red, the mathematical theory which the
author had bommtiiented to the Raval Society of Edinburgh, was illus:
trated to section A.|

In this theory it is shown that in an elastic solid constituted by a
single homogeneous assemblage of Boscovich atoms, there are in gen-
eral two different rigidities, n, m,, and one bulk-modulus, k; between
which there is essentially the relation 5k=3n + 2, whatever be the
law of force. The law of force may be so adjusted as to make n, =n ;
and in this case we have 3k = dn, which is Poisson’s relation. But no
such relation is obligatory when the elastic solid consists of a homoge-

neous assemblage of double, or triple or multiple Boscovich atoms. On
the contrary, any arbitrarily chosen values may be given to the bulk-
modulus and to the rigidity, by proper adjustment of the law of force,
even though we take nothing more complex than the homogeneous
assemblage of double Boscovich atoms above described.

The most interesting and important part of the subject, the kinetie,
was, for want. of time, but slightly touched in the communication to
Section A. The author hopes to enter on it more fully in a future
communication to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT.*

3v Prof. OLIVER J. LODGE.

To persons occupied in other branches of learning, and not directly
engaged in the study of physical science, some rumor must probably
have travelled of the stir and activity manifest at the present time among
the votaries of that department of knowledge.

It may serve a useful purpose if I try and explain to outsiders what
this stir is mainly about and why it exists. There is a proximate and
there is an ultimate cause. The proximate cause is certain experiments
exhibiting in a marked and easily recognizable way the already theoret-
ically predicted connection between electricity and ight. The ultimate
cause is that we begin to feel inklings and foretastes of theories, wider
than that of gravitation, more fundamental than any theories which
have yet been advanced; theories which, if successfully worked out,
will carry the banner of physical science far into the dark continent of
metaphysics, and will iluminate with a clear philosophy much that at
present is only dimly guessed. More explicitly, we begin to perceive
chinks of insight into the natures of electricity, of «ether, of elasticity,
and even of matter itself. We begin to have a kinetic theory of the
physical universe. |

We are living, not in a Newtonian, but at the beginning of a perhaps
still greater, Thomsonian era. Greater not because any one man is
probably greater than Newton,t but because of the stupendonsness of
the problems now waiting to be solved. There are a dozen men of
great magnitude, either now living or but recently deceased, to whom
what we now know towards these generalizations is in some measure
due, and the epoch of complete development may hardly be seen by
those now alive. It is proverbially rash to attempt prediction, but it
seems to me that it may well take a period of fifty years for these great
strides to be fully accomplished. If it does, and if progress goes on at

4492 THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT.

anything like its present rate, the aspect of physical science bequeathed
to the latter half of the twentieth century will indeed excite admiration,
and when the populace are sufficiently educated to appreciate it, will
form a worthy theme for poetry, for oratorios, and for great works of
art.

To attempt to give any idea of the drift. of progress in all the direc-
tions which I have hastily mentioned, to attempt to explain the begin-
nings of the theories of elasticity and of matter, would take too long, and
might only result in confusion. I will limit myself chiefly to giving
some notion of what we have gained in knowledge concerning electric-
ity, ether, and light. Even that is far too much; I find I must con-
fine myself principally to light, and only treat of the others as incidental
to that.

For now well-nigh a century we have had a wave theory of light; and
a wave theory of light is quite certainly true. It is directly demonstra-
ble that light consists of waves of some kind or other, and that these
waves travel at a certain well-known velocity, seven times the circum-
ference of the earth per second, taking eight minutes on the journey
from the sun to the earth. This propagation in time of an undulatory
disturbance necessarily involves a medium. If waves setting out from
the sun exist in space eight minutes before striking our eyes, there
must necessarily be in space some medium in which they exist and
which conveys them. Waves we can not have unless they be waves in
something.

No ordinary medium is competent to transmit waves at anything like
the speed of light, hence the luminiferous medium must be a special
kind of substance, and it is called the ether. The luwminiferous ether it
used to be called, because the conveyance of light was all it was then
known to be capable of; but now that it is known to do a variety of
other things also, the qualifying adjective nay be dropped.

Wave motion in «ther, light certainly is; but what does one mean by
the term wave? The popular notion is, 1 suppose, of something heav-
ing up and down, or perhaps of something breaking on the shore in
which it is possible to bathe. But if you ask a mathematician what he
means by a wave, he will probably reply that the simplest wave is

y= a sin (pt—n2v)

and he might possibly refuse to give any other answer.

And in refusing to give any other answer than this, or its equivalent
in ordinary words, he is entirely justified ; that is what is meant by the
term wave, and nothing less general would be all-inclusive. .

Translated into ordinary English the phrase signifies “a disturbance
periodic both in space.and time.” Anything thus douoly periodie is a
wave; and all waves, whether in air as sound waves, or in ether as light
waves, or on the surface of water as ocean waves, are comprehended in
the definition.
THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT. 443

What properties are essential to a medium capable of transmitting
wave motion? Roughly we may say two: elasticity and inertia. Elas-
ticity in some form, or some equivalent of it, in order to be able to store
up energy and effect recoil; inertia, in order to enable the disturbed
substance to over-shoot the mark and osciilate beyond its place of equi-
librium to and fro. Any medium possessing these two properties can
transmit waves, and unless a medium possesses these properties in some
form or other, or some equivalent for them, it may be said with moder-
ate security to be incompetent to transmit waves. But if we make this
latter statement one must be prepared to extend to the terms elasticity
and inertia their very largest and broadest signification, so as to include
any possible kind of restoring force, and any eae kind of persist-
ence of motion respectively.

These matters may be illustrated in many ways, but perhaps a sim-
ple loaded lath or spring in a vise will serve well enough. Pull aside
one end, and its elasticity tends to make it recoil; let it go and its in-
ertia causes it to over-shoot its normal position; both causes together
cause it to swing to and fro till its energy is exhausted. <A regular
series of such springs at equal intervals in space, set going at regular
intervals of time one after the other, gives you at once a wave motion
and appearance which the most casual observer must recognize as such.
A series of pendulums will do just as well. Any wave-transmitting
medium must similarly possess some form of elasticity and of inertia.

But now proceed to ask what is this «ether which in the case of light
is thus vibrating? What corresponds to the elastic displacment and re-
coil of the spring or pendulum? What corresponds to the inertia
whereby it over-shoots its mark? Do we know these properties in the
wether in any other way ?

The answer, given first by Clerk Maxwell, and now reiterated and
insisted on by experiments performed in every important laboratory in
the world, is:

The elastic displacement corresponds to electro-static charge
(roughly speaking, to electricity).
The inertia corresponds to magnetism.
This is the basis of the modern electro-inagnetic theory of light. Now
let me illustrate electrically how this can be.

The old and familiar operation of charging a Leyden jar—the storing
up of energy in a strained di-electric—any electro- static charging what-
ever—is quite analogous to the drawing aside of our flexible spring.
It is making use of the elasticity of the «ether to produce a tendency to
recoil. Letting go the spring is analogous to permitting a discharge of
the jar—permitting the strained di-electric to recover itself—the elee-
tro-static disturbance to subside.

In nearly all the experiments of electro-staties «therial elasticity is
manifest.

Next consider inertia. How would one illustrate the fact that water,
444 THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT.

for instance, possesses inertia—the power of persisting in motion against
obstacles—the power of possessing kinetic energy? The most direct
way would be, to take a stream of water and try suddenly to stop it.
Open a water tap freely and then suddenly shut it. The impetus or
momentum of the stopped water makes itself manifest by a violent shock
to the pipe, with which everybody must be familiar. This momentum
of water is utilized by engineers in the “ water-ram.”

A precisely analogous experiment in electricity is what Faraday
called “the extra current.” Send a current through a coil of wire round
a piece of iron, or take any other arrangement for developing powerful
magnetism, and then suddenly stop the current by breaking the circuit.
A violent tlash occurs if the stoppage is sudden enough, a flash which
means the bursting of the insulating air partition by the accumulated
electro magnetic momentum.

Briefly we may say that nearly all electro-magnetic experiments illus-
trate the fact of etherial inertia.

Now return to consider what happens when a charged conductor (say
a Leyden jar) is discharged. The recoil of the strained di-electric causes
a current, the inertia of this current causes it to over-shoot the mark,
and for an instant the charge of the jar is reversed; the current now
flows backwards and charges the jar up as at first; back again flows
the current, and so on, charging and reversing the charge with rapid
oscillations until the energy is all dissipated into heat. The operation
is precisely analogous to the release of a strained spring, or to the pluck-
ing of a stretched string.

But the discharging body thus thrown into strong electrical vibration
is embedded in the all-pervading ether, and we have just seen that the
wether possesses the two properties requisite for the generation and trans-
mission of waves, viz, elasticity, and inertia or density ; hence just as
a tuning-fork vibrating in air excites aerial waves or sound, so a dis-
charging Leyden jar in «ether excites «therial waves or light.

AXtherial waves can therefore be actually produced by direct electri-
cal means. I discharge here a jar, and the room is for an instant filled
with light. With light, I say, though you can see nothing. You can
see and hear the spark indeed (but that is a mere secondary disturb-
ance we can for the present ignore), | donot mean any secondary dis-
turbance. I mean the true «therial waves emitted by the electric oscil-
lation going on in the neighborhood of this recoiling di-electric. You
pull aside the prong of a tuning-fork and let it go: vibration follows
and sound is produced. You charge a Leyden jar and let it discharge:
vibration follows and light is excited.

It is light, just as good as any other light. It travels at the same
pace, it is reflected and refracted according to the same laws; every
experiment known to optics can be performed with this «therial radia-
tion electrically produced, and yet you cannot see it. Why not? For
no fault of the light, the fault (if there be a fault), is in the eye. The
THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT. 445

retina is incompetent to respond to these vibrations—they are too slow.
The vibrations set up when this large jar is discharged are from a hun-
dred thousand to a million per second, but that is too slow for the retina.
It responds only to vibrations between 400 billion and 800 billion
per second. The vibrations are too quick for the ear, which responds
only to vibrations between 40 and 40,000 per second. Between the
highest audible and the lowest visible vibrations there has been hither-
to a great gap, which these electric oscillations go far to fillup. There
has been a great gap simply because we have no intermediate sense
organ to detect rates of vibration between 40,000 and 400,000,000,-
000,000 per second. It was therefore an unexplored territory. Waves
have been there all the time in any quantity, but we have not thought
,about them nor attended to them.

It happens that I have myself succeeded in getting electric oscilla-
tions so slow as to be audibie, the lowest [ have got at present are 125
per second, and for some way above this the sparks emit a musical
note; but no one has yet succeeded in directly making electric oscilla-
tions that are visible,—though indirectly every one does it when he
lights a candle.

Here however is an electric oscillator which vibrates 300 million
times a second, and emits «etherial waves a yard long. The whole range
of vibrations between musical tones and some thousand million per
second, is now filled up.

These electro-magnetic waves have long been known on the side of
theory, but interest in them has been immensely quickened by the dis-
covery of a receiver or detector for them. The great though simple
discovery by Hertz of an “electric eye,” as Sir W. Thomson calls it,
makes experiments on these waves for the first time easy or even pos-
sible. We have now a sort of artificial sense organ for their apprecia-
tion,—an electric arrangement which can virtually ‘‘ see” these inter-
mediate rates of vibration.

The Hertz receiver is the simplest thing in the world; nothing but a
bit of wire or a pair of bits of wire adjusted so that when immersed in
strong electric radiation they give minute sparks across a microscopic
air gap.

The receiver I have here is adapted for the yard-long waves emitted
from this small oscillator; but for the far longer waves emitted by :
discharging Leyden jar an excellent receiver is a, gilt wall-paper or
other interrupted metallic surface. The waves falling upon the metallic
surface are reflected, and in the act of reflexion excite electric currents,
which cause sparks. Similarly, gigantic solar waves may produce
aurore ; and minute waves from a candle do electrically disturb the
retina.

The smaller waves are however far the most interesting and the
most tractable to ordinary optical experiments. From a small oscilla-
tor, which may be a couple of small cylinders kept sparking into each
446 THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT.

other end to end by an induction coil, waves are emitted on which all
manner of optical experiments can be performed.

They can be reflected by plain sheets of metal, concentrated by para-
bolic reflectors, refracted by piisms, concentrated by lenses. I have at
the college a large lens of pitch, weighing over three hundred- weight,
for concentrating them to a focus. They can be made to show the phe-
nomenon of interference, and thus have their wave-length accurately
measured. They are stopped by all conductors and transmitted by all
insulators. Metals are opaque, but even imperfect insulators such as
wood or stone are strikingly transparent, and waves may be received
in one room from a source in another, the door between the two being
shut.

The real nature of metallic opacity and of transparency has long
been clear in Maxwell’s theory of light, and these electrically produced
waves only illustrate and bring home the well known facts. The ex-
periments of Hertz are in fact the apotheosis of that theory.

Thus then in every way, Maxwell’s 1865 brilliant perception of the real
nature of light is abundantly justified; and for the first time we have
a true theory of light, no longer based upon analogy witi sound, nor
upon a hypothetical jelly or elastic solid.

Light is an electro-magnetic disturbance of the ether. Optics is a
branch of electricity. Outstanding problems in optics are being rap-
idly solved, now that we have tbe means of definitely exciting light
with a full perception of what we are doing and of the precise mode
of its vibration.

It remains to find out how to shorten down the waves—to hurry up
the vibration until the light becomes visible. Nothing is wanted but
quicker modes of vibration. Smaller oscillaters must be used—very
much smaller—oscillators not much bigger than molecules. In all prob-
ability (one may almost say certainly) ordinary light is the result of
electric oscillation in the molecules of hot bodies, or sometimes of bodies
not hot, as in the phenomenon of phosphorescence.

The direct generation of visible light by electric means, So soon as we
have learnt how to attain the necessary frequency of vibration, will have
most important practical consequences.

Speaking in this university it is happily quite unnecessary for me to
bespeak interest in a subject by any reference to possible practical ap-
plications. But any practical application of what I have dealt with this
evening is apparently so far distant as to be free from any sordid gloss
of competition and Company promotion, and is interesting in itself as a
matter of pure science.

For consider our present methods of making artificial light; they are
both wasteful and ineffective.
~ We want a certain range of oscillation, between 800 and 400 billion
Vibrations per second; no other is useful to us, because no other has any
effect on our retina; but we do not know how to produce vibrations of

—a
THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT. 447

this rate. We can produce a definite vibration of one or two hundred
or thousand per second; in other words, we can excite a pure tone of
definite pitch, and we can command any desired range of such tones con-
tinuously by means of bellows and a keyboard. We ean also (though
the fact is less well known) excite momentarily definite «etherial vibra-
tions of some million per second, as [ have explained at length; but we
do not at present seem to know how to maintain this rate quite continu-
ously. To get much faster rates of vibration than this we have to fall
back upon atoms. We know how to make atoms vibrate; it is done by
what we call “ heating” the substance, and if we could deal with indi-
vidual atoms unhampered by others, it is possible that we might get a
pure and simple mode of vibration from them. It is possible, but
unlikely ; for atoms, even when isolated, have a multitude of modes of
vibration special to themselves, of which only a few are of practical use
to us, and we do not know how to excite some without also the others.
However, we do not at present even deal with individual atoms; we
treat them crowded together in a compact mass, so that their modes of
vibration are really infinite.

We take a lump of matter, say a carbon filament or a piece of quick-
lime, and by raising its temperature we impress upon its atoms higher
and higher modes of vibration, not trausmuting the lower into the
higher, but superposing the higher upon the lower, until at length we
get such rates of vibration as our retina is construeted for, and we are
satisfied. But how wasteful and indirect and empirical is the process.
We want a small range of rapid vibrations, and we know no better than
to make the whole series leading up to them. It is as though, in order
to sound some little shrill octave of pipes in an organ, we were obliged
to depress every key and every pedal, and to blow a young hurricane,

I have purposely selected as examples the most perfect methods of
obtaining artificial light, wherein the waste radiation is only useless,
and not noxious. But the old-fashioned plan was cruder even than this ;
it consisted simply in setting something burning, whereby not the fuel
but the air was consumed, whereby also a most powerful radiation was
produced, in the waste waves of which we were content to sit stewing,
for the sake of the minute, almost infinitesimal, fraction of it which
enabled us to see.

Everyone knows now however, that combustion is not a pleasant or
healthy mode of obtaining light; but everybody does not realize that
neither is incandescence a satisfactory and unwasteful method which is
likely to be praticed for more than a few decades, or perhaps a century.

Look at the furnaces and boilers of a great steam-engine driving a
group of dynamos and estimate the energy expended, and then look at
the incandescent filaments of the lamps excited by them, and estimate
how much of their radiated energy is of real service to the eye. It will
be as the energy of a pitch-pipe to an entire orchestra.

It is not too much to say that a boy turning a handle could, if bis
448 THE MODERN THEORY OF LIGHT...

" energy were properly directed, produce quite as much reallight asigs
produced by all this mass of mechanism and consumption of material.
There might perhaps be something contrary to the laws of nature in
thus hoping to get and utilize some specific kind of radiation without
the rest, but Lord Rayleigh has shown in ashort communication to the
British Association at York that it is not so, and that therefore we have
a right to try to do it.
We do not yet know how, it is true, butit is one of the things we have
got to learn.
Any one looking at a common glow-worm must be struck with the
fact that not by ordinary combustion, nor yet on the steam-engine and
dynamo principle, is that easy light produced. Very little waste radia-
tion is there from phosphorescent things in general. Light of the kind
able to affect the retina is directly emitted ; and for this, for even a
large supply of this, a modicum of energy suffices.
Solar radiation consists of waves of all sizes, it is true; but then solar
radiation has innumerable things to do besides making things visible.
The whole of its energy is useful. In artificial lighting nothing but light
is desired ; when heat is wanted it is best obtained separately, by com- |
bustion. And so soon as we clearly recognize that light is an electrical
vibration, so soon shall we begin to beat about for some mode of exciting
and maintaining an electrical vibration of any required degree of rapidity. .
When this has been accomplished, the problem of artificial lighting will
have been solved. |

MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT.*

By JosernH LovEeRING, President.

For many generations it was assumed that no sensible time was
taken by light in moving over the largest distances. The velocity of
sound was found by noting the time which elapsed between seeing the
flash and hearing the report of an explosion. It was only in the vast
spaces of astronomy that distances existed large enough to unmask the
finite velocity of light, and, in extreme cases, to make it seem even to
loiter on its way.

The satellites of Jupiter were discovered by Galileo in 1610 ; and the
eclipses of these satellites by the shadow of Jupiter became an inter-
esting subject of observation. It was soon noticed that the interval
between successive eclipses of the same satellite was shorter when the
earth was approaching Jupiter, and longer when the earth was receding
from Jupiter. The change of pitch in the whistle of a locomotive,
under similar motions, would suggest to the modern inind an easy ex-
planation. A Danish astronomer, Romer, without the help of this
analogy, deciphered the problem in astronomy. ‘The eclipse was tele-
graphed to the observer by aray of light, and the news was hastened
or delayed in proportion to the distance from which itcame. In this way
it was discovered that light took about eighteen minutes to run over
the diameter of the earth’s orbit. This discovery was published by
Romer in the Memoirs of the French Academy in 1675. The mathe-
matical astronomer Delambre, from a discussion of one thousand of
these eclipses observed between 1662 and 1502, found for the velocity
of light 193,350 miles a second.

: Meanwhile Rémer’s method, after fifty years of waiting, had been
substantially confirmed in an unexpected quarter. Dr. Bradley, of the
Greenwich Observatory, the greatest astronomical observer of his day,
was perplexed by certain periodical fluctuations, of small amount, in
the position of the stars. Suddenly the explanation was flashed upon
him by something he observed while yachting on the River Thames.
He noticed that, whenever the boat turned about, the direction of the

vane altered. He asked the sailors, Why? All they could say was,
that it always did. Reflecting upon the matter, Bradley concluded
that the motion of the boat was compounded with the velocity of the
wind, and that the vane represented the resultant direction. He was
not slow in seeing the application of this homely illustration of the
parallelogram of motion to his astronomical puzzle. The velocity of light
was compounded with the velocity of the earth in its orbit, so that its
apparent direction differed by a small angle from its true direction, and
the difference was called aberration. In spearing a fish or shooting a
bird, the sportsman does not aim at them, but ahead of them. This
inclination from the true direction is similiar, in angular measure, to
what the astronomer calls aberration. Struve’s measurement of aber-
ration combined with the velocity of the earth in its orbit gave for the
velocity of light 191,513 miles a second. Both of the two methods de-
scribed for obtaining the velocity ot light depend for their accuracy
upon the assumed distance of the earth from the sun. The distance
adopted was the one found by the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769,
viz. 95,360,000 miles.

During the last forty years, the opinion has been gaining ground
among astronomers that the distance of the sun, as deduced from the
transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, was too large by 3 per cent. Ex-
peditions have been sent to remote parts of the earth for observing
the planet Mars in opposition. The ablest mathematical astronomers,
as Laplace, Pontecoulant, Leverrier, Hansen, Lubbock, Airy, and
Delaunay, have applied profound mathematical analysis to the numer-
ous perturbations in planetary motions, and proved that tae sun’s dis-
tance must be diminished about 2,000,000 miles in order to reconcile ob-
servations with the law of gravitation. Airy reduced the distance of
the sun by more than 2,000,000 miles, to satisfy the observations on
the transit of Venus in 1874. Glasenapp derived from observed eclipses
of Jupiter’s satellites a distance for the sun of only 92,500,000 miles.
From these and similar data, Delaunay concluded that the velocity of
light is about 186,420 miles a second.

These triumphs of astronomical theory recall the witty remark of
Fontenelle, that Newton, without getting out of his arm chair, calcu-
lated the figure of the earth more accurately than others had done by
travelling and measuring to the ends of it. And Laplace, in contem-
plation of similar mathematical achievements, says: “ It is wonderful
that an astronomer, without going out of his observatory, should be
able to determine exaetly the size and figure of the earth, and its dis-
tance from the sun and moon, simply,by comparing his observations
with analysis; the knowledge of which formerly demanded long and
laborious voyages into both hemispheres.”

The ancients supposed that light came instantaneously from the
Stars ; a consolation for those who believed that the heavens revolved
around the earth in twenty-four hours. Galileo and the academicians
of Florence obtained eyen negative results,

While the number of physical sciences has received numerous addi-
tions during the last half-century, new affiliations and a more intimate
correlation have been manifested. In this mutual helpfulness light has
played an important part. The optical method of studying sound, and
the many varieties of flame apparatus, have made acoustics as intelli-
gible through the eye as through the ear.

Velocity being expressed by space divided by time, it is evident that
in measuring au immense velocity we must have at our command an
enormous distance, such as we find only in astronomy, or else possess
the means of measuring fractions of time as small as one-millionth of
asecond. The first successful attempt to measure such a velocity was
made by Wheatstone in 1834. Discharges from a Leyden jar were sent
through a wire, having two breaks in it one-fourth of a mile apart. The
wire was in the form of a loop, so as to bring the breaks into the same
vertical line. The sparks seen at these breaks were reflected by a mir-
ror at the distance of 10 feet, and revolving eight hundred times per
second. The images of the two sparks were relatively displaced in a
horizontal direction. As the displacement did not exceed one-half of
an inch, the time taken by electricity to go from one break to the other
was less thin a millionth of asecond. Since the distance was one-
quarter of a mile, the electricity travelled in that case at the rate of
288,000 miles a second. If this experiment is interpreted to mean that
electricity would go over 288,000 miles of similar wire in one second, as
it probably often was at that time, the conclusion is fallacious. The
velocity of electricity, unlike that of sound or light, diminishes when
the length of wire increases.

In 1838, Wheatstone suggested a method for measuring the velocity
of light, which he thought was adequate for giving not only the abso-
lute velocity but the difference of velocity in different media.

In that year Arago communicated to the French Academy the details
of an experiment which he thought would give the velocity of light in
air or avacuum. As his own health was broken down (he died in 1853)
he appealed to two young French physicists to undertake the experi-
ment. On July 23, 1849, Fizeau, by a method wholly his own, made a
successful experiment. <A disk cut at its circumference into 720 teeth and
intervals, and made by Breguet, was rapidly rotated by a train of wheels
and weights. A concentrated beam of light was sent out through one
of the intervals between two teeth of the disk, which was mounted in a
house in Suresne, near Paris, and was sent back by a mirror placed on
Montmartre, at a distance of about 5 miles. The light, on its return,
was cut off from the eye or entered it, according as it encountered a
tooth or an interval of the disk. If the disk turned 12.6 times in asee-
ond the light encountered the tooth adjacent to the interval through
which the light went out. With twice as many rotations in the disk
the light could enter the eye through the adjacent interval. With
three times the original velocity, it was cut off by the next tooth but
452 MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT.

one, and soon. From the number of teeth and the number of rotations
in a second the time taken by the light in going and returning was
easily calculated. In this way the velocity of light was found to be
195,741 miles per second. In 1856, the Institute of France awarded to
Fizeau the Imperial prize of 30,000 franes in recognition of this capital
experiment.

In 1862, Foucault succeeded in measuring the velocity of light by a
wholly different method, all parts of the apparatus for it being embraced
within the limits of his laboratory. The light emanated from a fine
reticule, ruled on glass and strongly illuminated. by the sun. It then
felt upon a plane mirror revolving four hundred times a second, by
which it was reflected successively to five other mirrors, the last of
which was plane, and returned it back by the same path to the revolv-
ing mirror and reticule. The total distance traveled was only about
66 feet. As the revolving mirror had moved while the light was mak-
ing this short journey, the image of the reticule was displaced in refer-
ence to the reticule itself; and this displacement was the subject of
measurement. Although the time involved was only about one fifteen-
millionth of a second, this brief interval was translated by the method
of the experiment into a measurable space, and gave 185,177 miles per
second for the velocity of light, differing from the best results of astro-
nomical methods by only 1,243 miles. Foucault was prompted to this
experiment by Leverrier, director of the observatory. Arago was the
first to propose the experiment. To obtain greater accuracy he placed
the moving mirror in a vacuum, but without any advantage. He said,
‘Le mieux est Vennemi du bien.” His modest claim was that he had
suggested to Foucault the problem and indieated certain means of re-
solving it. Babinet thought that the experiment admitted of ten times
greater accuracy. With three times only it might correct Struve’s
value of aberration.

In 1873, Cornu, another French physicist, repeated the experiments
of Fizeau with a toothed wheel, the work extending over three years.
The observer was stationed atthe Ecole Polytechnique. The reflecting
mirror and collimating telescope were placed on Mont Valerian, at a
distance of about 33,816 feet. Three different wheels were tried, hav-
ing 104, 116, and 140 teeth respectively, and rotating between seven and
eight hundred times a second, the velocity being registered by electric-
ity. Cornu used at times all the eclipses from the first to the seventh
order. Calcium and petroleum light were tried, as well as sunlight. A
chronograph with three pens recorded automatically seconds, the rota-
tions of the toothed wheel, and the time of the eclipse. More than a
thousand experiments were made, six hundred of which were reduced.
The velocity of light as published by Cornu in 1873, was 185,425.6 miles
per second. The probable error was 1 per cent. In 1874, Cornu gave
the result of a new set of experiments made by him in conjunction with
Fizeau over a distance of more than 14 miles between the Observatory

MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT. 453

and Montlhéry. The experiments were repeated more than five nundred
times, mostly at night with the limelight. The light was sent through
a 12 inch telescope and returned through a 7-inch telescope. The
toothed wheel which produced the eclipse was capable of rotating six-
teen hundred times a second. From these experiments the velocity of
light was placed at 186,618 miles. The probable error did not exceed
187 miles. The time was recorded accurately within a thousandth of a
second.

I come now to that which most interests us to-night, viz, the part
taken in this country for the measurement of these great velocities.
About 1854, Dr. Bache, chief of the U.S. Coast Survey, appropriated
$1,000 for the construc tion of apparatus to be used in repeating Wheat-
stone’s experiment on the velocity of electricity. But those who were
€xpected to take part in the investigation were called to other duties,
and the money was never drawn.

In 1867, Professor Newcomb recommended a repetition of Foucault's
experiment, in the interest of astronomy, to confirm or correct the re-
ceived value of the solar parallax. In August, 1879, Mr. Albert A-
Michelson, then a master in the United States Navy, presented a paper
to the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, on the measurement of the velocity of light. This paper at-
tracted great attention. Mr. Michelson adopted Foucault’s method with
important modifications. In Foucault’s experiment the deflection of
the light produced by the revolving mirror was too small for the most
accurate measurement. Mr. Michelson placed the revolving mirror 500
feet from the slit (which was ten times the distance in Foucault’s experi-
ment) and obtained a deflection twenty times as great, although the mir
ror made only one hundred and twenty-eight turns in a second. With
apparatus comparatively crude, he obtained for the velocity of light
186,500, with a probable error of 300 miles. This preliminary experi-
ment, made in the laboratory of the Naval Academy in May, 1878, in-
dicated the directions in which improvements must be made in order
to insure greater accuracy. The distance from the slit to the revolving
mirror must be increased, the mirror must revolve at least two hun-
dred and fifty times a second, and the lens for economizing the light
must have a large surface and a focal length of about 150 feet. With
the aid of $2,000 from a private source Mr. Michelson was able to carry
out his ideas on a liberal scale.

His new experiments were made in the summer of 1879. The revolv-
ing mirror, made by Alvan Clark & Sons, was moved by a turbine wheel.
Its rapidity of revolution was measured by optical comparison with an
electric fork which made about one hundred and twenty-eight vibrations
a second, the precise value being accurately measured by reference to
one of Konig’s standard forks. The velocity generally given to the
mirror was about two hundred and fifty-six turns a second. The dis-
tance between the revolving and the fixed mirror was 1,986.26 feet.
454 MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT.

The light from the moving mirror was concentrated on the fixed mir-
ror by a lens 8 inches in diameter, with a focal length of 150 feet. These
improvements on Foucault’s arrangement were so advantageous that
Mr. Michelson obtained, even with a smaller speed in the revolving
mirror, an angle of separation between the outgoing and returning rays
of light so great that the inclined plate of glass in front of the microm-
eter was not necessary; the head of the observer not shutting off the
light. The mean result of one hundred observations taken on eighteen
different days made the velocity of light 186,313 miles per second, with
a probable error of 30 miles.

In 1882, at the request of Professor Neweomb, Mr. Michelson made a re-
determination of the velocity of light at the Case Institute, in Cleveland,
Ohio, by the method already described, with some modifications. The
space traversed by the light in going and returning between the two
mirrors was 4,099 feet. Twoslight errors in the reduction of his former
work were corrected in this. The velocity deduced from five hundred
and sixty-three new observations was 186,278 miles, with a probable
error of 37 miles.

In March, 1879, Congress had voted an appropriation of $5,000 for
experiments on the velocity of light, to be made under the direction of
Professor Newcomb. All the delicacy of instrumental construction, all
the skill of scientific observation, and all the resources of mathematical
discussion were enlisted in this service. The method adopted was that
of the revolving mirror. The movable mirror was mounted at Fort
Myer. Two different locations were selected for the fixed mirror, viz,
the Naval Observatory and the Washington Monument. In one case
the distance was 2,550.95 meters, or about 8,367.12 feet; in the second
case, 3,721 meters, or about 12,205.57 feet. Mr. Michelson assisted in
the observations until his removal to Cleveland, in the autumn of 1880.
The observations began in the summer of 1880, and were continued into
the autumn of 1882, the most favorable days in spring, summer, and
autumn, being selected. In all five hundred and four sets of measure-
ments were made, viz, two hundred and seventy-six by Professor New-
comb, one hundred and forty by Professor Michelson, and eighty-eight
by Mr. Holeombe. After a full discussion of all the observations and
the possible sources of error, Professor Neweomb decided to rest the
final result on the one hundred and thirty-two sets of observations made
in 1882 over the long distance between Fort Myer and the Washington
Monument. The velocity then obtained was 186,282 miles. The ve-
locity deduced from the three sets of observations was 186,251 miles.
The probable error of the first result was about 19 miles.

For some future attack upon this problem Professor Neweomb sug-
gested a prism for the reflector with a pentagonal section, and placed
at such a distance that it could revolve through an are of 36° while the
light was going and returning; five hundred turns a second and a dis-
tance of 19 miles would fulfill this condition. In the Rocky Mountains,

———-
MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT. 455

or the Sierra Nevada, stations from 20 to 30 miles distant could be
found, and with no greater loss of light from absorption than is pro-
duced by 2 or 3 miles of common air.

The first experiments made in Great Britain for the measurement of
the velocity of light were published by James Young and Prof. G.
Forbes in the Philosophical Transactions of 1882. They adopted the
method of Fizeau. In 1878, between six and seven hundred observa-
tions were made; but the number of teeth in the rotating wheel was
insufficient. New experiments were made in 188081 across the river
Clyde. Two reflectors were used at unequal distances, and -the time
was noted when an electric light after the two reflections was at its
maximum. The corrected distances for the two mirrors were 18,212.2
and 16,835 feet. After an elaborate mathematical discussion of the
theory of this method, the velocity cf light was placed at 187,221 miles.
This value exceeded those obtained by Cornu or Michelson; but this
might be explained by the color of the light used in the different ex-
periments. Mr. Young and Professor Forbes made some experiments
with lights of different colors, in confirmation of this view. But Profes-
sor Michelson compared his three hundred and eighteen observations
with sunlight and two hundred and sixty-seven observations with
electric light, and found that the difference was in the opposite direc-
tion; and in a differential experiment, when half the slit was covered
with red glass, he found no displacement. Young and Forbes were
attracted to their experiments on the velocity of light by Maxwell’s
speculations on the electro-magnetic theory of light, and also as promis-
ing the most accurate method of obtaining the parallax and distance of
the sun. Their velocity of light combined with Struve’s constant of
aberration made the sun’s parallax 20.445, and its distance 93,223,000
miles.

When Arago, in 1838, suggested to the French Academy an experi-
ment on the velocity of light, and explained his method of making it,
which was essentially the one afterwards adopted by Foucault, he had
in view the settlement of the long controversy between the advocates
of the corpuscular and undulatory theories. Almost all of the different
classes of phenomena in geometrical optics can be explained by either
one of these theories, though even here the undulatory has the advan-
tage of greater simplicity. But in one respect the two theories are an-
tagonistic. According to the corpuscular theory, light should move
faster in glass or water than in air, forexample. The undulatory theory
reversed this proposition. Here was an experimentum crucis. In 1850,
Fizeau and Foucault made the experiment, each in his own way, and in
both experiments the result was in favor of the theory of undulations.
It has been shown that in the case of air alone lengths of many thou-
sand feet are practicable. But the absorbing power of water prevents
the use of greater lengths than about 10 feet. Light would pass through
10 feet of air in less time than one eighteen-thousandth of a second;
AD6 MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT.

and the difference of time for air and water would be only a fraction of
that small fraction. Hence the exceeding delicacy of the experiment.

In 1883, Mr. Michelson, at the request of Professor Newcomb, re-
peated Foucault’s experiments for finding the difference of velocity of
light in air and water. Foucault did not aspire to quantitative precis-
ion in his results. The experiments of Michelson proved that the ratio
of the velocities was inversely as the indices of refraction. The velocity
with sunlight was a little greater than with the electric light; which
opposes the conclusion of Young and Forbes. When Mr. Michelson
covered half of the slit with red glass, the two halves of the image were
exactly in line. Experiments were also made on the velocity of light
in carbon disulphide, which led to the inference that its index of refrac-
tion was 1.77, and that orange-red light traveled from one to two per
cent. faster than greenish blue Hight. Mr. Michelson was enabled to
make this investigation by a grant from the trustees of the Bache Fund.

Various other methods of measuring the velocity of light have been
proposed. About 1850, Laborde suggested, in a letter to Arago, a me-
chanical method of measuring the velocity of light. He supposes two
disks, with many holes at the outside, connected by a very long axis
and rotating rapidly. The light which was sent out through a hole in
one wheel would be transmitted or arrested by the second wheel, behind
which an observer was stationed. The distance between the wheels,
the time of rotation, and the order of the eclipse, would be sufficient for
calculating the velocity of light. Laborde imagined an enormous axis
more than 200,000 miles long. Moigno recommended the substitution
of a mirror for the observer and the second. wheel, which would double
the distance travelled by the light. A distance of 1,640 feet, a disk 25
feet in radius, with 1,000 holes, and turning 360 times a second, would
be more than sufficient to surprise the reflected ray and stop it.

In 1874, Burgue suggested a new way of finding the velocity of light
by experiment. Ifa white disk, with a black radius, is rotated rapidly,
and at each turn is illuminated by an instantaneous flash, this radius
will appear immovable. If this flash is reflected on the disk from a
distant mirror, the black radius will be displaced. No details of the
arrangement of apparatus and no experiments were published.

In 1885, Wolf proposed the following arrangements: Two mirrors
were placed 5 meters apart and facing each other. The radius of curv-
ature of each mirror was 5 meters. The first mirror was 0.20 of a meter
in diameter; the other, 0.05 meter, revolved rapidly (two hundred turns
a second). A slit was made in the center of the large mirror through
which light was sent to the small mirror, forming an image on the sur-
face of the large mirror; this image became an object for the small
mirror, forming another image on the larger mirror, at a distance from
the first mirror depending on the velocity of rotation. These images
coula be sent out laterally by an inclined plate of thin glass, and their
distance measured by a micrometer. Wolf expected advantages from

=e

the proximity of the two mirrors which would more than balance those
of the long distances used by Foucault and Michelson.

The greatest difficulty which the undulatory theory of light has en-
countered is found in the attempted reconciliation between the require-
ments of the refraction of light and the aberration of light. To explain
refraction, the density of the luminiferous cether must be greater when
the index of refraction is greater. If a body moves, it must carry its
inclosed iether with it, as its refractive power does not change. On the
other hand, to explain the aberration of light, it must be supposed that
the «ther in the telescope does not move with the telescope; that the
wether sifts through the telescope, the wether in front taking the place of
the ether left behind; or, as Young expressed it, that the «ther flows
through the air and solid earth as easily as the wind blows through the
trees of a forest.

The difficulty can be eluded by supposing that a refracting body car-
ries along with it as much of the «ther as it possesses in excess of what
would exist in a vacuum of the same bulk. This, added to what is al-
ways sifting through it, would maintain its «ether at a constant density.
What this fraction is which must travel with the body was calculated
by Fresnel. But while the refracting power has been protected, how
is it with aberration? That would be increased to a small extent. But
as the aberration is very small, only about 2038” at its maximum, the
required change in its value might be masked by ordinary errors of ob-
servation. Boscovich suggested to Lalande, in 1766, that a telescope
filled with water instead of air would test the theory; but he made no
experiment. Wilson, of Glasgow, also proposed a water telescope in
1782. In the course of time it appeared that not only was the effect of
the earth’s motion on refraction and aberration under trial, but also the
solar parallax, the motion of the solar system, and that of other stars.

The case is clearly stated by Lodge in this way: Sound travels quicker
with the wind than against it. Is it the same with light? Does light
travel quicker with the wind? Well, that depends altogether on whether
the ether is blowing along as wellas the air. If itis, then its motion must
help the light on a little; but if the «ther is at rest, no motion of the
air, or of matter of any kind, can make any difference. According to
Fresnel, the free «ther is at rest, the bound is in motion. Therefore
the speed of light will be changed by the motion of the medium; but
only by a fraction, depending on its index of refraction,—infinitesimal
for air, but sensible for water.

At an early day Arago investigated the effeet which a change in the
velocity of light would produce on aberration and refraction. He saw
that a change of 5 per cent. in the velocity of light would alter the aber-
ration by only one second, whereas the refraction in a prism of 45° would
be affected to the extent of two minutes. He observed the zenith dis-
tances of stars with and without the prism; and also the deviation of
stars which passed the meridian at 6 A.M. and6Pp.M. The observa-
458 MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT.

tions were made with a mural circle and a repeating circle. Arago ex-
pected to find a difference of ten or fifteen seconds, but found none. He
thought that a difference no greater than one ten-thousandth would
have been manifested by his observations had it existed. Arago at-
tempted to explain his negative results by assumptions based upon the
corpuscular theory of light. But Lloyd thought that the change in the
length of the wave would balance the change in the direction of the ray.
Arago’s observations were communicated to the Institute on December
10, 1816, and excited great interest. They were quoted by Laplace and
Biot. But the manuscript was mislaid and not found until 1853, when
it was published. Mascart thinks that this experiment of Arago owes
its reputation to Fresnel’s explanation of it by his fraction.

In regard to the wave-motion involved in the transmission of light,
Maxwell says: ‘ It may be a displacement, or a rotation, or an electri-
cal disturbance, or indeed any physical quantity which is capable o
assuming negative as well as positive values. But the ether is loosely
connected with the particles of gross matter; otherwise they would
reflect more light.” Then he asks the question, “ Does the ether pass
through bodies as water through the meshes of a net which is towed by
a boat?” Itis difficult to obtain the relative motion of the earth and
cether by experiment, as the light must move forward and then back
again. One way is to compare the velocities of light obtained from the
eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites when Jupiter is in opposite points of the
ecliptic. Cornu referred, in 1883, to the difficulty of observing these
eclipses, especially when Jupiter is in conjunction with the sun. On
account of this difficulty observations have been neglected for the last
fifty years. Observations must be made near quadratures. Cornu sug-
gests a proper arrangement for this purpose.

At various times between 1864 and 1868, Maxwell repeated Arago’s
experiment in a more perfect form. A spectroscope was used, having
three prisms of 60° each. A plane miror was substituted for the slit of
the collimator. The cross-wires of the observing telescope were illumi-
nated by light reflected bya plate of thin glass placed at an angle of 45°.
Light went to the mirror and was sent back to the wires from which it
started after passing through six prisms. The experiment was tried
when the light started in the direction of the earth’s motion, and when
in the opposite ; also, at different seasons of the year. In all cases the
image of the wires coalesced with the wires.

Lodge states the case clearly thus: ‘If all the eether were free there
would have been a displacement of the image of the wires. If all the
wether were bound to the glass there would have been a difference on
the other side. But, according to Fresnel’s ry pothesis there should be
no difference either way. According to his hypothesis, the free «ther,
which is the portion in relative motion, has nothing to do with the re-
fraction. It is the addition of the bound ether which causes the refrac-
tion, and this part is stationary relatively to the glass, and is not stream-
See

MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT. 459

ing through it at all. Henee the refraction is the same whether the
prism be at rest orin motion throngh space.” Maxwell is more guarded
in his own statement of the case. He says: ‘* We can not conelude
certainly that the «ther moves with the earth, for Stokes has shown
from Fresnel’s hypothesis that the relative velocities of the ether inthe
prism and that outside are inversely as the square of the index of re-
fraction, and the deviation in this case would not be sensibly altered,
the velocity of the earth being only one ten-thousandth of the velceity
of light.”

In 1879, Maxwell wrote to Prof. D. P. Todd, then at the Nautical
Almanae Office in Washington, asking him if he had observed an appar-
ent retardation of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites depending on the
geocentric position of the planet. Such observations, he thought, would
furnish the only method he knew of finding the direction and velocity
of the sun’s motion throngh the surrounding medium. In terrestrial
methods of measuring the velocity of light, it returns on its path, and
the velocity of the earth in relation to the «ether would alter the whole
time of passage by a quantity depending on the square of the ratio of

the velocities of the earth and light, and this is quite too small to be
' observed.

In 1839, Babinet made a very delicate experiment on the relation of
the luminiferous zether to the motion of the earth. He found that when
two pieces of glass of equal thickness were placed across two beams of
light which interfered so as to produce fringes, one of them moving in
the direction of the earth’s motion and the other contrary to it, the
fringes were not displaced. The experiment was made three times by
Babinet, with new apparatus each time. He concludes that here is a
new condition to be fulfilled by all theories in regard to the propaga-
tion of light in refracting media. According to all the theories admit-
ted or proposed, the displacement of the fringes should have been equal
to many lengths of a fringe—thatis, many millimeters—while by obser-
vation it was nothing. Stokes has calculated the result according to
Fresnel’s theory, or his own modification of it, and found that the retar-
dation expressed in time was the same as if the earth were at rest.
Fizeau has pointed out a compensation in the effect of Babinet’s exper-
iment. Hesays: “ When two rays have a certain difference of march,
this difference is altered by the reflection from the turning mirror.” By
calculating the two effects in Babinet’s experiment, Fizeau finds that
they have sensibly equal values, and of opposite sign.

In 1860, Angstrém communicated to the Royal Society of Upsala a
method of determining the motion of the solar system by observations
on the bands of interference produced by a glass grating. In 1863, he
publisbed the results which he had obtained. After allowing for Bab-
inet’s correction on account of the motion of the grating, Angstrom
finds that a difference in the direction of the observing telescope with
reference to the earth’s motion might produce a displacement of the
460 MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT.

fringes amounting to 49.8. Selecting the line D in the fourth spee-
trum, he thought that the influence of the earth’s annual motion was
verified, but that of the motion of the solar system was less decided.
The observations were more consistent with the assumption that the
solar system moved with a velocity equal to one-third of that in its
orbit, than with an equal velocity, or none at all. In 186263, Babinet
presented to the Academy of Paris a paper on the influence of the mo-
tion of the earth on the phenomena produced by gratings, which depend
not on reflection, refraction, or diffraction, but on interference. His
principal object was a study of the motion of the solar system. He
calculated the effects to be expected, but published no observations.
In 1867, Van der Willigen measured the length of waves of light by
means of a grating. When a slit was used, no effect was produced by
the motion of the earth, the slit partaking of that motion. With astar,
a movement of the earth in the direction of the light had an effect.
This is the theoretical result, and agrees with Babinet’s experiment,
but is not applicable to solar light when reflected by a mirror. That
behaves as light from a terrestrial source. In 1873, he rejects the
proposition that the refraction of light is modified by the motion of its
source or of the prism. In 1874, he seems to doubt the reality of the
effect produced on diffraction.

In 1867, Klinkerfues used a transit instrument having a focal length
of 18 inches. In the tube was a column of water 8 inches long, and a
prism. He observed transits of the sun and of certain stars whose
north polar distance was equal to the sun’s, and which passed the
meridian at midnight. The difference of right ascension is affected by
double the coefficient of aberration. He computed that the column of
water and the prism would increase the aberration by 8”. The amount
observed was 7.1. In 1868~69, Hoek of Amsterdam discussed the in-
fluence of the earth’s motion on aberration. Delambre had caleulated
from the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites that light must take 493s.2 in
coming from the sun. Hence the aberration must be 20.255. Struve’s
observed aberration made the time 497°.8. Hoek decided in favor of
Struve; but he thought that it was desirable that a new set of obser-
vations should be made on the eclipses. Klinkerfues espoused the side
of Delambre. Hoek said that,if the earth’s motion was taken into
account, according to Fresnel’s fraction, different results would be
harmonized. In 1868, he made experiments on a divided beam of light,
the two parts going in opposite directions through tubes filled with
water. There was no interference attributable to the effect of the
earth’s motion. As to any influence to be expected from the motion of
the solar system, he thinks that motion must be insignificant compared
with the initial motion of the comets, and with the cometary orbits,
which are parabolas with few hyperbolas.

In 1872, and on several previous occasions, one of the grand prizes
of the Academy of Paris was offered for an investigation of the effeet

produced by the motion of the luminary or of the observer. This
prize, consisting of a gold medal or 3,000 franes, was awarded in 1874
to Maseart. He maintained that in Arago’s experiment the change in
refraction produced by the fraction of the earth’s motion was compen-
sated by the displacement of the observing telescope. Mascart re-
peated Babinet’s experiment with gratings, where the effects of the
motion of the telescope and of the grating would be additive, and found
the sum small compared with Babinet’s calculation. He thinks that
the change in the length of the wave caused by the motion is compen-
sated by the displacement of the measuring apparatus. Ile concludes
that reflection, diffraction, double refraction, and circular polarization
are powerless tp show the motion of the earth, ny ‘rv with solar light
or that from a terrestrial source.

In 1871, Airy used a vertical telescope, and measured the meridional
zenith distance of y Draconis, the star by which Bradley discovered
aberration. It is about 100” north of the zenith. The tube of the
telescope, which was 35.3 inches long, was filled with water. The days
of observation included the seasons of the equinoxes, when the star is
most affected in opposite directions by aberration. The observations
were repeated in the spring and autumn of 1872. No increase was
produced in the aberration by the water in the telescope.

In 1873, Ketteler, in the preface to the “ Laws of the Aberration of
Light,” enumerates thirty-nine persons who have investigated the effect
of motion on the phenomena of sound and light. From his own analy-
sis he concludes: (1) that a motion of the prism and telescope perpen-
dicular to the direction of a star produces no effect on the refraction; (2)
that when the motion is in the direction of the star, the velocity of the
light is changed according to I'resnel’s fraction of that motion; and (3)
that for any intermediate direction it is changed to the extent of that
fractional part of the motion multiplied by the cosine of the angle be-
tween the direction of the motion and the direction of the star.

In 1859, Fizeau proposed an experiment for ascertaining if the azi-
muth of the plane of polarization of a refracted ray is influenced by the
motion of the refracting medium. Whenaray of polarized light passes
through an inclined plate of glass, the plane of polarization is changed,
according to certain laws investigated by Malus, Biot, and Brewster.
The degree of change depends upon the inclination of the ray, the
azimuth of the plane of primitive polarization, and the index of refrac-
tion of the glass. The incidence and azimuth being constant, this rota-
tion of the plane of polarization increases with the index of refraction.
This index being inversely as the velocity of light, the rotation is
smaller the greater this velocity. Fizeau used two bundles of glass,
four plates in each, and slightly prismatic, inclined to one another.
One bundle was made of common glass; the other of flint glass. The
angle of incidence for the ray was 58° 49’,. When the azimuth of the
primitive plane of polarization was 20°, the rotation of the plane of
462 MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT.

polarization was 18° 40/ and 24° 58’ for the two bundles. By Fresnel’s
hypothesis the change in the velocity of light from the motion of the

medium is + (= ye The greatest available velocity for the medium
ee

is that of the earth in its orbit, viz, 101,708 feet per second (31,000
meters). At the time of the solstices this motion is horizontal, and from
east to west at noon. If the incident light comes from the west, the
velocity of light is diminished by Fresnel’s fraction of the velocity of
the earth. If the light comes from the east, its velocity is increased by

the same amount. The change in the index of refraction (ore ) is

1 { A
stag: Measure-

equal to "eV; this for an index of 1.513 amounts to;
ments show that in glass, the index increasing by a certain fraction,
the rotation increases by a fraction four and one-half times green and
the consequent change in the plane of polarization would be 5,45. The
total change on reversing the direction from which the light came would
be z5:5-. If the incidence is 70°, and allowance is made for the change
of direction inside of the glass, the fraction becomes ;.55. Whenaray
of light falls on a single plate of glass at an angle of 70°, if its plane of
prinitive polarization makes an angle of 20° with the plane of refrac-
tion, this plane is changed by 6° 40’. This multiplied by ;5, gives
sixteen seconds for the probable effect of the earth’s motion. With
forty such plates the effect would be increased to ten and two-third
minutes. Two mirrors were used, one to the east and the other to the
west, and light could be sent by a heliostat upon either one. The ap-.
paratus was easily turned through 180° so as to receive successively
the light which travelled with or against the earth’s motion.

With a single pile of plates highly inclined and a second pile less
inclined, of more highly tempered giass and in the opposite azimuth, a
rotation of 50° could be produced, while the tendencies to elliptical
polarization were exactly balanced. The motion of the earth could
modify this result to the extent of only two minutes; which is too small
for accurate observation. Fizeau then resorted to a device already in-
dicated by Botzenhart for amplifying this effect. A small variation in
the primitive plane of polarization produces a greater effect the smaller
the azimuth of this plane. If the original azimuth is only 5°, a small
change in the azimuth trebles the value of the rotation. A large rota-
tion is first produced on a ray whose azimuth is large, and then this
rotation is largely changed by another pile so placed that the ray enters
it under a small azimuth. More than two thousand measurements were
made under various conditions. Tor noon observations at the time of
solstice the rotation was always greater when the light came from the
west, and was less at other times of day. The excess in the value of
the rotation when the light came from the west varied between 30/ and

150’, according to the different ways in which the piles of plates were
MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT. 463

combined. The difference in the values of the rotation according as
the light came from the west or east was consistent with a change in
the index of refraction corresponding to Fresnel’s hypothesis. Fizeau
indicated his intention of renewing the research with improved appa-
ratus, but no further publication on the subject by him can be found.

Faye has criticised this investigation of Fizeau, on the ground that
he has taken no account of the motion of the solar system towards the
constellation Hercules. This motion, recognized by astronomers on
substantial evidence, amounts to 25,889 feet per secoid (7,894 meters)
at its maximum. Its influence is almost zero at noon of the solstices.
But it increases after noonday. Faye examines Fizeaws observations
at 4p. ™M., and finds discrepancies of 12/ or 15’ between the results of
theory and observation. By neglecting the term which corresponds to
the motion of the solar system, Fizeau’s observations accord better at
all hours of the day. Must the inference be, Faye asks, that the solar
system does not move? Tessan, in reply to Faye, says that the sun,
from which Fizeau derived the light used in his experiments, moves
with the rest of the solar system; and that therefore Fizeau was justi-
fied in neglecting the term which expresses this motion, as of no effect on
his caleulations. Fizeau’s theory depends only on the relative velocity
between the source of light and the body which receives it; that is, the
velocity of revolution and rotation of the earth.

In 1881, Professor Michelson published the results of his investigation
on this delicate problem. He first calculates the probable difference of
time taken by the light in going and returning over a given distance,
according as that distance lies in the direction of the earth’s motion or
at right angles to it. Ifthe distance were 1,200 millimeters, the differ-
ence of time translated into space would be equal to one-twenty-fifth of
a wave-length of yellow light. The apparatus was ingeniously devised
so as to bring about fringes of interference between the two rays which
have travelled on rectangular paths. The whole apparatus was then
turned round bodily through 90°, so as to exchange the conditions of
the two interfering rays. Special apparatus was made for this experi-
ment by Schmidt and Haensch of Berlin, and was mounted on a stone
pier at the Physical Institute of Berlin. It wasso sensitive to aceident-
al vibrations that it could not be used in the day-time, nor indeed earlier
than midnight. To secure greater stability the apparatus was moved
to the Astrophysikalisches Observatorium in Potsdam, in charge of Pro-
fessor Vogel. But even here the stone piers did not give sufficient pro-
tection against vibration. The apparatus was then placed in the cellar,
the walls of which formed the foundation for an equatorial. But stamp-
ing with the feet, though at a distance of 100 meters, made the fringes
disappear.

The experiments were made in April, 1881. At this time of the year, the
earth’s motion in its orbit coincides roughly with the motion of the solar
system, viz, towards the constellation Hercules, This direction is in-

clined about 26° to the plane of the earth’s equator, and a tangent to
the earth’s motion in its orbit makes an angle of 235° with the plane
of the equator. The resultant would be within 25° from the equator.
The nearer the components are in magnitude, the more nearly would
the resultant coincide with the equator. I=Zf the apparatus is placed so
that the arms point north and east at noon, the eastern arm would coin-
cide with the resultant motion of the earth, and the northern arm would.
be at aright angle to it. The displacement produced by revolving the
whole through 90° should amount to one-twenty-fifth of the interval be-
tween two fringes. If the proper motion of the solar system is small
compared with the velocity of the earth in its orbit, the displacement
would be less. Mr. Michelson drew from these experiments the conelu-
sion that there was not a sufficient displacement of the fringes to support
the theory of aberration, which supposes the wether to move with a cer-
tain fraction of the earth’s velocity. The displacement however was
so small that it easily might have been masked by errors of experiment.
Mr. A. Graham Bell supplied Mr. Michelson with the money required
for this investigation,

In 1886, Mr. Michelson and Mr. Morley published a paper on the in-
fluence of the motion of the medium traversed by the light on its ve-
locity. Fizeau had made similar experiments. In both cases the in-
terfering rays were changed in velocity in opposite ways by flowing air
or water through which they were transmitted. With air having a ve-
locity of about 52 feet (25 meters) a second, the effect was so small that
it might easily be covered up by errors of experiment; but with water
it was measurable, and the result corresponded with the assumption of
Fresnel, that the «ther in a moving body is stationary, except the por-
tions which are condensed around its particles. In this sense, it may
be said that the «ther is not affeeted by the motion of the medium which
it permeates. For this investigation, which was made possible by a
grant from the Bache Fund of the National Academy, Mr. Michelson
and Mr. Morley devised a new instrument, called the refractometer.
Cornu writes of Michelson’s experiments on moving media: “ Leur tra-
vail congu dans Vesprit le plus élevé éxecuté avec ces puissant moyens
Waction que les savants des Etats-Unis aimant a déployer dans les
grandes questions scientifiques fait le plus grand honneur a leurs au-
teurs.”

In 1887, Professor Michelson published another investigation of the
question whether the motion of the earth in its orbit carried its «ether
with it. In his previous experiment his apparatus was sensitive to the
smallest jars, and it was difficult to revolve it without producing distor-
tion of the fringes, and an effect amounting to only one-twentieth of
the distance between the fringes might easily be hidden by accidental
errors of experiment, Inthe new experiment the apparatus was placed
on a massive rock, which rested on a wooden base, which floated upon
mercury, The stone was 1.5 meters square and 0.3 of a meter thick,

At each corner four mirrors were placed, by reflection from which the
length of path traversed by the light was increased to ten times its
former value. The width of the fringes of interference, which were
the subject of observation, measured from forty to sixty divisions of
the observing micrometer. The light came from an Argand burner sent
through a lens. Tv prevent jars from stopping and starting, the float
was kept constantly in slow circulation, revolving once in six minutes.
Sixteen equidistant marks were made on the stationary frame-work
within which the foat moved. Observations were taken on the fringes
whenever any one of these marks came in the range of the micrometer.
The observations were made near noon and at 6 P.M. The noon and
evening observations were plotted on separate curves. One division
of the micrometer measured one. fiftieth of a wave-length. Mr. Michel-
son was confident that there was no displacement of the fringes exceed-
ing one-hundredth of a wave length. Itshould have been from twenty
to forty times greater than this. Mr. Michelson concludes that this
result is in opposition to Fresnel’s theory of aberration.

As late as 1872, Le Verrier thought that a new measurement of the
velocity of light by Fizeau very important in the interest of astronomy ;
and in 1871, Cornu wrote that the parallax of the sun, and hence the
size of the earth’s orbit, were not yet known with the desirable precis-
ion. In 1875, Villarceau made a communication to the Paris Academy
on the theory of aberration. He says that the parallax of the sun by
astronomical measurement is 8.86. Foucault’s velocity of light com-
bined with Struve’s aberration makes the sun’s parallax $7.86. Cornu’s
velocity of light gives the same result only when it is combined with
Bradley’s aberration, which differs from that of Struve by 0/.20. Vil-
larcean thinks that there is an uncertainty about the value of aberra-
tion on account of the motion of the solar system. In 1883, M. O. Struve
discussed seven series of observations made by his father, Nyrén, and
others, with various instruments and by different methods, at the Ob-
servatory of Pulkowa. He was certain that the mean result for the
value of aberration was 20.492, with a probable error of less than 7},
of a second. This aberration, conbined with the velocity of light as
deduced from the experiments of Cornu and Michelson, made the paral-
lax of the sun 8.784; differing from the most exact results of the geo-
metric method by only a few hundredths of a second. Villarceau pro-
posed to get the solar motion by aberration; selecting two places on
the earth in latitude 35° 16’ north and south, and after the example of
Struve, observing the zenith distances of stars near the zenith. The
tangents of these latitudes are +- <5 so that they contain the best sta-
tions for obtaining the constant of aberration, and the three components
of the motion of translation of the solar system. In 1887, Ubaghs, a
Belgian astronomer, published his results on the determination of the

direction and velocity of the movement of the solar system through
space. For finding the direction he used the method of Folie. For
calculating the velocity he combined the observations on three groups
of stars, the brightest belonging probably to the solar nebula. The
resulting velocity was only about 10,000,000 miles a year. Homann,
working on the spectroscopic observations at Greenwich, had obtained
a velocity of 527,000,000 of miles. As late as 1887, Fizeau studied the
nature of the phenomena when light was reflected from a mirror mov-
ing with a great velocity, and inferred that aberration was the same in
this case as when the light was taken directly from a star.

The solar parallax, calculated from Cornu’s last experiment on the velocity
of light and Delambre’s equation of light (493’’.2 being the time for pass-

Glasenapp calculated the time taken by the light in travelling the
mean distance of the earth’s orbit as equal to 5008.85 4+ 1.02. This
time combined with Micheison’s velocity of light makes the solar paral-
lax 8.76. Struve’s constant of aberration with Micbelson’s velocity
gives a parallax of 8.81. From Gill’s mean of the nine best modern
determinations of aberration (=20/.496) the parallax comes out equal
to 8.78. If we regard the solar parallax as known, the eclipses give
nearly the same velocity as aberration, though the former is a group-
velocity and the latter a wave-velocity. Gill’s parallax from observations
of Mars (8.78) agrees with Michelson’s velocity of light and the mean
constant of aberration.

In 1877~78, Lord Rayleigh, in his profound treatise on the Theory of
Sound, discussed the distinction between wave-velocity and group-
velocity. In 1881, he recognized the same difference in the case of
luminous waves. In the experiments of Young and Forbes, the wave-
velocity might be nearly three per cent. less than the group-velocity.
With toothed wheels and the revolving mirror, group-velocity was the
subject of observation. Aberration gave wave-velocity; Jupiter’s sat-
ellites, group-velocity; experiment however showed but little differ-
ence. Lord Rayleigh found formule for the relation between these two
kinds of velocity, which involved the wave-length and the idex of re-
fraction, and J. Willard Gibbs has compared them, and other formule
proposed by Schuster and Gouy, with the experimental velocities of
light. Michelson’s experiment on the index of refraction of carbon
disulphide agrees with the assumption that he was dealing with the
group-velocity.

Although there is not a complete accordance between the resuits of

ee ne ee
MICHELSON’S RECENT RESEARCHES ON LIGHT. 467

different methods of investigation, astronomers and physicists will be
slow to abandon the theory of undulations, and take up again the cor-
puscular theory of light. The latter theory has received fatal blows
from which it cannot recover. The undulatory theory, which started
with Huyghens more than two hundred years ago, and was elaborated
by Fresnel sixty years ago, has survived many crises in its history, and
is supported by a wonderful array of experiments. Some of the experi-
ments of Mr. Michelson may require a modification in Fresnel’s inter-
pretation. Stokes and Challis have worked tor many years upon it,
and established it on mathematical principles differing from Fresnel’s
and from each other. Ketteler in his Theoretische Optik, published in
1885, builds upon the Sellmeier hypothesis, that ponderable particles
are excited by the cetberial vibrations and then re act upon them. There
remains Maxwell’s electro-magnetic theory of light, which has been
elaborated by Glazebrook and Fitzgerald, and is supported, to say the
least of it, by remarkable numerical coincidences.

Discrepancies between theory and experiment are always to be wel-
comed, as they contain the germs of future discoveries. We have
learned in astronomy not to be alarmed by them. More than once the
law of gravitation has been put on trial, resulting in a new discovery
or in improved mathematical analysis. We may not: expect in light
such a brilliant discovery as that of the planet Neptune. The luminif-
erous «ther is a mysterious substance, enough of a fluid for the planets
to pass easily through it, but at the same time enough of a solid to adinit
of transverse vibrations. Stokes suggests water with a little glue dis-
solved in it as a coarse representation of what is required of the «ether.

Mr. G. A. Hirn has written recently on the constitution of celestial
space. He decides against the existence of an ali-pervading medium.
He thinks that matter exists in space only in the condition of distinet
bodies, such as stars, planets, satellites, and meteorites. In nebule it
is in a state of extreme diffusion; but elsewhere space is empty. But
how would it be after the correction is applied for the equation of light?
Humboldt said that the light of distant stars reaches us as a voice from
the past. The astronomer is not seeing for the most part contempo-
raneous events. He is reading history; and often ancient history, and
of very different dates. Stellar photography reveals millions of stars
which cannot be seen in the largest telescopes, and new harvests of
these blossoms of heaven (as they have been called) spring up like the
grass in the night. Numbers fail to express their probable distances
and the time taken by their light in coming to the earth. In the
theogony of Hesiod, the brazen anvil took only nine days in falling
from heaven to earth. On the other hand, the reduction of the sun’s
distance by three per cent. not only affects its mass and heat, but it
changes the unit of measure for the universe. Such are the remote
results of any change in the estimated velocity of light,

We may thank Professor Michelson not only for what he has estab-
lished, but also for what he has unsettled. In his various researches,
which I have hastily sketched, but which require diagrams or models
to be clearly understood, he has displayed high intelligence, great ex-
perimental skill and ingenuity, and unflagging perseverance. With a
full appreciation of his work, the Rumford Committee recommended,
and the Academy voted, that the Rumford Premium be awarded to him.

To obtain the greatest result with the least effort, is not this the
whole problem of modern industry, a problem which determines gradu-
ally the development of implements and machines? The engines which
he invents permit man to infinitely multiply the efficiency of his organs,
to extend their fitness, and to relieve them from the demands of exces-
sive efforts; they assist him, free him, more and more from the harsh
servitude of material labor. Confining himself henceforth to oversee-
ing the apparatus which labors for him, in proportion as he fatigues
himself less, he produces more and at much better advantage. There
is no comparison between the fabrication of a thousand needles from a
manufactory, and the work of an artisan who undertakes fashioning
them one by one by his own unaided efforts.

It is a progress of the same order which realizes to-day the detinitive
introduction of photography in astronomical observations: It is to
deliver the astronomer from a labor, thankless, painful, irksome, and
fatal for the eyes. When ten years ago I spoke in this journal of the
great prospects of celestial photography t I dared searcely to hope that
routine and prejudice would be disarmed so speedily. Indeed the
first attempts in astronomical photography go as far back as 1840, and
during nearly half a century frequent attempts, unhappily always iso-
lated, have shown that the difficulties of the problem have not been
insoluble; but on account of tenacious prejudices, a blind adherence to
the past proscribed the paraphernalia of photography from the sanctu-
aries or kept up the traditions of Cassini and of Bradley. It is in
these later years that finally this spontaneous enthusiasm appeared, this
grand movement which has found its expression in the ‘Astro-photo-
graphic Congress,” convened in Paris in the month of April, 1887, and
which promises to begin a work of the highest importance for future
ages, the photographie execution of a general chart of the sky.

470 PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF ASTRONOMY.

ING

This application of photography is however so reasonable, its rdle was
so clearly indicated and so well foreseen, that it seems an equal prog-
ress ought to have been obtained indeed from the first. There was
one problem whose solution was perfectly circumscribed ; it was truly no
more than a question of time and money. The history of photography,
since its origin, is like the logical development of a thought which
is realized in a continuous manner before our eyes. The gropings by
which we discover substances more and more sensitive, or the means of
retaining, of fixing, more and more permanently, the fugitive traces of
phenomena, all these ought to be, most certainly, hastened and matured
more speedily in the fact of having a prize to gain; and here appear
clearlythe conditions always more tyrannical than expense in the scien-
tific enterprises of our epoch.

Chemistry and the mechanical arts have singularly multiplied the re-
sources of astronomers of the close of this century. Is there any occa-
sion to recall the progress accomplished in the manufacture and grind-
ing of optical glass, in the mounting of great telescopes, in silvered mir-
rors, in electric chronographs, in the spectroscope and in spectral analy-
sis, whose entry on the scene, so brilliant and so unexpected, probably
diverted for some time the attention of astronomers from the develop-
ment of photographie processes? Unhappily this instrument, so pow-
erful, this new apparatus which has extended the domain of observa-
tion, is very costly. In order to bring it into service, great efforts of
eloquence are almost always necessary, because the scientific budget,
as is well known, is one whose endowment is generally measured with
the greatest parsimony. It is insuch a situation as this that the assem-
bly of a congress, with its solemn publicity, its persuasive programmes,
and its imperious desires, offers always the best means of overcoming
an opposition which is inspired by an ill-conceived economy.

The congress which held its sessions at the Paris Observatory, two
years since, and which was called by Admiral Mouchez, under the
auspices of the Academy of Sciences, had in view, primarily, the exe-
cution of a chart of the sky. It comprised fifty astronomers, who came
from all parts of the globe, some already familiarized for a long time
with the pratique of celestial photography.

It would be irksome to enumerate here even once, all the attempts
which have been made, since Daguerre, to bring photography into the
service of descriptive astronomy and the astronomy of precision. Re--
calling only that the most difficult part of the problem, the photographie
re-production of stars, had been entered upon with some success in
America by G. P. Bond (soon after the introduction of the collodion
process permitted the shortening of the time of exposure), about 1857,
the photography of stars to the sixth or seventh magnitude had been at-
tained. These trials were repeated some years later in England by

Warren de La Rue, and later in America, with a success continually in-
creasing, by Mr. Rutherfurd and by Mr. B. A. Gould, charged with the
direction of the Cordoba Observatory under the fine sky of the Argen-
tine Republic. Gould began his work in this line about 1875 and sue
ceeded in gathering, in a few years, a collection of more than a thousand
stellar photographs of the highest interest. After having tested, him-
self, the slowness of the wet collodion process, he was able at a later
date to utilize bromide of silver gelatine dry plates, the invention of
which marked a new phase in celestial photography.* It is necessary,
finally, to mention here the attempts in stellar photography of Henry
Draper, of Ainslie Common, and Isaac Roberts, who have studied the
respective advantages of refractors and reflectors with silvered mirrors ;
of Pickering, who has constructed for the Harvard College observatory
at Cambridge, United States of America, a photographic equatorial
specially designed for the rapid execution of celestial charts on a mod-
erate scale; of David Gill, the eminent director of the observatory of
the Cape of Good Hope, who commenced in 1835 a photographic revis-
ion of the southern sky, comprising the stars to the ninth or tenth
magnitudes, similar to the catalogue prepared by Argelander for the
northern sky.

At the Paris Observatory like labors have been also pursued for some
years with most marked success. Paul and Prosper Henry had under.
taken, in 1871, to continue the “ ecliptic chart” commenced by Chacor-
nace who had been able to executeit only inpart. This chart, extremely
useful in searching for small planets, which was to contain all stars to
the thirteenth and fourteenth magnitudes, extended along the ecliptic
in a zone five degrees in breadth. Now at acertain point the Henry
brothers found themselves arrested in this work by the manifest im-
possibility of constructing, by old processes, the sections of the charts
where the swarming of the stars announces the approach of the Milky
Way. It was then that they decided to resort to photography. They
were, says Admiral Mouchez, admirably prepared to conquer these dif-
ficulties. ‘ Foilowing the traditions to-day too much forsaken, of great
astronomers of former times who employed their own hands in the con-
struction of their instruments, they devoted for a long time, in their
modest work-shop of Montrouge, all the moments of liberty which were
left them from their very active service at the Paris observatory, in the
study of the grinding and polishing of optical glass. An extensive ac-

getic will and a persevering labor, which no distraction ever chanced
to trouble, could not fail in assuring for them a well-merited success.
They became, in a few years, the most skillful artists of France, and

strueted, by way of trial, an objective of 0.16™, which gave very good
results, the Henry brothers undertook to execute the optical part of a
definitive apparatus of 0.33™ in aperture, for which Mr. Gautier was to
furnish the mechanical part. The new instrument was mounted at the
observatory in 1885 and has not ceased since then to be in active use.
The sensitiveness of the plates is such that the image of a star of the
first magnitude is obtained in less than a hundredth of a second; that
of a star of the sixth magnitude in a half second; for the tenth magni-
tude the length of exposure is about twenty seconds; for the fifteenth
about thirty-three minutes; for the sixteenth one hour and twenty min-
utes is necessary.* The stars of the sixteenth magnitude! Here we
are already far beyond the limits of visibility for the best telescopes under
the sky of Paris! ‘Says Mouchez, even stars of the seventeenth magni-
tude have been certainly obtained, which without doubt have never
before been seen.” Finally the Paris plates have revealed the exist-
ence of nebule hitherto unknown in the regions which had been often
explored with the aid of the most powerful instruments; such is the
nebula of Maia, in the Pleiades, whose presence has been since di-
rectly verified.

After such success we understand that the director of the observa-
tory has not hesitated in taking the initiative in an international agree-
ment on the subject of the execution of the complete chart of the sky,
by the means of photography. The possibility of this considerable
work being to-day fully demonstrated, he has said to astronomers, we
have assumed, for the science of the future, the trust of going about it
without delay; whatever may be the value of the works in course of
execution in the various observatories, they will never have, for the
astronomers of future ages, an importance comparable with that of this
general inventory which we shall be able to bequeath to them. It is
besides, indispensable for us to concert together and distribute the labor
and conclude upon a plan of work, in order to avoid the waste of force,
the gaps, and the useless repetitions, and the result will be a work
truly homogeneous. In regard to the expense which the enterprise .
will involve, it will be without doubt large enough necessarily, but
very inconsiderable relatively to the importance of the result.

The astro-photographic congress convened in Paris, as we have said,
in the month of April, 1887; sixteen nations were there represented.
At the commencement certain technical questions were settled; the
employment of reflecting telescopes, in spite of the advantages which
they offer in some connections, has been rejected for the execution of
the chart of the sky, and a unanimous vote recommended refracting
telescopes; they will be constructed similar to the photographic tele-

* We take this information from the notice of Admiral Mouchez, which dates from
1587, but these times of exposure are already much shortened by employing more
sensitive plates, such as» the American plates which Pickering uses, and which the
Henrys have tested in their turn.
PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF ASTRONOMY 473

scope of the Paris observatory. In regard to the limit of the magni-
tudes of the stars to be photographed there was some difficulty in com-
ing to an agreement. Taking into consideration the notable difference
in the length of exposure necessary for bright stars and very faint
stars, it was finally decided to make two classes of plates designed for
two different uses.

For the double series of plates devoted to the picture of the sky,
which is to comprise the stars to the fourteenth magnitude, the length
of the exposure will be (in the climate of Paris at least) in the vicinity
of twelve minutes.* For the supplementary series of plates comprising
the stars to the eleventh magnitude only, and which must, on the one
hand, secure an extreme precision in the micrometrical measurement of
the stars of reference, and ou the other hand, furnish the elements for
a catalogue, the length of exposure will be much shorter (about thirty-
five to forty seconds). This catalogue will probably contain one and
one-half million stars,—more than double the number that are cer-
tainly known to-day. In regard to the number of stars which will be
found represented upon the chart properly so called, it may be esti-
mated to be from ten to fifteen millions. The two series of plates which
will serve for constructing the chart will be arranged in such a way
that the image of a star, situated in the corner of one plate of the first
series, will be found as near as possible in the center of a plate of the
second series; it is hoped that this will suffice for eliminating false
stars and remove the inconvenience of unsensitized points which must
exist on the plates.

In adopting for the chart an exposure of thirty minutes, it would be
possible to reach the fifteenth magnitude and obtain a double or triple
number of stars, perhaps thirty or forty millions, and possibly more.
This was what several members of the congress desired, whocould only
with reluctance decide to curtail thus the common work of the astron-
omers of the nineteenth century. Mouchez, notably, has made the re-
mark that the limit to which we are confined is very near that of the
asteroids which are discovered every day ; to obtain appreciable traces
of these small stars, the exposure of twelve minutes runs the risk of
being insufficient. Those who have combated the extension of the sur-
vey beyond the fourteenth magnitude have pleaded, in the first place,
the length of time which the completion of the char t, under these con-
‘litions, would demand. In reply to them it may be said that in fixing
at 14,000+ the total number of plates necessary for the execution of the
chart, and in supposing that the work will be distributed among fifteen
or twenty observatories each observatory will have only 1,000 plates
to farnish; in counting twelve minutes to each plate, the work would

adopting a length of exposure of thirty minutes in order to reach the
fifteenth magnitude.

Another objection, perhaps more serious, is drawn from the impossi-
bility of utilizing such a super-abundance of material. What will you
do, said David Gill, with the images of so many millions of stars when
once you have obtained them? Where will you find enough astrono-
mers tomake use of them? Weare notin the floating island of Laputa,
where all men are exclusively occupied with mathematics so that it is
always necessary to strike them on the head with a bag containing dry
peas to awaken them. ‘These remarks under their playful form are very
just. The answer to this was that the future would devise, without
doubt, processes of study more rapid than ours, and that it would not
be necessary to deprive our successors of treasures which cost us so
little to bequeath to them. In any case, Mouchez said, we would always
consider these plates as documents to consult, without being compelled
to study them in their smallest details, in the same manner as we pos-
sess a library or encyclopedia, not for the reading of all their volumes
from one end to the other, but for searching there in a given juncture
for the needed information.

However, if we wish to compute the amount of labor which would be
necessary to utilize the data which the enterprise will furnish, limited
as it is by the resolutions of the congress, it will be found perhaps that
there was wisdom in not wishing to comprehend too much. There is
nothing evidently to prevent the enlargement of the scale of the enter-
prise at a later date, in ten or twenty years; up to that time it may be
said that in limiting it the chances of success will be particularly in-
creased.

The congress of 1857, before adjournment, constituted a permanent
committee charged with securing the execution of its decisions, of cen-
tralizing the accounts, and of maintaining the associated observatories
in continued correspondence. This committee, in its turn, has formed a
bureau of nine members,* which has already commenced the publication
of a special bulletin, designed to keep astronomers constantly advised
of the state of advancement of the preparatory labors, the necessity of
which the congress had recognized. The committee will meet in Paris
the 15th of next September.

The number of observatories which have promised to take part in the
making of a chart of the sky, and who have already ordered their pho-
tographic telescope, is at present sixteen. These are, outside of the
French observatories (Paris, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Algiers), those of the
Cape of Good Hope (Africa), Potsdam (Germany), Oxford and Green-
wich (England), Melbourne and Sydney (Australia), Helsingfors (Rus-
sia), San Fernando (Spain), Santiago (Chili), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil),
Tacubaya (Mexico), La Plata (Argentine Republic). The Royal Society

of London contemplates establishing an observatory in New Zealand ;
others, as those of Harvard College, Meudon, Poulkova, and Leyden,
will contribute actively in special researches for the advancement of the
common work. These relate to the following: The preparation of reti-
cules whose image impressed on the plate can furnish the standard for
micrometrical measures, and permit to recognize deformations of the
sensitive film ; it is necessary to make a preliminary study of the scale
of photographic magnitudes of stars; to consider the means of determin-
ing the optical distortion of the field of the telescope; to study the
method of measuring and reducing the plates, ete. It is of mueh im-
portance to thus clear up the ground before commencing the execution
of the chart, in order not to be retarded afterwards by unforeseen ob-
stacles. We can now attempt to gain an idea of the expense which the
projected enterprise will involve. The cost of the construction of a
photographie refracting telescope is estimated at from 50,000 to 60,000
franes; the fifteen or sixteen telescopes which will be needed will cost,
then, nearly 1,000,000 frances.

In adding to this sum the price of the plates, and for each observa-
tory, the appointment of at least two operators during two years, we
arrive at a total in the neighborhood of 1,560,000 franes. It is true that
the instruments remain the property of the establishments which or-
dered their construction and that the work could be contined to the ex-
isting personnel. But the execution of the photographs is not the
most costly part of the enterprise. David Gill, in a memoir inserted
in the first fascicule of the Bulletin of the International Permanent Com-
mittee, has elaborated a detailed plan of organization of the office work
which ought to be accom plished in view of the publication of the results,
and which will consist, before al), in the measure and reduction of the
plates designed for the formation of catalogue. This work, of a nature
so special, says Mr. Gill, requires so perfect an experience and so skill-
ful an organization, in order to be conducted to a successful termination
without too much cost, that it will be most necessarily in charge of a
central bureau. Under these conditions this will be an outlay to be
provided for.

Mr. Gill supposes that the plates of the catalogue will be made, as
those of the chart, in duplicate, and that each plate will cover four de-
grees square, so that the total number of plates will amount to about
twenty thousand. The labor of measuring and reducing must be done
under the direction of an energetic and skillful chief, by young persons
of both sexes of average intelligence; not less than thirty will be
needed, and the entire completion of the work will demand from seven-
teen to twenty-five years. The publication of the catalogue will keep
up with the calculations. For the chart of the sky, so called, it will
suffice to issue to subscribers, namely, to observatories, societies, or na-
tions who have relations with the bureau, positives on glass, obtained
by means of the original negatives. These copies Will be executed

by a photographer assisted by two aids. After detailed estimate of
the outlay, which will result from this organization, Mr. Gill thinks
that the budget of the central bureau ought to be fixed at a mini- -
mum of 200,000 franes a year, but probably it will be necessary to put
it at 250,000 franes. The total outlay will thus rise to a little more
than 6,000,000 franes. This is the sum which appears necessary to se-
eure the publication of the catalogue of all the stars to the eleventh
magnitude, and that of the photographie re-production of all the stars
to the fourteenth magnitude, beside the cost of the telescopes, the sal-
aries of the astronomers, ete., expenses which we have already esti-
mated in the lamp at 1,500,000 franes. It would be reasonable to sub-
tract from this the return from the sale of copies of the chart, which
will yield, after Mr. Gill, about 1,000,000 franes in twenty-five years, or
enough to pay for the telescopes.

Is this amount of 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 franes, to which we have thus
definitely arrived, exorbitant if we take into account the importance of
the results which we are concerned in obtaining? It appears, on the
contrary, a trifling price in comparison with what it would be necessary
to expend in order to arrive at the same results by the old processes.
In the present state of astronomy the formation of a catalogue com-
prising all the stars to the eleventh magnitude (which is the practical
limit of comparison stars in current observations, with the ordinary
observatory instruments) must be considered as an absolute necessity.
Now we know by experience, says Mr. Gill, that the cost of a single
exact meridian observation of a star (comprising the cost of reduction
and publication) is never less than 10 franes, and often surpasses this
figure. The catalogue which itis proposed to form with the aid of pho-
tography will comprise nearly two millions of stars, each of which will
have been determined two times in turn. To obtain the same number
of independent positions from meridian observations (supposing that
sufficiently powerful meridian instruments are found to furnish them)
it would be necessary evidently to spend about 50,000,000 franes. This
is eight times more than the cost of the photographic catalogue and
the general chart of the sky. In regard to the precision of the photo-
graphic positions, it will be superior to that of direct observations. It
suffices in this regard to mention: the remarkable results which Mr.
Thiele, director of the Copenhagen observatory, has obtained by micro-
metric measures exccuted upon three plates of a star cluster which had
been communicated to him by Messrs. Henry.

It is necessary to say here a few words on the appearance which the
photographic images of stars present. These images, upon the plates,
have the form of small black disks, of a diameter nearly proportional
to the stellar magnitude, such as is figured upon celestial charts; their
dimensions inerease gradually according as we prolong the exposure,
which it may be said in passing is a somewhat serious obstacle in
photometric researches, for the experiments of Mr. Scheiner have shown
PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF ASTRONOMY. 4UT7

that the augmentation does not follow a simple law. Under the mi-
croscope * these round black spots are resolved into a multitude of
black points, very crowded at the center, for the stars of the first ten
magnitudes, more and more thinly distributed for the fainter stars,
down to the doubtful traces which mark the extreme limit of chemical
sensitiveness. At present this limit is much further removed than
that of the penetration of the eye armed witha telescope. ‘The dotted
character of the images proceeds evidently from the action of light
upon the molecules of the salt of silver incorporated in the sensitive
film. These photographic stars resemble thus clusters of stars, or
nebulw more or less resolvable.

This aspect is so characteristic that there is little risk of confounding
very small stars with accidental spots, as was feared at first, and it fol-
lows that a dupheation of exposures may often be dispensed with.
Messrs. Henry, to avoid all confusion, have confined themselves to re-
peating three times the exposures on the same plate, by displacing the
telescope each time in such a way as to form with each star a small
equilateral triangle of 3 to 4 seconds on a side. This triangular appear-
ance is not at all perceptible except with a lens; the paper prints give
images which appear perfectly round, <A subsidiary advantage of this
mode of operating is that it thus becomes possible to remove farther yet
the limit of visibility of the stars; thus may be established very easily
in this manner the presence of an unknown planet, whose proper mo-
tion would deform the microscopic triangle. But it is clear that the
triple exposure involves a great loss of time. The congress has pre-
ferred for the execution of the chart of the sky, as we have seen, two
parallel and independent series of plates.

The plates will not acquaint us with the absolute positions of the stars;
they will only permit us to determine their relative situations. It is also
necessary, in order to obtain these with the desired precision, to pro-
vide a system of standards. These standards will be procured by the
re-production of the reticules Mr. Vogel prepares for this object, and
which are traced with a steel point on plates of silvered glass; placed
upon the sensitive plate, the reticule leaves there a latent image, which
developed later appears under the form of a system of very definite lines
of reference. These standard reticules are not only of great assistance
in micrometrical measures of stellar positions, but they will serve to
control the deformation of the gelatine film. We know that for collo-
dion the shrinkage and the deformation of the image which it entails.
can attain an amount very sensible; if is no greater with gelatine,
which adheres very strongly to the glass. This is less according to the
micrometric comparisons of an original reticule and several photo-
‘graphic copies, which Mr. Scheiner has recently undertaken; but we
cannot answer for the invariability of the plate in each particular case

without a special verification ; it is particularly necessary to look out
for deformations when the copies have been executed with a pencil of
“slightly convergent light.

Il.

The truly invaluable advantage of this intervention of photo-chem-
istry in the processes of practical astronomy, is that in transporting
(so to speak) aa authentic image of the firmament into the study of the
astronomer, it frees him from obstacles without number which have so
long a time trammeled researches the most delicate; the cost of crea-
tion and maintenance of an observatory, the difficult handling of great
instruments, fatiguing nightly vigils, fogs, and clouds which so often
put a stop to observations, the necessity of changing one’s hemisphere in
order to study certain constellations, ete. Armed with asimple microm-
eter, he can henceforward explore collections of photographic plates,
taken with some years of interval, and make, in his chimney-corner, dis-
coveries which otherwise would demand long struggles, continued dur-
ing several generations, against the capricious inclemency of the sky.

Indeed celebrated labors come to our mind which have cost in former
times long efforts which we shall have no more to renew. These are,

firstly, the gauges of the number of stars which William Herschel °

undertook, a century ago, with the 20-foot telescope after a plan traced
by Wright. We know that, setting out with the hypothesis of a nearly
uniform distribution of the stars, he admitted for a long time that the
relative richness of a region indicated the depth of the heavens in the
direction considered, which must conduct to attributing to the visible
universe a structure tolerably improbable. Later he changed his
method, and occupied himself with sounding the celestial spaces with
telescopes more and more powerful, in taking henceforth for a criterion
of distances the resolvability of clusters or groups of stars. The two
methods are incorrect, in confounding, with the effects of perspective,

the inequalities of constitution of different stellar regions, indications |

of which indeed make us suspect the reality. But however in reserv-
ing the conclusions which may be drawn from the gauges or soundings
of the sidereal system, it will be necessary sooner or later to return to
this grand statistical work, and the photographie chart will singularly
tend to facilitate the task of astronomers who will be charged with it.
Shall we speak of catalogues of stars? The most ancient, those of
Hipparchus, Ulugh Beigh, Tycho-Brahé, containing a thousand stars;
they were made without a telescope. The catalogue, so precious, which
Bessel has derived from the observations of Bradley (made at Green-
wich about the middie of the last century), and which has, so to speak,
inaugurated the astronomy of precision, contained only a little more
than 3,000. That which is founded upon the observations of Lalande,
executed towards the close of the century at the observatory of the mil-
itary school, and published, in 1801, in the French Histoire Celeste (the

— ee
PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF ASTRONOMY. AT9

catalogue was not published till 1847), comprises more than 47,000 stars.
The Paris observatory has devoted itself, for a long time, to determin-
ing them anew with the greatest care, for the purpose of forming a
new catalogue, which is being gradually accomplished under the skill-
ful direction of Mr. Gaillot. The first two volumes, comprising 7,245
stars, appeared in 1887, and this brings to view the astonishing precision
to which Lalande and his co-workers attained with instruments on the
whole very defective.

The catalogue which Weisse has deduced from the ‘“‘zones” of Bessel
contains about 62,000 stars. That of Argelander, founded on the
“northern zones” observed at Bonn, contain 324,000, to which Mr.
Schoenfeld, the successor of Argelander, has recently added more than
133,000 stars, derived from his ‘‘southern zones.” » The Bonn zones fur-
nish positions, rapidly determined, of stars of the northern sky and of
a part of the southern sky, to the ninth or tenth magnitude. We have
already said that Mr. Gill has undertaken, at the Cape of Good Hope,
to complete this inventory for the remainder of the southern sky, by
the means of photography; we have besides also now, for this part of
the sky, the zones which Mr. Gould observed at Cordoba (Argentine
Republic). To this must be added that in 1867, the International Astro-
nomical Society has taken the initiative in a general revision of the Boun
zones Which was distributed among fifteen observatories, and which
will furnish the material for a new catalogue. The matters concerned
here are careful summaries which do not admit of a very great precision
in the observed places; for the stars more brilliant, which do not sur-
pass the eighth magnitude and which are less numerous, we possess a
series of catalogues prepared with more rigor and founded upon the
mean of frequently repeated observations. It is from these astronomers
derive the fundamental stars, stars of reference to which others are
referred in order to correct their absolute positions. These vast works,
which have cost so much effort and employed so many human lives, is
it necessary to believe that they will !ose their value when the great
photographic chart shall be completed? We do not think thus. Not
only the catalogues of high precision, founded upon meridian observa-
tions, will remain indispensable for the exact determination of absolute
positions; but the zone catalogues will serve to control the relative
positions of the stars determined by photography.

The comparison of plates taken at two different epochs will permit
the undertaking upon a vast scale of the research of proper motions,
which at present can be entered upon only for some thousands of stars.
These small progressive displacements which, in the mean, do not
exceed one-tenth of a second in the space of a year (in some cases it
attains to seven or eight seconds a year) proceed only in part from real
movements of the stars, which are thus seen to change in position.
These are, in a certain degree, apparent displacements which have for
480 PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF ASTRONOMY.

a cause the movement of translation of the solar system, and which per-
mit the determination of its velocity and direction.*

Sometimes the progression, instead of being uniform and continuous,
is found to be affected with periodic inequalities which reveal the ex-
istence of an annual parallax, that is to say, a sensible effect produced
by the change of position of the observer when the earth passes from
one extremity to the other of its orbit; the oscillation in the apparent
place of a star, which results from it permits the calculation of the dis-
tance which separates it from our system. Or indeed the inequality
presents a longer period, and the successive positions of the star per-
mit the discovery of an orbit which it describes arvund a neighboring
center of attraction. We deal here with a pbysical couple; optical
couples, where the nearness of position is only the effect of perspective,
present independent proper motions. |

Researches of this sort will without doubt be facilitated by the
application of photography, for the determination of the relative posi-
tions upon the negative will be infinitely more convenient than in the
field of the telescope, especially when a comparison is desirable between
stars of very different brilliancy. In certain cases, indeed, photography
offers the only means of obtaining precise measures; how would we at-
tempt directly the measurement of the distances and position angles in
a mass of stars such as the cluster in Hercules? Upon the negative
this cluster forms a small diffuse spot 2 to 5 millimeters in size; on ex-
amining it with a lens we distingush several hundred stars dispersed
around a nucleus of a pulverulent appearance, which we may proceed to
without doubt resolve in its turn into a multitude of luminous points.
We have never attempted to design these groupings, still less to make
direct micrometrie measures, the eye being dazzled, says Mr. Mouchez,
by what appears in the eye-piece as a mass of innumerable and brilliant
erains of dust; but the negative placed under the microscope will per-
mit us to draw without difficulty the exact chart of this wonderful corner
inthesky.- In transmitting itto posterity we will give to our descendants
the means of verifying the evolutions, which without doubt are slowly
accomplished in the bosom of this agglomeration of suns.

The research of the annual parallax, which permits us to measure the
distance of the stars by taking fora base of operations the diameter
of the terrestrial orbit constitutes one of the most delicate problems of
modern astronomy, for the displacements, which it concerns us to verify,
never surpass a few tenths of a second, and are oftener masked errors
of observation, whence the irritating discordance of suecessive «de-
terminations of the same parallax effected by astronomers equally skillful
with the most perfect instruments. Will photography be more fortu-
nate? Mr. Pritchard at Oxford has attempted to utilize 61 Cygni in the
first place for the verification of the parallax of a double star very often

*See in the Revue des Deux Mondes of October 1, 1875, ‘‘ The Progress of Stellar As-
tronomy.”
PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE SERVICE OF ASTRONOMY. 481

observed. According to Bessel and Peters, this parallax scarcely sur-
passes a third of a second; according to Otto Struve and Anwers, it
attains a lalf second (0.52). Mr. Pritchard has photographed the
double star in question, during the year with four comparison stars
disposed symmetrically,—two in the direction of the components and
two in the perpendicular direction. The micrometric measures have
given him for each of the two components a parallax of 0.43, which
indicates a distance equal to abont 500,000 times that of the sun, a
distance over which light leaps in seven and one-half years. It has been
necessary, however, to reject some negatives on account of accidental
deformations of the sensitive film occurring during development. In
order to free ones’ self from this source of error, it is only necessary to
employ plates impressed with a reticule of reference, in accordance with
the advice of Mr. Lohse. Since last year Mr. Pritchard has simplified
his process of research in confining himself to observing each star dur-
ing five nights in each of the four periods of the year indicated by the
parallactic ellipse, which the star seems to describe in the sky ; in this
way he hopes to be able to determine the parallaxes of ten to fifteen
stars a year. He has commenced the work on several stars of the con-
stellations Cassiopea and Cygnus, whose parallaxes appear to be com-
prised between 0.04 and 0.19. For Polaris Mr. Pritchard has found
0.07; that is to say, that Polaris is three millions times more distant
from us than the sun.

It is admitted generally that the most brilliant stars are also the
nearest tous; however, among the parallaxes which are known to be
sensible up to the present time many belong to stars relatively faint,
and nothing prevents supposing that in the number of stars which have
not been examined and which will soon be catalogued by photography
there will be found those which are even much nearer to our solar sys-
tem. However, they could not delay being disclosed, since the simple
microscopic inspection of the same group photographed at six months’
interval would suffice to reveal sensible parallactic displacements how-
ever small. .

The direct micrometric measures of groups of stars reveal to us only
displacements in the direction perpendicular to the visual ray; the spec-
troscope alone can make us acquainted with movements which take place
in a direction the same as the visual ray. Tor the color of light which
comes to us from a star, is slightly modified by the velocity with which
the star approaches or removes itself from us, and it follows that rays
of the spectrum are deviated a little towards the right or towards the
left. (It is for the same reason that the locomotive-whistle seems to us
sharper in pitch when the train is approaching than when it is receding.)
It is possible by this means to estimate the velocity of translation of a
certain number of bright stars whose spectra are not too difficult to
observe. However, the eye is fatigued in comparing with the motion-
less rays of an artificial spectrum the always trembling lines of the stellar

spectra, and the deviations thus established rest most frequently upon
impressions fading and very uncertain. Mr. Vogel has succeeded in
freeing himself from this difficulty, caused by the scintillations, by
photographing the stellar spectra at the same time with the spectrum
of a gas; the plates which he has published show with a surprising
sharpness the deviation of a ray common to several stellar spectra, and
which corresponds to the violet ray of hydrogen. Itis established thus
for example that a certain star of the constellation of Orion recedes
from the observer with the velocity of 86 kilometers per second, a ve-
locity which is reduced to 61 kilometers if it is referred to the sun.

At Greenwich, where the spectroscopic study of the velocity of trans-
lation of stars has been pursued for fifteen years by the process of prim-
itive observation, contradictory results appear, which proceed without
doubt from the small amount of fixity of the images of stellar spectra.*
There is reason to hope that the photographie method, in causing this
source of error to disappear, will permit the making use of data of this
character on the same ground as the proper motions, perpendicular to
the visual ray, which modify the apparent positions of the stars. The
attempt has already been made to deduce from them the direction and
the velocity of the movement of translation of the solar system, and the
results agree very well with those which have been obtained by other
methodst. Finally, these are the only data for the present which we
can make use of in arriving at a more complete knowledge of the orbits
of double stars, for the usual observations reveal to us only the appar-
ent orbits in the way they are projected on the celestial sphere. These
projections are ellipses, and it is more than probable that the real orbits
which we see foreshortened are equally ellipses ; butitis not rigorously
demonstrated that the principal star occupies one of the foci.

it follows that it can not yet be affirmed in an absolute manner that
the law of Newton, the law of universal gravitation, presides also over
the motions of double stars, although the generality of this law is ex-

The photographie study of stellar spectra is also of a high interest
from other points of view, and above all for the comprehension of the
constitution of the universe. This is entered upon with ardor in

earth in its orbit.

to this class of researches. Mr. Pickering,* whose energy knows no
obstacles, has undertaken a veritable spectroscopic revision of the sky.
In the first place a catalogue of the spectra of the stars visible to the
naked eye has been commenced. <A second catalogue will contain
numerous spectra of faint stars, to the eighth magnitude. It is proposed
besides to make a detailed study of the spectra of the brightest stars,
of variable stars, and in general of all spectra which offer remark-
able peculiarities. A first list of 10,875 spectra is finished. This
autumn an expedition will be sent to the southern hemisphere, probably
Peru, to complete the work to the south pole.

Mr. Pickering hopes also to draw toa successful termination a series
of photometric researches which have for an aim the comparison of
stellar magnitudes, furnished on the one side by, photography and on
the other by direct observation by the means of various photometers in
use. These researches reach a thousand stars near the pole, an equal
number taken in the neighborhood of the equator, and the stars visible
in the constellation of the Pleiades, the one of the best known in the
northern sky, and which offers the advantage of containing scarcely any
but white stars. It is also this constellation that Mr. J. Scheiner has
selected for photometric experiments, the results of which he is about
to publish.

These classes of researches will give the means of reducing the dif-
ferent scales to a common measure. We know already that the photo-
graphic scale is established by the diameters of the stellar disks. For
a given time of exposure the differences of the diameters will, in gen-
eral, be proportional to the differences of magnitude, such as result
from direct photometric comparisons. With a little acquaintance the
estimation of the magnitudes could be without doubt reached during
the micrometric measures of the negatives, as astronomers estimate
them during the observation of transits. For a more precise determi-
nation all the stars on a negative could be referred to three or four
among them, of which the magnitudes could be measured by pho-
tometry.

The processes in use permit in general the fixing of the magnitude t
of a star to about one-tenth, at least, for the first nine or ten magnitudes;
this is shown by the agreement of the published determinations by dif-
ferent observers. This is not so when exceptionally bright stars which
range above the first magnitude are concerned, or very faint stars below
the tenth, and the designations of the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth
magnitudes do not have a precise meaning, only by virtue of definition,
by such and such an observer. We can, as is done at Paris, define them
by the length of exposure necessary to make the images appear, for this
time varies in the proportion of 1 to 10,000 from the sixth magnitude

to the extreme limit of visibility, and furnishes a scale the most ex-
tended. But itis necessary to take account of the variable sensitive-
ness of the plates; finally it is clear that the process founded upon the
estimation of the time of exposure is not favored in present applications
as much as the method which consists in the comparison of the disks
taken on the same negative. It is then the latter method which is
sought to be perfected, for it does not suffer from difficulties when stars
gradually fainter are dealt with. The images, then, in forming have
dimensions already very appreciable, which increase only very little in
the first moments; tiie comparison of diameters can conduct to errone-
ous results if it is taken toosoon. The progressive increase of the disks
has for a cause the irradiation which results from the interior illumina-
tion of the translucent gelatine at the point where the image is formed.

III.

The measurers of double stars are subject to a multitude of errors
which regard the difference of magnitude of the components, the ineli-
nation of the line of the stars, ete., and which render the results ob-
tained by different observers comparable with difficulty. We meet
difficulties of the same nature in micrometric measures of satellites, and
it is in all these cases that the intervention of photography promises to
increase greatly the accuracy and security of the results. The negatives
obtained by Messrs. Henry permit the pointings to be made with extra-
ordinary precision. The sensitive plate is not like the eye, dazzled by
the vicinage of a bright star; it remains attentive to the faintest
gleams. The satellite of Neptune, always visible with difficulty at
Paris, can be photographed in all parts of its orbit, even when it is
found at only 8 seconds from the planet.

Satellites of new planets, hitherto unknown, will reveal their exist-
ence by the trace of their course in the midst of fixed stars. The ap-
parent displacement of a small planet about the epoch of opposition,
that is to say at the moment when it approaches nearest to the earth,
is in the mean one minute of are in two hours, or 0.5 per hour; upon
the negatives of the Paris observatory a trace is produced, in one hour
of exposure, of one-half of a millimeter. For the planet Pallas, which
is the eighth magnitude, this trace is found easily recognizable; but
Messrs. Henry think that it would still be appreciable for a planet of
the fourteenth or fifteenth magnitude, with a relative brightness four
or five hundred times fainter.

The number of asteroids known has increased by several each year;
it reaches already 285. Thanks for the intervention of photography,
the search, hitherto very laborious, for these little bodies will become
so easy that we shall see them multiply too rapidly for the liking of the
calewlators, and there will not be time enough to select their names.
In spite of the iusignificuuce of their masses these humble supernumer-

aries of the solar cortege interest astronomers in more than one connec-
tion; indeed they are watched after almost for the purpose of avoiding
losing them after having discovered and inscribed them upon the reg-
ister of the planetary system. This happens however from time to
time, when the first observations have not been sufficiently numerous
to fix very securely the elements of the orbit; there are at present a
score of these bodies which are wanting at roll-call.

The great diversity in the form and situation of their orbits opens
to young astronomers a field for mathematical exercise, and raises at
times arduous problems. In order to arrive at a determination of their
feeble masses, which we have been able to estimate only from their
brightness, it is necessary to be able to establish, for example, the mu-
tual perturbations of two asteroids passing very near one another, so
that their reciprocal attraction becomes sensible aside from that of the
sun. It is a matter of interest then to predict the coming near to each
other or physical conjunctions of the asteroids; but the proximities
worthy of being noted are rather rare, or at least they occur only be-
tween the orbits and not between the planets.* Perhaps some day the
passing of a comet through the belt of asteroids will offer us other means
of estimating the power of the attraction of these p'gmies. In return,
the perturbations which they experience themselves on the part of Ju-
piter are sometimes very sensible, and they have already served (nota-
bly those of Themis and Amphitrite) in verifying the value of the mass
of this planet, which represents a little less than a thousandth of the
mass of the Sun. The one of the three planets discovered in the month
of last October, by Mr. Palisa (it has received the number 279, and the
name Thulé), is particularly interesting in this regard, for its mean dis-
tance (4.3) surpasses that of all the known asteroids, and permits it to
approach near enough to Jupiter to be very strongly disturbed in its
course. These are some of the reasons which make us think that pho-
tography, in facilitating much the search for small planets, will not
serve solely for swelling the statistics of the solar system.

A discovery infinitely more interesting would be, however, that of the
trans-Neptunian planet, which has not ceased to haunt the imagination
of astronomers. For nothing proves that Neptune must be the last
term of the series of planets which gravitate around the sun. We know
that Le Verrier, in 1846, had reached a determination of the position of
this star by the aid of the errors or residuals of the Tables of Uranus,
which amounted to 20”, and which he attributed with reason to the
perturbations produced by an unknown planet. The day when he
was able to announce to the Academy of Sciences that Mr. Galle had
come upon this planet in the indicated place, he added: ‘ This success

*The shortest distance between the orbits of Thetis and Bellona is estimated at
30,000 kilometers; for Clytia and Nemesis, this distance is 115,000 kilometers, and the
two planets are found at 950,000 kilometers apart in the month of August, 1589; this
is twice and a half the distance of the moon from the earth.

ought to permit us to hope that after thirty or forty years of observa-
tions of the new planet, it may be possible to empley them in their
turn in the discovery of that which follows it in order of distance from
the sun.”*

He continues thus: ‘ We will unhappily soon fall upon stars invisi-
ble, on account of their immense distance from the sun, but whose orbits
will be completed in the course of centuries, by being traced with great
exactness, by means of the theory of secular inequalities.” More than
forty years have elapsed since the discovery of Neptune without real-
izing the hope of Le Verrier. The fact is that his formule represent
always with precision not only the observations of Neptune made since
1846, but also some observations much more ancient (Lalande had come
upon the planet twice, in 1795, and had entered it in his catalogue as a
star of the eighth magnitude). We do not know then on what to rest,
to renew the prodigious discovery of Le Verrier, which already itself
had been possible only on account of a happy concourse of circumstances.
It is this which we can not prevent ourselves from remembering in read-
ing the masterly exposition which Mr. Tisserand has made in the his-
tory of the discovery of Neptune in the first tome of his “ Treatise on
Celestial Mechanics” which appeared a few months since.

The trans-Neptunian planet, if it exists, will be found perhaps at a
distance very great, surpassing more than one hundred times the radius
of the terrestrial orbit, or else its mass is relatively small, and the action
which it exercises will not make accusation against it till after a long
period. Let us not forget that Neptune has scarcely traversed one quar-
ter of his orbit since the epoch of discovery. It may be possible even
that the action of a mass relatively large may remain for along time
hidden from us, in being confounded with that of the other planets.

There are then few chances for discovering the hypothetical star by
virtue alone of the law of Newton. It is necessary rather to count on
the happy chance of recognizing it among stars of the twelfth or thir-
teenth magnitude, among which it may be lost. All these things did
not prevent Mr. David P. Todd from constituting himself the prophet
of the trans-Neptunian planet, for which he entered upon a search
since 1874 by the systematic exploration of certain regions of the sky.t
During the winter of 187778 he employed in this exploration the great
refractor of the Washington observatory. He closed in placing his hope
in photography, which appears called to render this class of researches
much more easy. Mr. Todd founds his conviction of the existence of
the planet upon the examination of the last residuals of the Tables of
Uranus, to which he has applied a very simple graphical process indi-

to him: ‘¢ The name of Janus would indicate that this planet is the last of the solar
system, which there is no reason to believe.”

_ cated by Sir John Herschel in reference to the perturbations of Uranus
due to Neptune. That which has fortified him in this conviction is
the very probable accidental agreement of his result with that te which
Mr. G. Forbes has been conducted by the consideration of a tendency
to grouping of the aphelia of periodic comets, whose distances from the
sun coincide more or less exactly with the mean distances of the larger
planets. Having found indeed seven comets whose aphelion distances
approach 100, and six whose aphelion distances approach 300 (the unit
being always the radius of the terrestrial orbit), Mr. Forbes concluded
from this that it is possible that there are two trans-Neptunian planets
situated respectively at the distances 100 and 300, and whose powerful
attraction has acquired these comets for the solar system. The comets
thus captured would be able then to inform us of the actual position of
the planet to which we owe them, and which has in times past found
itself in proximity to their aphelia. But having taken little from the
value of these premises, the numerical data upon which the calculations
of Mr. Forbes rest do not bear scrutiny. The agreement of the results of
Mr. Forbes and Mr. Todd signifies nothing when it is seen how these
results have been established. In spite of everything the trans-Nep-
tunian planet may indeed appear some day before our astonished gaze
upon one of the negatives which will serve to prepare the general chart
of the sky.

Physical astronomy also sees new horizons to open ont before if. I
will not speak here at length of the photographs of the sun and moon.
For along time we have been able to see those which have great
beauty. We know with what success Mr. Janssen, at Meudon, pursues
the application of photography to the study of solar phenomena.  [e-
searches of the same kind aremadeat Potsdam, and Mr. Wilsing, depend-
ing on a hundred plates for the positions of groups of faculi, has arrived
at this unexpected conclusion, that (contrary to that which takes place
with the spots) the velocity of rotation of the facule is the same for all
the parailels, and equal to that of the equator. The retardation of the
motion of the spots explains indeed why those which originate at the
foot of a facula proceed graduaily in the direction of its parallel as if
sown upon its course. It is probable that the unequal velocity which
the spots possess is limited by a rather thin layer of the solar envelope,
while the great mass turns solidly with the constant velocity of the
faculie.

We know the stereoscopic effects whici are obtained with photo-
graphs of the moon, taken at two epochs suitably selected. Perfected
from time to time, these photographs will be of service in studying
more exactly the libration ; they will also cause the discovery of changes
which are occurring, perhaps, on the surface of our satellite, and which,
affirmed by some, contested by others, remain up to the present time
very doubtful. On the contrary, the reality of modifications, sometimes
rather sudden, appears to-day well verified for some planets. It suf-

fices to recall the mysterious rectilinear canals which Messrs. Schiapa-
relli and Perrotin have pointed out on the surface of Mars. In refer-
ence to sketches sent from Nice, Mr. Janssen has made the statement
that he was urgently seeking to obtain, with the aid of our great in-
strument, photographic images sufficiently perfect to replace these de-
signs. ‘I know,” says he, “that when phenomena are concerned, as
delicate as those which have been discovered at Milan and at Nice,
photography unhappily can no longer strive with sight; but it is nec-
essary to enter resolutely into this path, to prepare for the future.” If
in place of designs, we could have photographic images even less de-
tailed, we would already derive from them, in regard to the changes
which have occurred on the surface of Mars, notions incomparably
more certain than those with which we are obliged to content ourselves.

In order to judge of the difficulty which is experienced in confronting
designs of a diverse origin, we have only to pass in review the long
series of sketches of the nebula of Orion, made through two centuries
by observers such as Huyghens, Mairan, Messier, De Vico, Lamont,
J. Herschel, Lassell, O. Struve, the two Bonds, Lord Rosse, Father
Secchi. In 1882, Mr. Holden devoted to this nebula a monograph where
he gives the results of his own observations, at the same time also
copies of the more celebrated drawings of this famous object. These
copies, notwithstanding they are very imperfect, cause no less the
growth of the conviction that it would be rash to invoke unbiased tes-
timony to prove whether it is true that the appearance varies thus from
one sketch to another. Mr. Holden has also reproduced a photograph
of the nebula, obtained by H. Draper in 1882. It has been since photo-
graphed by Mr. Common, by Mr. Roberts, and by other astronomers.
Messrs. Holden and Struve think that the contour of the nebula of
Orion has not changed since it has been observed with care, but that
the brightness of certain portions has undergone variations which con-
tinue to re-produce themselves before our eyes. Photography alone
will be able, some day, to give us in this regard a complete certainty,
as it permits us already to watch rapid changes in comets, in outlines
so variable.

Meanwhile, it has already called up from the bosom of the darkness
unknown nebule which the human eye had not perceived. Upon a
plate of the Pleiades, which Messrs. Henry had obtained November 16,
1885, the star Maia was shown accompanied with a small cometary tail,
very brilliant; it was discovered that this was anebulosity. It has been
found that it also impressed itself upon a negative of Mr. Pickering,
which dated November 3; but in America it had been taken for an ac-
cidental spot. Once informed, astronomers in possession of very power-
ful telescopes have been able to verify directly its existence ; it has
been observed successively at Pulkova, Nice, Vienna, Washington,
Geneva, and other places with more or less facility. Since then, Messrs.
Henry have continued to perfect their processes, and they repeat each

year the negative of the Pleiades, which is well worth the trouble. The
impressions of 1888, obtained with very sensitive plates and an expo-
sure of four hours, have revealed with surprising clearness the diffuse
mass of cosmical matter which envelopes this constellation, and of
which the nebule of Maia and of Merope are only the most luminous
parts. A curious and very unexpected peculiarity is a rectilinear fila-
ment of nebulous matter which proceeds from the principal mass, over
a length of 40’ of are and a breadth of 3” to 4” only; it encoun-
ters on its course seven stars which it unites together as beads of
a chaplet. A second line, similar but shorter, exists in the midst of
the nebulous mass. This new negative contains besides twice as many
stars as the first, about 2,000. The chart of the Pleiades of Mr. C.
Wolf, which consumed several years of labor, contains only 671.

Mr. Pickering has entered into the same path, and very recently his
plates have revealed the existence of five or six new nebule in different
regions of the sky. Finally, some months since, Mr. Roberts commn-
nicated to the Astronomical Society in London photographs of the ellip-.
tical nebula of Andromeda, which are indeed arevelation. That which
seemed an unformed mass of cosmical matter, traversed by irregular
fissures, appeared now as a solar system in embryo; rings are dis-
tinguished in it, which are detached from the central mass, as is re-
quired by the hypothesis of Laplace, and two satellites in course of
formation, whose relative positions must have undergone some changes
since the epoch of the observations of Bond. Photography renders
thus intelligible a structure which sketches are inclined to conceal.

The success obtained in this field can depend, in a certain measure,
upon a particular photogenic power of nebule; but it is explained
especially by this fact, that the sensitive plate is not dazzled by the
vicinage of more brilliant objects, The nebula which surrounds the
variable star Eta Argus, was invisible when: this star appeared to be
the first magnitude, and was discovered only when the star which
eclipses if caused it to descend to the fourth order (it is now the seventh
magnitude).

There is found to be an advantage of the same order in the applica-
tion of photography in the registering of phenomena instantaneous or
of very short duration, like eclipses, occultations, meridian transits,
where the cool-headed sensitive plate shields us from the trouble, and
from errors inseparable from a precipitate observation. A great num-
ber of total solar eclipses, also the two transits of Venus, 1874 and 1882,
have already been observed by thismeans. The measures of numerous
negatives taken by the French expeditions have been confided to a per-
sonnel of the gentler sex, under the direction of Mr. Bouquet de La
Grye; they are completed, and the calculations are in a very advanced
state.

raphy has rendered to astronomy, or which it is to render to it after a

same time telescopes are perfected and attain colossal dimensions.

THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.*

By Sir HENRY E. Roscok, F. R. S., President.

In asking myself what subject I could bring before you on the pres-
ent occasion, I thought I could not do better than point out by one
example what a chemist may do for mankind. And in choosing this
theme for my discourse I found myself in no want of material, for
amongst the various aspects of scientific activity there is surely none
which, whether in its most recondite forms or in those most easily un-
derstood, have done more to benefit humanity than those which have
their origin in my own special study of chemistry. I desired to show
what one chemist may accomplish, a man devoted heart and soul to the
investigation of nature, a type of the ideal man of science—whose ex-
ample may stimulate even the feeblest amongst us to walk in his foot-
steps if only for a short distance, whose life is a consistent endeavor to
seek after truth if haply he may find it, whose watchwords are simplic-
ity, faithfulness, and industry, and whose sole ambition is to succeed
in widening the pathway of knowledge so that following generations of
wayfarers may find their journeys lightened and their dangers lessened.

Such men are not uncommon amongst the ranks of distinguished
chemists. I might have chosen as an example the life and labors of
your some time townsman, Joseph Priestley, had not this theme been
already treated by Professor Huxley, in a manner I can not approach,
on the occasion of the inauguration of the statute which stands hard by.
To-day however I will select another name, that of a man still living,
the great French chemist, Pasteur.

Asachemist Pasteur began life, as a chemist he is ending it. For
although, as I shall hope to point out, his most important researches
have entered upon fields hitherto tilled with but scanty suecess by the
biologist, yet in his hands, by the application of chemical methods, they
have yielded a most bountiful harvest of new facts of essential service
to the well-being and progress of the human race.

And after all, the first and obvious endeavor of every cultivator of
science ought to be to render service of this kind. For although it i:

foolish and short-sighted to decry the pursuit of any form of scientific
study because it may be as yet far removed from practical application
to the wants of man, and although such studies may be of great value
as an incentive to intellectual activity, yet the statement isso evident
as to almost amount to a truism, that discoveries which give us the
power of rescuing a population from starvation, or which tend to
diminish the ills that flesh, whether of man or beast, is heir to, must
deservedly attract more attention and create a more general interest
than others having so far no direct bearing on the welfare of the race.
“There is no greater charm,” says Pasteur himself, ‘“ for the investi-
gator than to make new discoveries, but his pleasure is more than
doubled when he sees that they find direct application in practical life.”
To make discoveries capable of such an application has been the good
fortune—by which I mean the just reward—of Pasteur. How he made
them is the lesson which I desire this evening to teach. I wish to show
that these discoveries, culminating as the latest and perhaps the most

remarkable of all, in that of a cure for the dreaded and most fearful of

all fearful maladies, hydrophobia, have not been, in the words of Priest-
ley, ‘lucky hap-hazardings,” but the outcome of patient and long-con-
tinued investigation. This latest result is, as I shall prove to you, not
an isolated case of a happy chance, but simply the last link in a long
chain of discoveries, each one of which has followed the other in logi-
cal sequence, each one bound to the other by ties which exhibit the life-
work of the discoverer as one consequent whole. In order however to
understand the end we must begin at the beginning, and ask ourselves
what was the nature of the training of band, eye, and brain, which en-
abled Pasteur to wrest from nature secret processes of disease the dis-
covery of which had hitherto baffled all the efforts of biologists? What
was the power by virtue of which he succeeded when all others had
failed ; how was he able to trace the causes and point out remedies for
the hitherto unaccountable changes and sicknesses which beer and wine
undergo? What means did he adopt to cure the fatal silk-worm dis-
ease, the existence of which in the south of France in one year cost that
country more than 100,000,000 of franes? Or how did he arrive at a
method for exterminating a plague known as fowl cholera, or that of
the deadly cattle disease, anthrax, or splenic fever, which has killed
millions of cattle, and is the fatal woolsorters’ disease in man? And
last, but not least, how did he gain an insight into the workings of that
most mysterious of all poisons, the virus of hydrophobia ?

To do more than point out the spirit which has guided Pasteur in all
his work, and to give an idea of the nature of that work in a few exanr-
ples, I can not attempt, in the time at my disposal. Of the magnitude
and far-reaching character of that work we may form a notion, when
we remember that if is to Pasteur that we owe the foundation of the
science of bacteriology, a science treating of the ways and means of
those minute organisms called microbes, upon whose behavior the very

life, not only of the animal, but perhaps also of the vegetable world de-
pends,—a science which bids fair to revolutionize both the theory and
practice of medicine, a science which has already, in the hands of Sir
Joseph Lister, given rise to anew and beneficent application in the
discovery of antiseptic surgery.

The whole secret of Pasteur’s success may be summed up in a few
words. It consisted in the application of the exact methods of physi-
cal and chemical research, to problems which had hitherto been at-
tacked by other less precise and less systematic methods. His early
researches were of a purely chemical nature. It is now nearly forty
years ago since he published his first investigation. But this pointed
out the character of the man and indicated the lines upon which all
his subsequent work was laid.

Of all the marvellous and far-reaching discoveries of modern chem-
istry perhaps the most interesting and important is that of the exist-
ence of compounds which while possessing an identical composition
(that is, made up of the same elements in the same proportions), are
absolutely different sabstances judged of by their properties. The first
instance made known to us of such isomeric bodies, as they are termed
by the chemist, was that pointed out by the great Swedish chemist, Ber-
zelius. He showed that the tartaric acid of wine-lees possesses precisely
the same composition as a rare acid having quite different properties and
occasionally found in the tartar deposited from wine grown in certain
districts in the Vosges. Berzelius simply noted this singular fact, but
did not attempt to explain it. Later on, Biot observed that not only
do these two acids differ in their chemical behavior, but likewise in
their physical properties, inasmuch as the one (the common acid) pos-
sessed the power of deviating the plane of a polarized ray of light to
the right, whereas the rare acid has no such rotatory power. It was
reserved however for Pasteur to give the explanation of this singular
and at that time unique phenomenon, for he proved that the optically
inactive acid is made up of two compounds, each possessing the same
composition but differing in optical pruperties. The one turned out to
be the ordinary dextro-rotatory tartaric acid; the other a new acid
which rotates the plane of polarization to the left to an equal degree.
As indicating the germ of his subsequent researches, it is interesting
here to note that Pasteur proved that these two acids can be sepa-
rated from one another by a process of fermentation, started by a mere
trace of a special form of mold. The common acid is thus first de-
composed, so that if the process be carried on for a certain time only
the rarer lievo-rotatory acid remains.

Investigations on the connection between crystalline form, chemical
composition, and optical properties occupied Pasteur for the next seven
years, and their results—which seem simple enough when viewed from
the vantage ground of accomplished fact—were attainable solely by
dint of self-sacrificing labors such as only perhaps those who have
A94 THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.

themselves walked in these enticing and yet often bewildering paths
can fully appreciate, and by attention to minute detail as well as to
broad principles to an.extent which none can surpass and few can equal.
A knowledge of the action of the mold in the changes it effects on
tartaric acid led Pasteur to investigate that béte noire of chemists, the
process of fermentation. The researches thus inaugurated in 1897, not
only threw a new and vivid light on these most complicated of chemical
changes and pointed the way to scientific improvements in brewing
and wine-making of the greatest possible value, but were the stepping-
stones to those higher generalizations which lie at the foundation of
the science of bacteriology, carrying in their train the revolutions in
in modern medicine and surgery to which I have referred.

The history of the various theories from early times until our own
day which have been proposed to account for the fact of the change of
sugar into alcohol, or that of alcohol into vinegar, under certain condi-
tions, a fact known to the oldest and even the most uncivilized of races,
is one of the most interesting chapters in the whole range of chemical
literature, but however enticing, is one into which I can not now enter.
Suffice it here to say that it was Pasteur who brought light out of dark-
nesss by explaining conflicting facts and by overturning false hypoth-
eses. And this was done by careful experiment and by bringing to
bear on the subject an intelligence trained in exact methods and in
unerring observation, coupled with the employment of the microscope
and the other aids of modern research.

What now did Pasteur accomplish? In the first place he proved
that the changes occurring in each of the various processes of fermen-
tation are due to the presence and growth of a minute organism called
the ferment. Exclude all traces of these ferments and no change
occurs. Brewers’ wort thus preserved remains for years unaltered.
Milk and other complex liquids do not turn sour even on exposure to
pure air, provided these infinitely small organisms are excluded. But
introduce even the smallest trace of these microscopic beings and the
peculiar changes which they alone can bring about at once begin. A
few cells of the yeast plant set up the vinous fermentation in a sugar
solution. This is clearly stated by Pasteur as follows: “* My decided
opinion,” he says, “on the nature of alcoholic fermentation is the fol-
lowing: The chemical act of fermentation is essentially a correlative
phenomenon of a vital act beginning and ending with it. I think that
there is never any alcoholic fermentation without there being at the
same time organization, development, multiplication of globules, or the
continued consecutive life of globules already formed.” .

Add on a needle’s point a trace of the peculiar growth which accom
panies the acetous fermentation and the sound beer or wine in a@ short
time becomes vinegar. Place ever so small a quantity of the organism
of the lactic fermentation in your sweet milk, which may have been
preserved fresh for years in absence of such organisms, and your milk
THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST. 495

turns sour. But still more, the organism (yeast) which brings about
the alcoholic fermentation will not give rise to the acetous, and vice
versa ; so that each peculiar chemical change is brought about by the
vital action of a peculiar organism. In its absence the change can not
occur; in its presence only that change can take place.

Here again we may ask, as Pasteur did, why does beer or wine be-
come sour when exposed to ordinary air? And the answer to- this
question was given by him in no uncertain tone in one of the most
remarkable and most important of modern experimental researches.
Milk and beer which have become sour on standing in the air contain
living micro-organisms which did not exist in the original sound fluids.
Where did these organisms originate? Are they or their germs con-
tained in the air, or are these minute beings formed by a process of
spontaneous generation from material not endowed with life ?

A controversy as to the truth or falsity of the theory of spontaneous
generation was waged with spirit on both sides, but in the end Pas.
teur came off victorious, for by a series of the most delicate and con-
vincing of experiments he proved the existence of micro-organie forms
and their spores—or seeds—in the air, and showed that while unpuri-
fied air was capable of setting up fermentative changes of various
kinds, the same air freed from germs could not give rise to these
changes Keep away the special germ which is the incentive to the
pathological change and that change can not occur. In the interior
of the grape, in the healthy blood, no such organisms, no such germs
exist; puncture the grape or wound the animal body and the germs
floating in the air settle on the grape juice or on the wounded tissue,
and the processes of change, whether fermentative or putrefactive, set
in with all their attendant symptoms. But crush the grape or wound
the animal under conditions which either preclude the presence or de-
stroy the life of the floating germ, and again no such change occurs ;
the grape-juice remains sweet, the wound clean.

I have said that every peculiar fermentative change is accompanied
by the presence of a special ferment. This most important conclusion
has only been arrived at as the result of careful experimental inquiry.
How was this effected? By the artificial cultivation of these organ-
isms. Just as the botanist or gardener picks out from a multitude of
wild plants the special one which he wishes to propagate, and planting
it in ground favorable to its growth, obtains fresh crops of the special
plant he has chosen, so the bacteriologist can, by a careful process of
selection, obtain what is termed a pure cultivation of any desired organ.
ism. Having obtained such a pure cultivation, the next step is to as-
certain what are the distinctive properties of that special organism ;
what characteristic changes does it bring about in material suitable for
its growth. This having been determined, and a foundation for the
science having thus been laid, it is not difficult to apply these principles
to practice, and the first application made by Pasteur was to the study
of the diseases of beer and wine,
496 THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.

In September, 1871, Pasteur visited one of the large London brew-
eries, in which the use of the microscope was then unknown. A single
elance at the condition of the yeast instantly told its tale, and enabled
him to explain to the brewers the cause of the serious state of things
by which frequently as much as 20 per cent. of their product was
returned on their bands as unsalable—this being that this yeast con-
tained foreign or unhealthy organisms. And just as pure yeast is tbe
cause of the necessary conversion of wort into beer, so these strange
forms which differ morphologically from yeast, and whose presence can
therefore be distinctly ascertained, are the cause of acidity, ropiness,
turbidity, and other diseases which render the beer undrinkable. It is
no exaggeration to say that, whereas before Pasteur’s researches the_
microscope was practically unknown in the brew-house, it has now be
come as common as the thermometer or the saccharimeter, and by its-
help and by the interpretations we can place upon its revelations through
Pasteur’s teaching, yeast—of all brewers’ materials the least open to
rough and ready practical discernment—becomes easy of valuation as
to its purity or impurity, its vigor or weakness, and therefore its
behavior during fermentation. Thus, while in former days the most
costly materials were ever liable to be ruined by disease organisms
unconsciously introduced into them with the yeast, at the present day
the possibilities of any sueh vast pecuniary disasters become easily
avertable.

Of all industries, brewing is perhaps the one which demands the most
stringent care in regard to complete and absolute cleanliness. The
brewers’ materials, products, and by-products, are so putrescible, there
is always so vast an abundance of disease organisms in the brewery air,
that the minutest amounts of these waste products lying about in ves-
sels or pipes transform these places into perfect nests for the propa-
gation of these micro-organisms, whence, transferred into the brewings,
they inevitably ruin them, however carefully and scientifically prepared
in other respects. Without the microscope, any breach of discipline in
the way of the supreme cleanliness necessary is impossible of detection ;
with it we can track down the micro-organisms to their source, whether
it be in uneleanly plant, in impurity of materials, or in carelessness of
manipulation.

Among the more direct applications of Pasteur’s researches, the so-
called Pasteurization of beer claims a place. Pasteur showed that tem-
peratures well below the boiling-point sufficed for destroying the disease
organisms in alcoholic fluids, and, based on these results, enormous
quantities of low-fermentation beers are annually submitted to these
temperatures, and thus escape the changes otherwise incident to tue
micro-organisms which have succumbed to the treatment. This process
is however for several intricate reasons, not suited for English beers,
but if we can not keep our beers by submitting them to high tempera-
tures, we can foretell to a nicety how they will keep by artificially fore-
THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST. 497

ing on those changes which would occur more slowly during storage.
The application of a suitable temperature, the exclusion of outside con-
tamination, a microscopic examination of the ‘“ forced” beer, and the
knowledge which we owe to Pasteur of what the microscopic aspect
means, suffice to make each brewing foretell its own future history, and
thus suffice to avert the otherwise inevitable risks incident to the stor-
age and export of beer, the stability of which is unknown.

Brewing has thus become a series of precise and definite operations,
capable of control at every point. Instead of depending—as it had to
depend—on intuition and experience handed down in secrecy from
father to son, it now depends upon care, forethought, and the soundness
of the brewer’s scientific training. This change in the nature of the
brewer’s operations, and in the persons who govern them, is primarily
due to Pasteur. Other men have done much to carry on his work, but
it is to his example of ceaseless patience, and to his example of freely
publishing to the world all the results of his work, that the brewers of
all countries are indebted for the connection of each phenomenon with
a controllable cause, and for thus emancipating their industry from em-
piricism and quackery.

Much the same story has to be told about Pasteur’s investigation of
wine and its diseases. As with the brewer, so with the wine-grower
Pasteur has pointed out the causes of his troubles, and the causes hav-
ing been ascertained, the remedies soon followed, and the practical
value of these researches to the trade of France and other wine-produc-
ing countries has been enormous.

The next labor of cur scientific Hercules was of a different kind, but of
a no less interesting or important character. The south of France is a
great silk-producing district. In 1853, the value of the raw silk was
represented by a sum of some £5,000,000 sterling, and up to that date
the revenue from this source had been greatly augmenting. Suddenly
this tide of prosperity turned, a terrible plague broke out amongst the
silk-worms, and in 1865, so general had the disease become, that the total
production of French silk did not reach £1,000,000, and the consequent
poverty and suffering endured in these provinces became appalling.
Every conceivable means was tried to overcome the disease, but all in
vain. The population and the Government of France—for the evil was
a national one—were at their wits’ end, and a complete collapse of one
of the most important French industries seemed inevitable. Under
these circumstances the great chemist Dumas, who was born at Alais,
in the center of one of the districts most seriously affected, urged his
friend Pasteur to undertake an investigation of the subject. Pasteur,
who at this time had never seen a silk-worm, naturally felt diffident
about attempting so difficult a task, but at last, at Dumas’s renewed en-
treaty, he consented, and in June, 1865, betook himself to the south for
the purpose of studying the disease on the spot. His previous training
here again stood him in good sted, and in September, 1865, he was able

H. Mis, 224—— 32
498 THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.

to communicate to the Academy of Sciences, results of observations
and experiment which, striking at the root of the evil, pointed the way
to the means of securing immunity from the dreaded plague. This pa-
per was freely criticised. Here, it was said, was a chemist who, quitting
his proper sphere, had the hardihood to lay down rules for the guid-
ance of the physician and biologist in fields specially their own. Why
should his proposals be more successful than all the other nostrums
which had already so egregiously failed?

In order to appreciate the difficulties which met Pasteur in this in-
quiry, and to understand how wonderfully he overcame them, I must
very shortly describe the nature of this disease, which is termed pébrine,
from the black spots which cover the silk-worm. It declares itself by
the stunted and unequal growth of the worms, by their torpidity, and-
by their fastidiousness as to food, and by their premature death.

Before Pasteur went to Alais the presence of certain microscopic cor-
puscles had been noticed in the blood and in all the tissues of the dis-
eased caterpillar, and even in the eggs from which such worms were
hatched. These micro-organisms often fill the whole of the silk organs
of the insect, which in a healthy condition contain the clear viscous
liquid from which the silk is made. Such worms are of course value-
less. Still this knowledge did not suffice, for eggs apparently healthy
gave rise to stricken worms incapable of producing silk, whilst again
other worms distinctly diseased yielded normal cocoons. These diffi-
culties, which had proved too much for previous observers, were fully
explained by Pasteur. ‘The germs of these organisms,” said he, “ which
are so minute, may be present in the egg and even in the young worms,
and yet baffle the most careful search. They develop with the growth
of the worm, and in the chrysalis they are more easily seen. The moth
derived from a diseased worm invariably contains these corpuscles, and
is incapable of breeding healthy progeny.”

This moth-test is the one adopted by Pasteur, and it is an infallible
one. If the female moth is stricken, then her eggs, even though they
show no visible sign of disease, will produce sick worms. If in the moth
no micrococci are seen, then her immediate progeny at any rate will be
sound and free from inherited taint, and will always produce the normal
quantity of silk. Butthisisnotall. Pasteur found that healthy worms
can be readily infected by contact with diseased ones, or through germs
contained in the dust of the rooms in which the worms are fed. Worms
thus infected, but free from inherited taint, can however (as stated)
spin normal cocoons, but—and this is the important point—the moths
which such chrysalids yield invariably produce diseased eggs. This
explains the anomalies previously noticed. The silk-worms which die
without spinning are those in which the disease is hereditary, viz, those
born from a diseased mother. Worms from sound eggs which contract
the disease during their life-time always spin their silk, but they give
rise to a stricken moth, the worms from which do not reach maturity
and furnish no silk.
THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST. 499

As I have said, these results were but coldly received. It was hard
to make those engaged in rearing the worms believe in the efficacy of
the proposed cure. Then, seeing this state of things, Pasteur deter-
mined to take upon himself the réle of a prophet. Having in 1866 care-
fully examined a considerable number of the moths which had laid eggs
intended for incubation, he wrote down a prediction of what would hap-
pen in the following year with respect to the worms hatched from these
eggs. In due course, after the worms from a mixed batch of healthy
and unhealthy eggs had spun, the sealed letter was opened and read,
and the prediction compared with the actual result, when it was found
that in twelve out of fourteen cases there was absolute conforinity be-
tween the prediction and the observation, for twelve hatchings were
predicted to turn out diseased, and this proved to be the case. Now
all these “educations” were believed to be healthy by the cultivators,
but Pasteur foretold that they would turn out to be diseased by the ap-
plication of the moth-test in the previous year. The other parcels of
eggs were pronounced by Pasteur to be sound, becanse they were laid
by healthy moths containing none of the micrococci, and both these
yielded a healthy crop. Sosuccessful a prophecy could not but gain the
belief of the most obtuse of cultivators, and we are nou suprised to learn
that Pasteur’s test was soon generally applied, and that the conse-
quence has been a return of prosperity to districts in which thousands
of homes had been desolated by a terrible scourge.

I must now ask you to accompany me to another and a new field of
Pasteur’s labors, which, perhaps more than his others, claims your sym-
pathy and will enlist your admiration, because they have opened out
to us the confident hope of at least obtaining an insight into some of
the inidden causes and therefore to the possible prevention of disease.

In the first place, I must recall to your remembrance that most infee-
tious diseases seldom if ever recur, and that even a slight attack ren-
ders the subject of it proof against a second one. Hence inoculation
from a mild case of small-pox was for a time practiced, but this too
often brought about a serious if not fatal attack of the malady, and the
steps taken by Jenner of vaccinating, that is of replacing for the serious
disease a slight one which nevertheless is sufficient protection against
small-pox infection, was one of the highest importance. But Jenner’s
great discovery has up to recent years remained an isolated one, for it
led to no general method for the preventive treatment of other maladies,
nor had any explanation been offered of its mode of action. It is to
Pasteur that science is indebted for the generalization of Jenner’s
method, and for an explanation which bids fair to render possible the
preventive treatment of many—if not of all—infectious diseases. It
was his experience, based upon his researches on fermentation, that led
toa knowledge of the nature of the poison of such diseases, and showed
the possibility of so attenuating or weakening the virus as to furnish a
general method of protective or preventive inoculation,
500 THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.

I have already pointed out how a pure cultivation of a microbe can be
effected. Just as the production of pure alcohol depends on the pres-
ence of the pure yeast, so special diseases are dependent on the presence
of certain definite organisms which can be artificially cultivated, and
which give rise to the special malady. Can we now by any system of
artificial cultivation so modify or weaken the virus of a given microbe
as to render it possible to inoculate a modified virus which, whilst it is
without danger to life, is still capable of acting as a preventive to fur-
ther attack? This is the question which Pasteur set himself to solve,
nor was the task by any means an apparently hopeless one. He had
not only the case of Jennerian vaccination before him, but also the well-
known modifications which cultivation can bring about in plants. The
first instance in which Pasteur succeeded in effecting this weakening
of the poison was in that of a fatal disease to which poultry in France
are very liable, called chicken cholera. Like many other maladies, this
is caused by the presence of a micro-organism found in the blood and
tissues of the stricken fowl. One drop of this blood brought under the
skin of a healthy chicken kills it, and the same microbe is found through-
out its body. And if a pure culture of these microbes be made, that
culture—even after a series of generations—is as deadly a poison as the
original blood. Now comes the discovery. If these cultures be kept
at a suitable temperature for some weeks exposed to pure air, and the
poisonous properties tested from time to time, the poison is found grad-
ually to become less powerful, so that after the lapse of two months a
dose which had formerly proved fatal now does not disturb in the
shghtest the apparent health of the fowl. But now let us inoculate a
chicken with this weakened virus. It suffers a slight illness, but soon
recovers. Next let us give it a dose of the undiluted poison, and, as a
control, let us try the action of the same on an unprotected bird. What
is the result? Why, that the first chicken remains unaffected, whilst
the second bird dies. The inoculation has rendered it exempt from the
disease, and this has been proved by Pasteur to be true in thousands
of cases, So that whereas the death-rate in certain districts amongst
fowls before the adoption of Pasteur’s inoculation method was 10 per
cent., after its general adoption it has diminished to less than 1 per
cent.

We can scarcely value too highly this discovery, for it proves that
the poisonous nature of the microbe is not unalterable, but that it can be
artificially modified and reduced, and thus an explanation is given of
the fact that in an epidemic the virus may either be preserved or be-
come exhausted according to the conditions to which it is subjected.
We have here to do with a case similar to that of Jenner’s vaccine,
except that here the relation between the weak and the strong poison
has become known tous, whilsc in Jenner’s case it has lain concealed.
This then is the first triumph of experimental inquiry into the cause
and prevention of microbic disease, and this method of attenuation is

——— CC
THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST. 501

of great importance, because, as we shali see, it is not confined to the
case of chicken cholera, but is applicable to other diseases.

And next I will speak of one which is a fatal scourge to cattle, and is
not unfrequently transmitted to man. It is called anthrax, splenic
fever, or woolsorters’ disease. This plague, which has proved fatal to
millions of cattle, is also due to a microbe, which can be cultivated like
the rest, and the virus of which can also be weakened or attenuated by
a distinct treatment which I will not here further specify. Now, what
is the effect of inoculating cattle or sheep with this weakened poison ?
Does it act as a preventive? That the answer is in the affirmative was
proved by Pasteur by a convincing experiment. Five-and-twenty
sheep, chosen promiscnously out of a tlock of fifty, were thus inoculated
with the weak virus, then after a time all the fifty were treated with the
strong poison. The first half remained healthy, all the others died of
anthrax. Since the discovery of this method, no fewer than 1,700,000
sheep and about 90,000 oxen have thus been inoculated, and last year
269,599 sheep and 34,464 oxen were treated. The mortality which
before the introduction of the preventive treatment, was in the case of
sheep 10 per cent., was, after the adoption of the method, reduced to
less than 1 per cent. So that now the farmers in the stricken districts
have all adopted the process, and agricultural insurance societies make
the preventive inoculation a sine qué non for insuring cattle in those dis-
tricts. This is however not the end of this part of my story, for Pas-
teur can not only thus render the anthrax poison harmless, but be has
taught us how to bring the highly virulent poison back again from the
harmless form. This may goto explain the varying strength of an at-
tack of infectious disease, one case being severe and another but slight,
due to the weakening or otherwise of the virus of the active microbe.

Last, but not least, I must refer to the most remarkable of all Pasteur’s
reseaches, that on rabies and hydrophobia. Previous to the year 15¢ 0,
when Pasteur began his study of this disease, next to nothing was
known about its nature. It was invested with the mysterious horror
which often accompanies the working of secret poisons, and the horror
was rendered greater owing to the fact that the development of the
poison brought in by the bite or by the lick of a mad dog might be de-
ferred for months, and that if after that length of time the symptoms
once make their appearance, a painful death was inevitable. We knew
indeed that the virus was contained in the dog’s saliva, but experiments
made upon the inoculation of the saliva had led to no definite results,
and we were entirely in the dark as to the action of the poison until
Pasteur’s investigation. To begin with, he came to the conclusion that
the disease was one localized in the nerve-centers, and to the nerve-
centers he therefore looked as the seat of the virus or of the microbe.
And he proved by experiment that this is the case, for a portion of the
matter of the spinal column of a rabid dog, when injected into a healthy
one, causes rabies with a much greater degree of certainty and rapidity
502 THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.

than does the injection of the saliva. Here then we have one step in
advance. The disease is one of the nerve-centers, and therefore it
only exhibits itself when the nerve-centers are attacked. And this
goes to explain the varying times of incubation which the attack ex-
hibits. The virus has to travel up the spinal cord before the symptoms
can manifest themselves, and the length of time taken over that jour-
ney depends on many circumstances. If this be so, the period of ineu-
bation must be lessened if the virus is at once introduced into the
nerve-centers. This was also proved to be the case, for dogs inoculated
under the dura mater invariably became rabid within a period rarely
exceeding eighteen days.

Next came the question, can this virus be weakened, as has been
proved possible with the former poisons? The difficulty in this case
was greater, inasmuch as all attempts to isolate or to cultivate the
special microbe of rabies outside the animal body had failed. But Pas-
teur’s energy and foresight overcame this difficulty, and a method was
discovered by which this terrible poison can so far be weakened as to
lose its virulent character, but yet remain potent enough, like the cases
already quoted, to act as a preventive ; and dogs which had thus been
inocvlated were proved to be so perfectly protected, that they might be
bitten with impunity by mad dogs, or inoculated harmlessly with the
most powerful rabie virus.

But yet another step. Would the preventive action of the weakened
virus hold good when it is inoculated even after the bite? If so, it
might be thus possible to save the lives of persons bitten by mad dogs.
Well, experiment has also proved this to be true, for a number of dogs
were bitten by mad ones, or were inoculated under the skin with rabic
virus; of these some were subjected to the preventive cure and others
not thus treated. Of the first or protected series not one became mad;
of the other, or unprotected dogs, a large number died with all the
characteristic symptoms of the disease. But it was one thing to thus
experiment upon dogs, and quite another thing, as you may well imag-
ine, to subject human beings to so novel and perhaps dangerous a treat-
ment. Nevertheless, Pasteur was bold enough to take this necessary
step, and by so doing has earned the gratitude of the human race.

In front of the Pasteur Institute in Paris stands a statue worked
with consummate skill in bronze. It represents a French shepherd boy
engaged in a death struggle with a mad dog which had been worrying
his sheep. With his bare hands, and with no weapon save his wooden
sabot, the boy was successful in the combat. He killed the dog, but
was horribly bitten in the fight. The group represents no mythical
struggle; the actual event took place in October, 1885; and this boy,
Jupille, was the second person to undergo the anti-rabic treatment,
which proved perfectly successful, for he remained perfectly healthy,
and his heroic deed and its consequences have become historic. ‘C’est
le premier pas qui coute,” and as soon as the first man had been success-
fully treated others similarly situated gladly availed themselves of Pas-
THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST. 503

teur’s generous offer to treat them gratuitously. And as soon as this
cure became generally known crowds of persons of all ages, stations,
and countries, all bitten by rabid animals, visited every day Pasteur’s
laboratory in the Rue @U1m, which, from being one in which quiet scien-
tific researches were carried on, came to resemble the out-patient de-
partment of a great hospital. There I saw the French peasant, the
Russian mowik (suffering from the terrible bites of rabid wolves), the
swarthy Arab, the English policeman, with women too and children of
every age; in all perhaps a hundred patients. All were there under-
going the careful and kindly treatment, which was to insure them
against a horrible death. Such a sight will not be easily forgotten.
By degrees this wonderful cure for so deadly a disease attracted the
attention of men of science throughout the civilized world. The French
nation raised a monument to the discoverer better than any statue in
the shape of the “ Pasteur Institute,” an institution devoted to carry-
ing out in practice this anti-rabic treatment, with laboratories and every
other convenience for extending by research our knowledge of the pre-
ventive treatment of infectious disease.

For be it remembered, we are only at the beginning of these things,
and what has been done is only an inkling of what is to come. Since
1885, twenty anti-rabie institutions have been established in various
parts of the world, including Naples, Palermo, Odessa, St. Petersburg,
Constantinople, Rio Janeiro, Buenos Ayres, and Havana.

We in England have also taken our share, though a small one, in
this work. In 1885, 1 moved in the House of Commons for a committee
to investigate and report on Pasteuv’s anti-rabic method of treatment.
This committee consisted of trusted and well-known English men of
science and physicians—Sir James Paget, Sir Joseph Lister, Drs. Bur-
don Sanderson, Lauder Brunton, Quain, Fleming, and myself, with
Prof. Victor Horsley as secretary. We examined the whole subject,
investigated the details of a number of cases, repeated Pasteur’s experi-
ments on animals, discussed the published statistics, and arrived unani-
mously at the opinion that Pasteur was justified in his conclusions, and
that his anti-rabie treatment had conferred a great and lasting benefit
on mankind. Since then His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who
always takes a vivid interest in questions affecting the well-being of
the people, has visited the Pasteur Institute, and has expressed himself
strongly in favor of a movement, started by the present lord mayor of
London, for showing to Pasteur, by a substantial grant to his Institute,
our gratitude for what he has done to relieve upwards of two hundred
and fifty of our countrymen who have undergone treatment at his
hands, and likewise to enable poor persons who have been bitten to
undertake the journey to Paris, and the sojourn there necessary for
their treatment. This lasts about a fortnight, it is nearly painless, and
no single case of illness, much less of hydrophobia, due to the prevent-
ive treatment, has occurred amongst the seven thousand persons who
have so far undergone the cure.
504 THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.

Now let me put before you the answer to the question: Is this treat-
ment a real cure? For this has been doubted by persons, some of
whom will, I fear, still doubt, or profess to doubt, and still abuse Pasteur
whatever is said or done! From all that can be learned about the
matter, it appears pretty certain that about from fifteen to twenty per-
sons out of every hundred bitten by mad dogs or cats, and not treated
by Pasteur’s method, develop the disease, for I need scarcely add that
all other methods of treatment have proved fallacious ; but bites on the
face are much more dangerous, the proportion of fatal cases reaching
80 per cent. Now of two thousand one hundred and sixty-four persons
treated in the Pasteur Institute, from November 1885, to January 1887,
only thirty-two died, showing a mortality of 1.4 per cent. instead of 15

to 20, and amongst these upwards of two thousand persons, two hun--

dred and fourteen had been bitten on the face, a class of wounds in
which, as I have said, when untreated, the mortality is very high; so
that the reduction in the death-rate seems more remarkable, especially
when we learn that in all these cases the animal inflicting the wound
had been proved to be rabid. The same thing occurs even in a more
marked degree in 1887 and 1888. In 1887, one thousand seven hun-
dred and seventy-eight cases were treated with a mortality of 1.3 per
cent., while last year one thousand six hundred and twenty-six cases
were treated, with a mortality of 1.16 per cent.*

Statistics of the anti-rabic treatment in other countries show similar
results, proving beyond a doubt that the death-rate from hydrophobia
is greatly reduced. Indeed, it may truly be said that in no case of
dangerous disease, treated either by medicine or surgery, is a cure so
probable. Moreover, in spite of assertions to the contrary, no proof
can be given that in any single case did death arise from the treatment
itself. And as showing the safety of the inoculation, I may add that
all Pasteur’s assistants and laboratory workers have undergone the
treatment, and no case of hydrophobia has occurred amongst them.

You are no doubt aware that Pasteur’s anti-rabic treatment has been
strongly opposed by certain persons, some of whom have not scrupled
to descend to personal abuse of a virulent character of those who in
any way encouraged or supported Pasteur’s views, and all of whom
persistently deny that anything good has come or can come from
investigations of the kind. Such persons we need neither fear nor
hate. Their opposition is as powerless to arrest the march of science
as was King Canute’s order to stop the rising tide. Only let us rest
upon the sure basis of exactly ascertained fact, and we may safely defy
alike the vaporings of the sentimentalist, and the wrath of the oppo-
nent of scientific progress. But opposition of a much fairer character
has likewise to be met, and it has with propriety been asked: How
comes it that Pasteur is not uniformly successful? Why (if what you
tell us is true) do any deaths at all follow the anti-rabic treatment ?

THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST. 505

The answer is not far to seek. In the first place, just as it is not every
vaccination which protects against small-pox, so Pasteur’s vaccination
against rabies occasionally fails. Then again, Pasteur’s treatment is
really a race between a strong and an attenuated virus. In cases in
which the bite occurs near a nerve-center, the fatal malady may outstrip
the treatment in this race between life and death. If the weakened
virus can act in time, it means life. If the strong virus acts first, pre-
vention comes too late,—it means death. So that the treatment is not
doubtful in all cases, but only doubtful in those which are under well-
known unfavorable conditions. This it seems to me is a complete
reply to those who ignorantly fancy that, because Pasteur’s treatment
has not cured every case, it must be unreliable and worthless.

One word more. I have said that Pasteur is still—as he has always
been—a chemist. How does this fit in with the fact that his recent
researches seem to be entirely of a biological character? Thisis true,
They seem, but they really are not. Let me in a few sentences explain
what I mean. You know that yeast produces a peculiar chemical sub-
stance—alcohol. How it does so we can not yet explain, but the fact
remains. Gradually, through Pasteur’s researches, we are coming to
understand that this is not an isolated case, but that the growth of
every micro-organism is productive of some special chemical substance,
and that the true pathogenic virus—or the poison causing the disease—
is not the microbe itself, but the chemical compound which its growth
creates. Here once more “to the solid ground of nature trusts the
man that builds for aye,” and it is only by experiment that these things
can be learnt.

Let me illustrate this by the most recent and perhaps the most strik-
ing example we know of. The disease of diphtheria is accompanied by
a peculiar microbe, which however only grows outside, as it were, of
the body, but death often takes place with frightful rapidity. This
takes place not by any action of the microbe itself, but by simple poi-
soning due to the products of the growing organism, which penetrate
into the system, although the microbe does not. This diphtheritic

Bacillus can be cultivated, and the chemical poison which it produces
can be completely separated by filtration from the microbe itself, just
as alcohol can be separated from the yeast granules. If this be done,
and one drop of this pellucid liquid given to an animal, that animal
dies with all the well-known symptoms of the disease. This, and sim-
ilar experiments made with the microbes of other diseases, lead to the
conclusion that in infectious maladies the cause of death is poisoning
by a distinct chemical compound, the microbe being not only the means
of spreading the infection, but also the manufacturer of the poison.
But more than this, it has lately been proved that a small dose of these
soluble chemical poisons confers immunity. If the poison be adminis-
tered in such a manner as to avoid speedy poisoning, but so as gradually
to accustom the animal to its presence, the creature becomes not only
506 THE LIFE-WORK OF A CHEMIST.

refractory to toxic doses of the poison, but also even to the microbe
itself. So that instead of introducing the micro-organism itself into
the body, it may now only be necessary to vaccinate with a chemical
substance which in large doses brings about the disease, but in small
ones confers immunity from it, reminding one of Hahnemann’s dictum
of “ Similia similibus curantur.”

Here then we are once more on chemical ground. True, on ground
which is full of unexplained wonders, which however depend on laws
we are at least in part acquainted with, so that we may in good heart
undertake their investigation, and look forward to the time when
knowledge will take the place of wonder.

In conclusion, I feel that some sort of apology is needed in thus
bringing a rather serious piece of business before you on this occasion.
Still I hope for your forgiveness, as my motive has been to explain to
you as Clearly as I could the life-work of a chemist who has in my
opinion conferred benefits as yet untold and perhaps unexampled on
mankind, and I may be allowed to close my discourse with the noble
words of our hero spoken at the opening of the Pasteur Institute in
the presence of the President of the French Republic:

‘‘Two adverse laws seem to me now in contest. One law of blood
and death, opening out each day new modes of destruction, forces
nations to.be always ready for the battle-field. The other a law of
peace, of work, of safety, whose only study is to deliver man from the
calamities which beset him.

‘“‘The one seeks only violent conquests. The other only the relief of
humanity. The one places a single life above all victories. The other
sacrifices the lives of hundreds of thousands to the ambition of a single
individual. The law of which we are the instruments, strives even
through the carnage to cure the bloody wounds caused by this law of
war. Treatment by our antiseptic methods may preserve thousands
of soldiers.

‘“‘Which of these two laws will prevail over the other? God only
knows. But of this we may be sure, that science in obeying this law
of humanity will always labor to enlarge the frontiers of life.”

Translated by Miss Henrinrra SZOLD,

Were it desirable to single out the rarest and most admirable among
the many fine qualities of the great and good scholar to whose memory
these lines are devoted, I should not hesitate to name the perfect self-
denial which at all times prompted him to place his unparallelled attain-
ments at the disposal of others. Among German orientalists (if Assyrio-
logists be excepted), few will be found who have not profited by his un-
selfishness ; and abroad likewise there are many who are similarly in-
debted. Weal] knew where to seek when our meager stores were on the
point of giving out, and we stood in need of the gifts with which his treas-
ure-houses were abundantly filled. In dispensing these to great and small,
he was untiring, generous, and impartial as God’s sun which shines
upon the just and the unjust alike. More than a year has passed since
his hand has grown numb and his eye dim, but where do they linger
who should have hastened to his grave, and wreathed with tributes of
gratitude the hillock which nature, slow though her processes are, has
twice decked with fresh verdure? I blame, I accuse no one. Many a
shrinking soul hides its gratitude in reverential silence rather than pa-
rade fine and tender feelings in the market-place. Doubtless there are
others who reluctantly find themselves forced by the cares of existence,
by daily new burthensome tasks, to deny themselves the fulfillment of a
warmly cherished desire. And most probably there are still others,
here and there, who, like the writer of these words, are even now, after
unavoidable delay, on the point of paying the long-planned tribute of
piety. Nevertheless it remains a sad fact that, with the exception of
the somewhat business-like though not unsympathetic announcements
of the French Institute and of the Bavarian Academy, the brief remarks,
accompanying an excellent portrait of Fleischer in the Leipzig [llustrirte
Zeitung, an article in the New York Times, and a barren notice in the
London Athenwum, only two attempts have up to this time been made
to give adequate and becoming treatment to the work of this distin-
guished scholar: Thorbecke’s sketch in the Journal of the German

Oriental Society, and the more extended memorial address by Goldziher
before the Hungarian Academy. Indeed it will ever be humiliating to
German orientalists, that although more than a year has elapsed since
Fleischer’s death, the only searching analysis published of his great
activity as a scholar and a teacher (and such Goldziher’s* essay ob-
viously is), has been written by an Hungarian in his native language,
with which no one of us is conversant.

In fact, the number is not very great of those who may without pre-
sumption undertake an exhaustive treatment of the life of so distin-
guished a scholar. I am far from counting myself among that number,
but I believe I have learned enough to enable me to appreciate to a
certain extent the great ability of him who acquired such vast learning
by means of his own exertions; and I trust I have sufficient judg-
ment to designate at least approximately the rank and position due
my deceased teacher in the history of our science. Precisely here
I can not permit the motive of modesty to hinder me from attempt-
ing this task, for the reader who is interested in the science of Indo-
European languages may justly wish to gain an idea of the general atti-
tude of a scholar whose investigations border upon his own sphere.
That my task also involves the duty of pointing ont the natural limita-
tions of his activity shall not hinder me from carrying out my intention.
Next to unselfishness, Fleischer’s most prominent trait as a scholar
was his love of truth. He himself would be the first to censure me if
I were to sketch his personality in white on a white back-ground, ae- .
cording to the latest fashion among painters. Admiration without criti-
cism is valueless. If, feeling the former, I venture to use the latter, no
one may charge me with presumptuousness. He is a poor master who
trains disciples bereft of the critical faculty; a poor disciple he who
leans unquestioningly upon the authority of even a deeply-revered
master. I must however refrain from giving a detailed description of
the purely human side of his being and life, incomplete though his pic-
ture will thus remain. I consider it improper to forestall a full presen-
tation by one more qualified for this task, who can base his assertions
upon intimate acquaintance with all the incidents and relations of his
private life. I shall confine myself to outlines, the data for which I
owe to the kindness of Prof. Dr. Curt Fleischer, of Meissen. They thus
may claim reliability on those points in which they disagree with state-
ments published elsewhere.

Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer was born at Schandau on February 71,
1801. His father, Johann Gottfried Fleischer, an officer in the custom-
service. died at the age of eighty-nine, on August 24, 1860, at Pirna,
enjoying at that time a pension as inspector of customs. His mother,
whom he lost as early as August 10,1825, was the daughter of the

parish schoolmaster Unruh, at Prietitz, near Pulsnitz. At Schandau
the boy attended the public school, where his talents soon attracted
the attention of the principal, Edelmann, who undertook to teach young
Fleischer the elements of Latin. Thus his father was enabled to enter
him in 1814, as a student at the high-school in Bautzen, where he re-
mained until 1819. Here he was instructed in Hebrew, thus for the
first time coming in contact with the Orient. When next he Lecame
interested in an HKastern subject it was by chance, and it decided his
whole future career. He accidentally found among the wrapping-paper
of a cheese-dealer at market sheets of an Arabic grammar, to the study
ot which he at once applied himself. He became so deeply interested that
when he entered upon his course in the University of Leipzig at Easter,
1819, he not only did not neglect his theological pursuits, nor fail to
devote himself under the guidance of Gottfried Hermann to classical
studies, but he also indulged his love for Orientalia. In fact, after hav-
ing passed with distinction a theological examination, he spent one more
year in the exclusive study of Oriental languages. He soon arrived at
the conviction that it was necessary for him to be at Paris with De Sacy.
By the assistance of a young French merchant named Bernard, with
whom he had become acquainted, he succeeded in obtaining a position
as tutor in the household of Mons. de Caulaincourt (under Napoleon
Duke of Vicenza). On March 4, he received his degree, and on April 18,
he began his journey to Paris. For one year and a half he was in Caul-
aincourt’s house. Later he lived alone, earning a livelihood by giving
private lessons. But during the whole time he was zealously occupied
with his studies under De Sacy, paying particular attention to Arabic,
Persian, and Turkish. The impression made upon him by the great
French savant was never obliterated,—neither by the work, nor the suc-
cess, nor the honors with which his long life was replete. He continued
to pay the tribute of love and esteem to his master long after he himself
had come to belooked upon as the master Arabist. At thesame time he
made diligent use of the valuable manuscripts in the library. Thus,
the first essay published by him was a review, in the Journal Asiatique
of 1827, of the first volume of Habicht’s edition of the Thousand and
One Nights, based upon Galland’s manuscript. His editions of Abul-
feda and Beidhawi, as well as the essay, De glossis Habichtianis, all pub-
lished later on, are also proofs of his industry in gathering material
while at Paris. At the same time he sought the society of Orientals,
especially of two Egyptians, a Mohammedan—Refa’a, and a Christian—
Aydé, both mentioned honoris causa in the above-named essay. Al-
though the article in the Journal Asiatique shows that he was a ripe
scholar at that time, he continued to devote himself after his return, in
1828, to private study, partly at his own home and partly at Dresden,
where he catalogued the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts in
the royal library. The catalogue was published at Leipzig in 1831;
likewise, his edition and translation of Abulfeda’s Historia ante-islamica,
510 MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER.

Both publications proved that he had reached the goal which he had
been pursuing during a twelve years’ preparatory period, entailing con-
stant hard work and manifold sacrifices. In the preface to Abulfeda
he deplores the fewness of his notes, and craves indulgence for himself
on the plea of being a homo lectionis pauce, memorie paucioris, otit pau-
cissimi. But the character of his work is such as to invalidate all but
the last of the three excuses. Meantime he had accepted in 1831, a
position as teacher in the Kreuz high-school at Dresden. Here he re-
mained until 1835, when, the above-mentioned works having spread his
fame, he was offered a professorship at St. Petersburg, later filled by
Dorn. He wasabout to eave for Russia, when, in the nick of time, the
offer of a fuil professorship of Oriental languages, at his own university
of Leipzig, reached him. He was elected on October 19, 1835, but did
not enter upon the duties of his position until Easter, 1836. At first
he was considered a member of the theological faculty, but early inthe
next decade he was permitted, after active agitation on his own part, to
pass over to the philosophical faculty. On September 27, 1836, he mar-
ried Ernestine Mathilde Jiissing, of Bautzen, the daughter of Friedrich
Leberecht Jiissing, retired brigade judge of the royal Saxon service,
who lived at that time in Dresden, He was permitted to celebrate, with
his faithful and affectionate wife, who still survives, the fiftieth anni-
versary of his wedding-day, and was blessed with the joy—marred only
by the death of their eldest daughter—of seeing their children occupy
positions of honor in the community. Not less happy was his domestic
life, than were his official and scientific undertakings. When, in
1846, the Royal Saxon Scientific Society was founded, he at once became
anactive member. In1855, he became its assistant secretary, and later,
secretary in chief, a position which he filled with his customary secrupu-
lousness until 1883. In 1860, he received an honorable call from Berlin.
He refused the offer, remaining faithful to his native land until his
death.

When Fleischer entered upon his professorship in Leipzig, in 1836,
Arabic-Mohammedan studies had begun to flourish in all parts of Ger-
many. Between 1819 and 1829 there had been published five of the
Mo’allagat, with the scholia of Zauzani, by Kosegarten, Hengstenberg,
Rosenmiiller, and Vullers; in 1828, the text of the Hamdsa, by Freytag;
between 1825 and 1831, the first six volumes of Habicht’s Thousand
and One Nights; and in 1828, Kosegarten’s Chrestomathy ; Freytag’s
Arabic Poetics (1830), and the first volume of his great lexicon (1830),
as well as the beginning of Ewald’s Grammatica critica (1831), had es-
tablished the principle that the edition of texts should be prepared
with due regard to the laws of the language. Meantime another Ger-
man scholar—Friihn, in the service of the Russian Government, by his
Recensio (1826), had laid a scientific foundation for Islamic numismatics.
Dorn was beginning to assist the Petersburg investigator, and Hammer-
Purgstall, unflagging, continued his magnificent work at Vienna, The
MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER. Gala

last-mentioned scholars prove that the increased interest in Arabic
subjects can not be traced entirely to outward causes, but should be
connected with the renascence in Germany of philological studies from
an historical point of view. On the other hand, the efforts of the first
set of scholars depend entirely upon the work of De Sacy, who had
been the teacher of Kosegarten and Freytag, and indirectly through
the latter, also of Vullers and Hengstenberg. Even Ewald, inde-
pendent though he was, and striving to master for linguistic purposes,
the material bequeathed by Arabian grammarians, had to lean upon
De Sacy in the development of the main features of his plan.

The times have been when it was customary, if not with Fleischer
himself, at any rate with a few of his disciples, to treat somewhat con-
temptuously the efforts of men like Freytag and Hammer-Purgstall in
behalf of Arabic philology. I myself must confess to the youthful folly
of having, in my first very imperfect essay, spoken of Hammer in a way
which even vivid remembrance of Ahlwardt’s Chalaf could not excuse,
certainly not justify. DeServedly, I was at once reproved by a more
sensible fellow-worker.* Freytag was also judged unkindly, though per-
haps not with equal severity. Even the numberless corrections which
had to be made in his lexicon, and will of necessity ever continue to be
made, cannotalter the fact thatit wasan eminent performance at the time
of its compilation, and still remains an exceedingly useful work. Nat-
urally, neither Hammer nor Freytag, neither Kosegarten nor Vullers
can bear comparison with the master mind at Paris. The last three are
docile disciples, who praiseworthy for industry, and estimable for at-
tainments, do no more than follow in the footsteps of their master, with-
out reaching him, even in their happiest moments. Hammer, on the
other hand, was never more than a highly gifted dilettante, whose desire
for novelties stifled the faculty of maturing ideas. His capacity for
work was unbounded; its results however laid down in numerous volumes,
but appartntly solve the vast problems of history and literature. On
his bold excursions, he often paved the way to fieids hitherto inaccessi-
ble, but keenly discovered by him to be worthy of cultivation. It will
always remain his distinction that he made it possible for us to gain a
bird’s-eye view over such fields, and cursory though it was, it is still
valuable on all points in which detailed research has not replaced bis
superficial statements by more reliable data. Hence it is not astonish-
ing that the Vienna Orientalist enjoyed undisputed fame and exerted
great influence in the first third of this century. Thus the danger was
imminent, that his virtues being inseparable from his personality, his
pupils and imitators might after his death seize only upon his weak
points and develop them into a radically false and highly dangerous
system. It is doubtful whether any of the German representatives of
DeSacy would have been able successfully to combat this method. De-
spite their merits, not one of the investigators named was distinguished

by that combination of wide knowledge and philological accuracy which
had marked De Sacy’s work, and which—in case his death occurred as
early as was feared,* would have to be the characteristics of a successor,
whose influence was to counteract Hammer’s. Kosegarten approached
this ideal most closely, unless we except Rédiger, who if not totally in-
dependent of De Sacy, had atleast not been trained in his school. But
neither devoted himself exclusively to Arabic-Mohammedan philology ;
and the same objection, to a still stronger degree, holds of Riickert,
whose interests were chiefly poetic. Thus it was Fleischer alone in
whom the ideal was fully realized. To him therefore naturally fell the
task of placing our science upon the same eminence in Germany that
it had oceupied under De Sacy in France,—a task rendered difficult by
the necessity of guiding it so that it might permanently be rescued trom
the crooked path into which it might have been forced under Hammer’s
influence.

It is impossible for me to judge whether Fleischer, at the time of en-
tering upon the duties of his Leipzig professorship, had conceived his
mission as clearly as we can now formulate it after its accomplish-
ment. At all events, the two essays with which he introduced himself
upon the arena of his fature successes seems to bear unequivocal signs
that this was his conscious goal. When he was no more than “ Pro-
fessor-elect of Oriental languages at the University of Leipzig,” he pub-
lished, while at Dresden, his translation of Zamachshari’s Golden Neck-
laces, with a preface and notes, containing a sharp attack on Hammer’s
edition and translation of the same text. Almost at the same time he
reviewed Habicht’s glosses, in which there is surely no lack of grave
mistakes. In this last review his tone was the mildest imaginable,
and later, even when dealing with bunglers of the worst sort, he never
became vehement. If then in opposing Hammer he made use of more
violent language, he must have been actuated by serious and far-reach-
ing considerations. In fact, he states them at the beginning of the
preface in these words: “If highly esteemed scholars in possession of
every facility, at a time when science has reached its manhood, give
thoroughly useless work to the world, what should be the attitude of
criticism? Itis our opinion that its sharpest weapons should be di-
rected against such abuses, and in this case it should combat even such
as are really beneath criticism, in order that their becoming contagious
may be prevented.” The man, comparatively speaking a novice, who
thus met a scholar, universally looked upon as the most eminent orien-
talist in Germany, must have felt the assurance of victory. The con-
tents of his essay justified his bold language, and a still further justifi-

cation was furnished by his Dissertatio critica de glossis Habichtianis

in quatuor priores tomos MI noctium, which appeared in the following
year (1836), on the occasion of his entering upon the duties of his ebhair.

“Arabian Nights,” require complete mastery of the whole domain of
Arabic-Mohammedan life, for a thorough understanding of all the
difficulties that grow out of the language and the subject-matter. Of
this mastery the essay testifies abundantly, as it does of the unerring
philological tact of the critic, whose emendations by no means are the
happy suggestions of an ingenious mind, but rather the results of wide
linguistic and historical knowledge, and of intimate acquaintance with
the habits of copyists and the manner of transmitting manuscripts.
For obvious reasons, it is not easy—and so far as Iam concerned it
is at this moment not possible—to trace the impression made by the
two essays when first published; but their success shows that it must
have been deep and lasting. The same complete mastery of the sub-
ject is displayed by Fleischer’s next works: Alv’s One Hundred Proverbs
(1837), a description of the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish manuscripts
in the Catalogus Librorum MSS. Bibl. Civit. Lipsiensis (1838), and the
completion of, Habicht’s edition of the Arabian Nights (vols. [xX—x11,
184243). But the character of the subjects treated in these works was
not calculated to confer controlling influence upon them. Likewise his
edition in 1847 of Mirza Mohammed Ibrahim’s Grammar of the modern
Persian Language (2d edition, 1875), merely strengthened the impression
derived from Ali’s Proverbs, that this scholar had as wide an acquain-
tance with Persian as with Arabic. Thus, directly or indirectly, it
must be duc to these two short essays that Fleischer, as early as the
fourth decade of this century, was freely acknowledged by all, except-
ing perhaps the immediate followers of Hammer, as the chief of Ger-
man orientalists. In fact, from that time on for a period of nearly half
a century, he became the chosen guide of all Germans and many
foreigners, desirous of thorough disciplining in Arabic-Mohammedan
philology. The impression created by these two works was so strong,
because they are an exemplification of the true philological method for
which the Germans, after the death of Reiske, the vir incomparabilis,
once more had to resort to the Frenchman De Sacy,—a method which
is nothing less than the use of common sense, coupled on the one hand
with faithful, untiring efforts to attain to the greatest possible complete-
ness and to scrupulous accuracy in the collecting and sifting of the
material handed down to us, and forbidding, on the other hand, all ar-
bitrariness, however ingenious, as well as all superficiality, however
grandiose. This definition by no means puts an interdict upon clever-
ness on the part of the philologist thus gifted. It merely provides that
cleverness must manifest itselfin mastering the details acquired, not in
speciously hiding the imperfections of scientific research and then sat-
isfying one’s conscience by a perfunctory though minute adherence to a
traditional method. That Fleischer realized in himself this ideal of a
philologist perhaps best marks his importance in the history of science ;
his example as well as his precept have made it possible for all to gaina
knowledge of the correct method to be used in our department of re-

search. Many of the most prominent scholars of the present day have
in other ways arrived at a knowledge of this method, or have been in-
tuitively gifted with it, but its spread to extended circles we owe to
Fleischer, and to him alone.

His disinclination to treat philological subjects according to routine
methods was shown by Fleischer in his edition of Beidhawi’s Coran com-
mentary, which completed his fame, and which, in a way is to be con-
sidered the most important work of his life. He, Gottfried Hermann’s
disciple, who surely knew what elements constitute a ‘“‘ methodical”
edition of a work, published this voluminous and difficult text with-
out any variant readings. I have elsewhere* shown what consider-
ations, in my opinion, justly led him to adopt a system unusual
even with himself. The character of a Coran commentary is, in every
respect, technical. He who would understand and edit it must first
have extensive and detailed acquaintance with the contents and techni-
cal peculiarities of the theological, juridical, and grammatical ‘system
of the Islam. But so enviable a scholar, aided by all available manu-
scripts and super-commentaries, certainly has the ability in every case
to select the correct reading; and superfluous readings serve but to
confuse less learned readers. The responsibility incurred by an editor
who takes it upon himself to omit customary technicalities is propor-
tionately great. But whoever heard Fleiescher himself interpret his
own Beidhawi a single time, was forever delivered from all uneasiness
on the score of his power to meet such responsibility. This edition is
naturally not purged of every human imperfection. Fieischer himself,
in a lecture on one oceasion, expressed his vexation that after the

w

word \\ \ had escaped him. (Cf. Fell?’s Indez, p. 67.) But such

instances assuredly are not numerous. On another occasion he related
that a copy of his book—(I no longer remember how and when)—had
been submitted to the Sheikh-ul-Islam at Constantinople, and that the
latter had considered it beneath his dignity to throw even a superficial
glance at an ignorant infidel’s disfigurement of the classical work of
Mohammedan theology. Finally however he had opened it and
glanced at a few lines; then, amazed had eagerly continued to read,
at last giving expression to his astonishment that, in the Occident, there
could exist a man who apparently understood Beidhawi as well as an
orthodox doctor. I quote these remarks of Fleischer, which I heard
myself, since I should consider it presumption were I to praise his
Beidhawi. He only has the privilege of doing this who is so well
versed in Muslim theology, that he might on a proper occasion, criticise
it. Whether there are—outside of the Orient—a half-dozen scholars

MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER. 5615

who may venture to make this assertion is doubtful; at all events, I do
not reckon myself among them.

Aside from a small edition of the Hermes trismegistus, written in 1870,
ona special occasion, Beidhawi is the last work published by Fleischer
without assistance. Even Beidhawi was not complete when it left the
hands of the publisher. For years the Indices weighed heavily upon
his conscientious mind, until finally in 1878, they were brought out by
the helpful aid of Fell. With reference to this unusual delay, Fleischer
said in the preface with which he introduces his pupil’s work: “ Qué
me resque meas norunt, eos me ultro excusatum habere scio,” and his mean-
ing was evident to all. During the period while he was busy with the
Beidhawi text, the claims made upon him from all sides had inereased
with his growing fame. These claims were put forth chiefly by three
parties: his pupils, his co-laborers, and the community at large. His
manner of satisfying them illustrates the most admirable traits in his
character: extreme conscientiousness, faithful attention to the shghtest
details, affability and absolute unselfishness.

His conscientiousness and faithfulness were pre-eminently evinced in
his academic labors, as I can testify from personal experience in the
years 1867 and 1868. He knew Beidhawi thoroughly ; daily, at any
chance occasion, he excited admiration by his clear explanation of the
doctrines of Mohammedan scholasticism, or by his equally correct way
of tracing the history of a word and its development in meaning from
the Arabic through the Persian to the Turkish,—all this without refer-
ring, except in rare instances, to his inter-leaved copy of Freytag,
famous on account of its marginal notes, literally covering the text as
well as the inter-leaves. Yet he never lectured on Beidhawi without
- preparation. His students, coming to attend a lecture at his study
early in the morning, frequently found him standing by a high desk,
the text and a copy of Sheikh Zade’s super-commentary lying before
him. In his “Arabic Association,” difficult passages in various texts
were discussed, opportunity was given to gain practice in the reading
of manuscripts, ete. But outside of this, he gave instruction, at the
period spoken of, only in the writings of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish
authors. The texts selected for reading varied, frequently according
to the wishes of the students. But the two lectures a week on Beid-
hawi were inviolable. In these, he himself translated and explained,
frequently cross-questioning his hearers, in order to assure himself that
they had grasped his meaning and were making good progress. In
the remaining four to six hours a week, Arabic, Persian, and Turkish
texts were given to the students to translate, their transiations being
corrected and elucidated by the professor on the spot. In conducting
this exercise his talk wandered from topic to topic, so that in looking
back it appears that not the reading of the texts was of prime impor-
tance, but rather the wealth of information, relating to the subject-
matter, chiefly however of a linguistic nature, which he fairly showered
516 MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER.

from out of the plenitude of his learning upon the eagerly listening
and busily writing members of his class. Aside from the numerous
additions to one’s knowledge, his apparently irregular and digressive
method of instruction possessed the advantage of at once ushering the
student into the Mohammedan world of language and ideas, giving him a
vivid conception of the wealth and pliability of the Arabic idiom, and
most emphatically reminding him at every turn of the necessity of being
accurate in the slightest detai]. Naturally it was at the same time
necessary to pursue private study systematically and unremittingly,
and it was pre-supposed as a matter of course. He who could and
would work, had to acquire rapidly a knowledge of the languages, and
yield with docility to a training in habits of accuracy ; the essentials
of Arabic, indeed of all philology. The undeniable but doubtless in-
tentional one-sidedness of this method is justified by the necessity of
helping the pupils to ground themselves thoroughly in these funda-
menrtals. If I have been correctly informed, Fleischer in earlier years
delivered regular courses of lectures, as for instance on the doctrinal
theology of the Islam. From this it can be inferred that his later
method meant to lay increased stress upon the important and essential
points which he had always emphasized. We were charged to acquire
Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, and to rid ourselves radically of any
tendency to superficiality. Having done that, we were prepared as
far as our ability went to do independent and philologically accurate
work in whatever special field any one of us might choose. However,
even from this point of view, there is one more desideratum, appa-
rently unprovided for in this method, namely, a knowledge of the tech-
nical working principles of philology, in any event a highly desirable
equipment of the future philologist. But every one had the opportu-
nity of acquiring them while preparing his thesis. For Fleischer’s ac-
tivity as a teacher was by no means at an end when he had appeared
in the lecture room eight or ten times a week. His library, his knowl-
edge, his talents were at the disposal of his pupils, and if any one of them
in his first attempt at editing a text was perplexed by some difficult pas-
sage in the manuscript, he needed but to apply to his ever-obliging
teacher to have the difficulty cleared away. Either he might content
himself with carrying away the ready explanation or emendation, or if
he attended intelligently, he might, in addition, derive the restricted
number of principles and tricks of method, which, in fact, can be
summed up in the direction to scrutinize carefully the manuscript to be
explained and in the observance of the two main injunctions in Lehrs’s
philological decalogue: ‘‘Thou shalt not prostrate thyself before manu-
scripts,” and “ Thou shalt not take the name method in vain.” Finally,
when the time came for the young scholar to leave Leipzig, perhaps
soon after receiving his degree, the bond that linked him to Fleischer
was by no means severed. Whenever and in whatever way he wished
he could apply to Fleischer for a solution of problems and difficulties,
MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER, 517

In his kindness of heart he was indefatigable in replying and explain-
ing, often himself correcting proof-sheet upon proof-sheet. Each of us
was sure to find in him as long as we lived a firm scientific support.
I do not care to mar this remembrance of a teacher’s touching unselfish-
ness and faithfulness by questioning whether these characteristics were
always appealed to with the reserve rendered doubly necessary by so
ample a benevolence. He himself never gave this question a thought.
He existed for his pupils as long as he supposed them at all interested
in science. Therefore no one called him anything but “the Sheikh ;”
unless led by the exuberant spirits of youth, we translated the Arabic
expression by *‘ the old man” (which after all was indicative of our un-
bounded respect for him), for this Arabic title of honor conveys an idea
of the parental relation existing between the teacher and the pupil,
which is assumed as a matter of course in the Mohammedan Kast.
But he was not our “Sheikh” alone. Long before I was permitted to
become one of his disciples, he had been acknowledged the ‘ sheikh-
ush shuytkh,” the master of masters. Toa certain extent it was natural
that he should have come to occupy this rank. His pupils had de-
veloped into co-investigators, and they could not well entertain the idea
of supplanting him. But great as was their number, there was still no
lack of men, who, having been disciples of Ewald, Rédiger, Freytag,
and others, might preserve their independence. In a still higher degree
this was true of partial contemporaries, such as Dorn and Rédiger. No
one will deny that this state of affairs was salutary for our science.
Under all circumstances it is baneful for one school, no matter how ex-
cellent its principles or its representatives may be, to exercise autocratic
sway in a given domain. In some respects it must be one-sided, and
one-sidedness is fatal to science. Now, from what has been said of
Fleischer as a teacher, it follows that nothing was further removed from
his mind than to force his pupils into a narrow-minded course. If
nevertheless any one is disposed to harbor this opinion, let him but
read Fleischer’s preface to Behrnauer’s translation of the Forty Viziers
to learn differently. But as was natural, his disciples at first had_to
abandon themselves to his guidance. The necessity was constantly
arising to refer them to the Arabic grammar, when once they began to
do independent work in the preparation of texts, always of a grammati-
cal nature, since such are easiest for a well-trained Arabist. Thus it
had to come about that for a time Arabie grammar seemed to thrive
almost too luxuriantly in these circles. Since then it has become ap-
parent that the danger was not very great. It must be conceded how-
ever that its complete avoidance was greatly due to the efforts of those
scholars who remained independent of Fleischer; tbat is to say, inde-
pendent of his instruction, not of his influence. It could not be gain-
said; he was the most learned of the learned, the most accurate of the
accurate. It is therefore not remarkable that the recognition of his
scientific superiority, readily yielded by all prominent scholars, with
518 MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER.

one or two exceptions, gradually led to the establishinent of personal
relations, in which he always gave more than he received. His co-la-
borers in Germany, as well as in more than one foreign land, by degrees
grew accustomed to ask his advice, claim his help, which he granted
to strangers as freely as to his own pupils. Thus it happened that for
many a year no Arabic text of any importance was printed in Germany
without owing to him considerable improvements, and likewise more
than one valuable work by foreign Arabists has received similar aid.
Sometimes he revised the proof-sheets as they were printed ; sometimes,
after the appearance of single volumes, he arranged the notes, taken
during its careful perusal, so that they might profitably be used in ap-
pendices, possibly to be added. There is quite a library of Arabie writ-
ings, in the building up of which he has thus participated. Here are
some of the important works, selected at hap-hazard: Amari’s Bibliotheca
Arabo-Sicula, Juynboll’s Abulmahasin, the Makkari, Tornberg’s Ibn el-
Athir, Wustenfeld’s Jacit, Fliigel’s Fihrist, Wright’s Kamil, de Goeje’s
Bibliotheca Geographorum, Jabhn’s Ibn Ya@ish. This critical work was
naturally accompanied by an extensive correspondence, which took the
more time as it was conducted with an almost exaggerated conscientious-
ness. But in no other way could these numberless connections have
been maintained so regularly and so steadfastly.

As Oriental studies advanced in Germany the necessity of establish-
ing closer connections between the representatives of the different de-
partments was keenly felt early in the third decade of this century.
To effect a union of this kind Ewald, Kosegarten, Rodiger, Riickert,
and some others established, in 1837, the Journal for the Science of the
Orient (Zeitschrift fiir die Kunde des Morgenlandes). From 1838, the
philologists’ conventions offered place ana opportunity for personal
intercourse between men in all departments of Oriental research. Thus
Rédiger was but giving shape to an idea that had long been enter-
tained when he proposed on the occasion of a visit, in September, 1843,
at Fleischer’s house, where Pott, Olshausen, von der Gabelentz, and
Brockhaus were also present, that German orientalists, as a body, should
hold sessions annually in connection with the conventions of philolo-
gists. As is well known, this plan was executed in 1844, at the Dresden
meeting. The consultations held there resulted in the formation, at
next year’s meeting, on October 2, 1845, at Darmstadt, of a German
Oriental Society, modelled after the Société Asiatique and the Royal
Asiatic Society. The Journal of the new society absorbed, in 1847, the
Zeitschrift fiir die Kunde des Morgenlandes. From the first, Fleischer
displayed zealous interest in the plan. The Dresden council was held
under his presidency, and the first draught ofthe constitution issued irom
his pen. His certificate of membership was the first conferred, and, up
to the time of his resignation from the governing body, in 1880, it may
be said, without disparagement to many faithful and deserving men,
that he was the soul of the association, unseltishly, as always, devoting
MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER. 519

his best powers to the common good. His help was given wherever it
was needed ; he served as editor of the Journal, and again as chroni-
cler of the year’s work; he was called upon to pass judgment on
works that were to be published under the auspices of the society, and
to correct them; and sometimes he had to act as mediator between
opposing parties that had sprung up within the society. The society
thus became dear to his heart, as does a child that has been raised with
care and trouble to man’s estate. Nothing (unless it were a falsehood)
vexed him so much as an injury done the society, or failure to fulfill
punctually the duties imposed by membership. While occupying the
position in the governing board of executive in matters relating to the
library, he took upon himself the unpleasant task of making a quar-
terly list of all books and pamphlets that had been sent to him, and in-
closing it in the chest of books forwarded to the librarian at Halle.
Later, when direct communications between the library and the corre-
spondents of the society were established, this work was no longer neces-
sary. Up to that time, while I was librarian of the society, many a list
of that kind passed from his hand into mine. I do not remember ever
to have found an error in a single one; but I know that I often wished
that he would not waste precious time on unimportant work, for which
he might have found dozens of willing hands near him. But he would
have eyed with suspicion the man who would suggest that he should
transfer to others what he considered his own duty. Undoubtedly he
was right, for the society would never have turned out to be such as it
is if he had not had so conscientious a conception of duty. He was re-
paid by the pleasure of seeing it grow and thrive; soon it could fitly
range itself by the side of older associations abroad; and among the
learned bodies of Germany it occupied a respected position. On one oe-
casion, to be sure, this position caused him much unpleasantness, namely
when the directors had to advise the Prussian Government as to the
purchase of the Moabite antiquities, which subsequently proved spuri-
ous. This is not the place and nowhere is it concern of mine to raise
anew the dust under which this unfortunate affair has finally been
buried. The proper conception of the province of a business committee
is expressed in a resolution, afterwards adopted by the general con-
vention of the German Oriental Society: ‘“ Inconsequence of the position
assigned by the constitution to the board of directors of the society, any
opinion published by them on scientific and more particularly on dis-
puted points, cannot be construed to express the opinion of the society.” *
Fleischer may have permitted a fatal mistake to be made, but he after-
wards generously assumed more of the responsibility than was neces-
sary.

Surely no one who once more passes in review his extensive and
varied work, even in the incomplete survey that I have just made, can
find reason to doubt the truth of what Fleischer further says in the

above. quoted passage from his preface to Fell’s Indices: “‘Ceteris adsevero
otium mihi et vires defuisse, non voluntatem et studium.” Certainly then
it was not possible for him to find leisure for the preparation and exe-
cution of comprehensive works embodying the results of independent
research. The translation of the Coran, the work of many years, was
left uncompleted. However, not all his powers were absorbed by his
efforts in behalf of his pupils, his colleagues, and the learned world in
general. He devoted every leisure moment to his appointed task of
maintaining Arabic-Mohammedan philology upon the eminence to which
De Sacy had raised it, and if possible of elevating it still higher. He
diligently continued up to the last moment the critical work that had
opened new paths to science upon his first appearance. For along time
he wrote reviews of new books in the Hallische Litteraturzeitung, in
Gersdorf’s Repertorium and in other journals, but afterwards exclusively
in the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenldndischen Gesellschaft. For the
readers of the Beitrdge, special mention may be made of his detailed
notices of the re-modelled edition of Riickert’s Poetics and Rhetoric of
the Persians, and of Bacher’s edition of Sa’di’s short poems, both repub-
lished in the third volume of his Minor Works. Besides, he contrib-
uted extensively to the improvement of the various editions of Arabic
texts, especially of Makkari and Abulmahasin, and wrote a number of
short articles on chance topics connected with Arabic, Persian, and
Turkish literature, history, and archeology, as they were suggested to
him by hints in his correspondence, in his official work for the German
Oriental Society, ete. Two great series, by far the most important in
amass of highly instructive material, must be noted: the celebrated
contributions (Beitrdge) to De Sacy’s Grammaire Arabe, and those to
Dozy’s Supplément aux dictionnaires arabes.

“Grammatici Arabes utilissimi nobis (sunt enim thesauri formarum totius
que antiquitatis promi condi)” was the opinion of Ewald.* It is perhaps
De Sacy’s greatest distinction that he put Arabic philology upon this
basis, and no less deserving of praise is Fleischer for having continued
and supplemented this work in a spirit of modesty and life-long devotion
to his beloved teacher, aided by the superior knowledge which he had
learned how to acquire in the school of De Sacy. Those endowed with
unusual talent, and furnished besides with a peculiar gift for the Arabic
language, may succeed in understanding Arabic, and in avoiding all the
hidden snares in the characters the vocabulary and the syntax, laid for
the guileless reader by this most treacherous of all languages with
which Iam acquainted. But the average scholar is lost, that is to say
sinks back upon a lamentably low stage of philological development,
unless he masters thoroughly his De Sacy with Fleischer’s additions.
That diligent and willing students are no longer exposed to this danger
of retrograding we owe to “the old man.” And the place filled in its
time by the worn, interleaved Freytag, or that filled in the domain of

grammar by De Sacy with the “ Beitrédge,” is occupied, on the field of
lexicography, by Dozy’s Supplément, enriched by Fleischer’s corrections
and additions. His ‘* Minor Works,” covering, together with the others
mentioned, 2225 pages, are a legacy, the conscientious use of which will,
for a long time, continue to be the prime duty of every scientific Ara-
bist.

We should use it however not only conscientiously, but also with
the most grateful remembrance. We should always bear in mind that
Fleischer, in order to become for his pupils and co-laborers what he was
to them, refrained from working for himself except by working for
others, and this at a time when his powers were at their height and his
comprehensive learning in its ripest state.

Possibly many a one has shared the feeling of a prominent and
clever co-laborer of mine, who said to me some years ago that it vexed
him to think that Fleischer, with his magnificent learning and ability,
was deserting from the solution of the highest problems. I can not
agree with my nameless friend. Diverse gifts—one mind. Some, vent-
uring fearlessly abroad, are permitted to discover new domains; others
secure law and order at home. Not the one by itself, nor the other is
the desideratum. The one canuot stand without the other. When
Fleischer came upon the stage we stood in need of law and order,
which he secured. Now, let the venturesome go forth upon voyages ot
discovery ; the less talented will still do well to remain at home and
watch lest law and order be undermined. Certainly it would have
been a great achievement if, for instance, our sheikh had built up the
edifice of Islamic doctrines for us. But has he not done better in sharp-
ening tools for many generations of workers, so that now they may
themselves build, not so quickly and not so high, but on a broad base
and with many wings? ;

‘Let me say briefly that from my early youth I have dimly felt the
desire and hope to cultivate myself, my whole self, such as itis,” writes
Wilhelm Meister to his wise friend Werner. Man’s duty with regard
to his own gifts has never been expressed more pertinently. Fleischer’s
was a sagacious, acute, and sensible mind. He in nowise sympathized
with what is mystic and ambiguous. A critic by nature, he exercised
his critical faculties not only upon others, but also and chietly upon
himself. Besides, he was faithful to duty, alover of truth, benevolent,
humbly self-sacrificing, and single-minded. Not one of these natural
traits did he fail to cultivate conscientiously, nor did he ever attempt
to lay false claims to virtues which he did not possess. A man of this
kind could not fail to see that only by means of self-restraint can one
succeed in perfectly cultivating one’s own nature. In no respect,—
neither in his views, nor in his studies,—was he one-sided; but he knew
accurately wherein his strength lay, and was too sensible to sin against
the proverb: “ Qui trop embrasse, mal étreint.” “ Il ne faut pas courir
deux lidvres & la fois,” he once wrote to me,—(he often delighted in using
522 MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER.

the French language, which he had mastered perfectly), and according
to this principle he consistently arranged his scientific career. In his
preface to the Golden Necklaces he says clearly and decidedly: * In Ara-
bie research neither good will, nor diligence, nor penetration of mind,
nor ingenuity, nor outside philological attainments, nor anything in the
world, can relieve one from the necessity of modestly, faithfully, and dili-
gently studying with the Arabic philologists;—and here in Europe,
above all with our master De Sacy; however, I do not mean to imply
that Ewald and his compeers will not in time succeed in summarizing the
superabundant material of Arabic philology in a more fitting and con-
venient form, as well as in explaining many facts in a more scientific
way.” The justification for Ewald’s philological methods does not es-
cape his notice, as Ewald in turn admits that the Arabian grammarians
are the promi condi totius antiquitatis. But Fleischer avowedly limits
himself to the purely philological side of the task, for il ne faut pas courir
deux liévres d la fois. Only once did he deviate from this rule, and then
it was done in order to venture upon a neighboring domain that could
not well be avoided, that of general Semitic etymology: He that wishes
to cast a stone at him on this account may do so after consulting St. John
viii, 7. To this wise self-restraint, among other things, he owes his pre-
eminence upon that field of philological research which was chosen by
him, or which (if you will) naturally fell to his share. At all events it is
hard to believe that any other field would have given the same scope to
his natural abilities. The undeviating conformity to law that character-
izes the structure of the Arabic language and its perspicuity naturally
appeal to him, as on the other hand its boundless wealth and apparent
complexity of linguistic phenomena offered weleome problems for his
ingenuity to solve. He was thus, by right of birth, the expounder of
the Arabic poets and writers, whose peculiarities are analogous to those
of their language. This partial affinity (for in other respects, he was a
true German with very un-Arabian feelings), together with his linguistie
attainments and large information, permitted him to reach the incom-
parable skill and certainty in the criticism of Arabic texts which for
the time at least did more than anything else to shed luster upon his
name. Theoretically indeed there is no difference between the proper
philological treatment of a Greek or Latin and an Arabic or Persian
text. But many external circumstances connected with Mohammedan
literature, such as the relatively short period intervening between the
original writer and the manuscripts to be studied, the peculiarities of
Arabic characters, etc., cause less stress to be put in our specialty upon
the recensio, if I may be permitted to use technical terms. In some cases
the recensio is the most essential part of the work; in most however it
is very unimportant. With us it is the emendatio that taxes the critical
faculties to the utmost. Similarly, ours differs from classical philology,
inasmuch as conjectures with us are usually either entirely correct or
altogether incorrect rarely—probabilis. Henceit may be said that, aside
MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER. — 523

from mere copyists’ blunders, it is easier to make conjectures in class-
ical philology, but, on the other hand ceteris paribus it is easier for us
to make correct conjectures or emendations. Tor both reasons we are not
justified in resting satisfied with the mere recensio, as our Greco-Roman
philologians may sometimes do. It follows that a man like Fleischer
may not be disposed of by praising him as the lucky possessor of a talent
for conjecturing, and then casting him into the great lumber-room, where
the superannuated philologists’ apparatus is stored. ‘True, he is the
author of thousands of conjectural corrections, but at least two-thirds
of his conjectures, if this measure of worth be applicable, are emenda-
tions. Whoever admits this, will thereby agree with me in saying that
self forgetful work limited by wise self-restraint, and undertaken with a
definite aim in view, is as a matter of course and almost in opposition
to the wishes of its author, rewarded with the prize.

It is time to conclude. Fleischer’s prominent position in the history
of our science is due to these circumstances; by precept and example he
made a home in Germany for the scientific study of Arabic Moham-
medan philology ; he trained generations of scholars with this purpose
in view; he similarly influenced his co-laborers in Germany and abroad;
he doubled the sum total of ali the results reached by De Sacy in the spe-
cial field of Arabic language and literature, and by his help the work
of his contemporaries was raised to the eminence occupied by his own.
There was no lack of prominent scholars in his own department, nor of
such as took up and supplemented his work outside of the limits he
himself had drawn. Still he and no other can be called the true heir
and successor of De Sacy. In knowledge and ability he excelled his
great teacher. But he himself would have administered a sharp reproot
to him who might venture to rank him above his master, in scientific

The unstinted recognition yielded to the great scholar on all sides
was commensurate with his deserts. The most prominent Orientalists of
Germany and others of foreign countries readily acknowledged that his
was unequalled knowledge and ability ; one learned society after another
conferred upon him honorary membership, and to several Saxon orders
and the Turkish Medjidié were added the two highest scientific distine-
tions in the giving of Germany,—the Bavarian order of Maximilian and
the Prussian pour le mérite. For a long time it seemed as though age
itself could not impair the octogenarian’s vigor nor destroy his love of
work. However, in the spring of 1884, there appeared the first symp-
toms of an abdominal disorder, which gradually grew. But whoever
saw him when he was not troubled with pain, scarcely noticed any change
in his appearance,—none whatever in his manner. On October 19,1885,
I enjoyed the privilege of participating with many others in the celebra-
tion of the fiftieth anniversary of his official connection with the univer-
sity, and on October 4, 1886, when I again visited him during his stay at
524 MEMOIR OF FLEISCHER.

Neu-Schonefeld, the entry in my diary reads: ‘Fleischer as bright as
ever.” But in 1886. he was compelled to avail himself of the permission
granted him, on the occasion of his jubilee celebration, to omit the lec-
tures of the summer session, and the physician’s orders were constantly
limiting the amount of work he did. When again IJ visited him at Leip-
zig in October 7, 1887, I felt that I should have to bid him an eternal
farewell. In spite of his increasing debility he began a course of lect-
ures for the winter session, and continued them until November 17.
But on November 18 he took to his bed, never again to leave it. He
bore the pain entailed by his disease with admirable patience; no com-
plaint ever crossed his lips, until on February 10, 1888, a short while
before completing his eighty-seventh year, death released him from his
suffering.

The prominent features of Fleischer’s character were truthfulness,
conscientiousness, unselfishness, and punctuality. I was never able to
decide how much he owed to nature, how much to the strict self-disci-
plineexercised in early years. But whatever he had acquired by habit
had come to be a part of his being. He became indignant nay wrath-
ful, the kindliness that marked his features and sprung from good
nature in the best meaning of the word, seemed to leave him,—when he
met with falsehood, carelessness, or lack of punctuality. As long as
there were no evidences of want of truth on the part of others, he was
unsuspicious, sometimes too much so; but whoever shocked his deli-
cate sense of justice, had good cause to fear his anger. Yet there was
not a trace of dogmatism in his nature. He may in some instances
have chanced to form an incorrect judgment of certain people, but
he took the first opportunity to change it most willingly in their
favor, unless weighty reasons existed for the contrary. All that he °
thought and did was characterized by objectivity, pure and simple. In
scientific debates he demanded that his conclusions be tested impar-
tially, and on the other hand he accepted instruction from the young-
est of his pupils, if he had chanced to find something that had es-
caped the notice of ‘‘the sheikh.” His polemics were never of a per-
sonal nature except when Ewald accused him, in a manner that even
now impairs the reputation of this great man of * being actuated by
sordid impulses in science.” In a published *‘ statement addressed to
Prof. Dr. Ewald of Gottingen,” he expresses in plain, though moderate
terms, his just indignation. His misunderstanding with Dozy, whom
Fleischer had unintentionally offended, was cleared up in a way that
reflects credit upon both scholars. He was conscious of his abilities
and bis achievements, but never boasted of them. Toall work done by
others, in his or their department, he gladly yielded recognition. Un-
hesitatingly he subordinated himself in every respect to De Sacy, and
to Lane’s knowledge of the Arabic, as (in his opinion) superior to his
own. He was never ambitious of empty honors, he never sought to
assert himself.

What was called Fleischer’s school, can scarcely be said any longer
to exist as such. Arabic studies, the preponderance of which formed
the most distinguishing mark of its unity, have been curtailed in Ger-
many. A cruel fate has prematurely removed the very best philologists
ot Fleischer’s school: Ralfs, Loth, Spitta, and, furthermore Kosut and
Huber. Someof us have struck out on new paths; general interest has
been diverted to Assyriological research and to comparative philology.
The leadership inthe Arabic domain is about to pass over to the Dutch
school. Butit matters not what we do, if only we emulate the example
of *‘our sheikh,” and do disinterested, honest, diligent, conscientious,
and modest work, in whatever is within the reach of our limited ability:
A MEMOIR OF GUSTAV ROBERT KIRCHHOFF.*

By ROBERT VON HELMHOLTZ.

Translated by JOSEPH DE PEROTT.

On the 20th day of Gctober of the past year (1887) we bade our last fare-
wells to Gustav R. Kirchhoff in St. Matthew’s Cemetery at Berlin. Nat-
ural science has lost one of its mightiest promoters, Germany is bereft
of one of her keenest thinkers, the youtl-lament their honored, brilliant
master, and his friends mourn over a man who belonged to the best, in
the true meaning of this word. While Kirchhoff’s works made his name
immortal, so that wherever physics is taught he will be mentioned, such
were his modesty and simplicity that his own person was hidden behind
the object to which he devoted his life, and if we except his colleagues
and those who had the fortune to be near him, there were very few
who knew more than that Kirchhoff was the illustrious discoverer of
spectrum analysis. Let one of his students be permitted to attempt to
do what he would never have undertaken himself and what even would
have been painful to him while he lived,—to draw a picture of his work
not in its pure, abstract form, destitute of all earthly vesture, as he pro-
duced it, but rather in connection with his personal life, and as a fruit
of his personal genius.

Gustav R. Kirchhoff wasa professor of mathematical physics. Imention
this first, not because it is the main fact which would stand first in a
biographical dictionary, but because mathematical physics is a science
of which only he who was born to it can become an adept.. There are
vocations in life, there are branches of science that do not allow us to
infer what spirit animates their adepts. In certain regions of abstract
science however, whoever wants to penetrate into them, must have fac-
ulties and dispositions of definite nature and bias, otherwise he will not
even cross the threshold that leads to them.

Pure mathematics is such ascience. Every-day experience teaches us
that only a small proportion of students are endowed with a genius for
it. Itis more difficult to say on what powers of the human mind such
a genius rests. Mathematics is logic applied to numbers and extensive
magnitudes. It requires accordingly a great power of abstraction and -
the faculty of intuitive perception of relations of magnitudes. At any

rate, Just because the technics of pure logical thinking have to be de-
veloped to a great extent, the perceptive faculty of a mathematician,
his judgment and his representation of things are of a peculiar kind.

The natural philosopher requires however another faculty still, I
mean the faculty of observation. Every one whose work rests on ob-
servation is a student of nature in the widest meaning of this word;
the physician, the traveller, the collector. To observe is to notice, and
to collect what you have noticed. In proportion however as the col-
lecting of things is done according to higher and higher standards, ob-
servation comes nearer to thinking, collecting approaches interpreta-
tion, and natural history verges into exact study of nature. The
adepts of natural science work not only through the senses by means
of observation, but also by means of the logical faculty of drawing in-
ference. They differ from mathematicians chiefly in the material for
their thinking being given in the external world and that they must
have the talent to find it there, while the foundations of mathematics
seem to be given a priort. Mathematics is the most convenient instru-
ment in the exact science of nature because it is the tongue in which
the latter can expressits conclusions in the quickest and most precise way.
That is why the exact study of nature becomes more and more mathe-
matical; physics, after astronomy, has made the most progress in this
direction; chemistry is about to follow it. Speaking generally, the
greatest physicist nowadays will be he who is endowed equally with the
gifts of observation and with logical precision of thinking, and has mas-
tered experiment as well as mathematics. According to the pre-emi-
nence of the one or the other faculty the place of each investigator
will be nearer to the observers of nature or to the thinkers about nat-
ure. Both kinds are necessary, the latteris more seldom met with,
there are more good observers than good thinkers. Gustav R. Kirchhoff
belongs rather, according to his nature, to the great thinkers, and still
his greatest and most celebrated discovery is a discovery of observa-
tion. He was one of the greatest natural philosophers just because he
was a mathematical physicist in the above-mentioned sense.

The life of Kirchhoff was that of a thinker, too. He did not travel
all over the world to see nature in the splendid attire of her multifari-
ous productions, like Humboldt or Darwin; he did not work his way to
theory through aschool of purely practical life, like Faraday or Siemens.
No more did he pass his life in the whirlpool of historical or social
events. He accomplished his work quietly in the externally serene,
but internally the more active, abodes of science,—in the lecture-rooms
and laboratories of several German universities. Whoever wants to
know him must follow him thither into spheres of thought that lie afar
off from the interests of the day.

Gustav R. Kirchhoff, son of the lawyer, was born (1824), brought up,
and educated at Konigsberg, the *“‘ City of Pure Reason.” According to
a certificate from the Kneiphof High-school, he wished to devote him-
MEMOIR OF KIRCHHOFF. Had

self to mathematics, aud in fact he commenced the study of it under
Richelot,and the elder Neumann. The latter, at first a mineralogist, and
afterwards gradually becoming one of the great founders of the mathe-
matical physics of our time, had a decisive influence on Kirchhoff.
The student took to physics too, and helped to build up his master’s
structure. While still a student, Kirchhoff wrote, in 1845, an excellent
original paper (On the flow of electricity through a circular plate), and
was granted a scholarship for a scientific journey to Paris. The dis-
turbances of the year 1848, prevented him from going any farther than
Berlin, however. He stopped there and qualified for a professorship in
mathematical physics. Strange to say, the first course of lectures of a
professor who afterwards attracted hundreds did not take place.
Mathematical physics appeared at the time a very remote and abstract
subject. In the year 1850, Kirchhoff went to Breslau in the quality of
an adjunct professor, and in 1854, as a fuli professor to Heidelberg, so
that he went through the usual career of a German professor.

The bloom of his life was the twenty years he lived and taught at
Heidelberg. These years fell into the most brilliant period of the most
beautiful of German universities, and Kirchbotf himself contributed
much to the increase and preservatiou of Heidelberg’s fame.

Indeed, when Kirchhoff came to Heidelberg, the University of that
town held an undisputed rank as the foremost of the German universi-
ties, through the renown of its teachers in law and history. A. v. Van.
gerow exercised an incomparable attraction through his celebrated
lectures on the Pandects; at his side worked men like Wittermaier,
Renaud, Mohl; the historians Schlossen, Weber, Gervinus, Hausser
have a world-wide renown. They raised the level not only of scientific
—but even of social life to such a high standard that all who partook of
it preserve forever the recollection of those days. A circle arose around
Hiusser in particular, which took its first beginning from political
grounds, but became afterwards the seat ofan enchanting and cheerful
conviviality. Among the scientists, Kirchhoff’s predecessor Jolly, the
anatomist Henle, the clinical physician Pfeuffer, all belonged to this
circle; and Bunsen, who was already famous when he came in 1852 to
Heidelberg, was one of its foremost members.

Robert Bunsen, whose friendship with Kirchhoff became as eventful
in the annals of German science as that of Gauss and Weber, made his
acquaintance at Breslau. It wasthrough Bunsen’s influence that Kirch-
hoff received a call to Heidelberg.

The large publie knew nothing of Kirchhoff at the time his Berlin
and Breslau papers could only be appreciated by his fellow-physicists.
There was a great surprise at Heidelberg accordingly, when-—heartily
recommended by Bunsen—there came an unusually young, gentle, shy
and modest North German. His fine, spirited talk, his amiable manners
full of courtesy to every one, and his keen sense of wit and humor won
the hearts of those who came nearer to him. Kirchhoff became accord-

ingly a favorite guest at the eheerful meetings of this circle at Hausser’s
friends. Butit was with Bunsen particularly that Kirchhoff came into
a close connection in the first years of his sojourn at Heidelberg. Bun-
sen was his elder by thirteen years; strong, broad shouldered, of a more
vivacious temper and of a more immediate influence, Bunsen struck
with awe one and all by the pienitude of his powers. Thus the two
men were in exterior very different from each other. It is a facet how-
ever that Bunsen and Kirchhoff not only accomplished together their
great works, but even spent together their bachelor days as true friends.
They took trips together to the magnificient environs of Heidelberg,
they travelled together during the summer holidays, and even could
often be seen together of an evening at the small Heidelberg theater,
an amusement in which Kirchhoff particularly took a great delight
from the days of his youth.

They did not part company, as is usually the case, even when Kirch-
hoff, towards the end of the sixth decade of our century, married the
young and charming daughter of his Kénigsberg Professor Richelot.
It was in fact during the years 1859-62 that the two investigators, start
ing from a research of Bunsen, made and accomplished together the
great discovery of spectrum analysis.

Towards the beginning of the seventh decade Kirchhoff moved, at the
same time with my father, to the newly erected Frederick Hall, the first
great institution in Germany devoted wholly to the furtherance of re-
sources in natural science. It was an external manifestation of the facet
that the center of gravity of the Heidelberg University gradually
shifted from law and history to natural science and medicine. The
philosopher Zeller, the mathematician Hesse, afterwards Konigsberger,
the chemist Kopp, the clinician Friedreich, my father as physiologist,
all received calls to the institution. The Frederick Hall, became a kind
of branch university. In this building I spent the days of my child-
hood; Kirechhoff’s apartments, as well as the apartments of my parents
under them, and the whole Frederick Hall, coalesce into one image in
my memory. Large lecture-rooms and museums, with enigmatical
— ological names, stuffed animals, chemical and anatomical smells,
acoustie sounds, then crowds of students (Russian lady students among
them) overflooding at regular intervals the passages and the yards, to
the great annoyanee of children, while going to hear lectures by their
(the annoyed children’s) fathers,—these are the impressions that time
has left me.

Kirchhoff spent there happy years. His name was already famous
through his discovery of spectrum analysis, so that his laboratory and
his lectures became the most frequented ones. With his wife, his four
children, and his nearest friends, he led a happy life made cheerful
through convivial intercourse.

Unfortunately these in every respect pleasant circumstances came to
anend already towards the close of the seventh decade. In consequence

of a fall on the staircase, he suffered from a sore foot, which compelled
him for a long time to move only on a rolling-chair or by means of
crutches. It was only at Berlin that he acquired again, after many re-
lapses, his power of locomotion, but even after that he enjoyed his com-
plete health only occasionally. He lost his wife about the same time,
so that his family lite broke asunder. Some of his friends (Hiausser,
Vangerow) died; others, like Feller and my father, received calls to
Berlin. But accidents to his person could endanger his life, not his
work. He continued to perform his task as a teacher and an investiga-
tor under the most difficult circumstances and after most severe trials,
with a stoical faithfulness to duty and with iron consistency. His own
person and his science should have nothing to do with one another.

Afterwards Kirchhoff married, as a second wife, Louise Brémmel, at
the time matron of the university clinical hospital for the diseases of
the eye. His inexhaustibly cheerful and amiable temper made this
second marriagea happy one too, notwithstanding his frequent ill health.

In the year 1875, Kirchhoff received and accepted a call to the Uni-
versity of Berlin, after having refused previously an invitation to be-
come a director of the projected solar observatory at Potsdam.

Whether a life at Berlin is to be considered as an advantage for a
scientist may be doubted. The teacher acquires a larger, richer field for
his activity, but just so much more is there loss of time for the investiga-
tor. Kirchhoff, however, owing to his infirm health, suffered but little
from the turmoil of the capital. He did his work as usual; he published,
as he used to, a paper or so every year in the reports of the academy; he
did experimental work too in the laboratory of his friend, G. Hanse-
mann. He it was who, after continuous separation from Bunsen, stood
nearest to him as a co-worker and friend.

But the most favorite and admirable work of Kirchhoff at Berlin (in
fact unique in its effect) was his course of lectures on mathematical
physics. His delivery captivated one and all through its externa! finish
and the precision of exposition. Nota word too little or too much; he
never bungled, hesitated, or made himself guilty of a want of clearness.
The terseness of his calculus was truly admirable,—a quality not easy
to expiain to an outsider. The whole subject rose betore a hearer in
the shape of a highly artistic, classically perfect frame-work, in which
every part could be logically deduced from some other, so that 1t was
even an wsthetic pleasure to follow Kirchhoft’s deductions. In fact
Kirchhoff’s lectures though intrinsically they belong to the most diffi-
cult, ought to be intelligible to every one—even the less gifted—pro-
vided of course he is acquainted with the instrument used, the mathe-
matical language. It may happen, and it happened often indeed, that
one was not able to see the arrangement of what was put before him,
could not understand why and to what purpose Kirchhoff made such
and such a dedustion, but to follow the train of his master’s thoughts,
to think the whole over and to reproduce it afterwards was within reach
of every one.
532 MEMOIR OF. KIRCHHOFF.

Paradoxical as it may seem, it was not impossible, without ever hav-
ing understood Kirchhoff, to write his lectures as a first-rate book by
means of the notes alone. It is to this quality of Kirehhoff’s dialectics
(absolute clearness and self-comprehension), that he owed a large part of
his success as a teacher. During nine years Kirchhoff was able to de-
liver his lectures at Berlin withoutinterruption. But it became more
and more apparent to us, his hearers, what exertion they required from
him and how he was obliged to gather his last strength in order to keep
himself on his feet. Nevertheless he was always punctual to the minute,
and the excellence of his leetures remained umimpaired. At last (1884)
he was prohibited lecturing by the physicians; he took up however
this favorite occupation of his once again for a short time. It became
apparent however that palsy made him unable to move, and Kirehhoft
was reduced entirely to his own home, to the rolling chair, and to the
eare of his family. In the last two years of his life one would see him
always cheerful and amiable, sitting in his arm-chair and preserving a
vivid interest in all problems, Never, not even once, did a complaint
escape his lips, though he must have been well aware of the decline of
his forces. Death, which came unawares during his sleep, delivered him
from worse suffering. :

We lost in him a perfect example of the true German investigator. To
search after truth in its purest shape and to give it utterance with
almost an abstract self-forgetfulness; was the religion and the purpose
of his life. He loved and furthered science only for her own sake;
every embellishment exceeding the limits of what was logically proved,
would appear to him as a profanation,—any admixture of personal mo-
tives, or grasping at honors or lucre, would seem to him worthy of
blame. And in life as well as in science, he carried out what he con-
sidered his duty as a man, a citizen, or functionary, with a logical rigor
divested of all personal motives. But the knowledge of good alone does
not make a man a good one, not eveu the will or the power to execute
it. It was only Kirchhoft’s kindness of heart and humaneness, which if
not demonstrative and warm in the expression of feelings, were the more
pure and genuine, that made of him a true friend, a self-forgetful co-
worker, the teacher ready to help, the judge ready to acknowledge the
merits of others; in short, a man that all of us loved. I have a fine
instance lying before me of how friendly and obliging he was, even
toward the humblest of his fellow-men. A poor workman—many would
have taken him to be insane-—applies in a letter to Kirchhoff, for an
explanation of pessimistic doubts that torture him. ‘No physician, no
priest, or any other materialistic egotist ean help me, but only a man of
a truly scientific educational training, an investigator and thinker him-
self, who does not consider himself too much above any of his fellow-
men, placed below him by birth and circumstances, to communicate his
conviction free of any Compromise. When people tell me I am a work-
man and must not trouble myself about such mattters, IT answer that not
MEMOIR OF KIRCHHOFF. Hao

all men are alike; that in all classes of men are individuals that have
not only material, but also spiritual wants. Not all sciences that are
known were developed by scientists alone,” ete. Many a one would
have simply laid aside the workman’s letter. Kirchhoff however wrote
to him a well-considered reply, as the minute shows, where among
other things we read: “ That there are such limits to our knowledge of
nature, must be borne with patience by every sound mind whether he
be a scientist or a workman. I can only advise you to leave off all
impossible aspirations and trying to conceive things that are beyond
conception. This requires a struggle, but a struggle is the lot of many
men of all professions. The best help is to devote one’s self to the task
which has fallen to one’s lot, and to fulfill the duties of the pesition in
which one is placed.” And, in fact, Kirchhoff fulfilled himself the duties
of his position. He was really “the truly noble mind, free from all
egotistic sham,” the workman was looking for. As for us, we are only
inclined to ask which to admire more, the greatness of his mind or the
strength of his will that lifted him so high above
“The vulgar, which we all, alas, obey!”

We have tried to portray Kirchhoff as he appeared to us, his contem-
poraries, as a man and asa teacher. His works will outlive him and
will be appreciated according to their merit only by posterity. ‘To us,
his pupils, falls the task, even if we do not belong to physics, to make
apparent what science owes to him. One is apt in such eases to lay
the chief stress on the practical results of his works, to adduce their
influence on technics and industry. While speaking of Kirebhoff’s
works one must however keep free from such a bias, first because
the chief value of many of his papers lies not in the application but
in the method; secondly such considerations would have been antipa-
thetic to his own mind. Kirchhoff never asked himself ‘* What is the
use of thy brooding and searching?” What he had to expound he
expounded in the way best suited to the thing itself, and in as general
a manner as possible, without paying any attention to accessory pur-
poses. ‘I think I have found such and such a thing, and I take the
liberty of giving a demonstration of it in what follows.” Such is the
beginning of the mostof his papers. His writings are Jess voluminous
than might have been expected. His forty papers—product of as
many years—are collected into a volume of moderate dimensions. He
published besides, a report on his ‘* Researches on the solar spectrum
and the spectra of the chemical elements” and a volume of lectures
on mechanics, the latter his most mature and perfect work.

What an immense amount of brain work is here condensed into the
smallest space possible! Kirchhoff’s style, like his delivery, was a
model of the most clear and concise diction, absolutely classical in the
subject concerned. The words stand as if hewn in stone, each one at
its place, the logical comprehension of each duly considered ; we find
here condensed into a few lines what would have taken others pages to

describe; only when the existing words seemed not precise enough, he
uses circumlocutions and definitions, and that mostly in mathematical
language. He held the highest rank among those who strove to re-
move from exact sciences all want of clearness, all subjective judg-
ments, all phrases. The influence of such an endeavor will transcend
the limits of his particular science.

The most popular of Kirchhoff’s works is his spectrum analysis. It
had in fact most extraordinary consequences of the most palpable kind,
and has become of the highest importance for all branches of natural
science. It has excited the admiration and stimulated the fancy of
men as hardly any other discovery has done, because it has permitted
an insight into worlds that seemed forever veiled for us. It is accord-
ingly the most celebrated of Kirchhoff’s discoveries.

But however wonderful the results, what seems to us more admirable
still is the truly masterly work itself, the unusually keen and at the same
time ingenious and diligent way in which Kirchhoff deduced from the
outset, from an accidental observation, a general theoretical law and all
the surprising inferences, and demonstrated them with full strictness
and certainty. Great men had already held in their hand before him
the threads of his discovery without being able to unravel them. The
French as well as English brought forward and still produce claims
of priority. Kirchhoff repelled them quietly but firmly. All had seen
something, made guesses, considered as possible or probable (without
Kirchhoff having been aware of it at the time, however). A solid basis,
a rigorous demonstration had been given by nobody ; it was reserved
to the acuteness, thoroughness, and perseverance of a German searcher
to elevate the lucky guess to the rank of a sure knowledge.

Spectrum analysis in the narrowest sense, 7. ¢., the ‘analysis of the
chemical elements by means of spectral observations,” is due, if we
wish to make a distinction, to an idea and a suggestion of Bunsen’s.
Among the most ingenious performances of Bunsen may be reckoned
certain very simple physical methods of qualitative chemical analysis,
i.é., the detection and the discrimination of chemical elements. A
characteristic re-action of this kind he found to be the coloring of non-
luminous flames. Each chemical element vaporized or burned in a non-
luminous flame, for instance a blue-burning gas-flame, imparts to it a
definite characteristic coloring. We should be able accordingly to
recognize each substance by the light its incandescent vapor emits if
our eyes had the power to distinguish as many differences of color as
there are substances in nature. Kirchhoff and Bunsen helped the eyes
however by decomposing the light of flames into its separate colors by
means of a prism. This gives rise to the spectrum of the flame. The
rainbow is a natural spectrum of the solar light made by the rain-drops.
But this spectrum, as well as the spectra of all glowing solid or liquid
bodies, offers quite another aspect from the spectra of flames, 7. é., in-
candescent gases. The first consist of known colors varying in a con-
MEMOIR OF KIRCHHOFF. 535

tinuous way from one to another; the second consist of different bright
lines separated by dark spaces, which bright lines have not only char-
acteristic colorings, but are placed in particular positions and at definite
intervals. Just as we recognize the constellation by their configurations
and different brightnesses of their stars so do we distinguish the spec-
trum of iron from the spectrum of copper by the respective distances and
coloring of their lines. We could even do without colors; it would be
sufficient to measure by means of a scale the intervals between different
lines in order to recognize by means of Kirchhoff and Bunsen’s tables the
element we have before us. It may seem amazing—but it is true—that
a color-blind man could know with absolute certainty what colors a
flame emits! The greatest advantage of a method in natural science, its
independence of all subjective judgment, was bestowed on spectrum an-
alysis by its discoverers. The main part of Kirchhoff and Bunsen’s
work and their chief merit is however the demonstration of the validity
of the method, viz, that the configuration of lines depends only on the
chemical nature of the luminous incandescent vapor, not on its temper-
ature or other elements with which if is combined, and not on the nature
of the flame in which it glows or other accessory circumstances. Of
this a carefully worked out experimental proof was given, and Bunsen
was accordingly able long ago to make the perfectly safe assertion that
he discovered by means of his spectrum analysis a new element, because
the salt from a certain mineral spring showed unknown lines. Nowa-
days spectrum analysis is the most sensitive chemical method of -de-
composition. And nevertheless, what is still more astonishing is the
further discovery made by Kirchhoff, by means of this method diseov-
ered jointly with Bunsen. Kirchhoff happened to let a solar ray pass
through a flame colored with sodium and then through a prism, so that
the spectrum of the sun and of the flame fell one upon another. It
was to be expected that the well known yellow line of sodium would
come out in the solar spectrum; but it was just the opposite that
took place. On the spot where the bright line ought to have shown
itself there appeared a dark line. Jo Kirchhoff this reversal of the
sodium line appeared at once in the highest degree remarkable, and
he suspected immediately that some fundamental law was lurking there.
The fact had been noticed by others (as was proved afterwards), and
that by men of the highest renown. It was reserved however to
Kirebhhoff’s genius to detect and to pick up the treasure of new truths
that lay hidden there. Already on the day following the experiment
he was able to deduce and to explain the phenomenon from a more
general principle which, strange to say, belonged not to opties but to
the theory of heat. From a proposition, very remote in appearance,
that heat passes only from a body of a higher temperature to one of
a lower and not inversely, he deduced by dint of purely logical infer-
ences the fact of the reversal of the sodium line. The middle term in
the syliogism was given by the celebrated Kirchhoft’s law on the emis-
536 MEMOIR OF KIRCHHOFF.

sion and absorption of light and heat by bodies, which says that all
bodies absorb chiefly those rays, those colors they emit themselves, and
that the ratio of the absorbed and the emitted amount of light is
one and the same in all bodies however different. The paper where
this law is proved is the most beautiful Kirchhoff ever composed,
although there is the smallest amount of mathematics init. The history
of this law might serve as a model for the work of astudent of nature ;
the law is vigorously deduced from well-known general propositions ;
but says itself something new; it gives the different particular infer-
ences which are to be verified by experiment. It will be the lot of a
few only to make such discoveries, but all ought to consider as a model
to imitate, the diligence, the conclusiveness, and the care—and not less
the great modesty—with which Kirchhoff communicates his discovery to
the world: ‘ On the occasion of a research made jointly with Bunsen on
the spectra of colored flames, by means of which it became possible to
us to recognize the qualitative composition of complex aggregates by
inspection of their blow-pipe flames, I mad@ some observations that
give an unexpected disclosure as to origin of Fraunhofer’s lines, and
justify the inference to be drawn from them as to the material consti-
tution of the solar atmosphere, and perhaps of those of the brightest
stars.” These words show that Kirchhoff himself made the wonderful
application of his law. The Fraunhofer’s lines to which he alludes are,
asis well known, fine dark bands that furrow the solar spectrum, such
as it is, even without the help of a flame. The nature of these lines was
at first very eniymatic. The just described experiment of Kirchhoff
shows however that artificial Fraunhofer’s lines may be produced by
means of aflame. The inference was near that the natural lines are pro-
duced by the same cause as the artificial ones, that they are reversed
gas spectra, and that the light of the giowing solar body has already
traversed somewhere incandescent gases, before it reached the earth.
We may go further, however. Whenthe artificial lines coincide with the
Fraunhofer’s lines, as (for instance), Kirchhoff proved to be the case for
iron, sodium, or nickel, one may conclude—taking one’s stand on the
joint research of Kirchhoff and Bunsen—that these chemical elements
are found in those hypothetical incandescent gases. The fact that the
sun consists of a glowing liquid nucleus, surrounded by an envelope of
luminous vapors, and above all that these vapors contain the terrestrial
substances whose line-spectra coincide with Fraunhofer’s lines, this fact
was inferred, “ with as much certainty,” says Kirchhoff,” ‘as can be
attained in natural science.”

It is a characteristic trait of Kirchhoff that he calculated numerically
this certainty. It would be possible for the bright lines of iron, for in-
stance, to coincide by mere chance with Fraunhofer’s lines; but the
probability for such an event was found to be equal to 7335-00b-e0 0700
(one-billionth), an almost evanescent quantity. ‘‘ There must be a
cause that occasions these coincidences,” says Kirchhoff. ‘ An adequate
MEMOIR OF KIRCHHOFYF. Hal

cause can be produced ; the observed fact may be explained if it be ad.
mitted that the rays of light that make the solar spectrum have trav-
ersed vapors of iron and suffered an absorption such as vapors of iron
generally produce. It is at the same time the only cause that can be
adduced; its adoption seems accordingly necessary.”

We may insert here a story that Kirchhoff liked to relate himself.
The question whether Fraunhofer’s lines reveal the presence of gold in
the sun was being investigated. Kirchhoff’s banker remarked on this
occasion: ** What do I care for goldin the sun if I ean not fetch it down
here?” Shortly afterwards Kirchhoff received from England a medal
for his discovery, and its value in gold. While banding it over to his
banker, he observed: ‘‘ Look here, I have succeeded at last in fetching
some gold from the sun.” As to Kirchhoft’s own opinion of the impor-
tance of this law, it was quite indifferent to him, as stated above, whether
the law admitted of any application to the investigation of the nature of
the sun and fixed stars, or had only a theoretical interest. Asa char-
acteristic trait of him may be mentioned that in his theoretical lectures
he never says a single word about the region to which access was gained
through his discovery, and in his collected papers he grants it a place
only near the end.

The other papers of Kirchhoff treat various subjects of mathematical
physics. Those concerned with electricity are the most numerous. A
whole series of them is devoted to the calculation of the paths the elec-
trical current takes in bodies of different shape or in a net-work of con-
duction. There is a Kirchhoff’s law about it too, which is of funda-
mental importance for the investigation of the distribution of the flow
of electricity in complicated conditions of conduction. Another series
of papers treats of the distribution of static electricity and magnetism.
These were in part celebrated problems on which the greatest of his
predecessors (like Poisson), had already tried their forces and had not
succeeded in mastering them so completely as Kirchhoff. He was the
first to apply the so-called mechanical theory of heat to chemical pro-
cesses, and by this application he bridged the way to the connection of
different branches of natural science by means of mechanical principles.
The basis of the mechanical theory of heat, the iaw of the permanency
of work, as Kirchhoff styled it, is according to him undoubtedly the
most important accession of knowledge gained in our century in the
region of natural science.*

The brilliant, various, and apparently complicated phenomena of
light, Kirchhoff deduced in his lectures on optics from the purely me-
chanical theory of an elastic body. That ether is such a body is a hypoth-
esis which, though enunciated by Kirchhoft’s predecessors, was worked
out by him ina particularly vigorous way. Nevertheless, all phenomena
can not be explained by such a supposition. That Kirchhoff developed
this hypothesis and this only, and eontented himself with mentioning at

* His discourse as rector of Heidelberg University 1865.
538 MEMOIR OF KIRCHHOFF.

the end of his course what circumstances spoke against his hypothesis
and, in this way, demolished before the eyes of the students the whole
structure, is to be accounted for by his idea of the scope and the limits
of the investigation and interpretation of nature.

On such occasions, | must confess, I asked myself many a time,
‘What for? Why develop a theory that leads to contradiction with
experiment? Is the probing of nature, for Kirchhoff, only the greatest
and the most interesting exercise in calculation 2”

In answer to such doubts | shall adduce his own words in bis discourse
delivered in 1865,as rector of Heidelberg University ‘“‘on the scope of
the natural sciences.” He says there: ‘There is a science called me-
chanics, whose object is to determine the motion of bodies when the
2zauses that occasion them are known. - - - Mechanics is a twin sis
ter of geometry; both sciences are applications of pure mathematics ;
the propositions of both, as to their certainty, stand on the same level;
we have just as much right to ascribe absolute certainty to mechanical
theorems as to geometrical.” And further: “If we were acquainted
with all the forces of nature and knew what is the state of matter at a
certain moment of time, we should be able to deduce by means of me-
chanies its state at every subsequent moment, and to deduce how the
various natural phenomena follow and accompany each other. The
highest goal the natural sciences must strive to attain is the realization
of the just mentioned suppostion, - - - viz, the reduction of all
natural phenomena to mechanics. Weshall never attain the goal of the
natural sciences, but even the fact that it is recognized as such offers «
certain satisfaction, and in approximating to it lies the highest pleasure:
to be derived from the study of natural phenomena.”

I must mention besides the famous words with which Kirchhoff com.
mences his Mechanics, published in 1875: ‘* Mechanics is the science
of motion; its object may be stated to be to describe in the most com.
plete and simple way the motion that takes place in nature.” The dif-
ference between the first and the last definition of mechanies is worthy
of notice. At the former time, and before the large public, Kirchhoff
spoke of causes of motion. Now, and in a strictly mathematical book,
the word and the notion of cause do not appear. The interpretation
of nature is given up; the only thing ‘looked for is the simplest possible
description of nature. These introductory words of his Mechanics,
and their working out in the book itself are the most consequent, far-
reaching expression of Kirchhoff’s way of looking at nature. He
makes no hypothesis as to the possibility of arriving at a knowledge of
things in themselves. He wants only to portray the phenomena in a
logically certain form. In relation to the sensible world (according to
Kant) we have logical (that is to say, a prior?) certainty only of the propo-
sitions of geometry and mechanics, the last distinguished from the first
on account of their requiring, besides the three dimensions of space, the
fourth one, time, and the notion of a mobile matter. With these three

fundamental notions of space, time, and matter, Kircbhott tries to make
his way to the description of the facts of experience and goes beyond
his predecessors by delineating by means of pure geometry the sup-
posed logically fandamental notions of force and mass. Force is to him
the acceleration (change of velocity) experienced by a material particle
in aunit of time; the knowledge of all these accelerating forces in a
given moment of time would suffice to describe the world ; experience
has shown however that the description gains in simplicity, if we mul-
tiply the acceleration by a certain positive constant, called mass of the
moving particle. I have mentioned this abstract train of thought be-
cause it is very characteristic of Kirchhoff. The necessity of looking at
natural forces as something really existing, or the mass as something
really constant, remaining equal to itself, he does not recognize. It is
only a fact of experience that the movements in nature hitherto observed
have taken place in such a way that they seem to be represented in the
simplest manner by making those suppositions. We can build up me-
chanical systems on quite different bases, but it would not help us to
describe simply the real movements. The problem of mathematical
physies will be solved when the observed phenomena will be described
by means of the simplest possible supposition as to the nature of forces
and distribution of matter. There is nothing impossible in it; it can be
proved in fact that all that men can observe in finite time must be sus-
ceptible of being described mathematically.

Even an outsider will not fail to notice, I think, that something is not
included in Kirchhoff’s programme. The simplest description can not
produce the conviction that the phenomena, even in future time, shall
run in accordance with the description ; its equations are, so to say, not
laws. There exists a stand-point differing somewhat from that of Kirch-
hoff; it looks for what is in accordance with a law in the change of
phenomena. Experience teaches us that nature acts according to laws;
because without laws experience would be impossible. Experience is
the collecting of what is similar in different particular perceptions.
That the laws exist is accordingly an observed fact and not a hypothe-
sis. We feel them acting at every moment independently of our will.
We must ascribe to them the same reality as to our will; these two
things are opposite to one another, power against power. We desig-
nate them accordingly by the names of forces, and forces as causes of
motion; they have the same reality as the motion itself. Up to this
point nature may be said to be intelligible. What a force is we know
not; we can only say that it manifests itself in the acceleration it im-
parts tothe mass, and de facto accordingly, we do not go beyond Kirch-
hoff’s description of nature. As to results, the search after a law and the
endeavor after the simplest description of nature is one and the same
thing; the difference lies only in the formnlation of the problem and
sometimes possibly in the way towards its solution. It follows for in-
stance from Kirchhoff’s definition, that it must be permitted (not only
540 MEMOIR OF KIRCHHOFF.

upon pedagogical but even upon philosophical grounds) to use hypothe-
ses, even when they are recognized not to be sufficient in all cases, pro-
vided they are still the simplest. In fine, only that will appear to us
simple which is logically true.

From what precedes one sees how near sometimes mathematical
physics approaches to metaphysics. Kirchhoff gave to empiricism in
the theory of cognition, its most precise and most consequent expression,
and placed himself accordingly at the acme of the whole of modern
mathematical physies.

Kirechhoff’s endeavor after clearness and truth appears also in his
philosophical stand-point, and makes him prefer to give the definition of
his own problem in the study of nature from a narrow view, rather than
to suffer in it even a semblance of a proposition accepted on faith, as
nature’s conformity to law possibly is. And still he analyzed nature
not merely as a critical thinker. His greatest discovery shows that he
possessed also the alert introspection, the sympathetic investigation, and
the intuitive insight into the working of natural forces, without which
no true student of nature can make investigations. We repeat, Kirch-
hoff was one of the greatest students of nature, because he was a math-
ematical physicist in the sense explained above.
ON HEREDITY.*

By Sir WILLIAM TURNER.

The subject of heredity (if I may say so) is in the air at the present
time. The prominence wiich it has assumed of late years is in connec-
tion with its bearing on the Darwinian theory of natural selection, and
consequently biologists generally have had their attention directed to
it. But in its relations toiman, his structure, functions, and diseases, it
has long occupied a prominent position in the minds of anatomists,
physiologists, and physicians. That certain diseases, for example, are
hereditary was recognized by Hippocrates, who stated generally that
hereditary diseases are difficelt to remove, and the influence which the
hereditary transmission of disease exercises upon the duration of life
is the subject of a chapter in pumerous works on practical medicine,
and forms an important element in the valuation of lives for life insur-
ance.

The first aspect of the question which has to be determined is whether
any physical basis can be found for heredity. The careful study, espe-
cially during the last few years, of the development of a number of
species of animals, mostly but not exclusively amongst the invertebrata,
by various observers, has established the important fact that the young
animal arises by the fusion within the egg or germ-cell of an extremely
minute particle derived from the male parent, with an almost equally
minute particle, derived from the germ-cell produced by the female
parent. These particles are technically termed in the former case the
male pronucleus, in the latter the female pronucleus, and the body formed
by their fusion is called the segmentation nucleus. These nuclei are so
small that it seems almost a contradiction in terms to speak of their
magnitude,—rather one might say their minitude ; for it requires the
higher powers of the best microscopes to see them and follow out the
process of conjugation. But notwithstanding their extreme minute-
ness, the pronuclei and the segmentation nucleus are complex. both in
chemical and molecular structure. From the segmentation nucleus pro-
duced by the fusion of the pronuclei with each other, and from corre-

sponding changes which occur in the protoplasm of the egg which sur-
rounds it, other cells arise by a process of division, and these in their
turn also multiply by division. Thése cells arrange themselves in course
of time into layers, which are termed the germinal or embryonic layers.
From these layers arise all the tissues and organs of the body, both in
its embryonic and adult stages of life.

The starting-point of each individual organism—i. e., of each new gen-
eration—is therefore the segmentation nucleus. Every cellin the adult
body is derived by descent from that nucleus through repeated division.
As the segmentation nucleus is formed by the fusion of material derived
from both parents, a physical continuity is established between par-
ents and offspring. but this physical continuity carries with it certain
properties which cause the offspring to reproduce, not only the bodily
configuration of the parent, but other characters. In the case of man
we find along with the family likeness in form and features, a corre-
spondence in temperament and disposition, in the habits and mode of
life, and sometimes in the tendency to particular diseases. This trans-
mission of characters from parent to offspring is summarized in the
well-known expression that “ like begets like,” and it rests upon a phys-
ical basis. The sizeof the particles which are derived from the parents
(called the male and female pronuclei), the potentiality of which is so
utterly out of proportion to their bulk, is almost inconceivably small

when compared with the magnitude of the adult body. And yet these-

particles are sufficient to stamp the characters of the parents, of the
grandparents, and of still more remote ancestors on the offspring, and
to preserve them throughout life, notwithstanding the constant changes
to which the cells forming the tissues and organs of the body are sub-
jected in connection with their use and nutrition.

In considering the question of how new individuals are produced, one
must keep in mind that it is not every cell in the body which ean act
as a center of reproduction for a new generation, but that certain cells,
which we name germ-cells and sperm-cells, are set aside for that pur-
pose. These cells, destined for the production of the next generation,
form but a small proportion of the body of the animal in which they
are situated. They are as arule marked off from the rest of the cells or
of its body at an early period of development. The exact stage at which
they become specially differentiated for reproductive purposes varies
however in different organisms. In some organisms (as is said by Bal-
biani to be the case in Chironomus) they apparently become isolated
before the formation of the germinal layers is completed ; but as a rule
their appearance is later; and in the higher organisms, not until the
development of the body is relatively much more advanced.

The germ-cells after their isolation take no part in the growth of the
organism in which they arise; and their chief association with the other
cells of its body is that certain of the latter are of service in their nutri-
tion. The problem therefore for consideration is the mode in which

se
ON HEREDITY. 543

these germ or reproductive cells become influenced, so that after having
been isolated from the cells which make up the bulk of the body of the
parent they can transmit to the offspring the characters of the parent
organism. Various speculations and theories have been advanced by
the way of explanation. The well-known theory of Pangenesis, which
Charles Darwin with characteristic moderation put forward as merely a
provisional hypothesis, assumes that gemmules are thrown off from each
different cell or unit throughout the body which retain the characters of
the cells from which they spring; that the gemmules aggregate them-
selves either to form or to become included within the reproductive
cells; and that in this manner they and the characters which they
convey are capable of being transmitted in a dormant state to sueces-
sive generations, and to reproduce in them the likeness of their parents,
grandparents, and still older ancestors.

In 1872, and four years afterwards, in 1876, Mr. Francis Galton pub-
lished most suggestive papers on kinship and heredity.* In the latter
of these papers he developed the idea that ‘the sum total of the
germins, gemmules, or whatever they may be called,” which are to be
found in the newly fertilized ovum, constitute a stirp, or root. That
the germs which make up the stirp consist of two groups; the one
which develops into the bodily structure of the individual, and which
constitutes therefore the personal structure; the other, which remains
latent in the individual, aud forms, as it were, an undeveloped residuum
That it is from these latent or residual germs that the sexual elements
intended for producing the next generation are derived, and that these
germs exercise a predominance in matters of heredity. Further, that
the cells which make up the personal structure of the body of the in-
dividual, exercise only ina very faint degree any influence on the repro-
ductive cells, so that any modifications acquired by the individuals are
barely, if at all, inherited by the offspring.

Subsequent to the publication of Mr. Galton’s essays, valuable con-
tributions to the subject of heredity have been made by Professors
Brooks, Naegeli, Nussbaum, Weismann, and others. Professor Weis-
mann’s theory of heredity embodies the same fundamental idea as that
propounded by Mr. Galton; but as he has employed in its elucidation
a phraseology which is more in harmony with that generally used by
biologists, it has had more immediate attention given to it. As Weis-
mann’s essays have during the present year been translated for, and
published by the Clarendon Press,t under the editorial superintendence
of Messrs. Poulton, Schonland, and Shipley, they are now readily ac-
cessible to all English readers.

Weismann asks the fundamental question, ‘‘ How is it that a single
cell of the body can contain within itself all the hereditary tendencies
of the whole organism?” He at once discards the theory of pangenesis,

* Proceedings Roy. Soc. Lond., 1872, and Journ, Anthrop. Inst., 1876, vol v.
t Oxford, 1889.
544 ON HEREDITY.

and states that in his belief the germ-cell, so far as its essential and
characteristic substance is concerned, is not derived at all from the body
of the individual in whichit is produced, but directly from the parent
germ-cell from which the individual has also arisen. He calls his theory
the continuity of the germ-plasm, and he bases it upon the supposition
that in each individual a portion of the specific germ-plasm derived
from the germ-cell of the parent is not used up in the construction of
the body of that individual, but is reserved unchanged for the forma-
tion of the germ-cells of the succeeding generation. Thus like Mr.
Galton, he recognizes that in the stirp or germ there are two classes of
cells destined for entirely distinct purposes: the one for the develop-
ment of the soma or body of the individual, which class he calls the so-
matic cells; the other for the perpetuation of the species, 7. ¢., for re-
production. In further exposition of his theory, Weismann goes on to
say.as the process of fertilization is attended by a conjugation of the
nuclei of the reproductive cells (the pronuclei referred to in an earlier.
part of this address), that the nuclear substance must be the sole bearer
of hereditary tendencies. Each of the two uniting nuclei would con-
tain the germ-plasm of one parent, and this germ-plasm also would
contain that of the grandparents as well as that of all previous gen-
erations. - - -

it follows therefore from this theory that the germ-plasm possesses
throughout, the same complex, chemical, and molecular structure, and
that it would passs through the same stages when the conditions of
development are the same, so that the same final product would arise.
Each successive generation would have therefore an identical starting-
point, so that an identical product would arise from all of them.
Weismann does not absolutely assert that an organism can not exer-
cise a modifying influence upon the germ-cells within it; yet he limits
this influence to such slight effect as that which would arise from the
nutrition and growth of the individual, and the reaction of the germ-
cell upon changes of nutrition caused by alteration in growth at the
periphery, leading to some change in the size, number, and arrange-
ments of its molecular units. But he throws great doubt upon the
existence of such a re-action, and he, more emphatically than Mr. Gal-
ton, argues against the idea that the cells which make up the somatic
or personal structure of the individual exercise any influence on the
reproductive cells. From his point of view the structural or other
properties which characterize a family, a race, or a species, are derived
solely from the reproduetive cells through continuity of their germ-
plasm, and are not liable to modification by the action on them of the
organs or tissues of the body of the individual organism in which they
are situated.

The central idea of heredity is permanency; that like begets like, or
as Mr. Galton more fitly puts it, that “like tends to produce like.” But
though the offspring conform with their parents in all their main char-
ON HEREDITY. 545

acteristics, yet, as every one knows, the child is not absolutely like its
parents, but possesses its own character, its own individuality. It is
easy for any one to recognize that differences exist amongst men when
he compares one individual with another; but it is equally easy for
those who make a special study of animals to recognize tndividual dif-
ferences in them also. Thus a pigeon or canary fancier distinguishes
without fail the various birds in his flock and a shepherd knows every
sheep under his charge. But the anatomist tells us that these differ-
ences are more than superficial,—that they also pervade the internal
structure of the body. Intimately associated therefore with the con-
ception of heredity—that is, the transmission of characters common to
both parent and offspring—is that of variability,—that is, the appear-
ance in an organism of certain characters which are unlike those pos-
sessed by its parents. Heredity therefore may be defined as the per-
petuation of the like; variability, as the production of the unlike.

And now we may ask, Is it possible to offer any feasible explanation of
the mode in which variations in organic structure take their rise in the
course of development of an individual organism? Anything that one
may say on this head is of course a matter of speculation, but certain facts
may be adduced as offering a basis for the construction of an hypothesis,
and on this matter Professor Weismann makes a number of ingenious
suggestions.

Prior to the conjugation of the male and female pronuclei to form the
segmentation nucleus, a portion of the germ-plasm is extruded from the
egg to form what are called polar bodies. Various theories have been
advanced to account for the significance of this curious phenomenon.
Weisman explains it on the hypothesis that a reduction of the number of
ancestral germ-plasms in the nucleus of the egg is a necessary prepara-
tion for fertilization and for the development of the young animal. He
supposes that by the expulsion of the polar bodies one-half of the num-
ber of ancestral germ-plasms is removed, and that the original bulk is
restored by the addition of the male pronucleus to that which remains.
As precisely corresponding molecules of this plasm need not be expelled
from each ovum, similar ancestral plasms are not retained in each case ;
so that diversities would arise even in the same generation and between
the offspring of the same parents.

Minute though the segmentation nucleus is, yet microscopic re-
search has shown that it is not a homogeneous structureless body,
but is built up of different parts. Most noteworthy is the presence
of extremely delicate threads or fibrils, called the chromatin filaments,
which are either coiled on each other, or intersect to form a net-
work-like arrangement. In the meshes of this network a viscous—and,
so far as we yet know, structureless—substance is situated. Before the
process of division begins in the segmentation nucleus these filaments
swell up and then proceed to arrange themselves at first into one and then
into two star-like figures before the actual division of the nucleus takes

H. Mis, 224——35
546 ON HEREDITY.

place.* It is obvious therefore that the molecules which enter into the
formation of the segmentation nucleus can move within its substance,
and can undergo a re-adjustment in size and form and position. But
this re-adjustment of material is without doubt not limited to those
relatively coarse particles which can be seen and examined under the
microscope, but applies to the entire molecular structure of the segmen-
tation nucleus. Now it must be remembered that the cells of the em-
bryo from which all the tissues and organs of the adult body are de-
rived are themselves descendants of the segmentation nucleus, and they
will doubtless inherit from it both the power of transmitting definite
characters and a certain capacity for re-adjustment both of their con-
stituent materials and the relative positions which they may assume
towards each other. One might conceive therefore that if in a sue-
cession of organisms derived from common ancestors the molecular
_ particles were to be of the same composition and to arrange themselves
in the segmentation nucleus and in the cells derived from it on the
same lines, these successive generations would be alike; but if the lines
of adjustment and the molecular constitution were to vary in the differ-
ent generations, then the products would not ke quite the same. Vari-
ations in strueture and to some extent also in the construction of parts,
would arise, and the unlike would be produced.

In this counection it isalso to be kept in mind that in the higher organ-
isms, and indeed in multicellular organisms generally, an individual is
derived, not from one parent only, but from two parents. If one parent
were tocontributea larger proportion than the other to the formation of a
particular organism, then the balance would be disturbed, the offspring in
its character would incline more to one parent than to the other, accord-

ing to the proportion contributed by each, and a greater scope for the .

production of variations would be provided. These differences would be
increased in number in the course of generations, owing to new combi-
nations of individual characters arising in each generation. As long
as the variations which are produced in an organism are collectively
within a certain limitation, they are merely individual variations, and
express the range within which such an organism, though exhibiting
differences from its neighbors, may yet be classed along with them in
the same species. It is in this sense that I have discussed the term
variability up to the present stage of this address. Thus all those
varieties of mankind which on account of differences in the color of
the skin, we speak of as the white, black, yellow races and red-skins
are men, and they all belong to that species which the zoologists term
Homo sapiens.

But the subject of variability cannot, in the present state of science,
be confined in its discussion to the production of individual variations

*The observations, more especially of Flemming, E. Van Bendenen, Strasburger,
and Carnoy, may be referred to in connection with the changes which take place in

within the limitations of a common species. Since Charles Darwin
enunciated the proposition that favorable variations would tend to
be preserved, and unfavorable ones to be destroyed, and that the result
of this double action, by the accumulation of minute existing differ-
ences, would be the formation of new species by a process of natural
selection, this subject has attained a much wider scope, has acquired
increased importance, and has formed the basis of many ingenious
speculations and hypotheses. As variations when once they have
arisen, may be hereditarily transmitted, the Darwinian theory might
be defined as heredity modified and influenced by variability.

It may be admitted that many variations which may arise in the
development of an individual, and which are of service to that individ-
ual, would tend to be preserved and perpetuated in its offspring by
hereditary transmission. But itis also without question that variations
which are of no service, and indeed are detrimental to the individual in
which they occur, are also capable of being hereditarily transmitted.
This statement 1s amply borne out in the study of those important
defects in bodily structure which pathologists group together under
the name of congenital malformations. The commonest form of mal-
formation is where an increase in the number of digits on the hands or
feef, or on both, occurs in certain families, numerous instances of which
have now been put on record. But in other families there is an hered-
itary tendency to a diminution in the number of digits, or to a defect
in the development of those existing. Another noticeable deformity
which is known to be hereditary in some families is that of imperfect
development of the upper lip and roof of the mouth, technically known
as hare-lip and cleft palate.

These examples illustrate what may be called the coarser kinds of
hereditary deformity, where the redundancies or defects in parts of the
body are so gross as at once to attract attention. But modifications or
variations in structure that can be transmitted from parent to offspring
are by no means limited to changes which can be detected by the naked
eye. They are sometimes so minute as to be determined rather by the
modifications which they occasion in the function of the organ than by
the ready recognition of structural variations. [Cases of color-blind-

ness, and of deaf-mutism were then referred to.| -— - Dr. Horner
has related a most interesting family history in which color-blindness

nearly seven times greater when both parents are deaf than when only
one is so. In the latter case the chance of a child being born deaf is
less than ? per cept., in the former the chances are that 5 per cent. of
the children will be deaf-mutes.

Although a sufficient number of cases has now been put on record to
prove that in some families one or other kind of congenital deformity
may be hereditarily transmitted, yet I do not wish it to be supposed
that congenital malformations may not arise in individuals in whom no
hereditary tendency can be traced.

The variations I have spoken of as congenital malformations arise, as
a rule, before the time of birth, during the early development of the
individual; but there is an important class of cases in which the evi-
dences for hereditary transmission is more or less strong, which may
not exhibit their peculiarities unti] months, or even years, after the
birth of the individual This class is spoken of as hereditary diseases,
and the structural and functional changes which they produce exercise
most momentous influences. Sometimes these diseases may occasion
changes in the tissues and organs of the body of considerable magni-
tude, but at other times the alteration is much more subtle, is molecu-
lar in its character, requires the microscope for its determination, or is
even incapable of being recognized by that instrument.

Had one been discussing the subject of hereditary disease twenty
years ago, the first example probably that would have been adduced
would have been tuberculosis, but the additions to our knowledge of
late years throw some doubt upon its hereditary character. There can,
of course, be no question that tubercular disease propagates itself in
numerous families from generation to generation, and that such families
show a special susceptibility or tendency to this disease in one or other
ofits forms. But whilst fully admitting the pre-disposition to it which
exists in certain families, there is reason to think that the structural
disease itself is not hereditarily transmitted, but that it is directly ex-
cited in each individual in whom it appears by a process of external infec-
tion due to the action of the tubercle bacillus. Still, if the disease itself
be not inherited, a particular temperament which renders the constitu-
tion liable to be attacked by it, is capable of hereditary transmission.

Sir James Paget,* when writing on the subject of cancer, gives statis-
tics to show that about a quarter of the persons affected were aware of
the existence of the same disease in other members of their family, and
he cites particular instances in which cancer was present in two and
even four generations. He had no doubt that the disease can be in-
herited—not, he says, that strictly speaking, cancer, or cancerous mate-
rial is transmitted, but a tendency to the production of those conditions
which will finally manifest themselves in a cancerous growth. The germ
from the cancerous parent must be so far different from the normal as
after a lapse of years to engender the cancerous condition.

Heredity is also one of the most powerful factors in the production
of those affections which we call gout and rheumatism. Sir Dyce Duck-
worth, the latest systematic writer on gout, states that in those families
whose histories are the most complete and trustworthy the influence is

* Lectures on Surgical Pathology, 3d ed,, London, 1870.
ON HEREDITY. 549

strongly shown, and occurs in from 50 to 75 per cent. of the cases ;
further, that the children of gouty parents shoe signs of articular gout
at an age when they have not assumed those habits of life and peculi-
arities of diet which are regarded as the exciting causes of the disease.

In connection with the tendency to the transmissibility of either con-
genial malformations or diseases, consanguinity in the parents, al-
though by no means a constant occurrence, is a factor which in many
cases must be taken into consideration.* If we could conceive both par-
ents to be physiologically perfect, then it may be presumed that the off:
spring would be soalso; but if there be a departure in one parent from the
plane of physiological perfection, then it may safely be assumed that
either the immediate offspring or a succeeding generation will display
a corresponding departure in a greater or less degree, Should both
parents be physiologically imperfect, we may expect the imperfections,
if they are of alike nature, to be intensified in the children. It is in
this respect therefore that the risk of consanguineous marriages arises;
for no family can lay claim to physiological perfection.

When we speak of tendencies, susceptibilities, proclivities, or pre-
disposition to the transmission of characters, whether they be normal
or pathological, we employ terms which undoubtedly have a certain
vagueness. We are as yet quite unable to recognize, by observation
alone, in the germ-plasm any structural change which would enable
us to say that a particular tendency or susceptibility will be manifested
in an organism derived from it. We can only determine this by fol-
lowing out the life-history of the individual. Still it is not the less true
that these terms express a something, of the importance of which we are
all conscious. So far as man is concerned, the evidence in favor of a
tendency to the transmission of both structural and functional modifi-
cations which are either of disservice or positively injurious, or both,
is quite as capable of proof as that for the transmission of characters
which are likely to be of service. Hence useless as well as useful char-
acters may be selected and transmitted heriditarily.

Much has been said and written during the last few years of the trans-
mission from parents to offspring of characters which have been ‘ae-
quired” by the parent, so that I cannot altogether omit some reference
to this subject. It will conduce to one’s clearness of perception of this
much-discussed question, if one defines at the outset in what sense the
term ‘** acquired characters” is employed; and it is the more advisable
that this should be done, as the expression has not always been used
with the same signification. This term may be used in a wide or ina
more restricted sense. In its wider meaning it may cover all the char-
acters which make their first appearance in an individual, and which
are not found in its parents, in whatever way they have arisen :—

(1) Whether their origin be due to such molecular changes in the

germ-plasm as may be called spontaneous, leading to such an altera-
tion in its character as may produce a new variation ; or,

(2) Whether their origin be accidental, or due to habits, or to the
nature of the surroundings, such as climate, food, ete.

Professor Weismann has pointed out with great force the necessity
of distinguishing between these two kinds of “acquired characters,”
and he has suggested two terms, the employment of which may keep
before us how important it is that these different modes of origin should
be recognized. Characters which are produced in the germ-plasm it-
self by natural selection, and all other character which result from this
latter cause, he names blastogenic. He further maintains that all blasto-
genic characters can be transmitted ; and in this conclusion, doubtless
most persons will agree with him. On the other hand, he uses the term
somatogenic to express those characters which first appear in the body
itself, and which follow from the re-action of the soma under direct ex-
ternal influences. He includes under this head the effects of mutila-
tion, the changes which follow from increased or diminished perform-
ance of function, those directly due to nutrition, and any of the other
direct external influences which act upon the body. He further main-
tains that the somatogenic characters are not capable of transmission
from parent to offspring, and he suggests that in future discussions on
this subject the term “ acquired characters” should be restricted to
those which are somatogenic.

That the transmission of character so required can take place is the
foundation of the theory of Lamark, who imagined that the gradual
transformation of species was due to a change in the structure of a part
of an organism under the influence of new conditions of life, and that
such modifications could be transmitted to the offspring. It was also
regarded as of importance by Charles Darwin, who stated,* that all the
changes of corporeal structure and mental power cannot be exclusively
attributed to the natural selection of such variations as are often called
spontaneous, but that great value must be given to the inherited effects
of use and dis-use, some also to the modification in the direct and pro-
longed action of changed conditions of life, also to occasional rever-
sions of structure. Herbert Spencer believes,t that the natural se-
lection of favorable varieties is not in itself sufficient to account for
the whole of organic evolution. He attaches a greater importance
than Darwin did to the share of use and dis-use in the transmission
of variations. He believes that the inheritance of functionally pro-
duced modifications of strueture takes place universally, and that
as the modification of structure is a vera causa as regards the indi-
vidual, it is unreasonable to suppose that it leaves no traces in pros-
terity.

_On the other hand, there are very eminent authorities who, contend

ON HEREDITY. 551

that the somatogenic acquired characters are not transmissible from
parent to offspring. Mr. Francis Galton (for example) gives a very
qualified assent to the possibility of transmission. Professor His, of
Leipsig, doubts its validity. Professor Weismann says that there is no
proof of it. Mr. Alfred Russel Wailace in his most recent work* con-
siders that the direct actions of the environment (even if we admit that
its effects on the individual are transmitted by inheritence) are so small
in Comparison with the amount of spontaneous variation of every part
of the organism, that they must be quite overshadowed by the latter.
Whatever causes (he says) have been at work, natural selection is su-
preme to an extent which even Darwin himself hesitated to claim for it.
There is thus a conflict of opinion amongst the authorities who have
given probably the most thought to the consideration of this question.

In the first place I would however express my agreement with
much that has been said by Professor Weismann on the want of sufti-
cient evidence to justify the statement that a mutilation which has af-
fected a parent can be transmitted to the offspring. It is I suppose
within the range of knowledge of most of us that children born of par-
ents who have lost an eye, an arm, or a leg, come into the world with
the full complement of eyes and limbs. The mutilation of the parent
has not affected the offspring; and one would indeed scarcely expect
to find that such gross visible losses of parts as take place wien a limb
is removed by an accident or surgical operation, should be repeated in
the offspring. but a similar remark is also applicable to such minor
mutilations as scars,of the transmission of which to the offspring,
though it has been stoutly contended for by some, vet seems not to be
supported by sufficiently definite instances.

I should search for illustrations of the transmission of somatogenic
characters in the more subtle processes which affect living organisms,
rather than those which are produced by violence and accident. I shall
take as my example certain facts which are well known to those engaged
in the breeding of farm-stock or of other animals that are of utility
to, or are specially cultivated by, man. I do not refer to the influ-
ence on the offspring of impressions made on the senses and nervous
system of the mother, the first statement of the effects of which we
find in the book of Genesis, where Jacob set peeled rods before the
flocks in order to influence the color and markings of their young;
though I may state that I have heard agriculturists relate instances
from their own experience which they regarded as bearing out the
view that impressions acting through the mother do influence her off-
spring. But I refer to what is an axiom with those who breed any
particular kind of stock, that to keep the strain pure, there must be
no admixture with stock of another blood. For example, if a short-
horned cow has a calf by 4 highland sire, that calf, of course, exhibits
characters which are those of both its parents. But future calves

* Darwinism. London, 1889. P. 443.
552 ON HEREDITY.

which the same cow may have when their sires have been of the short-
horned blood, may, in addition to short-horn characters, have others
which are not short-horned but highland.

The most noteworthy instance of this transmission of characters ac-
quired from one sire through the same mother to her offspring by other
sires, is that given in the often-quoted experiment by a former Lord
Morton.* An Arabian mare in his possession produced a hybrid, the
sire of which was a quagga, and the young one was marked by zebra-
like stripes. But the same Arabian had subsequently two foals, the
sire of which was an Arab horse, and these also showed some zebra-like
markings. How then did these markings characteristic of a very differ-
ent animal arise in these foals, both parents of which were Arabians ?
I can imagine it being said that this was a case of reversion to a very
remote striped ancestor, common alike to the horse and the quagga.
But to my mind no such far-fetched and hypothetical explanation is
necessary. The cause of the appearance of the stripes seems to me to
be much nearer and more obvious. I believe that the mother had ae-
quired during her prolonged gestation with the hybrid, the power of
transmitting quagga-like characters from it, owing to the interchange
of material which had taken place between them in connection with the
nutrition of the young one. For it must be kept in mind that in pla-
cental mammals an interchange of material takes place in opposite di-
rectious, from the young to the mother as well as from the mother to
the young.t In this way, the germ-plasm of the mother, belonging to
ova which had not yet matured, had become modified whilst still lodged
in the ovary. This acquired modification had influenced her future
offspring, derived from that germ-plasm, so that they in their turn,
though in a more diluted form, exhibited zebra-like markings. If this
explanation be correct, then we have an illustration of the germ-plasm
having been directly influenced by the soma, and of somatogenic ac-
quired characters having been transmitted.

Those who uphold the view that characters acquired by the soma
can not be transmitted from parents to offspring undoubtedly draw so
large a check on the bank of hypothesis that one finds it difficult, if not
impossible, to honor it. Let us consider for a moment all that is in-
volved in the acceptance of this theory, and apply it in the first instance
toman. On the supposition that all mankind have been derived from
common ancestors through the continuity of the germ-plasm, and that
this plasm has undergone no modification from the persona or soma of
the succession of individuals through whom it has been transmitted, it
would follow that the primordial human germ-plasm must have con-
tained within itself an extraordinary potentiality of development; a

potentiality so varied, that all the multiform variations in physical
structure, tendency to disease, temperament, and other characters and
dispositions which have been exhibited by all the races and varieties of
men who either now inhabit, or at any period in the world’s history have
inhabited, the earth must have been included in it. — - -

Let us now glance at the other side of the question. All biologists
will, | suppose, accept the proposition that the individual soma is influ-
enced or modified by its environments or surroundings. Now, if on the
basis of this proposition, the theory be grafted that modifications or vari-
ations thus produced are capable of so affecting the germ-plasm of the
individual in whom the variation arises as to be transmitted to its off:
spring (and I have already given cases in point), then such variations
might be perpetuated. If the modification is of service, then presum-
ably it will add to the vitability of the individual, and through the
inter-action between the soma and the germ-plasm, in connection with
their respective nutritive changes, will so affect the latter as to lead to
its being transmitted to the offspring. From this point of view the en-
vironment would, as it were, determine and regulate the nature of those
variations which are to become hereditary, and the possibility of varia-
tions arising which are likely to prove useful becomes greater than on
the theory that the soma exercises no influence on the germ-plasm.
Hence | am unable to accept the proposition that somatogenic charac-
ters are not transmitted, and I can not but think that they form an
important factor in the production of hereditary characters.

The morphological aspect of organic structure is undoubtedly of fun-
damental importance. But it should not be forgotton that tissues and
organs—in addition to their subjection to the principles of development
and descent—have to discharge certain specific purposes and functions,
and that structural modifications arise in them in correlation with the
uses 10 which they are put, so as to adopt them to perform modified
duties. It may be difficult to assign the exact force which physiologi-
cal adaptation can exercise in the perpetuation of variations. If the
habit or external condition which has produced a variation continues
to be practiced, then in all probability the variation would be intensi-
fied in successive generations. But should the habit cease or the
external condition be changed, then although the variation might con-
tinue to be for a time perpetuated by descent, it would probably be-
come less strongly marked and perhaps ultimately disappear. By ac-
cepting the theory that somatogenic characters are transmitted we
obtain a more ready explanation, how men belonging to a race living in
one climate or part of the globe can adapt themselves to a climate of a
different kind. On the theory of the non-transmissibility of these ae-
quired characters, long periods of years would have to elapse before the
process of adaptation could be effected. The weaker examples (on this
theory) would have had to die out, and the racial variety would require
to have been produced by the selection of variations arising slowly and
554 ON HEREDITY.

requiring one knows not how many hundreds or thousands of years to
produce a race which could adapt itself to its new environment.

It may perhaps be thought that in selecting the subject of Heredity
for my address, and in treating it as I have to a large extent in its gen-
eral biological aspects, I have infringed upon the province of Section D
(that of Biology). But lam not prepared to admit that any such en-
croachment has been made. Man is a living organism with a physical
structure which discharges a variety of functions, and both structure
and functions correspond in many respects (though with characteristic
differences) with those which are found in animals. The study of his
physical frame cannot therefore be separated from that of other living
beings; and the processes which take place in the one must also be
investigated in the other.

The physical aspect of the question, although of vast importance and
interest, yet by no means covers the whole ground of man’s nature, for in
him we recognize the presence of an element beyond and above his ani-
mal framework. Man is also endowed with a spiritual nature. He pos-
sesses a Conscious responsibility which enables him tocontrol his animal
nature, to exercise a discriminating power over his actions, and which
places him on a far higher and altogether different platform than that
occupied by the beasts which perish. The kind of evolution which we
are to hope and strive for in him is the perfecting of thisspiritual nature,
so that the standard of the whole human race may be elevated and
brought into more harmonious relation with that which is holy and
divine.
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.*

By Dr. RuDOLPH VIRCHOW, of the University of Berlin.
Translated by Rey. C. A. BLEISMER.

Nearly twenty years ago the foundation of our present union meeting
was laid on Austrian soil. A few men attending an association of nat-
uralists, at Innspruck in 1869, formed themselves into a separate sec-
tion, which held its session in a small auditorium of the university.

Of that number my countryman, Koner, has since died, but the rest.
are still living, among them Karl Vogt, Professor Semper (first general
secretary of the German Anthropological Society), Professor Seligman,
of Vienna, and some others.

And as I see with us Count Enzenberg, the secretary of that section,
there are here at least two representatives of that memorable day.

Every member ot that little gathering was fully convinced that Ger-
many and Austria ought to be united in anthropological matters and
that only through united work could any success be expected in anthro-
pological investigations. A call was published for the establishment
of a General German Anthropological Society, which should unite all
German workers, including the German Swiss and the Germans in
Austria.

At a subsequent meeting held in Mayence, in May, 1870, for the pur-
pose of drafting a constitution, a number of Austrians participated and
the articles were purposely framed in such a manner as to include Ger-
man Austrians. But circumstances are frequently more powerful than
the intentions of men.

The current of opinion during the period following this meeting was
contrary to our purpose, which represented ideas based upon an un-
prejudiced consideration of events. Previously, in 1869, there had been
formed an Anthropological Society at Berlin, the first one in Germany,
also a separate society at Vienna, but only the Berlin society became a
branch of the General German Society. It seemed impossible for some
time to find any direct point of contact with the society at Vienna,

although there was no variance between them_and us. Individual mem-
bers—as I most gratefully admit, (among whom our president, Baron
von Andrian, is one,) often expressed their regret at our lack of union.

In 1881, the first attempt to bring about a union was made when the

xyerman and the Austrian anthropologists held their general meetings

successively at Regensburg and Salzburg, both attending each other’s
session. Since that time the idea of union gained strength until it
was realized in our present joint meeting; and may a sentiment of
union be developed that shall complete the work which we began.

You all understand that this question of nationality is a very impor.
tant one in an anthropological sense.

We must always start from What is known; our question is that of
habitat. And here we differ from the zoologist, who is only to a limited
degree concerned about this question. Not until we know whence a
person came and where he lived is he a legitimate subject of anthropo-
logical investigation. This holds true also with respect to a human
skull. An unknown skull may be momentarily of some interest, but
from a scientific stand-point it is of no importance until its habitat has
been determined.

Tis x60cv cis dvdpdy is @ question which not merely concerns our every
day life, but is an important one for the anthropologist. It is a very
difficult matter to make collectors of skulls understand that not merely
skulls, but skulls of persons or tribes are needed, that can be identified
as regards their habitat. Then only are they of any anthropological
value to the investigator.

A skull per se is of very little account to us, but when its nationality
is known it begins to exist, so to speak. We must not forget more-
over that our conceptions of nationality are largely based upon our
present relationships, and that these become of less value the farther
back we go, and that they are of ne value at all when we reach the
period in which clearly defined nationalities are not known.

Every evidence of nationality ceases in pre-historic times; it is then
a mere abstraction. There nationality has to be made up and a no-
menclature adopted which can be at best only a designation for a cer-
tain period, valueless in itself and unintelligible to future times. To
be sure, to talk about a race of Cannstatt or of Cro-Magnon may sound
very learned, but I hope that ere long such a phraseology will be dis-
carded.

At present questions of nationality can be settled only with great
difficulty. We may be sure of being tolerably successful, if we select
some island of the Pacific Ocean. There nationality is fully developed
and its people are tangible; every one of them is easily recognized as
belonging to a distinct nationality, and our experience is similar to that
of the geologist who can construct a whole species from a single, or at
most only from a few skulls of animals, or who at any rate can determine
from a single skull the craniology of the whole species. It would be very
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY -YEARS. ata |

pleasant to be able to trace the history of a whole tribe whenever a skull
is found, but unfortunately we are too often confronted with such com-
plicated variations that we lose all data for making out the nationality.
Kut in an island of the Pacific Ocean, which possesses much more scien-
titic interest than political importance, we find an avalogy to animal
races, viz: races of men, developed in circumscribed surroundings, with
definite characteristics, easily pointed out, who represented a distinct
type. Much to our regret this can be done only very infrequently in
the case of continental tribes or nations. ‘To determine the question of
nationality with regard to a Kuropean would take many days.

Permit me to emphasize right here that we as anthropologists have
little right to thrust into the foreground the idea of nationality, in a
narrow sense of the word. We know that every nationality, take for
instance, the German or the Slavonic, is of a composite character, and
that no one can say, on the spur of the moment, from what original
stock either may have been developed. We usually call the Germans
blonde and the Slavonians brunette, yet just as great variations in this
respect can be found among the Germans as among Slavonians.  In-
deed, northern, southern, eastern, and western groups of either nation
present such a large number of variations that it is just as difficult to
assert that the Germans came from a common stock, as is the case with
the Slavonians. Consanguinity and heredity have been urged an ex-
planation of these differences, but it has been proven that certain Sla-
vonic groups are more nearly related to the Germans than to their own
Slavonic brethren. If we compare the blonde element among the Poles
and Galicians with the brunette Slavonians of the south, itis found
that they not only differ with respect to color of skin, of eyes, and of
hair, but also in a very marked degree in the structure of their skull ;
so much so indeed that the former show a greater affinity to our Ger-
man tribes than to the Slavonian. In Northern Germany matters are
still more intricate. There, in some of the old burial fields, skulls are
found which might be called Germanic, were it not that they clearly
possess Slavonic added character, so that for the present at least these
fields must be considered Slavonic burial places. To make the case still
stronger, there are found in the famous grave-rows (Reihengriber) of
the period of the Franks or of the Merovingians, with their character-
istic ornaments and weapons, skulls which very distinctly present the
peculiarities of the Germanic type. Corresponding to these in an an-
thropological sense, a large number of graves have been opened in the
east of Germany where similar types of skulls are found; but these are
lacking in Frankish peculiarities and are characterized by Slavonic
marks. Greater contrasts than these can not be imagined.

It is at present an impossibility and probably will be for all times to
trace back to a common type either the Slavonic or the German tribes.
When we compare the short and thick skulls of our Alemannic brethren
with the long and low skulls of the Frisians and Hanoverians, it is evi-
558 ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

dent that they differ more from each other than is the case with skulls of
certain Slavonic or German tribes. Consequently we must give up the
idea of an original consanguinity in respect to each one of the historic
nationalities. We do not possess as yet any known conclusive series of
observations by means of which it can be demonstrated that from dolicho-
cephalous families there have been developed brachycephalous individ-
nals, such as we find among Slavonic or Germanic tribes. It may he
possible by means of cross breeding to develop in process of time from
a dolichocephalous family a brachyeephalous one; but actual proof of
this has not as yet been produced. Hence we are compelled to adopt
as a solution the theory of ‘‘ mixed races.” A mixed race is one whose
elements are people of different blood, not of one blood: it is one which
can not appeal to a common origin but which in the course of time was
made up of elements of different original races. This theory causes
us, as you easily see, to attach but little importance to nationalities as
such existing at present. It will be our task to determine the localities
of the original elements of this mixture, and to ascertain whence came
these brachycephalous and these dolichocephalous peoples. Somewhere
there must be a starting point for each of these categories, since upon
an anthropological map these distinctions are marked with geological
clearness. This difficulty not only exists in Germany or Austria but
also in Russia. What are now called Russians are made up of a very
composite mass of elements, derived from the farthest parts of Asia,
from Turanian and Mongolian stocks. Hence our colleagues in the
East are in no less a quandary than ourselves. They too meet wide
differences between north and south, east and west.

In the popular mind these questions are very easily cousidered to be
concerned merely with a single nationality, but we must not only try
to solve them in respect to one nation, but for the whole of Europe. In
attempting to do this our investigations carry us further and further
from a consideration of their special relation to individual nations. I
may be permitted to say right here, that we are all especially interested
to see such investigations carried on in this Austrian Monarchy ; for
Austria in its peculiar development has preserved in greater purity the
remnants of old nationalities, than any other state in Europe. Every-
where else the change of former environments has gone on to a larger
extent, the remains of antiquity have been crowded back so far that at
present it is very difficult to make collections of the very oldest remains.

We are now occupied with the establishment of a museum in Berlin
for German costumes and domestic utensils; we intend to preserve in
it everything that can yet be saved from destruction. In some locali-
ties the very last relic has been secured for our museum. Here and
there we meet with lingering recollections of primitive days, but these
can not be compared with the living realities in so many districts of
Austria.

A reference to dead and living languages will make plain this con-
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. 509

trast referred to. For while adead language may indeed be studied,
the investi gation of a living language secures to a greater degree a com-
prehension of its fundamental elements, than the mere study of authors,
each one of whom expresses his own individuality. So that we lose
sight of the fact that this individuality of the author studied can not
be the portrait of the thoughts of the people to whom he belongs. On
this account we notice with especial gratitude the efforts along that
line, which are gradually spreading throughout all Austria and of which
the late Crown Prince Rudolf was the acknowledged leader.

Extensive labors were carried on under his direction and by reason
of his personal participation in them promised to yield rich returns of
trustworthy reports taken from life concerning.the nationalities of
Austria. To-day the place is vacant in which lhe hoped to stand; at
the throne we were considering the establishment of this congress ;
and it is fitting that I should voice the sorrow of all on account of the
loss which this great country has sustained in him who seemed to be
one of the most humane princes of this century. We trust that the
idea bequeathed to us in his words will not be lost, but prove a precious
heritage to Austria, which will be carried on by her to completion. It
will be our aim to do all in our power to foster a spirit of union with
our neighbors, which is so essential to the success of such an under-
taking.

In the department of archeology, you have made large advances
during the last few years, completely over shadowing the rather slow
progress of former years, which caused at times a little feeling of im-
patience in the bosom of your superintendent. Those of us who saw
yesterday your new buildings and your finely arranged collections were
obliged to ground their weapons. We can not longer keep up our
rivalry in view of such magnificence and completeness. Such a palace
of science as your Imperial Natural Historic Museum can be found no-
where else, and we too though strangers, must praise most highly the
beneficent plans of His Majesty the Emperor, as well as of the Govern-
ment, which have been executed in such an admirable manner. Here
we find revealed the incredible riches of pre-historic materials belonging
to Austria. Scarcely can there be found anywhere else a museum sur-
passing this one.

We are always sure to see in Austria, every possible effort made to
put into execution any views which have fully gained ascendancy. I
hope therefore that under the direction of Mr. von Hauer, with the
assistance of such accomplished investigators as are here to be found, a
further development of the pre-historic archeology of Austria may take
place and reach such a degree of perfection that the different branches
of local types will be arranged into a comprehensive whole.

Several years ago we differed widely concerning the interpretation
of certain local finds. At that time the most noted Austrian investi-
gators thought that the original seat of European civilization must
560 ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

have been in the mountains of Austria, while the Germans contended
that the starting point must be looked for farther south. I myself,
although recognizing the importance of this local development, was in
favor of the German theory. It seems to me that every day the bonds
are made stronger of a definite connection among the nations of the
north and south as regards their civilization.

My own travels in places of ancient human civilization as well as :
study of recent literature convince me that the numerous finds made
in Egypt and Babylonia prove conclusively that the origins of our
civilization are to be found only to a small degree in our own country,
or that they have arisen out of individual necessities, but that on the
contrary there exists a connection with the pre-historic times of those
nations of ancient civilizations, and that from them there have been
derived our present lines of culture. I will not say anything further
concerning this point, only to call your attention to a publication of
investigations in our Berliner Zeitschrift fiir Ethnologie concerning old
weights and measures. These investigations demonstrate again the
fact that our present weights and measures existed in all their details
in remotest antiquity and were at that time in common use, that our
modern measures correspond to the old as far as one-tenth of a gram,
and that we therefore have not made any advancement in respect to
them since 4000 B. ©.

I have stated elsewhere that only a few people can be called inventors.
At times it happens indeed that similar inventions are made at the
same time in different places, and that the same ideas make their way
in different directions, and it is said at such times “these things were
in the air.” But it is not in the air but in living human beings where
such things exist. Yet if at times two men arrive at the same thing,
a closer study proves that after all there is a difference. _ bverywhere,
whenever we can follow the history of human culture in individual
things, we find that it was not the work of the masses which determined
the great lines of civilization, but the work of individuals, or of individual
tribes, or of individual nations, if you please.

Not only in our study but in other matters however we met with
numerous contradictions which for a long time impeded the discovery
of the true direction of civilization in general, and the connections of the
civilization of different countries. This difficulty is so great because
first of all a mass of antiquated traditions remaining until the present
must be discarded in order to determine this question aright. There
are in Europe, perhaps three or four museums in which Caucasian
antiquities are more richly represented than anywhere else, and among
them your Imperial Museum here in Vienna occupies a prominent place.

Until a very recent period when these collections came to Europe it
was a rigid dogma of philologists and archeologists that the bronze
culture had its origin in the Caucasus. Its impossibility has now been
proven, for we do not find bronze of a primitive form or mixture in the
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. 561

Caucasus, but of the same composition as that found in Greece and
Italy, and at the same time in an advanced state of development that
clearly proves it to be an importation. Whether single articles were
imported or only patterns and a knowledge of the art of making bronze
matters little. At any rate the invention must have been made in
another place.

By examining different countries and nations we succeed in narrow-
ing the territory until by keeping on, we may find the point of beginning
of bronze manufacture. We shall probably be unable to find the orig-
inal inventor, but we shall learn the steps which mankind has taken in
its advance regarding bronze manufacture.

It may be mentioned at this point, that just such considerations as
these enable us to cast a retrospective glance upon the last twenty years,
and to exhibit the progress made by us in the science of archeology.
The science of pre-historic archeology twenty years ago bad reached
in but few places its full development. At that time the museum at
Copenhagen was so far ahead of all others that it was considered as
an unattainable prototype; next to this was the one at Lund, and later
on the one at Bergen. Here there was exhibited a seemingly circum-
scribed field of civilization which was called for brevity the Scandi-
navian. The Scandinavians indeed went so far as to believe that their
remote ancestors had invented these things, and that only at the time
of the Romans had there taken place an influx from without. The aged
Nilsson with his Pheenician hypothesis stood all alone. Matters have
changed considerably since then. Many Scandinavians to be sure still
defend the old view, by pointing out the great development which the
older bronze exhibits in the north, but none of them seriously believe
that the invention of bronze was really a northern achievement, even
though the manufacture in bronze shows numerous northern peculiar-
ities. We take in like manner Chinese patterns and copy them, but
although by modifications, the style may be called at last German or
Austrian, the Chinese origin never disappears entirely. Among us
scarcely any one believes in the Scandinavian origin of bronze. At
present we may assume that our Scandinavian friends are convinced
that bronze came to them as a finished thing. The formula of its compo-
sition was invented before it came to the north. Although special pecul-
iarities have been developed and although the art of bronze manufact-
ure seemed to flourish more independently in the north than in the
south, nevertheless they must adinit that their ancestors were not the
inventors of bronze. Here I think lies the main difference between the
former and the present theory. Formerly it was thought that the
secret lay concealed in the north, that there the origin of our metallur-
gical art was to be found and that there had lived the original smith
from whom our people had inherited their technique. During the last
two decades another view has found much favor, and for many good and
strong reasons it is called the Indo-German or Aryan theory. Inter-

esting investigations were made to prove how the Indo-Germans in their
immigrations from the east and from the central parts of the mountains
of Asia, had brought with them on their advance towards Europe, all
sorts of things and formule, not only the knowledge of the smelting of
bronze, but also precious stones like nephrite and jadeite. But this Indo-
Germanic theory has received lately some very damaging blows and
none more destructive than from the quarters of pre-historic archeology.

In spite of much care, we have not as yet succeeded in finding any
patterns in the supposed Asiatic home of bronze. I myself have made
strenuous efforts to find original Indian bronzes, but have not obtained
types which would justify the statement that this importation alluded
to ever took place. Not even sufficient proof can be found for saying
that the classic formula of 90 parts of copper and 10 parts of tin was in
use in India. This formula remained as-constant as the measures of
weight and length. Both facts present a good argument for the exist-
ence of a continuous communication of knowledge from one generation
to the next.

Indian bronzes are zine bronzes, like mixtures found in our country be-
longing to the time of the Roman empire. There are no authentic speci-
mens of them found in Europe dating before the Christian era. Pre-
historic archeology therefore at the present offers the poorest kind of
testimony for the Indo-Germanie origin of bronze. Moreover, the routes
of migration of the Indo-Germans are mapped out differently. Some
authors put them northward of the Aral and Caspian Sea, others to the
south. The northern route must be considered an entirely arbitrary
hypothesis, for there have never been found any Aryan tribes in those
regions. On the other hand, we find along the supposed southern route
of the Indo-Germans mainly a population of brachycephalous peoples,
which fills the Caucasus and the Armenian highlands, Thrace, and Illy-
ria. All these differ materially from those inhabiting the north, espe-
cially from the Seandinavians. This Indo-Germanic hypothesis is
attended with still another difficulty. Existing races in this region not
only differ among themselves in their physical composition and are
crossed in various ways, but they also diverge widely in many of the
conditions of life.

Archeological researches have nowhere led to the beginning of a
common civilization in an indisputably Aryan territory. Of course this
does not necessitate an attempt to locate the origin of the Ayran race
in Germany or Belgium, as has been proposed in the case where the race
of Cannstatt or of Neanderthal (a dolichocephalous people) is said to
represent the original central stock.

The pre-historic theory of the much abused skull of Cannstatt has
been much shattered; it does not fit into that far off period into which
our French neighbors place it. Too little attention has been paid to
the proposition: that international intercourseis a more important factor
archeologically considered than we are wont to think, With an increasing
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. 563

conviction of its truth a greater value will be attached to proofs which
show that there has been a transmitting of culture from one race to an-
other. Nothing has given me greater joy than the discovery of those
large burial fields in the most southern parts of the Austrian Alps, along
the coast and in Istria for which we are indebted to the energy of Messrs.
De Marchesetti and Szombathy. A number of new links have thus
been welded into the chain of the old system of transmission, and the
result of these researches wiil doubtless be embodied in a series of
papers, and given to the public.

Let me emphasize right here that these finds are most valuable be-
cause they prove a pre-historic international intercourse (not migrations,
for this can not be established); and because they exhibit the directions
which civilization has taken. They will also beget in our international
intercourse a little more modesty and amiability than seems to exist at
times on account of a too great sensitiveness about this idea of nation-
ality.

If different races would recognize one another as independent co-la-
borers in the great field of humanity, if all possessed a modesty which
would allow them to see merits in neighboring people, much of the strife
now agitating the world would disappear.

A far greater revolution than that which took place in the sphere of
archeology has been brought about in anthropological science. At
the time of our coming together twenty years ago, Darwinism had just
made its first triumphal march through the world. My friend Karl
Vogt, with his usual vigor, entered the contest and through his personal
advocacy secured for this theory a great adherence. At that time it
was hoped that the theory of descent would conquer not in the form
promulgated by Darwin, but in that by his followers ;—for we have to
deal now not with Darwin but with Darwinians. No one doubted that
the proof would be forthcoming, demonstrating that man descended
from the monkey and that this descent from a monkey or at least from
some kind of an animal would soon be established. This was a chal-
lenge which was made and successfully defended in the first battle.
Every body knew all about it and was interested in it ; some spoke for it,
others against it. It was considered the greatest question of Anthro-
pology.

Let me remind you however at this point that natural science, as long
as it remains such, works only with real existing objects; a hypothesis
may be discussed, but its significance can only be established by pro-
ducing actual proofs in its favor, either by experiments or direct obser-
vations. This Darwinism has not succeeded in doing. In vain have
its adherents sought for connecting links which should connect man
with the monkey ; not a single one has been found. The so-called pro-
anthropos which is supposed to represent this connecting link has not
as yet appeared. No real scientist claims to have seen him; hence
the pro-anthropos is not at present an object of discussion for an an-
564 ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

thropologist. Some may be able to see him in their dreams, but wien
awake they will not be able to say that they have met him. Even the
hope of a future discovery of this pro-anthropos is highly improbable,
for we are not living in a dream, or an ideal world, but in a real one.

At our meeting in Innspruck it looked as if it might become possible
to demnstrate amid the excitement, the descent of man from the mon-
key or some other animal. At present to our regret we do not even
possess the means to prove a descent of the individual races from one
another. It was not known at that time how difficult it is to prove that
all men are brethren, nevertheless laborious attempts were made to show
the unity of mankind.

There was an inclination to single out individual skulls and skele-
tons found among the remains of men in caves, as for instance in the
caves of the “ Maasthal”,) as representative types, and from them
make up the races of primitive ages. Some claimed the original race
to have been Mongoloid, others contended that the first man was Aus-
tralioid. It all depended on the question whether the Mongolians or
the Australians were the lowest race. The first European must have
looked like one of them, it was said. But the first European has not
yet been found. At preset we know that judging from his remains,
primitive man did not resemble a monkey any more than do men of
to-day. Theancients were well formed, they bore the same characteristic
marks which we find in men of our times; not a single one was so
poorly developed as to justify us in saying that he possessed the lowest
form of skull.

Twenty years ago little was known of the skull forms of the lowest
primitive nations. This accounts for hasty judgments passed; the
wildest ideas were afloat about the make-up of the lowest tribes. No
one possessed any exact idea concerning the physical construction of
the Eskimos, Patagonians, ete. To-day there is scarcely upon our
earth a tribe whieh might be called entirely unknown. There is only
one place where there is some possibility of new discoveries,—I mean
the peninsula of Malacca ;—but even in this place we have an energetic
agent at work. Its inhabitants, according to the results of the re-
searches of some, seem to satisfy most nearly the demands made for a
lowes trace. Aside from these we know them all,—Patagonians, Eski-
mos, Bushmen, Veddas, Laplanders, Australians, Polynesians, Mela-
nesians ; about many of them we really know more than of European
nations.

If for instance you take the case of individual islanders and com-
pare them with Albanians, | may say that more investigations have
been made concerning the Polynesian natives than concerning separate
groups of Albanians. All these uncivilized nations, which stand so
low in their mental development, are becoming gradually known to us.
Of most of them we have in Europe good typical examples, concerning
whom the most exact observations in respect to their whole organiza-

Se
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. HOO
tion have been made. Not a few of these died in Europe, and on that
account were more especially noticed. We possess greater knowledge
concerning the brains of a Patagonian than about the brains of the
civilized nations of Asia.

Not one of these examples resembled the monkey any more than (if
indeed as much as) it does our own. Now the systematic naturalist de-
termines the lines separating genera and species in the following manner:
Whenever he finds that the totality of points of one group equals that of
the other, he separates both from related genera or species. {f however
the respective sums of their points are equal he draws a line-between
them and makes of each a separate genus or species. Such a dividing
line is drawn between man and monkey. Every living race of men is
as yet purely human; not one has been found which might be called
pithecoid, or which might be considered an intermediate race between
man and monkey.

I must however admit that there exists a series of peculiarities found
among men which are called pithecoid, and these can not be explained
as mere disturbances or hindrances of their normal development. Let
me illustrate: The higher apes exhibit frequently an especial develop-
ment of the skull in the region of the temples. Just as in the case of
man, several bones join in the depression beneath the muscles covering
this part. From below, the upper edge of the great wing of the sphenoid
bone joins the parietal bone; the squamous portion of the temporal
bone to which the ear is attached touches this spot from behind, and
the frontal bone is joined anteriorly to the other three bones just men-
tioned. These four bones come together in such a manner that the
parietal and the sphenoid bone, joining each other, keep the frontal and
the temporal bone apart by being thus unitedly wedged in between
them. Now in the skuli of the monkey a long process of the temporal
bone is frequently found wedging itself in as far forward as the frontal
bone, thus separating the parietal and the wing of the sphenoid bone.
This constitutes a marked difference of great value, since this does not
occur in man, as a rule, but there exist isolated cases where this same
peculiarity is found.

As we examine large collections of skulls and formulate the result,
we find that certain races show these peculiarities more than others.
So far as we can tell, three races especially exhibit them. We find them
first of all among the Australian and African, 7. ¢., the black races;
then among the yellow in the Malay Archipelago, especially on that
chain of islands which connects New Guinea with Timor, and to which
are joined the Molucea Islands in the north and Australia in the south.

I lectured only a little while ago* concerning a number of skulls of
Alfuros, of Tenimber, among which this peculiarity was noticeable. At
the same time another characteristic was observed, namely, the enor-
mous development of the jaws, as shown in a greatly projecting ridge of

* Vide: Transactions of the Berlin Anthropological Society, 1889, page 177.
566 ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

the arch of the jaw and of the teeth. Associated with this prognath-
ism there is found an inward curving of the nose, together with the
extreme flattening, as if somebody had sat on it. In this case some-
times the nasal bones grow into one, which scarcely ever takes place in
other races of man. These forms also are especially characteristic of
catarrhine apes. Hence this catarrhine nose is a kind of pithecoid
element (Thermorphy). In certain localities this occurs more frequently
than in others, and there may have existed a greater propinquity of re-
lation with apes. It isnot without importance to remember that among
the anthropoid apes, the gorilla and chimpanzee are found in Africa, and
the orang and the gibbon in the Indian Archipelago. But if you in-
quire farther, may not the Australian and the African blacks or the
Malay and the Alfures be the sought-for connecting links which bridge
the chasm between man and the ape? No one can answer with an ab-
solute no. It might be possible, but possibility is a great way from re-
ality. For temporal processes, catarrhine noses, and prognathous jaws,
do not make an ape; a number of other characteristics are necessary
to produce a monkey.

Hypothetically from every piece of skin a monkey may be con-
structed; no anatomist ever doubted this. But the differences between
man and monkey are so wide that almost any fragment is sufficient to
diagnose them. Much is still lacking for a demonstration of the theory
of descent.

How necessary it is then as we may look at the problems of the fu-
ture, to make still more far-reaching researches in this particular branch
of science which has to do with the earlier developments of the human
race. Especially should there be made careful investigations concern-
ing pre-historic man in Australia, and also in Indonesia. if anthropo
logically-trained physicians would stay there continuously and make
researches, perhaps essential and important proofs might be found.

At present they are still lacking, and we can study the early state of
man only by means of what old graves, a few caves, and lake-dwellings,
and what the present can furnish us. I would not pass over in silence
the fact that from all these sources mentioned only specimens of man
have been discovered of which we need not be ashamed and whom we
may fully acknowledge as brethren. Through the kindness of Swiss
colleagues, I was enabled to make comparative examinations of nearly
all the existing skulls of the lake-dwellers. It became evident to me
that even in those times difference existed between tribes which prob-
ably came upon the scene of action one after the other. None of them
however was constructed in such a manner as to lie outside of the phys-
ical form of our present nationalities.

Again, it can not be said that all races have descended from a single
human pair. This matter does not lie within the province of natural
science proper. Everybody may decide that to suit himself. Those
who, on account of their religious convictions, need a first pair, will

"
ee
ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. 567

encounter no objection from us. <A possibility exists, we acknowledge,
that all races and tribes may have sprung from a single pair by means
of transmutations. But no one has actually demonstrated that negroes
descended from white parents, or vice versa. Whenever a black tribe
is found the naturalist supposes that there were negroes before, and
where a white tribe is located that such a tribe always has been white.
Of course, all this is likewise a mere supposition, which can not be es-
tablished. In short, every proof is lacking to show that a nation or a
tribe is capable of a total transmutation. This is seen in Egypt. I
thought that I could find by means of comparative examinations of the
living and the remains and pictures of the dead some points establish-
ing a change of ancient Egyptians into Egyptians of historic times, but
I have returned with the conviction that ancient Egypt and its neigh-
boring countries have not essentially changed during all these periods.
If Menes really existed, there were in his time negroes, since quite
old mural paintings show negroes with all their peculiarities. Nor
do the native Egyptians offer any data to speak of. The Egyptian of
to-day possesses still the forms of the ancient one. Unfortunately for
us, Egyptian skulls and skeletons are not as ancient as we might wish.
There has never a skull been seen belonging to the three oldest dynas-
ties. Hence there is no possibility of a continuous list. But anyhow
the register goes as fair back as 3000 B. Cc. with positive certainty, which
gives us in all some 5000 years. During this long time only one
difference has been noticed, namely: An appearance of brachycephalous
men in the old kingdom in centrast with dolicho- aud meso-cephalous
people of the new kingdom. At any rate, definite proof is not wanting
that since the beginning of the new kingdom, 1700 B. c., no noteworthy
change of type has taken place. A permanence of type accordingly
during thirty-five centuries is established.

It does not look unreasonable to assume a certain influence of climate
and occupation. In this respect both the straitest orthodoxy and the
purest Darwinism agree. Their thesis is the same. The former go as
far back as the first human pair, the latter beyond it to the first pair of
animals ; aside from this they both accept the transmutation ofa primi-
tive race into different races. Those can not sustain scientifically
their position in the case of man, and these as regards the monkey. If
you should ask me whether the first pair was white or black, i must
contess Ido not know. We have no foundation upon which to base
any decision. It can not be supposed that there lived, e. g., in France
at the time of the troglodytes all negroes with woolly heads and that
from these sprung white and straight-haired people. For other reasons
moreover it is not clear to me how or where this could have happened.
The very oldest remains show already differences. It sounds very
plausible that the north made man light complexioned. But in Amer-
ica where similar conditions exist we do not find any blonde natives.
The primitive Germans as well as the Finns of Mongolian origin are
568 ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

blonde, why these should be thus, while the rest of the Mongolians
became black or deeply brunette is a question which we can not an-
swer. It must not be forgotten that language does not stand in correla-
tion with outward physical phenomena. On the contrary, they arerelated
to each other in a similar manner as a process of the forehead which
may appear as a single mark without its necessitating a corresponding
similarity in all the rest of the given characteristics ; nor can we say
that underneath alight skin there is always one and the same arrange-
ment of internal organs. It may be entirely different.

In this particular direction I have tried from the very first appear-
ance of Darwinism to modify the doctrine of heredity. I recognize as
truth the law of heridity, but Lever emphasized, and do so again to-
day, that heredity in man is only a partial one. Man is not subject to
a general heredity by means of which all peculiarities are developed in
him from generation to generation. If botanists have begun upon a
basis of local variations to establish subdivisions, and in that way have
instituted within the same genus individual sub-genera or variations
with hereditary character, it is a very easy matter to form out of these
sub-genera new genera. But the fact that within thesame genus there
occur individual variations which appear to de hereditary, only proves
that the same individual may be the possessor of different hereditary
peculiarities.

It is indeed well known that one may inherit peculiarities from both
father and mother and thus unite in himself a double heredity; or he may
even exhibit characteristics which belonged to his grandparents while
at the same time marks may be present which were inherited from his
parents. In the same individual may unite then the aggregate of par-
tial heredities, which are more or less limited. There may be many of
these parts, but that can not beestablished. Only in the case of twins
it sometimes happens they can not be distinguished without much pains-
taking observations ; whenever they can be distinguished it is done by
means of marks peculiar to each one of them. Hereditary character-
istics under some circumstances may appear with such prominence
that the resulting shape actually differs from the type.

Often people are born with six fingers and six toes. These transmit
this peculiarity and whole families of this description come into exist-
ence. If this peculiarity were cultivated by in-breeding one might
get a whole tribe with six fingers. Something like this exists in the
dynasty of Hadramaut in Southern Arabia where only six-fingered
descendants have any right to the crown. Certainly these are peculiar
formations, but it can not be said on that account that in primeval times
all mankind had six fingers. The negroes in the neighborhood of the
Congo River have often web-membranes between their fingers and since
fishes have not only five but many more single rays in their fins, be-

tween which there is found such membrane, while the rays show, also, _

articulation, the thought suggests itself that web-membranes of the

negro must have been produced by a kind of retrograde movement.
There are to be found such retrograde movements whether we believe
it or not. If for instance a child has the nose of his grandfather we
say that atavism is clearly existing, and everybody is satisfied with it.
But if the six fingers are traced back to the six rays of the fins of a
ray it is looked upon as an imputation. There are great difficulties
connected with this subject which can be overcome only by means of
heroic effort. Irefer especially to the relation between atavistic pecul-
iarities and those acquired by external circumstances. Acquired pe-
culiarities are not atavistic, even when they prove to be hereditary.

During recent years a subject has been very popular which I would
recommend for further study, viz, the tailless cats. On the island of
Man there is found a race of cats without tails. It has not as yet been
explained whether these cats are indebted for their taillessness to a
fault of their original parents and by reason of acquired characteristics
are propagated in this way or whether there has intervened a disturb-
ance in their development. As to the fact of this taillessness there is
no doubt, for we find very frequently similar occurrences at other places,
é.g., in Scotland, but how this heredity has taken its rise is entirely
unknown. Perhaps the original mother was run over by a wagon and
in this way lost her tail and then brought forth tailless cats !

We do not even know how far this law of heredity extends. On ae:
count of this uncertainty the question becomes very complicated in its
relation tohuman circumstances. Climate and life may influence human
development, although at present no convincing reasons can be given
which show such a change in respect to human beings living in our age
either in their totality or as individuals through the influence of local
climate prevailing at their homes. In these particulars then we are
deficient to-day in our knowledge. You may possibly say that it is a
strange thing to have gone backward and to know less than people
knew twenty years ago.

We know indeed less, but it is our pride that we have our knowledge
in such a shape that we really know what we claim to understand.
Twenty years ago many things were supposed to be known when people
were really ignorant of them. We have made this supposed knowledye
the object of scientific tests and natural science has now really taken
possession of its wide domain, and we can now say that much that was
formerly asserted to be true is no longer admissible. It was supposed
by faith, but it never belonged toscience. Now the question before us
is whether it is not possible with all the auxiliaries to observation and
experiment to discover a kind of plan in the natural history of man.
Whether we shall ever get toa point where we can show that the hone of
the negro was the submerged land, which according to English zoolo-
gists was the original home of man, the so-called Lemuria, or that this
_ place was the river Rhine, where some claim to have found the most an-
cient remains of primitive man ;—all this we leave for our successors to
decide after another twenty years shall have passed.
570 ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

I can only say to day we have no debts ; we have not borrowed from
any hypothesis-framer ; we do not go about oppressed by a fear that the
things to which we hold will be overturned. What we now determine
has stability and will prove a foundation for further researches. We
have levelled the ground so that succeeding generations may make as
much use as possible of these means furnished them by us. It is our
confidence based upon the recognition given us by our rulers and the
sympathy of the people that in the future there will be no lack of ma-
terial for work.

Gentlemen, it is now our duty to go to work unitedly and with more
zeal than ever before, so that all these questions may be solved which
are of such importance to man for his understanding of self, and for his
social and political development. Let us take hold then so that real
and abiding progress may be ours.

I would propose as our aim to be attained in the coming twenty years
that we obtain such an insight into the anthropology of European nations
as to be able to present some valuable points concerning the connec-
tion of European tribes and to succeed in showing the reasons for ex-
isting differences among them.

This much I wanted to say to-day. I beg pardon for speaking so long.

Anthropology is surrounded by a dense fog of traditions, a large
number of them useless. Much labor is necessary to bring out its nu-
cleus, just as it is the case with many of our fruits, whose little living
kernel is surrounded by thick woody coverings. These germs are to be
found in the field of anthropology and they must be opened up in com-
ing days. May they find as much appreciation from a circle of such
interested hearers as I see before me to-day,

SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY.*

By M. INGWALD UNSET.
Curator of the Archwological Museum of Christiania.
Translated by Prof. L. D. LODGE.

Pre-historic studies made their appearance in Scandinavia before they
were broached in any other country. That is easily explained. The
pre-historic times of Scandinavia are only separated by a few centuries
from present times and extend to the introduction of Christianity into
that country about the year 1000 of ourera. The Roman legions never
set foot upon Scandinavian soil, and the ancient authors have only left
us some very enigmatical passages upon the countries of the north. Nor
do the Seandinavian traditions shed much light upon the epochs which
preceded the introduction of Christianity. On the other hand, Scan-
dinavia possesses an unusual number of pre-historic remains. Itis then
easy to understand that there should have been developed a peculiar
science, founded upon empirical studies of the antiquities themselves,
in the north rather than in other countries.

DENMARK.

Passing in silence the unsuccessful attempts of past centuries, the
first decade of our century must be considered as the epoch of the birth
of a pre-historic science in the north, whose beginnings appear in Den-
mark. The study of national history received in that country a strong
impetus in consequence of the sentiment of nationality which awoke
at that epoch in all the Germanic world. It was then that men began

in Denmark to direct their attention to the national remains and to re-
gard them as things worthy of study.

In the first rank in this road must be mentioned Prof, Rasmus N yerup,
who published in 1806, an epitome of the national remains of antiquity
(Oversigt over fedrelandets mindesmerker fra oldtiden), in which he pro-
poses a plan for the establishment of a national museum. At the same
time he began to make a collection of national antiquities at the
library of the university of which he was the librarian. This was the
germ of the pre-historic museum of Copenhagen, a museum now so vast
and so famous. The state itself a short time afterwards took charge

of the interests of this museum. On May 22, 1807, the King signed a
resolution constituting a royal commission of which Professor Nyerup
was named secretary. This commission was charged with forming a
museum for national antiquities, with watching over the preservation
of the remarkable remains still existing in the country, and finally
with making known to the public the value of ancient objects which
are found in the soil, in order to put an end to their daily destruction.

Under the active influence of this commission the collection originally
founded by the private exertions of Mr. Nyerup, became so extensive
that it soon gave birth to a new special science, that of pre-historic
archeology.

The historian Vedel-Simonsen was not a member at first, but he was
one of the most zealous collaborators; he undertook for the commission
several tours into the country, in order to collect antiquities and to
excite interest in favor of the National Institute recently founded. In
this way he had many opportunities of seeing the finds taken from the
soil and the tumuli. Relying upon his own experience, he was the first
to establish a fundamental principle for the classification and distribu-
tion of the chaotic mass of antiquities, the first to propose as a scientific
theory the division of pre-historic times into the great paleo-ethnologic
periods,—that of stone, that of bronze, and that of iron.

In his work entitled: Udsigt over Nationalhistoriens oldste og mer-
keligste Perioder (Epitome of the most ancient and most remarkable
periods of national history), the first volume of which was published in
1813, there is a chapter on the first settlement, the most ancient inhab-
itants, and the primitive history of the North. He discusses (pages
73-76) the tools and arms of the most remote times, and rejects the
opinion then common, that the stone objects are only sacred objects.
On the contrary, he pronounces them tools and arms of an epoch in
which metals were still unknown, and he fortifies his opinion by citing
for comparison the information about the savages of the present time
who still use stone tools, and by referring to his observations during his
tours undertaken for the new museum. t page 76, he gives a résumé
of his ideas in the following very remarkable passage: ‘The arms and
utensils of the most ancient Scandinavians were in the beginning of stone
and of wood. These Seandivavians then learned to work copper and
even to harden it ; so that there result copper axes found in the soil, and
lastly (as it seems) iron. So from this point of view the history of their
civilization might be divided into an age of stone, an age of copper, and an
ageofiron. These ages were not however separated from one another by
limits so exact that they do not encroach upon one another. Doubtless
among the poor they continued to use stone tools after the introduction
of copper ones, and copper tools after the introduction of iron ones ; the
same case has arisen in our day with vases of clay, of pewter, and of
porcelain. The arms and utensils of wood have naturally decomposed,
those of iron have been oxidized in the soil, those of stone and of copper
alone have been preserved.”

- SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAZOLOGY. 513

This proposition, already clearly enunciated in 1813, and now recog-
nized everywhere as a fundamental truth of pre-historic archeology,
was not however generally accepted at once in Denmark; the mate-
rials accumulated in the museum were not yet numerous enough for
the truth to be obvious to the eyes of all. It was only in Sweden that
some authors admitted the theory of Mr. Vedel-Simonsen ; in Denmark
his ideas were for a long time only a sort of prophecy of what every-
body was going to accept. The man who was to draw from the arche-
ological finds, and from the antiquities themselves, the incontestable
proofs of this theory and to secure its recognition throughout the entire
world was Christian Jurgensen Thomsen, for fifty years the director
of the Pre-historic Museum of Copenhagen, which he raised to the rank
of the first institution of that kind in Europe; he has been called the
father of the pre-historic archeology of the North. In 1816 he sue-
ceeded Mr. Nyerup as secretary of the archeological commission and
as director of the museum, a position which he held until his death, in
1865. This remarkable man was truly self-taught,—originally a mer-
chant without erudition, and for that matter little encugh attached to
books,—but he had very extraordinary natural gifts, an observing mind,
and a very delicate perception of objects of art and of antiquities. He
was an excellent numismatist and a good connoisseur in art. His
trained eye and his fine perception of the style and of the character-
istic details of ancient objects permitted him to arrive at a more pro-
found knowledge of pre historic antiquities. For him the aim was no
longer to seek to determine and to illustrate pre-historic objects by the
interpretation of traditions. Through him, as well as through the
young men who attached themselves to this acute connoisseur and to
his rich museum, pre-historic archeology became a study of the antiq-
uities themselves; they understood that a knowledge of the very re-
mote times to which these antiquities ascend is only obtained from
these contemporary remains by the empirical path and by an inductive
method.

Mr. Thomsen mainly exerted his influence by his labors inside of the
museum. It was in 1819, that he began to open the latter to the public
for a few hours each week; he was always there himself to instruct
visitors. In this way he succeeded by degrees in conquering for the
Archeological museum a place in the national interests. In the classi-
fication aud exposition of antiquities he was ever making progress.
Very early there began to form in him the knowledge of the three great
periods of the development of civilization, and of the way in which an
archeological museum should be arranged conformably to this principle.
What Mr. Vedel-Simonsen had declared on that subject ten years be-
fore does not seem at once to have convinced him. From 1825, how-
ever, he expounded to Professor Keyser, of Christiania, his ideas upon
the classification of a pre-historic collection on the basis of this chrono-
logical principle. We know that he had already, in 1830, realized this
574 SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY.

method in the museum of Copenhagen, when Mr. B. E. Hildebrand
studied there under him. As we have already said, Mr. Thomsen has
left only a very few printed works. In his memoirs of 1851 and of 1832,
he already puts forth the theory of the three periods; but it was only
in his book of 1836, Ledetraad til nordisk Oldkyndighed (Manual fer the
learning of northern antiquity,—a German edition in 1837, afterwards
an English one also) that he developed it more at length, and presented
it as valid not only for all the Nortb but for all Europe. He expresses
himself in the following terms upon the age of bronze, of which he as
yet knew scarcely any remains in countries not Scandinavian, but which
he thought had prevailed in the rest of Europe (p. 59): “It seems that
a very ancient civilization, anterior to the introduction of iron, had
spread overa large part of Europe, and that its products have had a
very great resemblance in countries very distant from one another. In
studying the arms and cutting tools of bronze and the inferences from
the discoveries as a whole, one will doubtless be more and more con-
vinced that they have a very high antiquity, and that (especially in the
countries of the South) they are exceedingly ancient. If it isadmitted
that the objects of this sort which are found upon Seandinavian soil
are imitations of those which have been imported thither, it is clear
that they have been used once in the countries from which they come.
If .on the contrary the relations ceased there, where they only existed
by the migrations of the peoples, one can understand that the inhabit-
ants of the North, having once received from southern countries the
knowledge of the most ancient inventions, should—because of the great
distance and the interruption of communications, have remained ignor-
ant of the progress and subsequent discoveries made by the most civil-
ized peoples. What exists in the North will thus be able doubtless to
instruct us about the similar objects which must have existed in coun-
tries where the development entered into the full light of history long
before it did in the North.” i

The Royal Society of Antiquaries of the North, founded by Mr. Rafn
in 1825, and directed by him for forty years, had also at this time com-
menced to enter into more intimate relations with the museum. In the
beginning the society expended its activity in editing the literary
remains existing in the ancient Norwegian-Icelandic tongue; afterward
it devoted itself also to the occupation of collecting and describing the
antiquities and of examining the archeological remains of the country.
The archeological commission had in 1812-27, published Antikvariske
Annaler (Archeological Annals), four volumes; from 1832, it united
with the royal society for the publication of Nordisk Tidskrift for Old-
kyndighed (Periodical of the North for the investigation of antiquity),
three volumes of which appeared by 1836. From that year the society
began to publish the Annaler for nordisk Oldkyndighed, twenty-three
volumes of which appeared by 1863; in the same time appeared seven
other volumes; Antikvarisk Tidskrift (Antiquarian Periodical), 1843-63,
SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY. 5I5

containing also some memoirs treating of ethnographic subjects. 'To
render the most important works accessible also to foreigners a series
was printed in French: Mémoires de la Société Royale des Antiquaires du
Nord (Memoirs of the Royal Society of Auntiquaries of the North),
1840-’60, in all three volumes.

Under the direction of Mr. Thomsen anumber of young men began
then to devote themselves to the study of pre-historic antiquities, work-
ing at the museum and undertaking excavations in the country, for
exampie Sorterup Strunk Herbst, but before all Worsaae (182185). By
an excellent little book, Danmarks oldtid oplyst ved Oldsager og Grav
hoie (the Antiquity of Denmark, elucidated by the tumuli and finds),
which appeared in 1842, he places himself immediately at the bead of
the archeological authorities of Denmark. It is a statement compris-
ing some conclusions possible to be drawn from the materials amassed
and from the facts established up to that time. This book showed the
public at once how this new science of pre-historic antiquities could
extend and had already extended the horizon of our knowledge. For
more than forty years Mr. Worsaae continued to be the chief of the
Danish archeologists; he has enriched the science with numerous
archeological and archeologico-historical works, and he has opened to
the studies new paths.

Pre-historic studies in Denmark made a very considerable stride for-
ward by the discovery of the kjoékkenmgddings (heaps of kitchen refuse).
It is the illustrious zoologist Japetus Steenstrup, (of whose last memoir
the Revlse @ Anthropologie gave an account in its last number,) who has
the honor of having discovered, examined exactly, and interpreted ingen-
iously these remarkable relics of the earliest antiquity of Denmark. It
was in 1837, that he observed, in some heaps of oyster and other shells
which were found in the elevated places of the Danish coasts, some
evident products of human industry, incontestable proofs that the for-
mation of these heaps must have taken place after the habitation of the
country. As some bones of animals were also found in these heaps, he
came to include these formations in the circle of his special studies upon
the ancient flora and fauna of the country. It was by examining the
turf-pits of Denmark that he discovered that the flora of the country for-
merly had been altogether different from that of our day, and that he
there established the existence of several successive periods of vegeta-
tion. Some bones of animals found in the different layers of these turf-
pits had also furnished him with the materials for the history of the
fauna of the country. Upon the initiative of Mr. Steenstrup, the Royal
Academy of Copenhagen in 1848, appointed a committee ccmposed of
Mr. Forchhammer as geologist, Mr. Worsaae as archeologist, and Mr.
Steenstrup himself as zoologist, to examine these shell heaps. This
last gentleman in reality took charge of the labors of the committee.
In the reports of the Academy of Copenhagen he gave (1848-55) a
series of famous memoirs upon his admirable studies. The true nature
576 SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY.

of these heaps was soon discovered by the committee; their formation
was evidently due to man; the shells and the bones of animals were
remains of things eaten; these large heaps were remains of meals, and
that is why Mr. Steenstrup called them kjgkkenmgddings, a word after-
ward naturalized in all languages as a scientific term designating the
similar remains found in the most distant countries in the world. By
acute studies upon the formation and upon the contents of these heaps,
Mr. Steenstrup discovered that they originated among a population of
hunters and of tishers who were as yet unacquainted with metals, a
population which had lived in a remote age; and that the climate of
Denmark, and in consequence the flora and the fauna, were then alto-
gether different from what they are now. That climate was colder ; the
forests consisted of firs; many animals which have now disappeared
from the fauna of Denmark were numerous there; for example, the
great European carnivores, the Bos primigenius, the Tetrao wrogallus,
ete.; of special interest is the presence ofa northern bird, now extinct,
Alca impennis. Thestudies of Mr. Steenstrup not only enriched, by
their results, Danish paleo-ethnology; indirectly they were also very
importaut by the influence which they exerted upon the severity and
the exactness of the method of the natural sciences which was subse-
quently adopted by the pre-historic archeologists in Denmark.

In this time Mr. Worsaae had already extended the circle of his pre-
historie studies beyond the limits of his native land, undertaking jour-
neys into Germany, France, England, and Ireland; he had already pub-
lished some works containing the results of studies made during these
journeys, and had just created thus the comparative method in pre-
historic science. Several of his works had been published in foreign
languages and had likewise exerted an influence upon the beginning of
paleo-ethnologic studies in other countries.

From 1850 to 1870, the museum of Copenhagen was greatly enriched ;
it increased especially from the materials coming from the systematic
excavations of the antiquaries. One event of great importance for the
prosperity of the museum and of paleo-ethnology occurred : the reign-
ing king, His Majesty Frederick VII, became warmiy interested in pale-
ology; he even made his appearance as an author on the subject. New
collaborators were added to the museum to those who were already
working there under the direction of Mr. Thomsen, among others Mr.
Boye and Mr. Engelhardt who, until 1863, was the director of the mu-
seum of Sleswick at Flensburg.

But relying thus upon materials whose number was increasing and
upon ever-extending explorations, progress ought to have been made.
First an effort was made to sub-divide the three great ages established
by Vedel-Simonsen, and Thomsen, and to discover their chronological
limits. It is always Mr. Worsaae who marches at the head. In 1854,
he published an atlas of illustrations: Afbildninger fra det Kgl. Museum
for nordiske Oldsager (Illustrations of the royal museum of northern
SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY. BT 7

antiquities), an important work, of which the second edition especially,
under the title: Nordiske Oldsager (Northern Antiquities) 1859, circu-
lated in all Europe, and which, still frequently quoted, has served as a
model for several similar paleo-ethnological atlases in different countries.
In this work appeared for the first time the sub-division of theage of iron
into two periods. About 1840, moreover, few remains of the age of iron
were known in Denmark, while those of the age of bronze were numer-
ous ; investigators inclined to the opinion that the age of bronze ex-
tended there down toward the year 700 of ourera. In 1853, Mr. Worsaae,
with the co-operation of Mr. Herbst, discovered a first age of iron, char-
acterized especially by numerous imported Roman pieces, and whose
duration he determined as from the year 1 to about 500 of our era. In
a memoir of 1859, Mr. Worsaae also proposed sub-divisions of the age of
stone and of the age of bronze. As to the age of stone, he wished to
establish a first period, comprising essentially the kjdkkenm@ddings with
their ground flint, and corresponding to an epoch of transition from the
paleolithic age to the neolithic age in the west of Europe; then a second
period, characterized by the dolmens and the ground and polished flint ;
but this sub-division was very energetically contested by Mr. Steenstrup.
In the reports of the Academy of Copenhagen, 1859-62, this question
was earnestly discussed by Mr. Worsaae and Mr. Steenstrup ; the lat-
ter wished to maintain the contemporaneity of the kj¢kkenmgddings and
the dolmens.

Among the most considerable publications of Danish paleo-ethnology
about 1870, should be noticed moreover Mr. Engelhardt’s descriptions
of some great discoveries of the first iron age, or more exactly of the
lower Roman epoch, which had been made in some marshy meadows in
Sleswick and in Fionia.

The Swiss Morlot contributed much to make Danish paleo-ethnology
and its results known abroad. In 1858, he studied a long time at the
museum of Copenhagen and on his return to his native land, published
several memoirs upon the pre-historic labors of the savants of the North.

SWEDEN.

In Sweden also attention had been directed, in past centuries to pre-
historic remains and objects. Beginning with the year 1666, the Gov-
ernment had established a college of antiquities which was charged
with forming a collection of the ancient treasures which might be found
in the soil. Aithough that is to be considered as the germ of the
archeological museum of Stockholm, only a few objects nevertheless
were collected there. When in 1786, King Gustavus III founded the
Royal Academy of belles-lettres, of history, and of antiquities, that in-
stitution was charged with the care ot the remains of the country and
with the custody of the collection which had already existed for a cent-
ury. The Swedish historians often mentioned at this period ancient
objects, but it was only in our century that the special study of national
antiquities began in Sweden.

578 SCANDINAVIAN ARCH AZOLOGY.

At the beginning of this century, Sjoborg, professor of history, at
Lund, deserved credit for his activity in investigating the remains of the
country, in order to make up its archeological topography and statistics;
in 1805, he obtained from the government a decree ordering the preser-
vation of pre-historic remains. The fruits of his labors are published in
several memoirs, but especially in a work entitled Samlingar for Nor-
dens fornelskare (collections for those interested in northern antiquity),
I-Ill, 1822~23. The Goétiska forbindet (Gothic Union), a literary so-
ciety, founded in 1811, by some learned and patriotic young men, has
also done much to spread the knowledge of the national antiquities ; its
literary organ, Jdwna, must be considered as the first periodical publi-
cation of Swedish archeology. At this time many private collections
of antiquities were founded, the most of which have since been acquired
by the museum of Stockholm.

The theory of the three ages of civilization enunciated in 1813, by the
Dane Vedel-Simonsen, was accepted by Magnus Bruzelius, at Lund
(Specimen antiquitatum borealium, 1816). The illustrious Geijer ap-
proved it in his work, Svenska folkets historia (The History of the Swed-
ish People), 1832.

In 1830, Dr. B. E. Hildebrand, of Lund, went to Copenhagen to study
there under Mr. Thomsen, numismatics and northern antiquities; on
his return he was appointed chief of the archeological collection at
Lund, which he classified according to the system of the three periods
communicated to him by Mr. Thomsen. In 1833, Hildebrand was called
to Stockholm to arrange the numismatic collection and the old museum
of antiquities, hitherto however without any importance. Hildebrand
thus became the true founder of this museum; in the beginning he
classified it according to the ideas of Mr. Thomsen. In 1837, appointed
antiquary of the kingdom, he had during a long energetic administra-
tion the opportunity of being very active for the enlargement of the
museum, so that in 1879, he was able to commit it into the hands of his
son and successor, as an institution of the first rank.

Another illustrious man is also to be named at the beginning of pa-
leo-ethnological studies in Sweden in our century. As the introduction
to a new edition of his work Skandinaviens Fauna, the celebrated
zoologist Sven Nilsson, at Lund, in 1834, published a remarkable
memoir: Udkast til Jagtens og Fiskeriets Historie « Skandinavien (out-
line of a history of hunting and fishing in Scandinavia). He there
sketches the life of the first inhabitants; they were as yet unac-
quainted with metals, and lived as hunters and fishers; they had only
tools of stone and of wood. He gives detailed descriptions of the different
kinds of tools found, investigates their use, and compares them with
those of peoples still savage, particularly with those of the Greenlanders
and Australians. Then after having visited the museums of Copen-
hagen and several ethpographie collections abroad, he published in
1838~43 his famous work Skandinaviska Nordens Urinvanare. (The

—
SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAZOLOGY. DAo

First Inhabitants of the Scandinavian North). In this work, which is
of the greatest importauce, upon the age of stone, one sees introduced
for the first time the methods of comparative ethnography; it is a book
which assures forever to its author an elevated place among the
founders of pre-historic science. In this first edition, the age of bronze
is only treated in the last chapter; the opinion is there maintained that
the introduction of that civilization is due to the immigration of a Cel-
tic tribe. It was not until later that he put forth his well-known theory
that the age of bronze in Europe is due to the Phcenicians, those com-
mercial mariners of antiquity; this theory has been developed in de-
tail in the second part, published in 186264, of a new edition of his
work. Inthe same way a new edition of the first part, upon the age of
stone, was published in 1866. This work, translated into German,
French, and English, excited the greatest attention in all Europe, and
still enjoys, and with reason, the greatest reputation, although his
Pheenician theory perhaps no longer counts any adherents.

Principally under the influence of B. E. Hildebrand, the Swedish
Academy of belles-lettres, history, and antiquities, from the year 1856,
directed its activity more and more toward archeological topography
and the statistics of the remains of the country, the extension of the
museum, and of the systematic excavations, and the publication of the re-
sults; a throng of able men took part in these labors. During the course
of 1860, local societies of antiquaries were founded everywhere in the
provinces; these societies did much to spread archeological knowledge,
excite interest in its favor, and collect and preserve materials; a series
of provincial museums were organized, depending in a certain degree
upon the National Museum of Stockholm. The Swedish Archeological
Society, founded in 1869, has become the common center of these local
societies.

The most of these private societies have published private periodical
collections; the principal organ of Swedish archeology appears under
the auspices of the Academy of Antiquities, Antikvarisk Tidsskrift for
Sverige (Antiquarian Journal for Sweden). Among the most impor-
tant memoirs of this journal must be cited the work of Bb. EK. Hilde-
brand, published in 1869, upon the carvings on rock, where he first
gives the incontestable proofs that these remarkable remains date from
the age of bronze. From 1860 to 1870, commenced also the labors of
two men still the most celebrated to-day among the Swedish pre-histo-
rians: Hans Hildebrand (the son of B. E. Hildebrand), who published
in 1866, an important book entitled Svenska folket under hednatiden
(The Swedish People during the Time of Paganism), in which he treats
especially of the relations between the two periods of the age of iron in
Scandinavia; and Oscar Montelius, whose work, Fra jernaldern (On
the Age of Iron), which appeared in 1869, has laid the solid foundations
of a chronological classification of the finds dating from the age of
iron, by giving detailed descriptions of all those of the northern iron
age, accompanied by imported forvign coins.

NORWAY.

In Norway it was the Royal Society for the good of Norway which
founded at Christiania the first collection of national antiquities; in
1811, it appointed a commission to form this collection. After the re-
establishment of the independence of Norway, by the separation from
Denmark in 1814, the society ceded the collection to the university
recently founded, where it became the basis of the pre-historic museum,
now the most considerable in the country. It was not until 1828, how-
ever, that a director of the museum was appointed,—Key ser, a professor
of history. Already, in 1825, Keyser, during a visit at the house of
Mr. Thomsen in Copenhagen, had learned of the classification into
three periods adopted by him in his museum; at Christiania the same
principle was adopted from the beginning. This museum grew con-
stantly and rapidly in a subsequent period. To Mr. Keyser, in 1862,
succeeded Mr. O. Rygh, who is still the director.

In 1825, another archeological museum was foundedin Norway. At
that time a number of private citizens, patriotic and interested in the
sciences, established at Bergen a museum for the west of Norway,
whose collections, especially the archeological, increased rapidly.
There also, in 1833, was begun the first Norwegian archeological jour-
nal, Urda, of which down to 1846, two volumes and a part of a third
were published. It was above all Christie, and the bishop Neumann,
who displayed the most activity in the founding and the development
of this museum of Bergen.

In 1844, at Christiania, was created the Forening til norske fortidsmin
desmeerkers bevaring (The Society for the Preservation of the Ancient
Remains of Norway), which formed a new centre for archeological
labors. The society has affiliated members at Trondhjem and at Ber-
gen, and counts members throughout the country; it is subsidized by
the state, and its president is always the antiquary of the kingdom, ap-
pointed by the government,—at present Mr. Nicolaysen. The society
has done much for the preservation and description of the remains; it
has undertaken explorations and excavations, and has published a series
of works. Since 1815, it has published Aarsberetninger (Annual Re-
ports), with plates; among its other publications must be named the
work of Mr. Nicolaysen, Norske fornlevninger (Norwegian Archeolog-
ical Materials), 1866, containing information upon all the archeological
remains and materials known up to that time in Norway.

About 1870, at Trondhjem, a provincial museum wasalso organized by
Mr. K. Rygh, which has now acquired some importance. In the south
of the country Mr. Lorange has formed at Frederickshald a private col-
lection of special interest, because almost all the materials which are
there preserved come from his own excavations.

The most important archeological publications which appeared in
Norway from 1860 to 1870, are some memoirs of Mr. O. Rygh, especially
SCANDINAVIAN ARCHZOLOGY. 581

one published in 1868: Den eldre Jernalder i Norge (Yhe First Age ot
Iron in Norway). The first period of iron stands indicated for the first
time and distinctly characterized in the Norwegian finds. It is a model
work as to soberness and soundness of method.

We have followed the development of pre-historic studies in the north
down to 1870; here it is proper for us to stop and to conclude this first
period. :

It is already a long time since the new science pushed itself likewise
junto the other countries of Europe. The surprising discoveries of Mr.
Boucher de Perthes, which formed an epoch, havelong since been gen-
erally accepted ; energetic labors have commenced, especially in geolog-
ical paleo-ethnology ; great attention is directed at once upon prehis-
totic times and upon proto-historic times. In Germany, particularly in
the north of that country, local investigators early began work in the
same way as the antiquaries of the north. Let us mention among them
and in the first rank Mr. Lisch, at Schwerin. In 1852, a central museum
was established at Mayence under the direction of Mr. Lindenschmit.
A few years afterwards, in Switzerland, Mr. Keller discovered the palaf-
fites ; finally about 1860, Mr. Gastaldi founded the study of paleo-eth-
nology in Italy.

In 1866, the international congress of anthropology and pre-historic
archeology held its first session. It is fitting to end this first seetion
by mentioning the fourth session of this congress, which took place at
Copenhagen in 1869. Scholars from all the countries of Kurope assem-
bled there to learn the results attained by Danish paleo-ethnology dur-
ing more than fifty years. The rich museums, the archeological and
the ethnographic, both lasting monuments of the aged Thomsen, de-
ceased a few years before, excited the admiration of all. The labors
of the congress presented much interest. Foreigners were especially
interested in a discussion between Messrs. Worsaae and Steenstrup upon
the sub-division of the stone age and upon the chronological characters
of the Ajokkenmoddings.

i:

About the year 1870, a new phase opens in the history of Scandina-
vian archeology. Under the xgis of the preceding scholars there is
formed a phalanx of young men who bring with them new ideas, ten-

dencies, and methods.
SWEDEN.

The first to be pomted out in this country, at this period, is Mr. Hans
Hildebrand, the son (already mentioned) of B. E. Hildebrand. While

Still young he had the opportunity of making, during several years,

long tours to the most important archeological museums of Europe, and
thus acquiring a profound knowledge of all archeological materials.
The results of these studies have been recorded especially in a memoir
the principal parts of which appeared in 187273, in the Antikvarisk
582 SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY.

Tidsskrift for Sverige: Studier 1 jémnforande fornforskning. Bidrag til
spdnnets historia. (Studies in comparative archeology: materials to
be used for the history of the fibula.) In this excellent work the author
classifies for the first time the principal groups of finds of the bronze and
the iron age in central Europe; he describes them in their peculiari-
ties and their geographical extension and insists particularly upon the
two great groups of the pre-Roman iron age, which he designates under
the names of the Hallstadt group and the Zéne group, after the most
celebrated localities of these finds. Though this work has neyer been
translated in its entirety into a foreign language, it has nevertheless
been of great importance in the development of the science, and has
formed an epoch in comparative prehistoric archeology. We have
seen how Mr. Worsaae, many years before, had already undertaken to
compare the archeological data of the north with those of other coun-
tries; but it is Mr. Hildebrand who possesses the merit of having sought,
almost the first, to give a systematic epitome, a complete classification of
all the material pertaining to a certain archeological age, in this case
the one nearest the beginning of historic times in southern and central
Europe. Geologically speaking, it is the principal stages and the most
remarkable formations of the tertiary period of pre-historic time, which
are separated and characterized in this work for the first time. The
principal conclusions of this memoir, whether they be essentially modi-
fied by the increase of materials or not, will always be of great impor-
tance as the point of departure of a new phase in the progress of this
pre-historic science. Another memoir of Mr. Hildebrand has the same
tendency: Sur la division du Nord de VEurope en provinces archéolo-
giques pour Vage de la pierre polie.- (On the division of the north of
Europe into archeological districts for the age of polished stone.) Re-
port of the Congress of Brussels, 1872. In 1873-80, he published a great
work: De férhistoriska folken « EHuropa (the pre-historic peoples in
Europe), in which—exhibiting vast erudition—he treats of all the paleo-
ethnological materials then existing in Europe. Among his other
works must be mentioned here a memoir upon les Cassitérides et Vétain
dans Vantiquité (the cassiterides and tin in antiquity). In the Antik-
varisk Tidsskrift, 1878, two works upon the “ Finds discovered by Mr.
Schliemann in Troas” (Stockhoim, 1878) “and at Mycene” (ibidem,
1882); then two memoirs treating of comparative ethnology: Folkens
troom sina déda (the ideas of peoples about their dead; Stockholm,
1874), and De lagre naturfolkens konst (art among primitive peoples).
The latter, which is concerned especially with the sculpture and carv-
ing on bone of the aurochs, the Eskimos and the men of the quaternary
period, forms a part of the work of Mr. Nordenskjéld: Résultats de mes
voyages dans le haut Nord (results of my travels in the far north). In
1879, Mr. H. Hildebrand was appointed antiquary of the kingdom of
Sweden. He has shown himself an energetic administrator. This is not
the place to dwell upon the dispositions of the Government with regard
9°

to the museums and remains, nor to speak of the works which he has
published upon the civilization and the arts of Sweden in the middle
ages, studies with which he seems to have been most occupied in the
last years.

A worthy colleague of Mr. Hans Hildebrand is Mr. Oscar Montelius,
whom we have also mentioned already ; he is to-day first curator of the
museum of Stockholm. By numerous works he has contributed to the
knowledge of the antiquities of the North and of other countries of Eu-
rope. In 1872, ’73, he published (in the Antikvarisk Tidsskrift) an ex-
tended memoir on the relics of the age of bronze, discovered in the
northern and central parts of Sweden, with comparative dissertations
upon the bronzes of the North and those of central Europe. Since
then, he has continued his studies upon the bronze age in the North,
and has published a series of them, seeking to throw some light upon
that remarkable epoch by profound researches upon the bronze age in
central and southern Europe. Recently (in 1885), ie has published his
definite conclusions upon this pre-historic age in a great work which our
next article will discuss in detail. Among his numerous other works

9) AFF

we must mention his atlas: Svenska pee 187277, a French edi-
tion of which appeared in 1873~75— Antiquités Sidience arrangées et
dé.rites par O. Montelius (Swedish antiquities, arranged and described
by O. Montelius), with 658 figures; of the text corresponding to this
atlas there has appeared only the first part, Stenalderen (the age of
stone) 1874. An abridged collection of the results of Swedish arche-
ology has been given by him in his book on Pre-historic Sweden, Stock-
holn, 1874. (A French translation from the Swedish original, of 1873.
A German edition, much enlarged, appeared in 1885, at Berlin, under
this title: Die Kultur Schwedens in vorchristlicher Zeit.) In the Antik-
varisk Tidsskrift, V, he published, in 1880—82, a great comparative study:
Spdnnen fran bronsalderen, ete. (Fibule of the age of bronze and of the
first age of iron); a study which is the result of extended travels, and
which treats in a very detailed manner especially of the Italian fibule
del prima eta del ferro (of the first age of iron). <A succinct résumé of
this memoir is inserted in the Matériaux pour Vhistoire de Vhomme (Ma-
terials for the history of man, 1880, pp. 583-589). In the works of
Messrs. Hildebrand and Montelius a peculiar method of research, typo-
logy, with which we shall occupy ourselves in our next article, plays a
prominent part.*

Other archeologists attached to the museum of Stockholm are to be
mentioned,—Messrs. Stolpe and Eckhoff. Both have made valuable in-
vestigations and have published reports of them, Mr. Stolpe especially,
upon the famous findings of Bjork6, of the second age of iron. Mr.
Eckhoff, since 1880, has published the description of the antiquities of
the Bohuslin, a model of the archeological topography of a country.

* We cannot refrain from calling attention to a review of Mr. Hildebr Baie Secandi-
navian archeology, which appeared in the Revue d’anthropologie in 1873, p. 523.
584 SCANDINAVIAN ARCH AOLOGY.

Among the men who, without being attached to the museum, have
contributed to the pre-historic archeology of Sweden must be mentioned
Mr. Wiberg, director of the lyceum of Gefle. From 1861 to 1873, he
published several studies upon the relations of the ancient peoples of
the Mediterranean to the ancient inhabitants of Scandinavia; then
upon the influence of the Greeks and Etruscans on the age of bronze
in the north of Europe (1869). Moreover, numerous local societies
have also displayed great activity and have given proofs of it in their
periodicals. Important contributions to archeo!ogical literature have
also been furnished by private individuals; for example, a work on
“* Les antiquités de Warend (The antiquities Wiirend), a district: of south-
ern Sweden, by Mr. Wittlock, 1874; then a ceramic monograph on the
clay funeral vases found in Sweden by Mr. Strale, 1873. The great
illustrated work of Mr. Baltzer, of Gétheborg, on the glyphics upon
the rocks of Bohusliin, of the age of bronze, commenced in 1881, is not
yet finished.

The Swedish periodical publications which we have mentioned above,
page 320, have been continued in this period ; since the year 1872, the
Academy of Antiquities has added to them a new Manadsblad (monthly
bulletin) containing less extended memoirs and especially information
on recent finds and excavations. In 1873, the Academy also com-
menced the publication of a grandly conceived work, Tekningar ur
Statens historiska museum (Illustrations of the National Archeological
Museum). This magnificent work is destined to comprise several vol-
umes of figures on the most important series of the museum of Stock-
holm.

In 1874, the International Congress of Anthropology and Archeology,
having held its seventh session at Stockholm, the Messrs. Hildebrand,
father and son, together with Mr. Sven Nilsson, did the honors of Swedish
archeology to their most illustrious colleagues from all the countries of
Europe. In 1879, Mr. B. E. Hildebrand, the true founder of the museum
of Stockholm, resigned the direction of the museum and his position as
antiquary of the kingdom; he was succeeded by his son, Hans Hilde-
brand; he was still living five years ago. In 1883, Sven Nilsson also
died at Lund, almost a centenarian.

DENMARK.

Mr. Worsaae, during all this period, has continued to be the chief of
the pre-historic archeologists there. Among his numerous works we
must notice an important memoir which appeared in 1872, in the Aarbé-
ger on the archeology of the countries situated tothe east of Seandi-
navia, a French edition of which appeared in the Memoirs of 1873-74
under this title: La colonisation de la Russie et du Nord scandinave et leur
plus ancien état de civilisation (the settlement of Russia and of the Sean-
dinavian North and their most ancient state of civilization). He demon-
strates that the theory of the immigration of the Scandinavian peoples
SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY. 585

from the East finds no support in archeological facts. In the Aarbo-
ger of 1879, he publishes a study embracing vast territories: Des ages de
pierre et de bronze dans Vancien et le nouveau monde (on the ages of stone
and of bronze in the Old and the New World):—French translation in
the Memoirs, 1880. In this memoir he advances the opinion that these
archeological ages have existed in eastern Asia and in America, and
that the system of the three periods has thus a certain value in the
whole world. He draws thence the conclusion that in the developments
of civilization, there is not only a parallelism, but also a true relation,
even between the most distant races. In his book, Nordens Forhistorie,
1878, second edition, 1581 (the pre-history of the North), he seeks to
give a complete epitome of the results of northern archeology. In his
last years he occupied himself with researches by which he believed
that he could open new horizons upon our knowledge of pre-historic
civilization ; comparative studies of antiquities from the point of view
of their forms and of their ornamentation, which, according to him,
must almost all have derived their origin from religious symbols;
and detailed observations on the usages and rites according to which
antiquities are deposited he thought that he could even form conject-
tures about the mythology and the religious life of pre-historic times.

In his book, The industrial arts of Denmark, London, 1882 (South
Kensington Hand-Book), he has published some conclusious on this
subject.

By the side of Worsaae the men whose names have been mentioned
above—among them Mr. Engelhardt especially—have also been active
at the museum of Copenhagen during this period. His works treat of
the age of iron. We call attention to one of his articles of 1871, Rom-
erske Gjenstande fundne it Norden (Roman objects found in the North),
a French résumé of which exists in the Memoirs, 1872; then to two
memoirs on the tombs of the iron age in eastern Denmark (in the Aar-
boger, 1877, cf. Memoirs, 187879); and in Jutland (in the Aarbdéger,
1881). Constructed according to a larger plan is his work of 1875,
Klassisk Industris og Kulturs Betydning for Norden (Influence of classic
industry and civilization upon those of the North in antiquity in the
Memoirs, 187576). Mr. Engelhardt died in 1881.

In Denmark also a new generation of archeologists has formed at
the museum in the period of whose history we are giving a summary.
Mr. Sophus Miiller has published there several admirable works on
comparative archeology, relying not only upon Danish materials, but
also upon a profound knowledge of all the riches existing in foreign
lands, where he has several times visited the most important museums.
In a study published in the Aarboger, 1877, be sueceeded in sub-divid-
ing the age of iron in Denmark in a more detailed manner than any one
had done before. In 1876, appeared his work on “ The periods of the
age of bronze,” in which he seeks to demonstrate that the two groups of
the northern age of bronze, established by Mr. Worsaae, and defined
586 SCANDINAVIAN ARCHZXOLOGY.

in a more compete manner by Mr. Montelius, rest upon differences
rather in topography than inchronology. In 1880, he published an ex-
cellent work on * Decoration with animal designs in the northern age
of iron” (La décoration avec des motifs animaux dans Vage du fer nor-
dique) and in Europe during the epochs of the migrations of the peo-
ples. In the Aarbéger of 1882, is contained his important memoir, Sur
les origines et le premier développement de Vage du bronze en Europe,
éclairi par les trouvailles dans le sud-est de ? Europe (on the origin and
first development of the age of bronze in Europe, elucidated by the
finds in the southwest of Europe). There the author treats of the
finds discovered by Mr. Schliemann and of the materials derived from
southern Russia and Caucasus. These three works have also passed
through German editions.

Among the young men connected with the museum of Copenhagen
Mr. Henry Petersen ought also to be named. In the number of his pub-
lications must be mentioned his memoir of 1875, Helleristninger 1 Dan-
mark (a résumé in the Memoirs, 1877; ‘‘ Notes on the sculptured stones
of Denmark”); and further, Stenalderens gravformer og deres chronologie
(the different kinds of tombs during the age of stone in Denmark and
their chronology, Aarboger, 1881); the remains of northern Germany
are also here treated. Otherwise, the works of this anthor are mainly
taken up with the archeology of the middle ages.

Among the other archeologists who have been active during this
period in Denmark we must name also Mr. Boye, previously mentioned,
who has published several memoirs upon national antiquities; tlen Mr.
Zink, who in the Aarboger, 1871, published a very important memoir
Sur les tombeaux de Vage du bronze et leurs relations avec ceux de Vage de la
pierre (on the tombs of the age of bronze and their relations to those of
the age of stone.) Mr. Vedel, the governor of the island of Bornholm,
whoin the Aarbéger, 1869, 1870, 1872, 1878, and 1883, (cf. Memoirs, 1872,
1878, 1879,) has given the report of his researches on the pre-historic
antiquities of this island, researches so excellent, that there is not per-
haps in northern Europe any territory so correctly explored from the
point of view of its antiquities as the island of Bornholm.

The able artist Mr. A. P. Madsen, published in 1868-’76, a splendid
illustrated work: Afbildninger af Danske Mindesmirker og Oldsager
(Illustrated Danish remains and antiquities), three volumes in 4to,
containing 125 engraved tables. Another Danish artist, Mr. Magnus
Petersen, has also devoted himself to the illustration of Danish antiq-
uities.

A proof of the ardor with which national archeology in Denmark
was cultivated also by private individuals is afforded by the two mag-
nificent works published in 1878 and 1884, by Mr. de Sehested. In the
vicinity of his chateau of Broholm, on the island of Fionia, this gentle-
man had for a series of years investigated the archeological remains
with minute care, and undertaken considerable excavations, the reports
of which are contained in the two works mentioned. Of very special
SCANDINAVIAN ARCH ZOLOGY. 587

interest are the descriptions in the second work (posthumous) of the
long series of technical experiments undertaken by the author during
several years upon the making and the utility of stone implements ;
for example, he had a wooden house constructed, using only stone tools.

In the same way after the year 1870, Mr. Steenstrup continued his
studies on the pre-historic flora and fauna of Denmark. For example,
his memoir included in the Reports of the Academy, 1872, on the con-
temporaneity of the Bos primigentus and the forests of fir in Denmark,
in which mention is made of some flint chips buried in animal bones, as
proof of the hunts conducted against the deer during the stone age, is
important.

Quite an interesting episode in the development of Swedish archeol-
ogy is the vehement controversy with the German archeologists which
took place from 1876 to 1880. Before that time the system of the three
periods had already been vigorously contested in Germany, where the
archeological materials were scattered in a multitude of small collee-
tions, and where (owing to the lack of great deposits of objects) one
could with difficulty understand the principal phases of the develop-
ment of civilization. Mr. Worsaae had been obliged several times to
repulse the German attacks against northern archeology, especially
those of Mr. Lindenschmit. In 1876, Mr. Hostmann, in the Archiv fiir
Anthropologie, made a furious assault against the theory of the three
archeological ages, and disputed especially the existence of an age of
bronze. On the northern side M. Sophus Miiller entered the lists;
others joined the two champions; the controversy continued for sev-
eral years. Ifthe attacks have in no respect been able to overthrow
the system of the three periods or annihilate the age of bronze, it will
be found perhaps that northern archieology has received a salutary in-
fluence from the criticisms of German scholars.

During these fifteen years (1870-’85), the periodical publications be-
fore mentioned have been continued by the Royal Society of Antiquaries
of the North at Copenhagen. In Aarboger for nordisk Oldkyndighed
(Annals for the study of northern antiquities), and in the Mémoires de
la Société royale des Antiquaires du Nord (Memoirs of the Royal Society
of the Antiquaries of the North) new series were commenced in 1866.
Moreover, investigators have worked energetically during this epoch to
complete the archeological exploration of Denmark, and numerous
excavations have been undertaken by the scholars connected with the
museum. In 1874, Worsaae, then minister of religion, procured an
annual subsidy from the revenue of the state for the investigation of
the antiquities of the country. Every sammer an archeologist and an
artist associated have since 1875, travelled through several districts
parish by parish, writing lists and detailed descriptions of the known
remains and findings, and taking the measure and the designs of all
the ancient remains still existing. When these labors some years
hence shall have been finished, there will be in Europe no country
archeologically so well explored and known as Denmark.
588 SCANDINAVIAN ARCHAOLOGY.
NORWAY.

The archeological society of this country, under the direction of Mr.
Nicolaysen, the antiquary of the kingdom, has continued since the year
1870, its investigations and its excavations, the reports of which are
found in the annals of the society. In 1875, was established at the Uni-
versity of Christiania a chair of pre-historic archeology (perhaps the first
ordinary chair for this science in any university in Europe ?) to which was
appointed Mr. O. Rygh. The administration of the museum of Christiania
was attached to this chair. This period saw the most active Norwegian
archeologists: First, those already mentioned, then Mr. Lorange, the
director of the museum of Bergen since 1874, Messrs. Bendixen and
Undset. Among the publications must be mentioned a memoir of Rygh
on the Deuxiéme dge du fer en Norvége (Second age of iron in Norway),
which appeared in the Danish Aarboger, 1877, and above all a large
and splendid atlas, which appeared in 188085, Norske Oldsager (Nor-
wegian antiquities), 732 wood cuts, with the text in Norwegian and in
French.

Among the publications of Mr. Lorange must be noticed, Om spor
af romersk Cultur i Norges celdre Jernalder, 1873 (The traces of Roman
civilization in Norway during the first age of iron). A remarkable work,
Langskibet fra Gokstad (The ship of Gokstad), by Mr. Nicolaysen, was
published in 1882, witha number of plates and figures, the text in Nor-
wegian and in English, in 4to. He there describes a large ship of the
epoch of the Normands (about the year 900) which he was able to dig
out of a tumulus and have transported to Christiania, where this unique
relic is now preserved in the archeological museum, of which it con-
stitutes the principal ornament. Mr. Undset, connected with the mu-
seum of Christiania, has for his part contributed to comparative arche-
ology by works founded upon studies made during extended travels.
Reference may be made to amemoir by him, Fra Norges oldre Jernalder
(On the first age of iron in Norway, published in the Danish Aarbdéger,
1830);* then a book entitled, Etudes sur Vdge du bronze de la Hongrie
(Studies on the bronze age of Hungary), Christiania, 1880, in which he
has treated of the relations between the bronze age of central Europe
and that of the Scandinavian North. In 1881, appeared his great work:
Jernalderens Begyndelsei Nordeuropa (the beginnings of the iron age
in northern Europe. A German edition of it was published in 1882,
under the title, Das erste Auftreten des Hisens in Nordeuropa. In this
book he speaks of all the materials of central and especially northern
Europe, which date from the epoch of the transition from the bronze
age to the age of iron.

I conclude this retrospective review of pre-historic archeology in

* The feeaaeiee that None dian archi Bere often publish their memoirs in
a Danish periodical journal is explained by the fact that Denmark and Norway have
the same literary language.
SCANDINAVIAN ARCHEOLOGY. 589

Scandinavian countries, which has become essentialiy a history of its
developments in the North, with a single remark. It is possible that
some persons may be surprised that under the title of pre-historic
archeology I include works treating of Roman antiquities or dating even
trom a later period. It is because the Scandinavian countries were
plunged in pre-historic darkness until nearly the year 1000 of our era.
The knowledge of northern doings and developments before that epoch
should be sought there principally in an empirical manner, by the in-
ductive study of all the archeological materials, whatever they may be.
The word pre-historic has a signification altogether relative. The con-
ditions of France, for instance, about the year 2000 before our era, are
absolutely pre-historic, while the civilization of the valley of the Nile,
having followed its course for many centuries, was already in the full
light of history.
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889.

By Prof. OT1s T. MASON.

INTRODUCTION.

Merely for the convenience of bringing together those subjects that
are most akin, and not to draw hard and fast lines in a vigorously
growing science, the same method will be pursued here as in last year’s
summary. The order of presentation will be: General or Encyclopedic
Anthropology, Biology, Psychology, Ethnology, Language, Technology,
Archeology, Sociology, Philosophy, Folk-lore and Religion, and
Hexiology.

Under the heading of Encyclopedic Anthropology, the following
classific concepts cover the entire ground :

(1) General treatises, annual addresses, courses of lectures, diction-
aries, encyclopedias, general discussions, classifications of the science.

(2) Societies, their organization, scope, enterprises, history, and lists
of their publications.

(3) Journals, proceedings and transactions, the organs of associated
bodies.

(4) Periodicals, like L’Anthropologie, devoted wholly or in part to
anthropology.

(5) Annual assemblies, caucuses, congresses, general meetings of a
national or international character.

(6) Laboratories for general study.

(7) Museums and collections, public and private, their scope, con-
tents, methods, catalogues and history. Expositions.

(8) Albums, galleries, portfolios, methods of illustrating anthro-
pology.

(9) Libraries on anthropology, catalogues, bibliographies, check-lists,
and devices for ready reference, classification of books.

(10) Instructions to collectors.

I.—GENERAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

(1) Each year some distinguished anthropologist brings together the
results of his lifetime work in a general treatise upon the natural

‘history of man. In accordance with this unwritten law the historian
591
592 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889.

calls attention to the works of Sergi and Turner in the current year.
Characteristic addresses were delivered by Galton and Virchow, the
former before the annual meeting of the Anthropological Institute, the
latter before the general meeting of German anthropologists in
Vienna. The volumes of the Bibliothéque Anthropologique continue
to make their appearance. This series is designed to give expression
to the ripest thoughts of the French Société d Anthropologie. The
series of Smithsonian Annual Reports now embraces two volumes
instead of one, as formerly. Part I contains general papers; while in
Part II will be found only such as are based on material in the
National Museum collections.

(2) Happily for the diffusion of knowledge, innumerable societies and
organizations are now to be found in every land, studying mankind.
It would be well to enumerate them all. The best collection of titles
will be found in the very last Smithsonian list of foreign and home cor-
respondents. Scudder’s catalogue has already become antiquated by
the death of many societies and the birth of others. Indeed the
anthropological part of it was never full. Nothing is more desirable,
and the suggestion is here made with the hope of stirring up an inter-
est in the subject. In the bibliography appended to this report most
of the great national societies are noticed, especially in connection with
their journals and proceedings. The personnel of the American local
societies is generally represented in the American Association. The
same is true of England and France. The leading spirits of local or.
ganizations are to be seen in the British Association and the French As-
sociation. It is only in Germany that a general anthropological annual
meeting is held, in which the sole topic considered is the natural his-
tory of man. The national organization of Germany is most complete
in this regard. Every meeting publishes a stenographic report in
Correspondenz-Blatt.

(3) What is true of societies is true of their journals. A full list can
not be given. Ifthe following should be carefully studied, nearly all
that is good will be found reviewed or at least catalogued by author and
by title.

The American Anthropologist, Washington ; Archiv fiir Anthropologie,
Braunschweig; Archivio per l’ Antropologia, Firenze; Bulletins de la
Société d@Anthropologiede Paris ; Journal of the Anthropological Instv-
tute of Great Britain and Ireland, London; Journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society of Great Britain and Ireland, London; Mittheilungen der An-
thropologischen Gesellschaft, in Wien ; Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesell-
schaft fiir Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte, Berlin.

(4) The most gratifying statement to be made in this summary is the
fact that every popular magazine,weekly or daily newspaper, and every
course of lectures for the people, contains a great deal of the very best
anthropological material. It is frequently said nowadays to the pub-
lishing committees of technical and scientific journals, ‘‘ We can not
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN. 1889. 593

afford to have our papers appear in our society organ because the sub-
scription periodicals otter good prices for them.” This fact marks an
epoch in the history of anthropological literature and invites the socie-
ties to explore new fields to which the general reader has not arrived.
Indeed it is impossible to chronicle ali the periodicals of purely scien-
tific character that lend their pages to our pens.

If the following journals be scrutinized in their original papers, re-
views, and book-lists, little that is desirable will escape the reader:

Academy, London; American Antiquarian and Oriental Journal, Men-
don, Il.; The American Naturalist, New York; LD’ Anthropologie, Paris ;
Atheneum, London; Ausland, Stuttgardt; Internationale Archiv fiir
Ethnographie, Leiden; Nature, London; The Popular Science Monthly,
New York; Science, New York.

5. The four events of national interest each year are, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Associ-
ation for the Advancement of Science, the Association Francaise pour
PAvancement des Sciences, and the Allgemeine Versammlung der
deutschen Gesellschaft fiir Anthropologie. During the year 18389, the

the hypothesis of relationship, or that of pre-historic migration.

The enormous advantage of having the Congress in Paris during the
Exposition was apparent in the large attendance and in the frequent
visits which were made to the anthropological museum of Paris, and to
the many sections of the Champs de Mars, and the Esplanade des
Invalides under the very best of guidance.

6. The model workshops of anthropologists is the Laboratoire
d’Anthropologie in Paris. Even here the counting, weighing, measur-
ing of capacity, surface, distance, and angulation is confined to the
human body. Galton’s laboratory in London and Wundt’s psycho-phys-
icai establishment should be added, with the assistance of the vital
statistician and the census director to make the whole complete. The
system employed by Alphonse Bertillon for the measurement and
identification of criminals in the Palais de Justice in Paris, is being
adopted in many cities in our own country. Under the names of Bene-
dikt, Galton, Hitchcock, Rollet, Topinard, and Virchow in our bibli-
ography will be found titles of publications on this branch of anthro-
pology.

7. Kristian Bahnson, of Copenhagen, has rendered a lasting benefit
to the student in his pamphlet on ethnographic museums, first pub-
lished in Denmark and translated in the Mittheilungen der Anthro-
pologischen Gesellschaft, in Wien. Museum history is the subject
of an elaborate paper by Dr. Goode, of the Smithsonian Institution.
Dr. Bastian, in the transactions of the Berlin Anthropological Society,
writes on American collections. Reinach, on the museum of the Em-
peror Augustus, should not be overlooked.

The Peabody Museum in Cambridge publishes carefully prepared
reports of its explorations and accessions each year. New zeal and ac-
tivity have characterized the management of the American Museum in
New York, and of the collections in Philadelphia. In the reports of the
National Museum in Washington will be found detailed statements of
work done and of the accessions,
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889. 597

The memorable event in our science was the Paris Exposition, and
especially that portion of it called “Exposition retrospective du travail
et des sciences anthropologiques.” The design of this portion of the
world’s great fair was to trace in outline by means of specimens, re-pro-
ductions, authentic documents and villages inhabited by native peo-
ples, the steps of human genius from their first trace to the present
moment. Associated with this exhibition of invention were the speci-
mens of man himself, shown in the savage just as he came from the
hands of nature, and in other races as he has improved with time. Fin-
ally, the cabinets of skeletons and the soft parts of the body in plaster and
papier-maché were so installed as to exhibit man associated with his
inventions; the skull and the brain, laboratory of thought and discov-
ery; the skeleton and its contents, articulated machine to execute the
conceptions of the central office.

A building entitled Palais des Arts Liberaux was devoted to the serial
display of the history of invention, a large space on the Esplanade des
Invalides was covered with villages of Africans and natives of south-
eastern Asia. The whole Exposition was filled with the climaxes of
modern thought in every land, the Champs de Mars was fringed with
structures which enabled the student to grasp in a coup d@@il the his-
tory and the natural history of architecture.

The arrangement of objects embraced the following classes: (1) An-
thropology and ethnography, anatomy and races of mankind. (2)
Liberal arts. (3) Arts and trades. (4) Transportation, (5) Military
arts.

In addition to this, a very interesting conception was that of showing
also the organized machinery for the study of anthropology in Paris.
To this end the Société @’ Anthropologie, the Ecole d’Anthropologie and
the Laboratoire d’ Anthropologie, under the regime of public instruction,
made a display in the Palais des Arts Liberaux. The institutions of
Paris, united more or less for studying the natural history of man, are
the following :

(1) Société @ Anthropologie, founded May 19, 1859, publishes bulletins
and memoires. The collections of the society are styled, since 1880,
the Musée Broca, and the literary collections, Bibliotheque de la So-
ciéte @ Anthropologie. Two prizes, the Godard and the Broca, furnish
an effective stimulus to thorough work.

(2) Laboratoire @ Anthropologie (Keole des hautes Etudes), founded
by Broca in 1878. During the period from 1875 to 1889 the Labora-
toire published 378 separate titles.

(3) Ecole @Anthropologie, tirst authorized in 1876. This school is
an annual course of lectures by the most distinguished men in France
upon the different branches of anthropology.

The following foundations are accessory to the three above named.

(1) Société dW Autopsie mutuelle—In 1876 a group of members of the
Société d’ Anthropologie formed a-fraternity, the object of which is to
598 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889.

conduct a scientific autopsy upon the members as they die. Hach one
signs a will conveying his cadaver to the society, to be used in the
furtherance of the science to which he has devoted himself while living.

(2) Réunion Lamarck.—In 1884, the admirers of Lamarck formed a
union for the erection of a monument to the great naturalist, and they
brought together in the Exposition his works and other testimonials
of his greatness.

(3) Bibliotheque des Sciences Contemporaines.— This is a series of
works on anthropology conducted by M. M. Hovelacque, Issaurat, An-
dre Lefévre, Letourneau, Mortillet, Thulie, Veron. The list as now
made up is as follows: (1) La Biologie, by Charles Letourneau; 518
pages, 112 cuts. (2) La Linguistique, by Abel Hovelacque ; 454 pages.
(3) L’Anthropologie, by Paul Topinard ; 576 pages, 52 cuts. (4) L’Es-
thetique, by Eugene Veron; 524 pages. (5) La Philosophie, by Andre
Lefevre; 640 pages. (6) La Sociologie, by Charles Letourneau; 624
pages. (7) LaScience Economique, by Yves Guyot; 600 pages, 67 fig-
ures. (8) Le Préhistorique, by G. de Mortillet; 678 pages, 64 figures.
(9) La Botanique, by M. de Lanessan ; 570 pages, 132 figures. (10) La

Agronomique, by Albert Larbaletrier; XXxIv,568 pages. (15) La Phi-
sico-chimie, by Dr. Fauvelle; xxtv, 512 pages.

8. As we have frequently said in these summaries and dlsoateres
the anthropologist must collect things, all possible knowledge about
things, and he must also imitate the architect, mechanical engineer, and
patent attorney in collecting working drawings. Now this last he has
neglected until quite recently. The portfolios of Prince Roland Bona-
parte, of Hayden, of de Mortillet and others, are well known, but now
we may have such modified by the cheap processes of photographie
printing. The anthropological gallery should also include pictures of
men and things in action, their physiology, and their anatomy. But
this part of our subject lies still chiefly in the future.

9. The segregation of anthropological material from natural history
collections in all the great centers of intelligence has been almost im-
mediately followed by the formation of anthropological libraries. The
societies also have their centers where books are gathered. For in-
stance, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Peabody Museum has its own
library, and in addition to that the keeper of the great library in Har-
yard University sends to the Peabody Museum a duplicate of every
ecard in the Harvard Catalogue which bears an anthropological title.
This is an excellent system. At Washington, while material is more
abundant, the facility of finding a book is not so good. The material
is housed in the Capitol library, the Surgeon-General’s library, the
ae

PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889. 599

Smithsonian or National Museum library, and the Bureau of Ethnol-
ogy at the Geological Survey. In Paris, the Sociéte @ Anthropologie,
the Feole, and the Laboratoire all have their books together in one
room, but these are far from exhausting the resources of that great
city. In Copenhagen the royal librarian turns over the books on
various specialities to the department most interested. The precise
method followed in Berlin, London, Dresden, Leipsic, and other great
centers is not known, but the Peabody plan is far the best, of exchang-
ing ecards, when the books are not in dupheate.

In addition to the lists here given the student should carefully study
the appendices to the American Anthropologist, Archiv fiir -Anthro-
pologie, Mittheilungen der Anthropologischen Gesellschaft in Wien;
and for biological topics, the Index Medicus and Surgeon-General’s
Catalogue. All the publications of the United States Government are
given in Hickox’s Guide.

10. Among the books of instruction to collectors of anthropological in-
formation no one has had greater popularity or done more good than the
little guide published by the British Association for the Advancement
of Science. After several years of well earned praise it appears ina new
dress, with such corrections as time and experience have suggested.
The generai tone of all such manuals is toward more rigid and multi-
plied observations. Professor Goode’s epigram, that “a good museum
specimen is an exhaustive and truthful label illustrated by an object” is
appreciated in all lists of questions, The material history of man must
be studied by natural history methods, and as these methods improve,
the science will need to re-write its question books.

II.—BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY.

Biological anthropology in a restricted and scientific sense is what 1s
learned about man by the biologist in his laboratory and in the use of
his instrumentalities of research. The psychologist, the linguist, the
ethnologist, the ethnographer, the sociologist, have all need of this
man’s aid, but it would be entirely contrary to the use of words to
declare that the first named investigators were biologists only.

No better way can be devised of showing how the body in health and
disease has been invaded by this most zealous elass of workers than a
list of the principal publications for a year. And this is here appended
as a study in the scope of biological anthropology :

III.—PSYCHOLOGY.

The best work done in the field of physiological psychology finds an
efficient reporter in our own Janguage through the pages of the Ameri-
can Journal of Psychology. The removal of Prof. Stanley Hall from
Baltimore to Worcester meant only a more vigorous prosecution of the
laboratory work.

Astronomers will be glad to follow up the researches of Dr. Stanford
respecting what they call personal equation. in four papers filling
nearly two hundred pages, Dr. W. H. Burnham narrates first the history
of theories concerning memory. Hesays, “The continued Platonic and
Aristotelian influences may still be noticed in these modern theories,
: PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889. 601

the former appearing in the transcendental conception of memory,
which has been taught by the German idealists, and appeared in mod-
ified form in the Scottish school, and later its ablest champion in Lotze;
the latter appearing more or less in the empirical conceptions of the
Associationists, Herbartian, as well as English, and in modern physical
theories. Finally it must be plain that whatever be the relative merits
of the idealistic and the physiological theories of memory, the facts of
introspection have been pretty thoroughly worked over in the con-
tinued discussious of memory from the days of Plato and Aristotle
down to the last German student who has contributed a theses Zur
Theorie der Reproduction. After our historical orientation, the quar-
ter of the horizon that looks most promising is in the direction of empir-
ical study.” The progress of empirical research is then comprehensively
sketched by Dr. Burnham.

The value of language study in mental discipline has been questioned
in our day as compared with the pursuit of the natural sciences. From
a purely physiological side and in a most ingenious manner Dr. M. Put-
nain Jacobi examines the subject. A priori, the study of language mast
be an extension, more or less complex, of the process of acquiring lan-
guage ;—the highest physiological acquisition that distinguishes the bu-
manrace from the lower aninals. After noting the portions of the brain
whose activities are involved in so simple a process as the utterance
of a word so commonplace as “ bread,” Dr. Jacobi says: It is plain,
therefore, that tolearn the name of a thing and to learn how to use this
name, much more mental action is required than simply to acquire sense
perceptions about it. The acquisition of foreign languages in addition
to the native tongue multiplies the number of verbal signs which the
mind habitually couples with visual impressions. In registering and
using these multiple signs, the mind is compelled to more complex oper-
ations than when only one signis used. When in different languages
different primary words or roots are used to represent the same object;
then the mind using them all becomes acquainted with the several as-
pects of that object which have impressed the minds of those among
whom these different names have sprung up. Thus a larger impression
of the object is formed, and the mind of the speaker, which is rendered
more flexible and active by engaging in more complex internal pro-
cesses, is also enlarged by a richer store of external impressions. The
immense mental discipline to be derived from the study of the European
languages is likened to the delicate nanipulation of the fingers as com-
pared with the gross movements of arms and legs. The acquisition of
language develops the mental sphere in which ideal conceptions arise,
combine with one another, and generate endless successions of new
ideas. The process of acquiring foreign languages, in addition to the
mother tongue, modifies the original process, by extending, refining,
and complicating it. Impressions are immensely multiplied and the
mind becomes accustomed to take cognizance of such subtle differentia-
,

602 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889.

tions that its delicacy of perception is indefinitely increased. The ea-
pacity to appreciate subtle distinctions, more subtle than those exist-
ing in ature outside the mind, is essential to scientific work.” The
whole essay of Dr. Jacobi should be studied by those who all along have
felt the superiority of language study, but who could not translate their
convictions into modern psycho-physical phraseology.

The accumulation of psychological literature has been chiefly in the
fields of abnormal psychology, such as hallucinations, alexia, amnesia,
aphasia, apraxia, illusions, idiocy, alcoholism, melancholia, and insanity ;
animal psychology, child-mind, dreams, experimental psychology, hyp-
notism, memory, nerve action in health and disease, physiological
psychology, psycho-physics and reaction time; the senses and the dis-
orders of sleep. There is no doubt that, whatever may be one’s ulti-
mate theory of mind, psychologists, like astronomers and_ biologists,
have often to wait for tbe instrument maker. Indeed, there seems for
that reason to be no further advance possible in speculative psychol-
ogy until the instrumental side of the study is improved.

*

The elassification of mankind by physical characters has been
resumed with vigor by J. Deniker (Bul. Soe, d’Anthrop. de Paris, ser.
3, vol. X11, 320-336). From Linnieus to our day, only four or five races
or species have been recognized on physical marks. Bory de Saint
Vincent, Desmoulins, @Omalius @Halloy, and Ir. Miiller admit fifteen
or sixteen, or perhaps a greater number of “races” or “ species,” but
they differentiate them by linguistic or sociologie criteria. Only the
classifications of I. Geoffroy Saint Hilaire (1858), and of Topinard (1879),
reckon more numerous divisions (eleven and sixteen races) based
upon physical characters. In 1885, Topinard, then in possession of
more minute details, increases the number of races to 19.

The tables here given were presented to the Anthropological Soci-
ety of Paris at its session of Jane 6(1889). M. Deniker takes the ground
that in the divers peoples, nations, hordes, tribes, etc., which we now
see scattered over the earth, we have not a clear group of species asin

eee,
al

PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889, 603

zoology. These are mixtures of elementsthe most heterogeneous; there
are no pure races on the earth. In classifying races therefore we must
seek further than among the ethnic groups for the fundamental units.
Save two or three peoples, there is not an ethnos on earth that is not
the product of mixing two or three or several races, and it is our task
to discover the elemental races. The first step in this analysis is to dis-
tinguish the ¢ypes, by which is meant ensembles of salient characters
associated and incarnated in a number of individuals. Now these types
may appear in more than one area, pure or altered, belonging to peoples
which at first glance seem to have had no connection. Sueh is the
Negrito type, seen in its purity among the Aetas, the Mincopies, the
Sakai, ete., and turns up here and there among the Melanesians, the
Australians, the Malays, the Nagas, the Dravidians, ete.

That which varies is the proportion in which a type enters into anethnie
group. When it is altogether preponderating, the people are nearly a
pure race, asthe Bushmen, Aetas, Mincopies, or Ainos. The types are
the units of classification and the numerical preponderance of individ-
uals therein gives importance to a type as a constituent element in an
ethnic group. Just so far as we are able to go back from type to race
we can tell the races which go to make up a people. M. Deniker makes
out thirteen of these races, a small number of which are pure, the
others are represented by varietes, two for the Ethiopian, Xanthochroi,
Indonesians, and three or more for others. Now these thirteen races
are evidently variations of a smaller number (perhaps only one) of
species of the genus Homo.

The first table differentiates the thirteen races into the thirty types
fixed by M. Deniker. The first group corresponds with the Oulotriches of
Bory Saint Vincent (UJotriches of Haeckel), and comprehends Negroes,
Melanesians, and Bushmen. The second group comprehends blacks
with curly hair, but not woolly, Negritos, Australians, Ethiopians, and
corresponds to the Australoids of Huxley. In the third group, wavy
haired Caueassians, is subdivided according to Huxley into the brown,
Melanchroi, and the blonde, Xanthochroi. The fourth group compre-
hends races with white, yellow, or yellowish sEins and slightly wavy
hair, Uralo-Altaic, Ainos, Indonesians. The fifth group, finally, includes
Mongoloids and the Americans.

to the principal publications of 1889.

During the winter of 1889-90 Dr. Daniel G. Brinton published two
papers in the proceedings of the American Philosophical Society main-
taining that the ethnic affinities of the ancient. Etruscans lay in the
direction of the Libyans on the North African coast. His arguments
were that the Etruscans were tall, blonde, and dolicho-cephalic, which

ras also the type of the Libyans; that their social life and form of
government was much closer to African than to Asiatic models; that
their own traditions unanimously stated their advent on Italian soil to
have been by sea from the south; and finally, that their language,
what little we know of it, seems to have roots and forms, explainable
by the Libyan dialects. This last argument Dr. Brinton expanded at
some length in his second paper entitled “A Comparison of Etruscan
and Libyan Names,” in which he attempts to analyze a number of
Etruscan personal mythological and geographic names by the various
modern and ancient Libyan dialects.

By looking over the bibliographic list accompanying this summary it
will be readily seen that there are many works of inestimable value to
the ethnologist which wouid be indexed under other catch-words. Mr.
Galton’s paper on gold working among the Peruvians, and Mr. Kina-
han’s on Irish proverbs, were written—the former from a technical point
of view, the latter for a folk-lore journal, but the student of the Peru-
vians or the Irish could omit neither their arts nor their lore. The best
the summarist can do is to base his index on the motive of the writer
with such cross reference as he can make.

V.—GLOSSOLOGY.

The eighth international congress of Orientalists was held in Stock-
holm and Christiania from the 2d to the 13th of September. The
meeting was under the immediate patronage and presidency of His
Majesty King Oscar. Never in the history of science have more
elaborate preparations been made for the entertainment of such an
assembly.

The congress was composed of five sections, as follows: (1) Semitic
and Islam. (a) Languages and literatures of Islam. (b) Semitic
languages, other than Arabic; cuneiform texts and inscriptions. (2)
Aryan. (3) African, including Egyptology. (4) Central Asia and
the far East. (5) Malay and Polynesia.

At the Paris Exposition the student of living languages did not lack
for opportunities to investigate the natives of every part of the globe.
In the separate exhibits, colonial headquarters, cafés, bazaars, and,
above all, on the Esplanade des Invalides, the highest and the lowest
could be investigated.

An amusing example of the French desire to exhaust the possibilities
of a subject was furnished by the placard posted in every available
space by the proprietors of the Decauville Railroad. This was a narrow
gauge tramway running to all parts of the Exposition, and the passenger
was warned in more than twenty tongues not to expose his head or his
arms or his legs to the trees along the route.

The volume of Paul Regnaud, on the origin and philosophy of lan-
guage, treats the subject purely from a natural history point of view.
The study is divided into three parts: (1) Exposition of theories already
proposed. (2) Attempt at anew theory. (3) Future of languages
and linguistic studies. Under the first head are reviewed, language as
a revelation, as an instinet, as an invention, as having a spontaneous
origin. In the second part the evolution of language is consider d in
in the two lines of form and sense. Upon the subject of the future of
PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889. 609

language, M. Regnaud, from purely natural reasons, does not hold to
the possibility of a universal language.

To follow minutely the literature of comparative language, no better
guide can be found than Techmer’s Internationale Zeitschrift fur Allge-
meine Sprachwissenschaft, founded in Leipzig in 1884, and now pub-
lished in Heilbronn. The editor commences in the first number of vol. Lv,
issued in 1888, and completes in the second number, issued in 1889, a
bibliography of language publications in 1886. The first ten pages are
devoted to journals and periodicals, with their contents. A liberal
definition is allowed to the word language, so as to include papers on
general ethnology. Then follow 162 pages of titles with elaborate digest
in fine print, one of the most exhaustive helps to the general student.
To leave no stone unturned for the reader’s convenience, Dr. Techmer
furnishes at the close a syllabus of the entire catalogue, and with each
-atch-word the name of the authors who have written on that subject
and the page where his title and review may be found. Would space
permit, the whole syllabus should be here re-produced, but the classifi-
cation without the names here printed will show the magnitude of the
scheme: :

Science of language in general. History of the science of language.

I. Natural history and language: Relation of this study to anthro-
pology. (1) Acoustic methods of expression, including phonetics,
anatomy, storing of language, rhythm, metric; (2) optical and other
nodes of expression ; (3) present condition of acoustic and optical ex-
pression, phonetic writing, sound writing, shorthand, orthoepy and
orthography, principals of transcription, universal speech, deaf-mute
language.

II. Psychological side of language study: (1) Relations to psychics ;
2) roots ; (3) suffixes, affixes; (4) words; (5) semiology and change of
meaning; (6) analogy ; (7) etymology ; (8) psychological subject and
predicate.

III. Historical side of language study: (1) Phylogenetic develop-
ment of speech; (2) origin and prehistoric development; (3) relations
to mythology; (4) relation to the science of religion; (5) relation to
ethnography ; (6) relation to aesthetics; (7) historic development ;
(8) science of language and philology ; (9) paleography ; (10) conflict
of languages ; (11) grammar in relation to logic and psychology.

IV. Glossography, or the study of special languages: (a) languages
not Semitic or Indo-germanic in Africa, America, Asia, Europe; (0)
Semitic languages; (¢c) Indo.germanic languages: Indic, Iranic, Greek,
Latin, and its derivatives, Keltic, Slavic, Lithuanic, Germanic, Seandi-
navic, English, Hollandic. Ontologic development of a language.

In 1888 R. de la Grasserie, of Rennes, published a work on the divis-
ions of linguistic study (Divisions de la Linguistique, Maissonneuve
et Ch. Leclere (1888) Paris), in which he considers the subject under
three heads: (1) The study of each language separately; (2) the com-

H. Mis. 224 39

610 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889, :

parison of related languages; (3) comparison of non-related languages.
The author remarks that in botany or zoology, classification must be
founded upon the knowledge of the essential characteristics of the be-
ings under investigation, their true resemblances and their differences,
and the degrees ef importance among these last. The origin and rela-—
tionship of each group must then be noticed. In this way a true
synthesis of nature is the result. The following syllabus is followed
by the author in a series of papers published in Techmer’s Zeitschrift :

I, Classification of allied languages. ;

Title 1. Partial and subjective classification (in abstract): (A) Allied
languages; ascending, fixed, descending; (B) related languages; re-:
lated, allied, isolated ; (C) allied languages, classed as if not related.

March of morphological evolution. (1) Transition between the three
systems of expressions, more or less linguistic, of thought, (a) syntactic
or the order of words, (b) employment of relational words, (c) of phonic
modification. (2) Transition in each of the three systems between the
concrete and the abstract. (3) Transition in each of three systems
between the subjective and the objective. (4) Transition in each of the
three systems between the non-formal and the formal.

Title 2: Classifications, objective and genealogie, of allied languages ;
natural families: (1) Indo-germanic; (2) Semitic; (3) Uralic; (4)«

proposition. (B) Formulated. ‘

(a) Subjective. The concretness is thus graduated. (1) From the
stand-point of necessity ; (2) from the stand-point of comprehension ;
(3) from the stand-point of energy ; (4) from the stand-point purely —
material, or purely intellectual, or both combined. (b) Objective: The>
concreteness is thus graduated. (1) From thestand-point of necessity ;
(2) from the stand-point of comprehension ; (3) from the stand-point of —
energy; (4) from the stand-point of material or intellectual character, —
or both combined ; (5) from the stand-point of application which is made
of this concreteness in the principal ideas, or to those of determination
or relation. 2. Abstract psychological languages; (A) analytical non-
formulated languages; (B) analytical formulated languages. Section
2. Languages with sufficient expression, either morphological languages,
or with unmeaning (vides) words. The languages with non-significant

end of the dominant word.

Title 2: Total classification, natural and objective, of non-allied lan-
guages.

VI.—_TECHNOLOGY.

In Berlin, close to the Ethnological Museum, is the Kunstgewerbe
Museum. It is difficult to say which of these is the more interesting.
In the Ethnographic Museum the ruling concept is chorographic, but
also ethnic. Each of-the vast rooms is designed to cover a portion of
_ the earth’s surface which shuts in a recognized body of humanity and
of human arts.

The Kunstgewerbe Museum contains much that is like the ethno-
graphic collection, but the reigning concept is technographic. A trade,
craft, art, profession is worked out ethnically, nationally, historically.
That is, you are called upon to study the natural history of inventions.

In Oxford, at South Kensington, in Cluny, in Amsterdam, indeed in
many European cities, the most interesting collections are thus arranged.

In the literature of anthropology, a great number of books, papers
read before societies, and articles in periodicals, are devoted to the trac-
ing out of separate industries. It is thus that in the National Museum
Mr. Watkins traces the first wheel up to the latest paper car-wheel, or
Captain Collins discloses the relation between the bull-boat of the
Tigris or the Missouri and our last pontoon.

An extremely interesting example of technology coming tothe aid of
archeology is Mr. Edward B. Tylor’s explanation of the mythical fig-
ure holding before the tree of life a cone-shaped object in Assyrian
sculptures, This object resembling a fir-cone, the professor thinks,
612 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889,

is the inflorescence of the male date palm as it appears when freed —
from its sheath ready to have its pollen dusted over the ae flowers.
(Academy, June 8.)

simplest forms by the technographic method. The following list of

VIT.—ARCH A OLOGY.

The pre-historic station of Lengyel, on the Danube, within the estate
_ of Count Alexander Apponyi, in the comitat of Tolna, Hungary, is
doubtless the most remarkable discovery of its kind in Europe during
the year 1889. The station is a fortified enciente, within which have
been found several groups of habitations and two cemeteries. Among
the habitations, to the number of about two hundred, some were in
form of a bee-hive dug in the loess of the Danube about three or four
meters deep and two to three meters in diameter, and entered from the
top. Alongside of these dwellings were other smaller souterrains, whose
walls were formed of reeds and small branches interwoven and covered
with a thick layer of clay, apparently hardened by fire. In these sou-
terrains were many large jars similar to those found by Schliemann in
Troy, and filled with different kinds of grain slightly parched. At
Lengyel some of the habitations were above the soil. Their founda-
tions are not more than a meter deep, and their walls were formed of
wattling. But of the superstructure little can be said. One of the
cemeteries belonged to the Neolithic period; the objects recovered in
the other bring it into relationship with the palafittes and terramares,
or the finds of the Villanova or first Hallstadian period. In the habita-
tions and cemeteries over twelve thousand objects were found. Marquis
de Nadaillae coneludes that Lengyel belongs to the ancient Greeco-
Asiatie civilization, and that here we see traces of one of the immi-
erations which have exercised such a grand influence on the primitive
populations of Europe.

The most original investigations into the Stone age made in the United
States in 1859, were those of Mr. William H. Holmes, of the Bureau of
Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, at Piney Branch, 1 mile
north of Washington City, and those of Prof. F. W. Putnam in the
Little Miami Valley, Ohio. The work of Mrs. Holmes is described in
the January number of the American Anthropologist for 1890. The fol-
lowing résumé will convey some idea of the digging:

A hill slopes by a steep decline towards a running brook. Upon its
sides is a dense growth of hard-wood timber and over its surface have
been found for many years the rudely chipped stones called ‘ turtle-
backs.”

In the autumn of 1889 Mr. Holmes carried a trench up the sides of
the hill, going down to bed-rock all the way. At first his trench was
only a few inches deep, but the depth increased to 9 feet about 50 feet
up the hill-side. At every depth however the same rude examples
were found as occurred on the surfa&e, until suddenly the explorer came
to a steep escarpment of bowlders in hard clay. The mystery was
solved. Mr. Holmes had unearthed an aboriginal bowlder quarry, and
the thousands of stones were the remnants of its occupation. Two
questions are propounded by this discovery: the first is with reference
614 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889.

to the antiquity of the workshop, the other to the function of the stone
relics. Mr. Holmes inclines to the view that they are all refuse, the
remains of unsuccessful attempts to make implements, and that the
place is not very ancient. In this view he is not followed by all his
colleagues.

In the latter part of September, 1889, Mr. Charles Francis Adams,
president of the Union Pacific Railroad, announced the finding of a
clay image during the boring of an artesian well at Nampa, Idaho, a
station on the Oregon Short Line Railroad, 20 miles from Boisé City,
about half way between Boisé City and Smoke River, being 7 miles
from the former and 12 miles from the latter. This region is covered
with deposits of lava rock belonging to late Tertiary or Quaternary
times.

Beneath these lava deposits in California occur much gold-bearing
gravel, and it was therein that Professor Whitney found the Calaveras
skull.

The finding is thus described by Professor Wright: In boring the
well, the surface soil was penetrated 60 feet to the lava rock, which
was found to be 20 feet thick. Below this for 200 feet were alternate
beds of quicksand and clay; then coarse sand was struck from which
the image came up. Below this was vegetable soil and then sand rock.
The image therefore lay buried to the depth of about 300 feet beneath
deposits which had accumulated in a lake formed by some ancient ob-
struction of the Snake River Valley, and over this accumulation there
had been an outflow of lava sufficient to cover the whole and seal it up.
The image is carved out of soft pumice-stone and has a coating of red
oxide of iron.

VIII.—SOCIOLOGY.

The firm hold which the methods of natural history have taken upon
sociology is exhibited in the review of a threadbare subject with a
reversal of public judgment. The efforts of Lord Kingsborough, Adair,
and others to prove that the North American Indians were the lost
tribes of Israel brought discredit upon their statements about the
Indians. Colonel Mallery, as vice-president of the American Associa-
tion in Toronto, reviewed the subject, re-affirmed the statements about
both Indians and Israelites, and then proceeded to show that the simi-
larities between the two peoples could be accounted for by a well-known
principle in ethnology without assuming either consanguinity or contact.

The British Association for the Advancement of Science did an excel-
lent thing in appointing a commission to study the Indians of Canada.
Dr. Boas has reported extensively upon the social life of the coast
Indians of British Columbia, a branch of ethnologie science for which
he had specially qualified himself.

Mr. Stuart Culin, of Philadelphia, has utilized the presence of a large
number of Chinese there to acquaint himself with some of their social
customs. His studies in their apparatus of gambling have been prose-
cuted with extreme care, and the result is a series of monographs of

great value.

The one absorbing topic among sociologists at present is the cause
and prevention of crime. A congress of criminology was held in Paris
616 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889.

during the exposition, at which gathered the most eminent students of
the subject. The questions proposed to the congress were divided into

IX.—RELIGION AND FOLK-LORE.

The folk-lorists are just encountering a difficulty which has con-
fronted the archeologists and technologists for a number of years. It
is this: How are we to account for tales and myths and lore found in
lands distant by thousands of miles and centuries of time, and yet so
similar in dramatis persone and incidents. Leaving out of view the
nature theories of Miiller, Cox, and de Gubernatis as at present unpop-
ular, we have two extremely active candidates for our acceptance in
the opinions of Lang and his colleagues on one side and Benfey on the
other side. The views of Andrew Lang and of Mr. Tylor are that simi-
lar stimuli acting upon similar stages of culture and similar conditions
produce similar results. The idea of Benfey is that many resemblances
are too close to be accidental, and can be accounted for only by what
Major Powell calls acculturation. The conflict is therefore fairly on,
with the ablest of opponents on either side.

The first annual meeting of the American Folk-Lore Society was held
in Philadelphia, November 28 and 29, in the halls of the University of
Pennsylvania. Dr. Daniel G. Brinton presided and Mr. Horace Fur-
ness pronounced the address of welcome. A resolution was passed
recommending a more extensive publication than the Journal of Ameri-
can Folk-Lore. The council was also instructed to provide a question-
naire or guide to the collection of Folk-Lore, to be circulated in pam-
phlet form. The meeting was made a very happy one by the courtesies
of the authorities of the University and of the people of Philadelphia.
The following papers were read:

Additional collection a pre-requisite to correct theory in Folk-Lore
and Mythology, W. W. Newell. Chinese secret societies in the United
States, Stewart Culin. Superstitions connected with human saliva,
G. L. Kittridge. Some saliva charms, Mrs. Fanny D. Beyen. Primi-
tive man in modern belief, Henry Phillips. Voodooism in Missouri,

Teutonic folk-names in America, Albert H. Smyth. Derivations of
folk-tales, ete.,in the United States, W. H. Babcock. Louisiana Folk-
Lore stories, Alcee Fortier.

The bibliographic notices and references to sources of information in
the Journal of American Folk-Lore, place the student immediately in
relation with home and foreign literature upon this most popular branch
of anthropology.

The first congress of folk-lorists was opened in Paris on the 29th
July, at the Trocadero. The occasion of the exposition brought together
French, Spaniards, Italians, Russians, Poles, Finns, Swedes, English,
American, and Chinese. The officers of the congress were: President,
Charles Ploix; vice-presidents, Bruyere, de Rialle, Leland, Dagomanor,
Nutt, Prato, Nyerop, Tchengkitong; secretary, Sebillot. The subse-
quent meetings were at the Mairie of the sixth arrondissement, near St.
Sulpice. The question of classification, tabulation, and analysis were
referred to a committee.

The next congress will be held in London, 1891.

The Folk-Lore Society of London, the most active of all the organiza-
tions devoted to this branch of anthropology, held its annual meeting
on Tuesday, November 26. The policy of the society has been carried
out in two directions, (1) the systematic collection of the remnants of
British Folk-Lore, and (2) the classification of general folk-lore in such
a Shape that the scientific value of each item may be tested and exam-
ined.

As the Folk-Lore Journal in its present shape did not sufficientiy rep-
resent the scientific aims of the society, it was decided to issue the
journal under a new title, Folk-lore. The Archeological Review will be
fused into the new publication.

The prospectus gives a good analysis of Folk-lore as it is regarded
by the English Society, and is here appended: (1) Original articles,
whether collections of facts or expositions of theory. (2) Reprints of
English material, not easily accessible, and translations of little read
languages. (3) A record of the progress of study in folk-lore and in
allied branches of science. This record will comprise: (a) A bibliog-

raphy of English and non-English books relating to folk-lore, mythol-

ogy, archaic and savage institutions, medieval romantic literature,
archaic history, etc. (b) Summaries of contents of follk-lore periodicals
and citation of articles of interest to the folk-lorist in general period-
icals. (c) Reports on well-defined sections of folk-lore, to be issued at
stated times, briefly summing up the progress and results of study
within each section during the interval from one report to another,
each section to be intrusted to a member of the society, who will make
himself responsible for the production of the report.
620 PROGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN 1889.

‘The following sections are planned:

Comparative mythology. Celtic and Teutonic myti and saga. In-
stitutions: (a) archaic, (b) savage. Folk-lore in its more restricted use:
(a) folk-tales and cognate subjects, (b) ballads and games, (c) folk-usages.
Pre-historie anthrepology and archaic history. Oriental and medieval
romantic literature. (4) Tabulation of folk-tales and analysis of cus-
toms and superstitions.

The impracticability of separating the study of comparative religion
from folk-lore at present is seen in the titles given below, while in the
common affairs of life no less than in the conduct of the gods the sav-
age and the untutored mind live much in presence of a spirit world.

The most important of these publications are the following:

Amulets against evil eye, Tylor. Arab amulets, Pallary. Arab le-
gend, Bolton. Aryan sun-myths, Morris. Ballads of London, Babcock.

dance, McLean. Bread-lore, Gregor. Budha’s alms dish and the Holy

Upon the endowment of the late Lord Gifford for a chair in each of
the Scottish Universities for teaching natural theology, defined to be
“the knowledge of God, the Infinite, the All, the first and only cause,
the one and Sole Substance, the Sole Being, the Sole Reality, and the
Sole [ixistence, the Knowledge of His Nature and Attributes, the
Knowledge of the Relations which men and the whole universe bear to
Him, the Knowledge of the Nature and Foundation of.Ethies and Mor-
als, and of all Obligations and Duties hence arising,” Max Muller was
elected to fill the chair in Glasgow for the first time. His lectures on
Natural Religion upon this foundation are now published and form one
of the important contributions of the year.

X.—MAN AND NATURE.

The study of the earth in its relation to man continues in two direc-
tions, the investigation of man’s relation to geology and the accumula-
tion of knowledge concerning climatology and the earthly forces effect-
ual in human fecundity, longevity, vigor, health, ete. The most puz-
zling enigma of the year has been previously mentioned, the finding at
Nampa, Idaho, of an image over 300 feet beneath the surface. There
is just enough of uncertainty about this discovery to keep the matter
forever in dispute. A much more solid foundation for argument is laid
in the diggings of Mr. Holmes on Piney Branch, in the District of Co-
lumbia, where the ordinates of correct deduction were furnished by fol-
lowing the original horizontal stratum and by the perpendicular face of
the bowlder bed.

A. few titles are herewith appended to show the drift of investigation:

Acclimation at Panama, Vernial. Climate of tropical Africa, Vir-
chow. Glacial period, Falsan. Man and nature, theories transformistes,
de Quatrefages. The world’s supply of fuel, McGee.

THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.*

By Dr. PAuL TOPINARD.
Translated by WALTER HouGu.

Our science does not yet know the precise ways, direct or indirect,
by which the present orders and families have advanced. The poly-
phyletic table of the genealogy of mammals that seems best to repre-
sent the present state of the inquiry, is far from having the ideal sim-
plicity of the monophyletic tree of Heckel. The genealogy of the cele-
brated professor of Jena is an admirable work, which has been the
starting point for numerous studies that have rendered immense service.
But he will himself acknowledge it to be a preliminary attempt, which
he will certainly re-consider some day.

There are certain truths worthy to be remembered. The first is that
our existing mammalian orders, families, and genera, are the product of
a long evolution of successive transformations, and were not in exist-
ence before the eocene and miocene periods. At that time also accord-
ing to the present teaching of paleontology, the first placental mammals
began to be developed from the marsupials by means of differentiation
and multiplication of types which have led to our present forms.

The second truth is that the progressive passage from the marsupial
fauna of that time to the existing fauna did not take place by a single
series of species for each order, family, or genus, but in all cases, where
science has sufficient evidence, by multiple series anastomosing, inter-
crossing, and forming sometimes a perfectly inextricable network.

Here and there however, science seems already to have advanced ;—
for instance, in the case of the ungulata, whose genealogical table has
been tolerably made out; the carnivora, whose numerous origins have
been shown ; the cheiroptera, and the pinnipeds or aquatic carnivora,
Other orders resemble a veritable cross-roads, as the insectivora and
rodentia.

For some orders we have recorded only the probabilities or provis-
ional suppositions in regard to their derivation and development.

One important branch leading to man, in the doctrine of Heckel, is
that of the lemurs which follow the marsupials, the eighteenth stage
from the moners in the genealogy of Heckel.

*Lecture delivered in March, 1888, in the Ecole d’Anthropologie of Paris. (From

670 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.
I.—LEMURS.

The lemurs have been classed among the quadrumana by Geoffroy
Saint Hilaire, Cuvier, de Blainville, Duvernoy, and Milne Edwards,
and among the primates by Linneus, Lesson, Huxley, and Broca; that 1s
to say, separated from man in the first case and re-united to him in the
second. Vogt and Heckel give them the name of pro-simians. The
Germans call them half-apes (Halbaffen); the French sometimes the
false-apes. The main question is, to what extent are they apes? Do
they merit the name of pro-simians, and should they figure among the
primates ?

What do we understand by the primates? The best definition seems
to be the following: The primates are non-aquatic, placental mammals
(which excludes the cetacea, sirenia, and pinnipeds); they have no
hoofs (which excludes the ungulata and proboscidea); they have three
kinds of teeth (which sets aside the rodentia and edentata), and their
molars are not in sharp and cutting ridges, or with sharp and conical
points (which excludes the carnivora and insectivora).

But have they not certain characters in common? Not absolutely.
Naturalists omit in their scheme of characters the type of cerebral con-
volutions. The primates have a discoidal placenta, a uterus with a
cavity not two-horned, and the penis pendant.

Passing over the first two characters, the third is observed likewise
in the cheiroptera or bats. The primates have two pectoral mamme,
but so have the cheiroptera and sirenia.

The teeth that everywhere furnish characters of the first order, vary
as to number, form, and degree of continuity: all we are able to say
here is that they are much more specialized, much closer together, and
are above all, much more fixed in their general formula, as the families
rise toward man.

Under the last head there are four stages: the lemurs, the monkeys
of the old world, the monkeys of the new world, and man.

The nails, which among the primates take the place of claws, are one
of their most important characteristics. So long as the claws are horny
productions, compressed transversely, more or less long, recurved and
sharp pointed, they serve as organs of attack and defense ; and in the
hoof the horny growth curves in on every side and envelops the digi-
tal extremity to hinder direct contact with the ground, and adapt it
exclusively to walking. The nails are horny growths flattened above
and below, growing straight and serving to facilitate prehension and
touch. Their adaptation to that use is more or less perfect and applies
more or less to the fingers of the primates; this allows us again to
divide them into perfect primates, such as man and the monkeys
(minus a certain group), and the imperfect primates.

The well developed thumb, separated from the other fingers and
opposable, is a character of adaptation, the corollary of the nails. More
completely, it is besides an organ for clamping, for seizing, and for

wae tron 5 > ah
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 671

touching; by this the primates may be sub-divided also, but into three
groups, viz: Man, in which the thumb is opposable only in the upper
extremities; the monkeys, in Which it is opposable in all of the extremi-
ties, and the imperfect primates in which the adaptation may be either
less apparent, or more marked, in the lower extremities than in the
upper. Other characters could be pointed out, for the most part show-
ing grades in the ascending series of the primates; but the above are
sufficient for our purpose.

To so consider the primates is perhaps to prejudice in a measure the re-
sult sought. As souon as one introduces into the series a progressive de-
velopment of characters,and divides the primates into superior, medium,
and inferior, one is held to be indulgent toward the characters which
appear to be obscure or lacking among the lowest. When we admit
that the lower primates are but the commencement of the series, the
passage from the other orders to that of the primates is but a step.
Now the lemurs will supply us with the greater part of the imperfect
primates to which we have alluded.

The lemurs embrace, or should embrace, three groups of animals:
the galeopitheci, the cheiromys, and the lemu:s properly so called.

The galeopitheci, or flying cats (from yady cat and zAyx07, monkey)
inhabit the Sunda, Molucea, and Philippine islands. They exemplify
the difficulty of fixing in our classification certain groups characterized
as paradoxical, and for the reason that they are groups of transition,
having tie right really to be found in many groups. By Oken they
have been classed with the rodents, by Etienne Geoffroy Saint Hilaire
with the carnivora, by Cuvier with the bats, by Linnzeus, Broca, Brehm,
Huxley (in 1862), and Vogt, with the lemurs, and by Huxley (in 1872),
with the insectivora.

That which permits of their being called lemurs is their general
appearance and their arboreal and nocturnal habits. Most of their
characters however oppose it. They have claws on all the fingers,
and the thumb is not opposable, hence they are not primates, not even
incipient. They possess that which Mr. Huxley calls a patagium, that
is, a fold of skin on the sides of the body extending along the outside
of the lower limbs and along the outside of the upper limbs, encireling
the tail and prolonged between the fingers of normal length. It is the
organ exhibited among the flying marsupials called petaurites, and
which modified recalls the jurassic pterosaurians on the one hand, the
cheiroptera and particularly the pteropus on the other, without agree-
ing among the last, however, with the wing of a bird.

This patagium has caused the galeopitheci to be classed with the
cheiroptera. That which causes them to be placed among the inseet-
ivora by Professor Huxley is their dentition, the conformation of their
skull, and their brain. In short, we discard them from the lemurs and
consequently from the primates.

The cheiromys embraces but one genus, the aye-aye of Madagasear.
672 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

It resembles a squirrel, but it also approaches the monkeys and maki.
It has claws only on the upper limbs; the thumb is freely developed and
is not opposable. In the lower limbs four of the fingers have claws;
the well-developed thumb has a flat nail and is opposable. Its denti-
tion is curious, making it a rodent as an adult, and an insectivore or
lemur when an infant at its first dentition. Owen, de Blainville, Hux-
ley, Brehm, and Vogt all place them among the lemurs. It is evi-
dently a primate at its inception ; but a species as if hesitating whether
it should remain in the primates or in the rodents. The exposition of
M. Vogt, on pages 13 and 77 of his “ Mammalia,” implies that its origin
was in the insectivora.

The lemurs proper are divided into fossil and recent. The former
appeared in the Kocene, and at that time existed parallel with tae mar-
supials, which were then in the course of extinction, and the first pla-
cental mammals, which were the carnivores, the rodents, the ungulates
and the insectivores. Kurope has furnished five genera, America more,
the most important being the anaptomorphus, from which Professor
Cope derives man. ‘The present species may be divided into three geo-
graphical groups. ‘The first and the most numerous embraces the island
of Madagascar, the second that island and Africa south of the Sahara.
The third the island of Ceylon, the peninsula of Malacca, the Moluceas,
and the Philippines. These regions constitute in the theory of Haeckel
the remains of a vast austral continent, which he has called Lemuria.
Among the genera belouging to the group of Madagascar I cite the
maki, the indris, and the tarsius; in the second group, the galago, of
which a species is found only however in Madagascar; and in the third
or oriental group the loris.

The lemurs are arboreal and nocturnal animals, as previously said.
Oken calls them the nocturnal monkeys of the Old World. They have
four opposable thumbs with a single exception, the tarsier, which does
not have the upper thumbs opposable, but only the lower ones. All
their fingers, as.a general rule, have nails, save the posterior index,
which is armed with a claw, or the anterior little finger of the loris.
However, the nails are sometimes rudimentary and as though develop-
ing from the claw. Relative to the teeth it is impossible to establish a
general formula. The number varies from thirty to thirty-six. For
example, the formula of thirty-two has been given to man and the
catarrhine apes; the indri has thirty, because it lacks an upper pre-
molar; the tarsier thirty-four, because it has a lower incisor less and
for each jaw a premolar more; the maki thirty-six, because it has a
lower incisor and an upper premolar extra; the Loris also thirty-six,
because it has an incisor and a lower premolar more. All these con-
siderations tend to establish that the lemurs have not a fixed and
homogeneous type, but that they constitute a transitional group from
animals with claws to animals with nails, and should consequently be
regarded as the first, if not the second, step (considering cheiromys as

—s_
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 673

the first) in the line of the better-characterized monkeys. However,
Serious objections are raised against that way of looking at it. The
first is that of Broca. In 1870, when his celebrated monograph on the
order of primates appeared, my lamented master (Broca) maintained
in nearly the same terms as Huxley that the lemurs are the fifth family
of the order of primates, but more separated from the other families
than any one of those is from one another.

In 1877, after a communication before the Société d@’ Anthropologie, he
changed his opinion, and for the following reason: Haeckel based his
bifurcate division of placental mammals on the existence of extended
or limited placenta and the absence or presence of a deciduous mem-
brane which detaches with the débris of the egg at the time of birth.
Among the mammals with diffuse and deciduous placenta are classed
the ungulata and cetacea. The others are sub-divided in their turn
into four branches, in which the circumscribed placenta presents itself
under different aspects reducible to two, one an annular or zone-like
insertion, the other a disk or discoidal insertion. The carnivora and
proboscidea are examples of the first mode of insertion. Man, the an-
thropoids, the ordinary monkeys, and the lemurs,—that is to say, all the
primates are in the second class. Now Broca had shown to the society
the placenta of a lemur, the propithecus diadema, in which the placenta
was neither discoidal nor annular, but is diffase, and which had no de-
cidua. The lemurs hence are separated violently from the other pri-
mates by a character of the first order.

Vogt answered that we have as yet examined but four specimens of
lemurian placentas, and that this organ among them is neither diffuse
nor zonary, nor discoidal, but bell-shaped, a transition from the zonary
to the discoidal. Afterwards, without denying the importance of the
placenta as a basis of classification for the mammals, he showed that its
importance had been exaggerated, that all the intermediate ones fall in
between the different forms, and that very different shapes may fre-
quently be observed in the same order. Vogt accepts however the
opinion of Broca, but it was on account of other considerations. Ac-
cording to him the lemurs are to be separated from the monkeys, and
consequently are not their ancestors. Heremarked that the opposable
thumb has nothing absolute about it since it has been already observed
among certain marsupials, and likewise the nails, since the lemurs have
claws on more or fewer fingers. That is true, but Vogt retains the
galeopitheci among the lemurs, and they are the most important feat-
ure in his argument. As to the contradictory physical characters
invoked by Vogt they are numerous and weighty. To enumerate:
—the lemurs have the two parts of the jaw independent, but they are
always joined among the primates; their low and slim jaw contrasts
with the high and heavy jaw of the monkeys. The intermaxillary bone
persists throughout life among the lemurs but it is co ossified early among
the recognized primates. The orbits are opened behind or have but a

H. Mis. 22 i——43
674 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

slender ring, whilst they ave always closed among the primates. The
lachrymal bone is largely exterior or facial, whilst among the primates
it is intra-orbital. Their dental types are various, whilst it is fixed
among the monkeys. The cerebellum is uncovered among the lemurs,
and covered over among the primates. The uterus is bifid, contrary to
the assertion of Hieckel. Beside the pectoral mamme, they have often
inguinal mamme. They have never been observed to have breech
callosities or cheek pouches as among the monkeys of the Old World.
The pelvis and the ear are entirely different.

Vogt concludes in these words: “ In summing up, it follows from all
these facts that absolutely no relation exists between the prosimians
and the monkeys, and from the same, none with man. With the excep-
tion of the opposable thumb, which is found among the marsupials, the
lowest and most ancient of the mammals, the prosimians have not a
single anatomical character in common with the monkeys. It is derog-
atory to all principles of positive science to class the prosimians among
the probable ancestors of the human species.”

Are these objections really so weighty? From a morphological point
of view, they are certainly important; but they do not oblige us to
throw out the lemurs from the order of the primates. None of these
divergent characters are in contradiction to the idea that they are but
the rough draft of a beginning of the primates.

The characters drawn from the nails and the opposable thumbs out-
ranked the others at the time in determining the general idea involved
in the choice of the word primate. But man has the orbit open, or
closed, the angles of the uterus are prolonged more or less, the inter-
maxillary and symphisial sutures may or may not be united, he is not
thelessman. The same is true for the monkeys. The adaptation of the
extremities,two, or four to the function of prehension, is the character-
istic trait of the primates. But is the inconvenience of admitting the
lemurs into the order of primates of moment when it is made in the terms
of Huxley? The lemurs are the last family of the order of primates and
are more remote from the other families than they are from each other.
The distance from the anthropoids to man is also very great, as shown
in the volume of the brain and the cranial characters flowing from it,
and nevertheless I range man among the primates. Strictly, they can
separate the lemurs and make a special order, so that the genealogical
attachment to the monkeys will not be so prejudicial, but that will com-
pel us to do the same with man. Vogt is inconsistent ; he retains the
word pro-simians as synonymous with lemurs.

Having finished with the links which do or do not attach the lemurs
to the primates, it remains to speak of their relations with the other
neighboring groups. I have sufficiently insisted on the relationship with
the marsupials and more particularly with the phalangers. The in-
sectivores are next to be considered.

All authors from Cuvier to M. Vogt have noted the resemblance of
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 615

the teeth of the lemurs to those of the insectivores. “Their teeth,”
writes Cuvier, “begin to show us (from higher to lower) the sharp
tubercles interlocking one into the other as in the insectivora.” “The
galegos,” one finds a little further on, “ have the teeth and the insect-
ivorous diet of the other lemurs.” ‘ The dentition of the tarsians is that
of an insectivore,” says Mr. Vogt. “The lobes of the molars are usually
well forward as among the insectivora,” says M. Huxley. We have
already pointed out the inseectivorous first dentition of the cheiromys.
Gratiolet, going farther, classed the lemurs in the insectivora. The
origin of the insectivora besides, is by no means irreconcilable with that
of the marsupials. The primitive type of these was the insectivore of
the trassicand jurassic periods. The phalangers are an existing species.
We must seek in the fossil species the true origin of the lemurs, since
these appeared in the eocene or beyond. The Jastrelation to point out
is that with the ungulates, according to the eminent professor of the
Museum, M. Albert Gaudry, whose work on the placoid and ganoid
fishes and the amphibious labyrinthodonts deserves attention. ‘I
have asked myself,” said he, in his Tertiary Fossils, ‘if the lemurs
had not a common origin with many of the extinct pachyderms.” The
resemblances between the present lemurs and the ungulates, proven by
Alphonse Milne Edwards and Grandidier in their great work on Mad-
agascar, leads to that belief.

Two genera bear out this idea. The first is the genus adapis, of which
a Parisian species, coming from the gypsum beds of the upper eocene
of Montmartre, has been classed by Cuvier among the pachyderms; but
itis found, judging from the teeth, the skull, and some parts of the limbs
to be but a lemur. The second is the aphelotherium, classed by Gervais,
likewise withthe pachydermsand at present recognized asalemur. The
resemblance holds good with the eocene species of the stock of the pres-
ent perissodactyls, such as the ale the lophiotherium and
the pachynolopus.

In the United States, oe Cope has discovered many species of
adapis and confirmed these resemblances. It is always well to remark
that the genealogy leading up to man is outside of the question. Mr.
Cope divides the fossil lemurs of America into three families ; the anap-
tomorphus, which leads up by two branches, one to the monkeysand the
other to man, the mixodectins, the limits of which I am not able to state,

‘and the adapides, which lead to the ungulates. The branch of adapis
is therefore, according to Cope, foreign to the branch leading to man.

II.—MONKEYS.

The more I study this question, the more | am convinced that the an-
thropoids should be re-united to the accepted monkeys, of which they
are only a higher family ; 1 am more persuaded that they are more sep-
arated from man, as I do not yield to the belief of a certain school in
taking a purely morphologic point of view. As to the physiological, or
676 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

rather the intellectual point of view, it is not to be discussed for a
moment.

The principal classifications of the primates are as follows: Cuvier:
Two groups—manand the monkeys—the latter, under the name of quad-
rumana, divided into monkeys, makis, and oustitis, the first group em-
bracing those which are called the great monkeys or anthropoids.*

Broca’s latest way, which is but a variation of Linnzeus’s two groups:
Man and the united anthropoids; the monkeys, those of the Old World,
or pitheci, and those of the New World, or cebians.

Huxley’s last way: Three groups, man, the monkeys, and the lemurs.
The monkeys are divided into catarrhine, platyrrhine, and arctopithe-
cine. The catarrhines are subdivided into anthropomorphs and eyno-
morphs. :

Vogt, in his work entitled ‘‘Mammals:” First group, man, which we
place here for sake of completeness, but who is not treated of; second
group, the monkeys of the Old World, divided into the anthropomorphs
without tails and monkeys with tails; third group, the monkeys of the
New World, divided into platyrrhines and arctopitheci; fourth group,
the lemurs or pro simians.

It follows therefore (with but the exception of Broca) that all agree
in uniting the great monkeys or anthropoids to the common monkeys
under the term monkeys or catarrhine monkeys, or monkeys of the Old
World, and that Huxley and Vogt (whom no one would suspect of
revolutionary theories, I was on the point of saying,) think as Cuvier.
Is Broeca as isolated as I have affirmed? I mention here that Broca
never formulated his division as have the foregoing, but that it is the in-
contestable result of his teaching here, and especially of that of his last
years. This fact seemed so apparent that I was compelled to express
it in a table in my Elements of General Anthropology, appearing in 1885,
to make evident the resemblance of his classification to that of Linneus.
Hervé and Hovelacque, who were in possession of notes taken at the
course of Broca, so understood it and have re-produced it with some ad-
ditions to complete it in their “Summary of. Anthropology” (Précis
W@ Anthropologie), appearing in 1887. Would Broca have put it intoa
table rashly,as Hervé and Hovelacque and I have done, specifying that
he treated only of physical man? I can not say. One phrase of his
memoir of 1870, on the order of primates (page 83), where he qualifies
the uniting of man and the anthropoids in the same group as extrava-
gant, bears out this idea. I imagine he would have said, ‘Certainly
this table is correct, but it is only one See of the question.”

* Gre ier “ds ided the Aged mentee tis three groups: The ees or Gearon:
which have four straight incisors in each jaw and flat nails (nails properly so called)
‘on all the fingers; the makis or quadrumana, which have in either jaw incisors in
number other than four or of other shape and the nails flat on all the fingers except
the little finger, armed with a pointed and turned-up nail (a claw), and the ouistitis
or doubtful quadrumana, thouch he ranges them in the first group, The makis are
our lemurs,

THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 677

However that may be, the classification that I attribute, right or
wrong, to Broca is held to be his by many people, and against it I would
protest.

From my special studies and my knowledge of the differences (great
and little) from monkeys presented by man, drawn from the volume of
the brain, the cranial characters that are the consequence of it, the facial
characters that accompany them, and the characters of the skeleton that
are developed parallel with them,—that is to say, of all the characters
that I have specially studied, I am compelled to abandon the classifi-
cation of Linneus, and to adopt the abused one of Cuvier, in which, be-
sides, critics never have seriously reproached anything but the employ-
ment of the word quadrumana and the exact definition of the hand on
which he based it. Cuvier may not have been very much of a philoso-
pher, but he was the first of observers.

Let us consider for a moment the word quadrumana. When Broca
opposed the term quadrumana as applied to the monkeys to distinguish
them from two handed man he set forth the fact that the presence or ab-
sence of the thumb was not enough to authorize the name hand or foot,
bat in man the upper limbs accorded with the function of prehension,
to which the extremity of the limb is the immediate organ, but the
lower limbs are likewise constituted in view of the function of locomo-
tion and support, which its extremity seems intended to supply. Ina
word, there is harmony between every part everywhere, of which the
different details constitute the characteristics of the function, hand and
foot. This is extremely true, but with man only, who occupies the sum-
mit of the evolutionary series. It is far from the same when we de-
scend the course of the series.

Among the monkeys, the anterior limbs are still adapted to the func-
tion of prehension, but they are at the same time organs of locomotion;
the posterior limbs are still adapted for walking, but they are at the
same time organs of prehension. Among the lemurs, are still the same
general types of all the members for prehension and progression, but
in fact the anterior extremity is more a paw and the posterior more a
hand by comparison; as for example in the cheiromys. The monkeys
are both quadrupeds and quadrumana. Notice the three chief seg-
ments of each limb: forward it is an arm, but backward it 1s a true leg;
however, look only at the last segment both before and behind; it is a
hand by the principal characters of the free and opposable thumb and
the nails.

In man the harmony is perfect because the functions are specialized
and because the organs are all adapted in the same way, those for-
ward for prehension and those rearward for walking.

Beyond our branch of primates then, where its origin is seen, the
fore limbs appear with the same types but less definite, less precise,
all four for prehension, the forward ones more; all four for locomotion,
678 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

the hinder ones more. Following the marsupials, evolution commences,
specializations take place in different directions.

Among the galeopitheci and the cheiroptera, the particular adap-
tation works in the way of flight, one part or the whole limb is not only
transformed, but bends itself to the needs and obeys the calls upon it.

Among the ungulates, the adaptation works in the way of locomotion
by the four limbs, exclusively; gradually these mold themselves on
the same type, the useless bones disappear, or are fused together, cer-
tain superfluous movements cease in the ratio that others increase,
including the necessary corresponding anatomical arrangements. Here
Broca ought to have taken his model type of the locomotive limb, as
among man he possessed the model type of the prehensile limb.

Among the carnivora, that have to bound over the earth to catch
their prey while at the same time they must be able to seize, hold, and
rend it, the fore paws have remained perfect locomotive organs, but at
the same time, organs of attack by their claws, and organs of prehen-
sion to a certain extent,—particularly in the anterior extremities.

Among the monkeys an adaptation of another kind has taken place.
Those from whom they descend lived in the trees, ran on the branches;
they had need of increasing their power of prehension; they had to
clasp the rounded trunks of trees and catch the branches in passing
from one to the other. The adaptation appears to show in the posterior
members first; later in the anterior ones. The make-up of the limb
has not had to lose its own type on that account; it is enough that the
extremities are adapted in acertain way. The nails, the free oppos-
able thumb, the very movable fingers, are enough ; nature is contented
with that without mounting to the higher segment.

One fine day a revolution takes place. In the same way as an adap-
tation to an arboreal life has taken place at the expense of other prior
species, so an adaptation to terrestrial life occurred with an upright
attitude, favorable to a more extended vision, a diminution of the
olfactory sense and the facial prominence over which it presides, a
perfecting of touch, and above all intelligence. From that time all the
living forces of adaptation have tended towards the same end, the lower
thumb has ceased to be opposable, the other toes have decreased in
length, what the foot loses the hand gains; man was created exclusively
two handed above, exclusively two footed below, all the accessory
parts in the segments of the limbs agreeing with the types, which had
existed since the marsupials but less accentuated until then.

The little character of the opposable thumb brought out by Cuvier,
marks then perfectly that which is common and special among the
monkeys, the ability of clasping limbs of trees by the four extremities.
Without doubt he expressed but one of the particulars of that make-
up so perfect in man, who has given birth to the words hand and foot,
but itis an essential one. One does not know enough to deny however
that the second character necessary to the function of prehension, that

a)
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 679

is the great mobility in every way of the segments of the limb may not
be well developed among the monkeys in the lower limbs. Cuvier then
had a perfect right to call all monkeys quadrumana, although they
were at the same time quadrupeds, and to oppose them to man.

I unite then the anthropoids and the ordinary monkeys under the
name of monkeys, and I should not recoil before the synonym of quad-
rumana, if that of monkeys does not satisfy me.

The monkeys are divided into two groups, those of the Old World
called catarrhines, because they have the nasal septum narrow and
the nostrils opening below the nose (from zaza, below and px, nose), and
those of the New World called also platyrrhines, because they have the
septum of the nose wide, and the nostrils opening on the side (from
zhatos, flat). We will commence with the latter.

The monkeys of the New World are entirely arboreal; they are di-
vided into two families; the monkeys properly so called, and the arcto-
pitheci.

The first are divided into diurnal monkeys, embracing the howlers,
the ateles, the sajous, etc., and the nocturnal monkeys, embracing the
sagouins, the sakis, the nyctipitheei, and the saimiris.

The second family requires particular notice. The aretopitheci or hap-
alians are a separate group among the monkeys of which [have spoken,
from two considerations. They embrace the ouistiti (a charming little
monkey made illustrious by one of our novelists), and the tamarin.
They are arboreal as the preceding ones, and nocturnal like the latter.

The arctopitheci are an example of the imperfection of our means of
classification. They are monkeys and aze like the monkeys of America
in most of their affinities, but they lack the single character which dis-
tinguishes all monkeys including the lemurs, and they have neither
the dentition of the monkeys of America nor of the Old World. We
cut out the galeopitheci from the lemurs by the absence of the first
character; is it necessary to treat the arctopitheeci the same way with
regard to the monkeys ?

Here are their characters. When one seizes the skull in a way to
hide the lower part of the face, it is entirely an American monkey.
Like the monkeys of America 1t has a round head, a flat face, lateral
nostrils, and no rump callosities or cheek pouches. But it does not
have opposable thumbs on any of the limbs, which leaves out the only
character common to all the monkeys and false monkeys. Furthermore,
they have claws on all the fingers except the hinder thumb (the hallux)
which has a nail. The teeth number thirty-two, that is to say, the
count of the monkeys of the Old World and man, but with a different
formula; a small molar more and a large molar less. Furthermore,
their teeth have certain insectivorous characters; the lower canine is
small; their molars interlock a little as those of the insectivora, and
the front ones have sharp, conical points. The lower incisors of certain
species are pointed,
680 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

Cuvier hesitated to make them quadrumana. For our part we should
readily see here an introduction to the Primates, a kind of American
lemur, a transition from the insectivora to the monkeys of the New
World.

Fossil monkeys have been found in America. A most remarkable
thing is that all have thirty-six teeth, and agree with the types of that
continent, as if the platyrrhine monkeys had always lived there. The
highest among them is the laopithecus, which one should compare
with the anthropoids of our continent.

In short, one is led in America to a special series so constituted by
its origin and its termination, viz: many insectivora, arctopitheci,
nocturnal monkeys beginning with the saimiris, diurnal monkeys, and
the laopitheca, Vogt, Schmidt, and Cope, have agreed on this insec-
tivorous descent.

The monkeys of the Old World are less arboreal than those of the
New World, and are entirely diurnal. Most of them have rump callos-
ities and cheek pouches. Their teeth are in general less omnivorous
than those of man and tend by the canines to the carnivorous type;
they are also farther apart. They are divided into the great monkeys,
monkeys without tails, or the anthropoids, and monkeys with tails,
which are divided into semnopitheci, cercopitheci, and cynocephali.
The semnopitheci (from ceyvos, venerable) embrace the entelle, which
has received that name because it is sacred in India, and plays a part in
Aryan legends. It inhabits India, Indio-China, Borneo, and Java.
The colobe of Abyssinia and Guinea, completes the list. The cerco-
pitheci include the guenon, which is found only in Africa, the magot,
which inhabits Africa and appears even on the Rock of Gibraltar, and
the macaque, which has been observed at two points in Asia,—India,
and Japan. As for the eynocephali, they are the large dog-muzzled
monkeys of numerous species which inhabit almost all of Africa.

The monkeys of the Old World are related on the one hand to the
lemurs, and on the other to the ungulates.

The first relationship is openly maintained by Heckel, and by Cope.
Heckel rests entirely on the shape of their placenta, not a very con-
vineing proof. Mr. Cope depends chiefly on the conformation of the
teeth, which is a more solid argument. Huxley does not say that the
monkeys descended from the Jemurs, but his description leads us in
that direction. Vogt rejects that genealogy, as we have seen; Schmidt
does the same.

The second relationship (that with the ungulates) is entertained by
Gaudry, and is the consequence of the one which he has established
between the lemurs and the ungulates. There we had two genera, the
adapis and the aphelotherium, that establish the communication, the
point of junction being at the eocene origin of the perissodactyl branch
of the ungulates. Here we have as yet but one known genus, the
oreopithecus of Gervais, which by its dentition resembles the choero-
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. G81

potamus, belonging to the artiodactyl branch of the ungulates. In
review we have genera of ungulates, belonging to the same stock as the
suides or very close to it, which have marked resemblances to the mon-
keys; they are the cebochoerus (or pig monkey) of Gervais, the acoth-
erulum and the hyracotherium of Owen. It is worthy of remark here
that the ungulates, going on the one hand to the lemurs and on the
other to the monkeys, are all eocene, whilst the only real monkey lead-
ing to the ungulates is miocene. it is also worthy of remark that in
his general proof of the relation of the preceding species with the
ungulates, Gaudry did not separate the lemurs from the monkeys, as if
from a paleontological stand-point; in the ancient species the two
were tangled together.

Assuredly this is a slender basis upon which to establish the deriva-
tion of monkeys and ulteriorly of man from the ungulates. For all that,
the hypothesis has made some stir. Vogt seems disposed to accept it,
and Schmidt concludes that chapter in his book with these words: “The
monkeys have distinctly a double origin; the American branch has
had ancestors in the form of insectivores, the Euro-Asiatice branch,
including the anthropomorphs, ancestors in the form of pachyderms.
We are thus brought very close to the question of the pachydermal
origin of our primitive ancestors.”

Observe that the catarrhine monkeys are dispossessed of their affilia-
tion with the lemurs. I declare that I can not bring myself to accept the
idea. The lemurs are, according to my belief, the lowest of the prim-
ates, of the quadrumana, and as such, those which bear every prob-
ability of having produced the others.

I will indulge in asingle reflection. Iam an anatomist, a craniologist,
and it is far from me to throw any doubt on the great value of the
smallest morphologic character; but Lask myself if really, underneath
the particulars which may show the conformation of the teeth, the fin-
gers, and the toes of the tarsus and carpus, back of the characters
that reflect the precise kinds of alimentation and the precise way of
locomotion, there is not something more general answering to the spe-
cial habits, to the course of life or habitat more or less terrestrial, aquatic,
diurnal or nocturnal, that imprints on the make-up of the organism that
general appearance of relationship that the naturalist perceives over
and above all those special modes of adaptation that he studies with
so great care to find a testimony, an expression, a formula for the sup-
port of his thought,—of his vision, if | may so express myself. Clearly
a particular trait, a progressive variation of form, reflects the higher
kind of influence to which I allude. The teeth, the condyle of the jaw
and its articular cavity, the temporal fosse give very exactly the diet
of the animal and consequently certain of its habits. The patagium of
which we have seen the first traces among the marsupial petaurites
allows us to establish a series leading to the bats by way of the galeo-
pitheci. I have shown you that the genealogy of the perissodactyls,
682 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

one of the most satisfactory that science has yet established, rests essen-
tially on a single character, the number and degree of atropy of the fin-
gers or toes.

Is the form of this chosen characteristic, all? Has not nature different
ways of attaining the same end, and cannot she divide her influence over
the make-up of the organism without making any characters particularly
distinctive, and even at the same time leaving present characters in
appearance contradictory? Mice are known entirely by their way of
progression, head, and general form; nevertheless, they are found under
different names among the aplacentals and the placentals, among the
rodents and among the insectivores, terrestrial, semi-aquatic, semi-flying,
or flying altogether. It is the same with the genus squirrel; they are
scattered in many orders under names simply modified in certain par-
ticulars. There is among the marsupials a type of remarkable leaping
animals, which, while entirely preserving that type, are dispersed in
different placentary orders, because they have acquired new characters.

Lask then, if the peculiar ways of the monkeys, if their habitat, which
is exclusively arboreal among their better defined representatives, and
which impresses a stamp on their entire individuality, the proportions
of the body, the extent and situation of the articulating surfaces, the
freeness of movement by means of segments one over the other, is not
a sufficient incitement to establish their relationship to the lemurs and
not at all with the ungulates. In the same way as the lemurs, which
live a similar life, lead to certain marsupials, so these also dwell con-
stantly in the trees. Between the ungulates and the monkeys I see
nothing in common. I can not understand an animal with hoofs walk-
ing on the end of the digital extremity alone, having the metatarsals
co-ossified, drawn out and raised, the fore limbs drawn close to the
body and moving almost in the same parallel plane; that is to say,
adapted to a measured and rythmic terrestrial locomotion, giving birth
to a plantigrade animal with nails, with movable fingers made so by
being molded upon the trees in grasping the branches, with limbs
endowed with the most dissimilar movements of abduction and addue-
tion; whereas it does not require any effort of imagination to conceive
an adaptation already commenced in that way among the lemurs and
having but to be continued and more specialized among the monkeys.

Before starting on the relationship of the monkeys of the Old World
with man we must look into another question. We have verified an
intrinsic ascending series; do we find a similar one among the monkeys
of the New World?

Two stages of evolution appear at the start, one that relates to the
tailed or ordinary monkeys, and the other which takes in the four
catarrhine monkeys without tails or anthropoids. The latter show two
degrees, the one for the gorilla, the chimpanzee, and the orang; the
other for the gibbon, which is the transition shown between them and
the tailless monkeys, more particularly the semnopitheci. With the
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 683

four it is necessary to class two fossil anthropoids, the Pliopithecus
antiquus, noted in 1837, by E. Lartet in the miocene of Sansan (Gers),
an animal probably near to the gibbon, and the Dryopithecus fontani,
found by Fontan in the miocene of St. Gandens (Haute Garonne), which
is incontestably an anthropoid, but different from the present anthro-
poids. I have not included the laopithecus, an American monkey, which
would be the third fossil anthropoid known. One ean also give as a
proof of evolution in the monkey group the Mesopithecus pentilici of
which Gaudry has unearthed the fragments of twenty-five individuals
in the miocene of Pikermi, Greece. It does not belong in any of the
present genera, but approaches in its skull the semnopitheci, and the
macaque in its limbs. One can believe then that, it is an ancestor of
both by a kind of doubling of type like that which was produced in a
large number of marsupial types.

Vogt, in spite of himself, gives an argument in favor of this internal
evolution. In the arboreal life of monkeys there is gradation; the
moukeys of America and the semnopitheci never leave the trees; the
magots often set foot en earth and would be semi-arboreal; the ma-
eaques anil eynocephali are terrestrial. Now is it not permissible to
believe, seeing their perfect adaptation to life in the trees that the
magots and with much stronger reason—the macaques and cynocephali
correspond with an original effort in a new line, a way which continued,
we can conceive would cause them to grow straight or to have an inter-
mittently oblique attitude, and thus be helped to new adaptations.

Finally, Gratiolet, at a period when he could scarcely have thought
of the doctrine of evolution which was about to spread over the world,
and which at all events would have been repugnant to his religious
sentiments, put forth the idea of parallel series among the monkeys of
our continent; for example, the semnopitheci, proper to southern Asia
and the neighboring islands, leading to the gibbon and orang in the
same region, particularly in the southeast; of the macaque and magot
leading to the chimpanzee; and above all of the cynocephalus leading
to the gorilla. Uneconsciously Gratiolet prepared the doctrine of the
derivation of man from the monkey, siding with the polygenistic ideas
then in favor in the school of anti-orthodoxy.

This now leads us to our last genealogical stage, to the passage from
the monkey to man.

IIT.—MAN.

I will set forth on this point the principal opinions that are current,
or which can be maintained.

The first is that of the learned: professor of Jena, Heckel. He is
monogenistic as to man, as he is monophyletic concerning each of the
branches and branchlets of his genealogical tree. The tailless monkeys
of the Old World constitute his nineteenth stage above the monera.
He divides them into four branches. The fourth is the anthropoids,
divided into two branches, an African and an Asiatic; the latter he
684 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

divides into three. The third division gives us the pithecanthropus or
man-monkey, which already holds itself upright, but which lacks
speech; this is the twenty-first stage, the anthropopithecus of M. de
Mortillet, out of which present man is derived by two branches, the
twenty-second and last step of Heckel, one the negroes with wooly
hair, and the other the races with straight hair, of which the Austra-
lian would be the prototype. On the chart of the world that Heckel
gives, the place where man would have taken rise by the acquisition of
articulate language is put at the the southwest of India, where the
center of the continent of Lemuria of which we have spoken would
have been. The place is marked Paradise; it is the starting point
from which man should have spread in all directions, some to the west
towards Africa, others to the east towards Australasia and Melanesia,
and others to the north towards Europe, Asia, and by Bering’s Strait
into America.

Huxley does not express his opinion on the immediate descent of
man in any of his writings that I have read; he lets the reader draw
the conclusions from the developments into which he enters, and these
lead to an origin from the anthropoids.

Our eminent paleontologist of the Museum, Professor Gaudry, is
also very reserved; nevertheless he will allow us to surmise his opinion
where he has not plainly formulated it. On our authority, the follow-
ing series expresses-his entire thought concerning the mammals: Mar-
supials, ungulates, lemurs, and catarrbines forming a single group,
anthropoids, and man. The anthropoid that he points out is the dry-
opithecus. Were is what he says: “The dryopithecus was a monkey
of a high order; it resembled man in many particulars; its height
must have been nearly the same; in its dentition it recalls the char-
acters of the teeth of the Australian.” (Fossil Primates, page 236.)
Further on he adds: “If then it comes to be proven that the chalk
flints of Beauce, discovered at Thenay by the Abbe Bourgeois, have
been dressed, the most natural idea that presents itself to my mind
would be that they have been worked by the dryopithecus (page 241).
Unfortunately we possess but a lower jaw and a humerus of this
animal.”

Another paleontologist, the American Professor, Cope, has an opin-
ion of his own. Man did not descend from monkeys, anthropoids, or
the rest; he descended directly from the lemurs. We have already
said that the condylarthri, the original stock of almost all the orders
of mammals, gave birth notably to a branch that was divided into
three; one was principally represented by the genus anaptomorphus,
and was divided in its turn into two twigs, one of which produced the
monkeys and anthropoids, and the other which lead directly to man.
Here are his principal reasons. They show us on what slender basis
our genealogies sometimes rest.

Man has, as a general rule, four tubercles or cusps on the upper
molars. The monkeys and the anthropoids have in general five tuber-
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 685

cles. The present lemurs, the fossil necrolemur, and the anaphtomor-
phus have in general three tubercles. But in man three tubercles
have been noticed ; Cope has published a long list of their degrees of
frequency among the races. It is a reversion towards the lemurs, and
not towards the monkeys and anthropoids.

The present opinion of Vogt is radically different; but as the learned
professor of Geneva has held at different times opinions almost diamet-
rically opposed and: has played an important part in the question, we
will stop longer with him. His first way of looking at it was formulated
in his course of 1862-64, before Darwin had formally applied to man his
doctrine of the derivation of species one from the other by the mechan-
ism of selection, and before Heckel had completed his course of 1867-
68, in which he showed for the first time his complete genealogical tree.
His second opinion is known to me by his magnificent book on the Mam-
mals, appearing in 1883 in France.

First opinion: ‘ Shall we admit scientifically the origin of the type
of man from that of the monkey?” says Vogt cn page 617 of his ‘* Lee-
tureson Man.” ‘I have put before your eyes ail the material known up
to the present able to contribute to the knowledge of the bridge which
shall span the abyss separating man from the monkeys.” (I will give
the substance of his remarks): I have shown to you the three great
anthropomorphic monkeys on the one hand and the lower human races
on the other forming uninterrupted series; the most ancient cranial
forms approach to the simian type; furthermore the brain of a micro-
cephal re-produces, as if for our instruction, that which should be the
primitive brain, intermediate between that of man and that of the
monkeys - - - the descent of man from the monkeys by derivation.
But it does not follow that the descent operated in a single way. It
has secondary types among the human races as it has them among
the monkeys; but prolong the parallel series of Gratiolet and we have
the multiple stocks of man.

Here is Vogt’s textual conelusion: ‘*The summary of these facts far
from indicating a common stock, a unique intermediate form between
monkey and man, shows us on the contrary numerous parallel series
which must have developed (more or less circumscribed) from as many
parallel series of monkeys” (page 626),

Second opinion: Less clear to my mind than the first. On the one
hand Vogt maintains his former ideas of the polygenistic simian descent,
on the other hand he reverses them by formally denying that man de-
scended fromthe monkey. The following will better show the inciting
causes which preceded his conclusion.

The monkeys to-day as in the Miocene and Pliocene epochs have
always been settled in tropical climates, and are essentially arboreal ;
they leap from branch to branch and do not go far afield,—even those
that are terricoles and clamber over the rocks. Between the monkeys
of the Old and New Worlds the separation has been complete through
686 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

all time ; the two hemispheres have not been united since the Miocene
at least, perhaps since the Hocene; the monkeys which cannot live in
cold countries would be very wary of approaching Bering’s Straits.
The monkeys are little modified then throughout the Old World where
they are more arboreal. Since the Miocene, one recognizes among them
types high as the laopithecus of America and the dryopithecus of Europe;
they have not evolved since. Theexample of the mesopithecus of Gaudry
is the only one which we can cite in favor of any evolution whatever.

Nevertheless Vogt speaks here of a tendency toward a superior or-
ganization like that of man, of a similarity that is produced in different
ways; the gorilla resembles man more in its limbs, the orang in its
brain and the chimpanzee in its skull and teeth. ‘ No fact,” says he,
“ will permit us to admit of an unique line of evoiution toward the hu-
man organization.” Unique, perhaps! but what if multiple? Tor it
would always be a descent from monkeys.

Passing then to the fossil species more particularly, Vogt insists on his
proposition that there has not operated ‘any evolution of the simian type
through the geologic periods;” that we can not “signalize any progress
of that type since the time ef the Upper Miocene.” With the exception
of one argument of his which I reserve for another place, that is all.

Very well, [must say that I see nothing to lead me to that conclu-
sion. As I have shown just now that there is as much probability of an
evolution among monkeys as in any other zoological group. No series
of species leads, it is true, positively from any kind of monkey to any
kindof man, But in paleontology what they show asa series of species,
is usually but a series of characters. Now comparative anthropology
shows us a multitude of characters forming series, going from the
monkeys to man, by the way of or not of the anthropoids.

Vogt finishes with an argument which has a good deal of weight.
‘The infant monkey resembles man more than does the adult monkey,
age alone emphasizes their characteristic differences by the evolution of
the jaws, the cranial ridges ete.” And he thus concludes: “From all
these facts follows the conclusion that man can not be put into direct
generic relation either with the existing monkeys or with any known
fossil monkeys, but that both (man and monkey) have risen from a
common stock of which the characters show themselves in youth more
related to the stock than in the adult being.”

A priori, the latter argument of Vogt is very correct. Every-one has
remarked the contrast between the cranium of the young orang and the
adult orang, of the young gorilla and the adult gorilla. Its value rests
on the known principle of the parallelism of ontogeny and phylogeny
which may be expressed thus: The forms of the young subject re-produce
the forms that have existed among its ancestors and thus indicate their
relationship. In other words, the character in progress, or new,—that
which should relate a species to a following species, exists in the adult
at his highest degree, whilst the character which belongs to the ances-
tors descends to the infant, though it disappears in the adult; for ex-
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 687

ample, the exclusively pulmonary respiration in the adult salamander
and the branchial respiration in the young salamander.

But one should separate that which is produced after birth and which
is a matter of growth of the body, or of physiological development by
the course of age in the individual life, from that which is an ancestral
resemblance depending on embrylogy and intra-uterine ontogeny. In
the young man as in the young monkey the skull is rounded in every
sense, and smocth, being almost without asperities. The temporal
ridges and sagittal ridge (which Jatter is but the result of elevation
and pressure up against—causing ossification on the median line of the
former), are ridges developed with age, especially in the male sex, and
are proportionate with the strength of the muscles which are inserted
onthem. They reach considerable development among the monkeys in
the species which have powerfu] masticatory apparatus and enormous
temporal fossie.

The supercilliary arches bulge out in man with age as in the monkeys,
not taking so remarkable an aspect among the latter, because they have
a more ample frontal sinus; asecoudary character. The projecting jaw
in both only becomes marked with age. The human child has a small
orthognathous face, hidden under the skull, forming an enormous bowl
as in the orang; the face grows, elongates and becomes more progna-
thous partly by simple increase of volume, whilst the skull diminishes
relatively, partly because the molars of the second dentition have need
of room and push forward. Among the monkeys this feature is very
marked, but it has some distinctive characters in man.

Later, I will sum up to show how the agreements between the base
of the skull and the base of the face follow the naso- basilar plane, chang-
ing proportionately in the adult compared with the child, the angles
that craniomentry brings out in that part. The facial angle cited, since
it enjoys a certain popularity, is greaterin the young monkey as in the
young of man. The infantile forms of the young monkey of which Vogt
speaks, recur in part in the adult woman. They characterize the same
way the male sex of certain races which writers have classed for that
reason as infantile, such as the Andamanese.

There is a character implied in the argument of Vogt that seems to
come very much to the support of his theory. It is that the young
monkey, the orang, or the chimpanzee, for example, is more intelligent
than the adult. Then ought not one to say that it has descended from
an ancestor more intelligent than the present monkeys? But, greater
intelligence is a rule among all young animals, as well as in man, if
circumstances are taken into account. At that time the brain is rela-
tively much larger than the body, it is virgin and every way more im-
pressionable, it increases excessively andonly asks that it absorb, that
it work up, that it put to profit the blood it receives. What is more
marvellous than the way our children learn to speak, write and read?
Are we adults capable of the burden of quick memory required for the
mass of words and ideas that they pick up at that time? Young Aus-

tralians are equal to Europeans in the schools, they acquire language
with an extraordinary facility ; but the period comes, their savage na-
ture returns, they drop their clothes, rejoin their kind and manifest no
more intelligence than if they had never been among the whites. If at
our age we appear so capacious, intellectually speaking, it is that we
have accumulated for numerous years, that we reason from habit, in
great measure automatically ; we are constantly excited by the strug-
gle for existence, by the society of our equals, by the use of language
which the monkeys do not possess.

The last argument of Vogt, that the young monkey is more human
than the adult, does not therefore convince me.

I have indicated the different current opinions, positive and negative,
on the derivation of man. Are there not others, possible ?

Although I have addressed many objections to Vogt, the very remark-
able uncertainty on the part of a man who does not fear habitually to
deliver himself, makes me reflect. I ask first what should be that com-
mon stock of the monkeys and man of which he speaks, and which is not
the lemurs (Cope’s theory)? Although Vogt leaves his reader in sus-
pense, it is easy to discover his tendency. That stock started from
some point inthe ungulates. But if itis legitimate when one considers
the present species the evolved extremities of the branch, it is less
when one ascends towards the trunk before the specialization of the
ungulates, particularly in that which concerns the four limbs, pushed
to the extreme in two different ways, among the equide and among
the ruminants. After that it must be said that nothing is impossible
in nature, but the less probable things, when one sees their work, are
attained by the most unforeseen processes and the veriest by-ways,
That which selection by the hand of man gave to pigeons, a question
so well studied by Darwin, is done again in nature by the hand of
chance, the laws and mechanism of which escape us, and which we
eall by that name for just that reason.

There is an objection to the descent of man from the monkey that I
have made, and which goes to the support of Vogt’s thesis. As I have
said previously, the primordial type of mammifers—( which it is needless
here to separate into placental and aplacental, all the placentals have
certainly been aplacentals at their origin and the transition was pro-
duced insensibly without geology being able to establish at what time
this form is aplacental and that analogous one placental)—the primitive
type, I say, is with four limbs having already much that one ean recog-
nize, their destination already written, the four set apart for locomo-
tion, but the anterior ones so as to serve moreover as organs of prehen-
sion and the posterior ones so as to serve essentially as organs of support
and locomotion. This double specialization goes back to the reptiles, not
to speak of the dinosaurs, among which itis so marked. Some amphib
ians show traces of it. Among the most ancient mammals known inall
their parts,as the Phenacodus primevus of the Lower Eocene of the Ter-
tiary of Wyoming Territory, in the United States, the fore limb is well
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 689

marked as an organ of prehension and the hind limb as an organ of
travel. In the first the humerus articulates within a narrow glenoid
fossa at the upper external angle of the scapula in such a manner as to
permit the most extensive movements in divers ways, the radius is
movable over the ulna, around which it accomplishes the turning move-
ment made necessary by the function of the hand ; the five fingers are
free, the thumb is more turned on its axis to admit of opposition ; the
hand is continued on a straight line with the fore-arm. In the leg the
femur, as with us, is united to a massive pelvis; the articular surfaces
of the knee, the knee-cap, the two immovable bones of the leg are
entirely such as arise from the function of locomotion exclusively; the
foot is plantigrade, with salient heel, with digits close together, and it is
articulated perpendicularly by its arch to the leg,asin man. In another
contemporaneous animal and of the same deposit, the coryphodon, (of
which I can only judge by the foot and hand figured, but entire,) these
two organs show more resemblance, the foot looks a little like a hand,
but there is nevertheless a differentiation. But in man that specializa-
tion or differentiation has attained its maximum; no other animal is
found in the same rank. Among the birds the upper limb has become
a wing, a function of locomotion. In man alone the upper limb is
exclusively a hand, the lower limb combines in itself all the locomotive
function that it divided formerly within certain limits with the anterior,
but which nevertheless always retained its essential attribute. It
seems then that man should be the direct continuation of the first
Eocene mammals, if not of the marsupials which preceded them, the
completion of a type begun, and it seems scarcely logical that his trans-
formation should be accomplished at the expense of a branch that
seems collateral. The monkeys are produced by the facet of the adapt-
ation of the lower limb to an arboreal life; the upper limb remained
as it was; it is a deviation of the axis of evolution, in some way, a devi-
ation from the primitive type. On the one hand the ungulates are
detached from the primitive type by a metamorphosis of the anterior
limb designed for prehension, into a limb designed for running, and by
a harmonious perfection of the four limbs in the same way; on the
other the carnivores, whose four extremities, also the teeth, the jaw,
and the entire skull put themselves into harmony with the needs to
which they are subject and the mode of life and diet adopted ; also the
monkeys, who avoid the earth usurped partly by the swift herbivores,
partly by the sanguinary carnivores, are refugees in the trees, where
nevertheless they have prospered ; they are supported there and ¢on-
sequently they have appropriated their extremities to that special life.
Man being born from the monkeys by the disappearance of the acci-
dental adaptation of the hinder limb to the function normally belonging
to the fore limb, that is to say, returning to their primitive archi-
ancestral type, such a thing would appear strange! Assuredly such a
thing may be; for nature, as I have said, does not take the shortest
road. From the carnivora, which are terrestrial animals, have descended

690 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

in remote times a multitude of animals with fins called the pinnipeds.
By a retrogression the latter have seen their limbs atrophy, come close
to the body in the form of a paddle, and play the part of fins. But the
most probable is generally the simplest. This bend in the road that
would have determined the evolution of man, or rather of one of his
precursors, is useless. It seems more rational to conceive of the per-
fect biped and biman type descending from a type that we have seen
already sketched in the Eocene times and constituting the fundamental
original type of the mammals. It would have been necessary then to
consider the branch of the monkeys as a collateral branch in which evo-
lution would not have surpassed that which the present and fossil an-
thropoids show us.

This hypothesis would resolve certain difficulties which seem unsur-
mountable in anthropology. The most inferior human races known to
us are so near to the superior races in contrast to the distance which
separates them from the monkeys, that we can consider the different
men as forming an entirely relatively homogeneous, uniform species as
M. de Quatrefages maintains. The most ancient human race, that of
Neanderthal, is in the same position, whatever they say of it. His cra-
nial capacity, that is to say, that feature which really characterizes man,
is indeed considerable and higher than the most inferior of the present
human races, such as the Australians. Between the lowest mean of the
vapacity of the skull of the human races, which I fix at 1100 cubie centi-
meters in round numbers, and the mean of the highest anthropoid spe-
cies, which I put at 530 cubic centimeters,* the distance is prodigious

y F rom a the aueniete eniguies fora ee fo bei ae con all fe Seoul capaci-
ties utilizable in the series of the vertebrates, in dwelling on the two limits of the
series, I have made out for the latter two schematic tables showing the differences that
are presented; first, the general means of man and the anthropoids (Gibbons left
out); second, their particular means, the lowest in the human races, the highest
among the anthropoids; third, the extreme individual cases, the weakest normal in
man, the strongest in the anthropoids. Combining these two tables, that is to say,
associating the products furnished by the weight with that furnished by the capacity.
1 then drew up a third schematic table which gives me an intermediate value, that I
have designated under the name of cerebral volume.

Here are the results:

(1) The distance between the general mean of humanity and the general mean of
the anthropoids (Gibbon always excepted) is 70 to 100 of the first of these means ; or
the mean normal brain of man is two and one-half times larger than the mean brain
of the anthropoids.

(2) The distance from man to the anthropoid in the general means being taken as
100, the distance between the particular means, the lowest observed in the human
races and highest found in the three genera of anthropoids is 48, and the distance be-
tween the extreme individual cases the closest on the one side and the other is 26.

It is evident that gradually as new material is gathered these figures may vary and
that being an intermediate value between two different data, the one expressed in
grammes and the other in Gubic centimeters hence they have not an absolute value.
But such as they are they permit us to associate the data which, separate are frequently
insufiicient, and throw clearly into relief that gulf that at the present time separates
man and the anthropoids (Orang, Chimpanzee, and Gorilla),
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 69L

when one compares it to the trifling mean differences, one notices be-
tween the species, genera, families, and orders of animals coming after,
and aiso when one takes into account the comparison of this volume of
the brain with that of the body. In order that this cerebral transfor-
mation should be accomplished it has required an unheard of time,
defying all our conjectures.

Pliocene man has probably been found in America. Miocene man is
incontestable, though we have not been able to prove it clearly. But.
in the miocene the monkeys are seen for the first time with their pres-
ent characters. Man would then have established himself since their
appearance. Would evolution have chosen an animal whose posterior
member was organized for an arboreal life, was at the same time
foot and hand, when by the side of and existing prior to it were ani-
mals whose organization presented part of the wished-for characters ?
It is scarcely probable, and considering (I repeat), the number of inter-
mediate species which have been necessary before arriving to the pres-
ent constitution of our brain, it seems probable that the introduction
of man‘had taken place sooner in the eocene epoch by means of one of
the condylarthres having already the principal morphlogical characters
of man, those relating to the brain excepted, that Cope shows us served
as intermediary to the marsupials and the most of the present mammals.
There the differentiations were made according with the different modes
of life, which have given on one side, the branch of the ungulates, the
branch of the carnivores and many others that have disappeared with-
out founding a stock, on the other side, the branch of the quadrumana,
and the human branch.

The human type, that is the cerebral type before culminating in the
astonishing development which we perceive and beside which all the
rest is but accessory had then a proper stock, a stock that had been
the most central continuation of the general primitive trunk of the
mammals! In the present state of science they usually compare the
make up of the mammals to a tree ramified into numerous main branches,
each of these terminating in efflorescences higher in growth. These
are our better specialized groups, viz: the equidie and the ruminantia
among the ungulates, the lion or the dog among the carnivores, ete.
In the new system, the comparison with a growing tree of which the
central axis sends out the lateral branches would be more correct, the
central stock continues to elevate itself as the Lombardy poplar, and
bears at its summit, man.

IV.—CONCLUSION.

We have examined the genealogy proposed by Heckel, and the sys-
tems proposed to replace it. Whether the vertebrates have had for
their starting point a worm with a soft body destitute of a skeleton, or
on the contrary, a crustacean possessing an entirely exterior skeleton,
we have previously concluded that our genealogy has passed by the ga-
noid fishes to join with those galled by paleontologists labyrinthodonts,
692 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

which I have often designated by the name of middle vertebrates. There
the current has carried us along not in the direction of the mammals,
which however already appeared in the triassic epoch, but plainly to
the kingdom of the reptiles where we have to deal with the dinosaurian
origin of the monotremes or of some analogous group. We have found
the placental marsupials (designated by us under the name of con-
firmed proto-mammals), and we have shown whence with certain prox-
imate reservations (the whales for instance), all the present placental
mammals have issued, and consequently our race. But here the prob-
lem is complicated. Until that point, our origin appeared clear—save at
the very origin of mammals. The lemurs are already a cause of embar-
rassment. On the immediate descent of man, the uncertainties in-
crease, Many opinions each expressed by illustrious authorities are
before us; sometimes making objection, sometimes making confirmatory
arguments.

There are only two doctrines to consider; one that makes man come
from the primary trunk of the mammals in a direct line and without
intermediate orders, not from a mathematical point, but from that
confused mass succeeding the marsupials in which the differentiations
are undecided and tend toward the ungulates, or toward man; the
other which accepts the branch or order of the primates with all its
consequences, the lemurs or pro-simians at the base, the monkeys or
simians following, and man all alone at the summit.

After a careful balancing of the two, I confess that I incline toward
the latter solution, and conclude for our descent from the monkey. In
my mind one consideration out-ranks all others. The type of cerebral
convolutions among all primates where it is well characterized in its
ascending evolution, is that of man; it varies from the cebian, to
the pithecus, from the latter to the anthropoid, and from it to man,
only in degree.* The extreme development of the simian type of con-
volutions and the abrupt increase of the volume of the brain in going
from the anthropoid to man on which I have laid so much stress are
the two fundamental anatomical characters of man, histological exam-
ination being left out of consideration.t

If on the one hand we find as details that the foot of munkeys has
a thumb more or less opposable; that the latter should be more or less
es to their arboreal life; that it might seem strange to us that

* See P. Broca, ‘‘Anatomie comparée des hgpanealeane eérébrales. 2 ae D Me
thropologie, 1878, page 385.

t According to M. Chudzinski, so competent on this subject, not only the type of
the convolutions but to an equal degree the muscular and visceral anomalies show-
ing themselves in man plead in favor of simian descent. Certain muscular anomalies
give likewise a reversion towards the state of climbers or tree dwellers (see Chud-
zinski’s memoir in the Ievue d’ Anthropologie, ‘On the muscular and visceral varia-
tions among the races” and in the bulletins of the Societe’ d’Anthropologie, “An
anomaly observed in the Orang).” See also his great work crowned by the Institute,
‘On the comparative anatomy of the convolutions,” that appeared in 1878 and of
which the Rerue q’ Anthropalogie has given a review in the volume of 1879, page 707,
THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN. 693

the human line after having seen its foot partly transformed should take
again the original foot of its remoter ancestors ; on the other hand, we
have the details of the cranial and facial characters that result in man
from the great volume of his brain, the atrophy of the nasal fosse and
of their numerous posterior cayities (posterior nares) which has led to
the disappearance of the muzzle, the perfection (in compensation) of
touch and sight, which with the modifications that necessitated the
equilibrium of the skull, have raised him up to the bipedal attitude, and
have thus evolved an entirely new series of differential characters.
That which rules all is the already human cerebral type, but in a rudi-
mentary state among the monkeys, as it is the same type, amplified and
perfected in man. .

All the organs, foot, hand, teeth, thorax, pelvis, and digestive tract,
evolved among the mammals, have been transformed capriciously, have
taken different ways, and are specialized in different senses, sometimes
in the same line. One only remained stationary, or little varied; that
is the brain, exceptin man. In him or one of his ancestors among the
primates it has taken its rise, it has grown and developed, bending
everything to its needs, subordinating everything to its own life, the
skull, the face, the whole body, putting on everthing its imprint. The
fish swims, the ruminant browses, the carnivore seeks his prey, the
monkey is arboreal, man thinks. Everything in him gravitates around
that characteristic. The philosopher has said truly: ‘ Man is an intel-
ligence served by organs.”

We have descended then from the monkeys, or at least everything
appears as if we had descended from them. From what monkey known
or unknown? Ido not know; no one of the present Anthropoids has
assuredly been our ancestor. From several monkeys or a single one?
I do not know; and also do not know yet if I am monogenistie or poly-
genistic. In the study of the human races I see arguments for and
against both systems. Until further knowledge is arrived at, we must
reserve our opinion.

. We must see what arguments comparative craniology will bring in
favor of or against this or that genealogy. At that time alone will we
be permitted to determine on the place that anthropology gives to man
in nature. Whatever may be the result arrived at, that place—believe
me—will be as enviable as you could desire. At the origin, towards
the beginning of the Miocene perhaps, monkey and man were but one;
a division takes place, the fissure has grown, has become a crevasse;
later an abyss, with talus more and more scarped, like the canons of the
Colorado ;—an abyss which our friend, Abel Hovelacque, does not wish
to see, but that Messrs. Vogt and Huxley (little suspected of orthodoxy)
admit ;—an abyss that widens every day under our eyes, though permit-
ting still the recovery of those lost paths going from one side to the other,
(of which Huxley speaks in his preface to his book on ‘The Place of Man
in Nature,”) but which sooner or later will become impassable by the
694 THE LAST STEPS IN THE GENEALOGY OF MAN.

disappearance on the one hand of the last of the present anthropoids,
and on the other of the lowest human races, and will leave man isolated
and majestic, proclaiming himself with pride the king of creation.

Let us not blush then for our ancestors; we have been monkeys, as
those formerly have been reptiles, fish, nay worms or crustaceans.
Butit was along time ago, and we have grown ;—evolution I say has been
very prodigal of its favors in the struggle for existence, she has given
all the advantages to us. Our rivals of yesterday are at our mercy, we
let those perish that displease us, we create new species of which we
have need. We reign over the whole planet, fashioning things to our
will, piercing the isthmus, exploiting the seas, searching the air, an-
nulling distance, wringing from the earth her secular secrets. Our
aspirations, our thoughts, our actions have no bounds. Everything
pivots around us. What is there to desire more? That the future will
perhaps reveal. Evolution has not said its last word,

THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

By HERBER? B. ADAms, Pu. D.

This is an era of educational endowment upon a generous seale. A
recently published report of Col. N. H.R. Dawson, Commissioner of
Edueation, shows that the sum total of noteworthy educational gifts
during the year 1886~87, was nearly $5,000,000. More than two thirds
of the entire amount were distributed among nine institutions, four of
them collegiate, one academic, three professional, and one technical.
The institution most highly favored was Harvard University, which
received from individual sources nearly $1,000,000. From one man
caine a legacy ot $630,000. Haverford College, supported by the Society
of Friends, received $700,000 in one bequest. Of tlie two hundred and
nine gifts recorded by the Commissioner of Education, twenty-five
represent $50,000 or more; seventy-two were sums between $5,000 and
$49,000; and one hundred and twelve were suns less than $5,000. The
most striking fact in all this record of philanthropy is that such a large
proportion of the entire amount, fully two-thirds, was given to higher
education. The year 1888 is richer than 1887 in individual bounty to
institutions of learning. Nearly ten millions were given by three per-
sons for the encouragement of manual training, but there are rumors
of even larger benefactions for university endowment. The collective
returns for 1888 are not yet published, but it is certain that the past
year will surpass any hitherto recorded in the annals of American edu
cation.

Whatever forms modern philanthropy may take, one thing is certain,
universities are not likely to be forgotten. At the founding of the new
Catholic University in Washington, Bishop Spalding said that a univer-
sity “is an institution which, better than anything else, symbolizes the
aim and tendencies of modern life.’ Will not broad-minded people
recognize the truth of this statement and strengthen existing founda-
tions? Senator Hoar, at the laying of the corner-stone of the new Clark
University, said, ‘The university is the bright consummate flower of
democracy.” Will not American patriots cultivate endowments made

by the generosity of sons of the people? Are the noble gifts of Johns
Hopkins for the advancement of learning, and the relief of suffering,
likely to be forgotten by present or future generations? All history
testifies to the gradual up-building of universities by individual bene-
factions. The development of European and American colleges is one
long record of private philanthropy. Private philanthropy will do all it
can, but public interest demands that the State should do its part.
The encouragement of higher education by government aid, in one
form or another, has been a recognized principle of public policy in
every enlightened state, whether ancient or modern. Older than the
recognition of popular education as a public duty was the endowment
of colleges and universities at public expense for the education of men
who were to serve church or state. It is a mistake to think that the
foundation of institutions by princes or prelates was a purely private
matter. The money or the land always came from the people in one
form or another, and the benefit of endowment returned to the people
sooner or later. Popular education is the historic outgrowth of the
higher education in every civilized country, and those countries which
have done most for universities have the best schools for the people.
It is an error to suppose that endowment of the higher learning is con-
fined to Roman and German emperors, French and English kings.
Crowned and uncrowned republics have pursued the same public pol-
icy. Indeed, the liberality of government towards art and science
always increases with the progress of liberal ideas, even in monarchical
countries like Germany, where, since the introduction of parliamentary
government, appropriations for university education have greatly in-
creased. The total cost of maintaining the Prussian universities, as
shown by the reports of our Commissioner of Education is about
$2,000,000 a year. Only about 9 per cent. of this enormous outlay is
met by tuition fees. The state contributes all the rest in endowments
and appropriations. Prussia now gives to her universities more than
twice as much as she did before the Franco-Prussian war, as shown by
the report of our commissioner at the Paris Exposition in 1867. In
that year France gave her faculties of higher instruction only $765,764.
After the overthrow of the second empire, popular appropriations for
higher education greatly increased. The budget for 1888, shows that
France now appropriates for college and university faculties $2,330,000
a year, more than three times the amount granted under Louis Napo-
leon. Despotism is never so favorable to the highest interests of edu-
cation as is popular government. Louis XIv, and Frederick the Great,
according to the authority of Roscher, the political economist, regarded
universities, like custom-houses, as sources of revenue, for the main-
tenance of absolute forms of government. The world is growing
weary of royal munificence when exercised at the people’s expense,
with royal grants based upon popular benevolence and redounding to
the glory and profit of the prince rather than to the folk upholding his

throne. Since the introduetion of constitutional government into
European states, representatives of the people are taking the power of
educational endowment and subsidy into their own hands, and right
royally do they discharge their duty. ‘Fhe little Republic of Switzer-
land, with a population of only three millions, supports four state uni.
versities, having altogether more than three hundred instructors. Its
cantons, corresponding upon a small scale to our States, expend over
$300,000 a year upon the higher education. The federal government
of Switzerland appropriated, in 1887, $115,000 to the polytechnicum
and $56,000:in subsidies to eantonal schools, industrial and agricultural;
besides bestowing regularly $10,000 a year for the encouragement of
Swiss art. Theaggregate revenues of the colleges of Oxford, based
upon innumerable historic endowments, public and private, now amount:
to fully $2,000,000 a year. The income of the Cambridge college en-
dowments. amounts to quite as much. But all this, it may be said,
represents the policy of foreign lands. Let us look at home, and see
what is done in our own American commonwealths.

Maryland began, her educational history by paying a tobacco tax for’
the support of William and Mary College, in Virginia. This colonial!
generosity to another State has an historic parallel in the appropriation:
of a township of land by Vermont for the encouragement of Dartmouth
College in the State of New Hampshire, and in the corn that was sent.
from New Haven to the support of young Harvard. In colonial days
Maryland had her county schools, some of them classical, like King:
William’s School. at Annapolis. All were founded by authority of the:
colonial government and supported by aid from the public treasury...
The principle of state aid to higher education runs throughout the:
entire history of both State and colony.

The development of Maryland colleges began on the Eastern Shore:
In the year 1782, representatives.of Kent County presented’ a petition
to, the legislature, saying that they had a flourishing school at Ches-
tertown, their county seat, and wished to enlarge it into a college. The:
general assembly not only authorized the establishment of Washing:
ton College, which still exists, but in consideration of the fact that:
large sums of money had been subscribed for the institution by public-
spirited citizens of the Eastern Shore, resolved that ‘ such exertions for
the public. good merited the approbation of the legislature: and’ ought.
to,receive public encouragement and assistance.” These are the very
words of representatives of Maryland more than a century ago. Their
deeds were.even better than their words. They voted that £1,250) a
year shoud be paid from the peblic treasury for the support of Wash-
ington College. That vote was passed just after the conclusion of a
long war with England, when the State and indeed the whole country
lay impoverished. Toward raising this government subsidy for higher
education, the legislature granted all public receipts from marriage
licenses, from liquor licenses, fines for breaking the Sabbath, and alt
698 THE STATE AND. HIGHER EDUCATION.

similar fines and licenses that were likely to be constant sources of
revenue.

The founding of St. John’s College occurred two years later, in 1784.
This act by the State of Maryland was also in response to a local de-
mand. It was urged by the citizens of Annapolis that King Williams
School, although a classical institution, was inadequate to meet the
educational demands of the age. It was very properly added that the
Western Shore, as well as the Eastern, deserved to have a college; and so
St. John’s was established as the counterpoise of Washington College.
The legislative act is almost identical with that establishing the earlier
institution, although the appropriation was larger. The legislature
gave St. John’s 4 acres of good land for college grounds, and building
sites and an annual appropriation of £1,750 current money. This sum,
in the words of the original act, was to “be annually and forever here-
after given and granted as a donation by the public to the use of said
college on the Western Shore to be applied by the visitors and gov-
ernors of the said college for the payment of salaries to the principal,
professors, and tutors of said college.” The establishment was to be-
absolutely unsectarian. Students of any denomination were to be ad-
mitted without religious or civil tests. Not even compulsory attend-
ance upon college prayers was required so modern were the legisla-
tive fathers of Maryland.

The next step in the higher educational history of Maryland was the
federation of the two colleges into the University of Maryland. The
two boards of visitors and two representatives of each faculty consti-
tuted the University Convocation, presided over at Annapolis on com-
mencement day by the governor of the State, who was ex officio chan-
cellor of the University. One of the college presidents acted as vice-
chancellor. Thus more than a century ago Maryland inaugurated a
State system of higher education which, if it had been sustained, would
have given unity and vigor to her academic life. But unfortunately,
in 1794, the legislature yielded to county prejudices and withdrew £500
from the £1,250 annually granted to Washington College and began to
establish a fund, the income of which was distributed among various
county academies on both shores of the Chesapeake. This was the
origin of the subsidies still given in one form or another to secondary
institutions in the State of Maryland. In 1805, the remaining appro-
priation of £750 belonging to Washington College and the entire £1,750
thitherto granted to St. John’s College were withheld for the avowed
purpose of “disseminating learning in the different counties of the
State.”

For six years there was a famine in the land as regards the support of
higher education. At last in 1811, the legislature resumed appropriations
to St. John’s College. Realizing that it had misappropriated to local
uses subsidies “‘ granted annually forever” to St. John’s, the legislature
endeavored for many years to compromise by giving a smaller allowance.
THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 699

The cotirt of appeals ultimately decided in 1859 that such a re-adjastment
was a breach of contract, and that the college could collect what was due
it from the State. There is perhaps some excuse for the economy of
Maryland in its treatment of St. John’s College, namely, ‘hard times.”
A State that went through the financial crises of 1857 and 1857 without
repudiation deserves some historical credit. St. John’s College was sus-
pended during the civil war, but appropriations were renewed in 1866,
and have been continued, with slight variations, down to the present
day. The amount granted in 1888 was $3,000 for the institution itself
and $5,200 for boarding twenty-five students, one from each senatorial
district.

The first University of Maryland ceased to exist by the act of 1805,
which withheld appropriations from St. John’s College; but in the year
1812, a new University of Maryland was instituted by authority of the
State, in the city of Baltimore. The proceeds of a State lottery were
granted to the institution for a library, scientific apparatus, botanical
garden, ete. The corporation was to have a full equipment of four
faculties, representing the arts, law, medicine, and theology. Two
faculties of law and medicine still perpetuate the spirit of the founders
of the University of Maryland, and are honorable and distinguished
promoters of professional education. It cannot be said that they were
ever treated with adequate generosity, though they actually received
from State lotteries between $30,000 and $40,000, and were never taxed.

The present generation has not been so generous to the cause of higher
education as were the fathers of the State, but nevertheless Maryland,
in her entire history, has appropriated something over $650,000 for what
may be strictly called college education, not counting $60,000 given to
the State Agricultural College, nor $40,000 proceeding fiom State lot-
teries. While this collective bounty is small, it is money given by vol-
untary taxation and not taken from institutions of learning. Most of
the amount was raised in times when the State was poor or heavily in
debt, and when public money came with difficulty. Moreover this finan-
cial generosity of Maryland establishes the principle for which we are
contending, namely, that this State, like all other enlightened States in
the world, has recognized the duty of support to higher and unsectarian
institutions of learning. She has at different times appropriated $650, -
000 to colleges and to the University of Maryland from her public treas-
ury.

Let us now inquire what other States in the American Union have
done for higher education, always recognizing of course great inequality
in State population and in the taxable basis.

Virginia, whose earliest educational foundations Maryland helped to
lay by her tobacco tax, has expended upon colleges and university over
$2,000,000, during her history as a State, not counting the colonial
bounty to William and Mary. Since the war, Virginia has given her
university $40,000 a year. Before the war, she gave $15,000 a year,
700 THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

The original university-establishment cost the State about $400,000.
The people of Virginia are proud of their university, and it would be
suicide for any political party to cut off the yearly appropriation from
the institution founded by Thomas Jefferson. The State of South Caro.
lina was Jefferson’s model for generous appropriations to the cause of
sound learning. She has given $2,800,000 to that object. Georgia has
given $938,000 for the same purpose. Louisiana has given $794,000
from her State treasury for the higher education in recent years, and
according to the testimony of her own authorities, has distributed over
$2,000,000 among schools, academies, and colleges. Texas has spent
upon college education $382,000, and has given for higher education
2,250,000 acres of land. The educational foundations, both academic
and popular, in the Lone Star State, are among the richest in America.

Turning now to the Great West, we find that Michigan has given
over $2,000,000 to higher education, She supports a university which
is as conspicuous in the Northwest as the University of Virginia is in
the South, upon one-twentieth of a mill tax on every dollar of taxable
property in the State. That means half a cent on every hundred dol-
lars. This university tax-rate yielded last year $47,272. Wisconsin
pays one-eighth of a mill tax for her university, and that yields $74,000
per annum. Wisconsin has given for higher education $1,200,000.
Nebraska is even more generous to her State university. She grants
three-eighths of a mill tax, yielding about $60,000 a year. .The State of
California grants one-tenth of a mill tax, which yielded last year over
$76,000. Besides this, the University of California has a permanent
State endowment of $811,000, yielding an annual income of $52,000,
making a total of $128,000 which the State gives annually to its highest
institution of learning. Altogether California has expended upon
higher education $2,500,000. The State of Kansas, the central empire
of the Great West, gives already its rising university at Lawrence
$75,000 a year, “levied and collected in the same manner as are other
taxes.”

It is needless to give further illustrations of State aid to American
universities. These statistics have been carefully collected from origi-
nal documents by historical students, who are making important con-
tributions to American educational history, to be published by the
United States Bureau of Education. The principle of State aid to at
least one leading institution in each commonwealth is established in
every one of the Southern and Western States. In New England
Harvard, and Yale, and other foundations of higher learning appear
now to flourish upon individual endowments and private philanthropy ;
but almost every one of these collegiate institutions, at one time or
another, has received S‘ate aid. Harvard was really a State institution.
She inherited only £800 and three hundred and twenty books from
John Harvard. She was brought up in the arms of her Massachusetts
nurse, with the bottle always in her mouth. The towns were taxed in
ka

her interest, and every family paid its peck of corn to make, as it were,
hoe-cake for President Dunster and his faculty. Harvard College has
had more than $500,000 from the public treasury of Massachusetts.
Yale has had about $200,000 from the State of Connecticut. While
undoubtedly the most generous gifts have come to New England colleges
from private sources, yet every one of them, in time of emergency, has
come boldly before representatives of the people and stated the want.
They have always obtained State aid when it was needed. Last year
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology became somewhat embar-
rassed financially, and asked the legislature for $100,000. The institu-
tion got $200,000, twice what it asked for, upon conditions that were
easy to meet.

Turning now from historic examples of State aid to the higher edu-
cation by individual American commonwealths, let us inquire briefly
concerning the attitude of the United States Government towards in-
stitutions of science and sound learning.

Washington’s grand thought of a National University, based upon
individual endowment, may be found in many of his writings, but the
clearest and strongest statement occurs in bis last will and testament.
There he employed the following significant language :

‘‘ Tt has been my ardent wish to see a plan devised on a liberal scale
which would have atendency to spread systematic ideas through all
parts of this rising empire, thereby to do away local attachments and
State prejudices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought
to, admit from our national councils. Looking anxiously forward to
the accomplishment of so desirable an object as this is, in my estima-
tion, my mind has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to
effect the measure than the establishment of a wniversity in a central
part of the United States, to which the youths of fortune and talents
from all parts thereof may be sent for the completion of their education,
in all branches of polite literature, in arts and sciences, in acquiring
knowledge in the principles of politics and good government, and as a
matter of infinite importance in my judgment, by associating with each
other, and forming friendships in juvenile years, be enabled to free
themselves in a proper degree from those local prejudices and habitual
jealousies which have just been mentioned, and which, when carried to
excess, are never-failing sources of disquietude to the public mind, and
pregnant of mischievous consequences to this country. Under these
impressions, so fully dilated, I give and bequeath, in perpetuity, the
fifty shares which I hold in the Potomac Company - - - towards
the endowment of a university, to be established within the limits of
the District of Columbia, under the auspices of the General Govern-
ment, if that Government should incline to extend a favoring hand
towards it.”

Here was the individual foundation of a National University. Here
was the first suggestion of that noble line of public policy subsequently
adopted in 1846, by our General Government in relation to the Smith-
sonian Institution. The will of James Smithson, of England, made in
1826, was “ to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian

Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
102 THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

among men.” A simpler educational bequest, with such far-reaching
results, was never before made. Whether James Smithson was influ-
enced to this foundation by the example of Washington is a curious
problem. Smithson’s original bequest, amounting to something over
$500,000, was accepted by Congress for the purpose designated, and
was placed in the Treasury of the United States, where by good admin-
istration and small additional legacies (in two cases from other individ-
uals) the sum has increased to over $700,000. Besides this, the Smith-
sonian Institution now has a library equal in value to the original en-
dowment, and acquired by the simple process of government exchanges 5
and it owns buildings equal in value to more than half the original en-
dowment. During the past year, as shown by the Secretary’s report, the
Institution was ‘charged by Congress with the care and disbursement
of sundry appropriations,” * amounting to $220,000. The National Mu-
seum is under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and the Government appropriations to that museum, since its
foundation, aggregate nearly $2,000,000. The existence and ever-in-
creasing prosperity of the Smithsonian Institution are standing proofs
that private foundations may receive the fostering care of government
without injurious results. Independent administration of scientific insti-
tutions can co-exist with State aid. Itisaremarkable testimony to the
wisdom of George Washington’s original idea that Andrew D. White,
who, when president of Cornell University, happily combined private
endowments and Government land grants, lately suggested in The
Forumt the thought of a national university upon individual founda-
tions. This thought is a century old, but it remains to this day the
grandest thought in American educational history.

George Washington, like James Smithson, placed a private bequest,
so that the General Government might extend to it ‘¢a favoring hand ;”
but iu those early days Congress had no couception of the duties of
government towards education and science, although attention was re-
peatedly called to these subjects by enlightened Executives like Thomas
Jefferson, ‘father of the University of Virginia,” James Madison,
James Monroe, and John Quincy Adams. It took Congress ten years
to establish the Smithsonian Institution after the bequest had been
accepted and the money received. Unfortunately, George Washington’s
Potomac stock never paid but one dividend, and there was no pressure
in those days towards educational appropriations from an ever-increas-
ing surplus. The affairs of the Potomac Company were finally merged
into the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which became a profitable enter-
prise and endures to this day. What became of George Washington’s
‘consolidated stock” of that period, history does not record. Jared
Sparks, Washington’s biographer, thought the stock was ‘held in

trust” by the new company for the destined university. There is prob-
ably little danger that it will ever be thrown upon the market ina
solid block by the Treasury of the United States, to which the stock
legally belongs, unless the present surplus should suddenly vanish,
and the General Government be forced to realize upon its assets for the
expenses of the administration.

George Washington’s educational schemes were by no means vision-
ary. His stock in the James River Company, which, like the Potomac
Company, he had helped to organize, actually became productive and
was by him presented to Liberty Hall Academy, now Washington and
Lee University, at Lexington, Va., where General Lee died and was
buried, having served his native State, as did George Washington, in
the capacity of a college president. Washington raised Liberty Hall
Academy to what he called “a seminary of learning upon an enlarged
plan, but not coming up to the fall idea of university.” He meant to
make it one of the three Virginia supporters of the university at Wash-
ington. Liberty Hall, or Washington College, his own William and
Mary, and Hampden-Sidney, were all to be State pillars of a national
temple of learning.

Washington’s dream of a great university, rising grandly upon the
Maryland bank of the Potomac, remained a dream for three-quarters
of acentury. But there is nothing more real or persistent than the
dreams of great men, whether statesmen like Baron von Stein, or poets
hike Dante or Petrarch, or prophets like Savonarola, or thinkers like
St. Thomas Aquinas, the fathers of the church and of Greek philosophy.
States are overthrown; literatures are lost; temples are destroyed ;
systems of thought are shattered to pieces like the statues of Pheidias;
but somehow truth and beauty, art and architecture, forms of poetry,
ideals of liberty and government, of sound learning and of the eduea-
tion of youth—these immortal dreams are revived from ave to age and
take concrete shape before the very eyes of successive generations.

The idea of university education in the arts and sciences is as old as
the schoals of Greek philosophy. The idea was perpetuated at Alex-
andria, Rome, and Athens under the emperors. It endured at Gon.
stantinople and Ravenna. It was revived at Bologna, Paris, Prague,
Heidelberg, Oxford, and Cambridge under varying auspices, whether
of city, church, or state, and was sustained by the munificence of mer-
chants, princes, prelates, kings, and queens. Ideas of higher education
were transmitted to anew world by Englishmen whoa believed in an
educated ministry and who would not suffer learning to perish in the
wilderness. The collegiate foundations laid by John Harvard in Mas-
sachusetts and Commissary Blair in Virginia were the historic models
for many similar institutions, north and south. George Washington,
the chancellor of William and Mary, when he became President of a
Federal republic, caught up, in the capital of a westward-moving
empire, the old university ideaand gave it national scope. There upon
704 THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

the Potomac he proposed to found a National University, drawing its
economie hfe from the great artery of commerce which connects the
Atlantic seaboard and the Great West. As early as 1770 Washington
described this Potomac route as ‘the channel of the extensive and
valuable trade of a rising empire.”

Was it not in some measure an historic, although an unconscious,
fulfillment of that old dream of Washington when, a hundred years
later, Johns Hopkins determined to establish upon the Maryland side of
the Potomae a university with an economic tributary in tbe Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad, which follows the very windings of that ancient
channel of commerce? Forms of endowment may change, but uni-
versity ideas endure. They are the common historic inheritance of
every enlightened age and of every liberal mind; but their large fulfill-
ment requires a breadth of foundation and a range of vision reaching be-
yond mere locality. Universities that deserve the name have always
been something more than local or provincial institutions. Since the
days when Roman youth frequented the schools of Grecian philosophy,
since the time when ultramontranes and cismontanes congregated at
Bologna, since students organized by nations at Paris, Prague, and
Heidelberg, since northern Scots fought southern Englishmen at Oxford,
university life has been something even more than national. It has been
international and cosmopolitan. Though always locally established and
locally maintained, universities are beacon lights among the nations,
commanding wide horizons of sea and shore, catching all the winds that
blow and all the sun that shines, attracting, like the great light-house of
Ptolemy Philadeljhus on the island of Pharos, sailors from distant
lands to Alexandrine havens, or speeding the outward voyager.

The nations of the Old World are proud of their universities and col-
leges. Three years ago all Germany and the learned institutions of all
Europe united in celebrating the five hundredth anniversary of “ Alt
Heidelberg.” Last summer at Bologna, under the auspices of the Ital-
ian Government and of the minister of public instruction, the whole civ-
ilized world was represented by academic delegates, who had come joy-
fully together to celebrate tue thousandth birthday of ‘ the mother of
studies.” Every country in Europe takes pride in the history of its
universities and of its system of public education. It is time that some-
thing should be done for the history of learning in these United States.
Dr. G. Stanley Hall, the president of Clark University, in his Bibliog-
raphy of Education (page 41), says: “A history of educational institu-
tions in this country is greatly needed. The field is very rich and almost
unknown. No comprehensive history exists.”

Before educational specialists can have a History of American Edu.
cation that is worthy of the name, there must be a vast amount of spe-
cial investigation. There must be many local and State contributions
to the subject before national generalizations of any permanent or prac-
tical value can be drawn by educators, One might as well generalize
THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 105

upon the character of the American people without an historical study
of immigration and without taking a census of the population, as to
write a History of American Education before obtaining the local
facts.

~ A great deal of pioneer work in this direction has been done in Bar-
nard’s American Journal of Education; in the Annual Reports and Cir-
culars of Information published by the United States Bureau of Eduea-
tion; in the periodical and educational journals of the country, and in
the local histories of particular institutions of learning and of particular
systems of schools. A strong and novel impulse in the direction of or-
ganized inquiry concerning the history of e uecational institutions in
this country was communicated to the country in the centennial year,
1876, by General John Eaton, then Commissioner of Education. The
spirit of local co-operation was enlisted in many of our American colleges,
and considerable historical work was then done. Some of it was locally
published, but most of it never saw the light. Popular support and
Government appropriations were lacking for the adequate prosecution
of the work. One magnificent result however of this new spirit of
organized inquiry was the great volume on the public libraries of the
United States, their history, condition, and management, published in
1876, by the Department of the Interior for the Bureau of Education.
A single contribution to the history of education, edited by Dr. Frank-
lin B. Hough, was published by the Bureau in 1883. It was a pamphlet
of 72 pages, called Historical Sketches of the Universities and Colleges
of the United States, and related to the University of Missouri.

The idea of systematically investigating the history of higher eduea-
tion in this country was revived anew in connection with an inquiry un-
dertaken by the speaker, at the instance of General John Eaton, con-
cerning The Study of History in American Colleges and Universities.
Although concerned primarily with the history of a single department
of instruction in a few representative colleges, like Harvard, Yale, Co-
lumbia, Cornell, the University of Michigan, and the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, the writer could not fail to discover something of the general
historic interest belonging to the development of certain institutions of
learning north, south, and west. To representa school of history and
polities in the South, he had proposed to introduce an account of Wil-
liam and Mary College into the above report, but this institution proved
so generally interesting, as representing the history of education in Vir-
ginia, that the present Commissioner of Education, Col. N. H. R. Daw-
son, under whom the report on The Study of History was completed
for publication in 1887, encouraged further elaboration of the above ae-
count for a special Circular of Information. The monograph on The
College of William and Mary; a Contribution to the History of Higher
Education, with Suggestions for its National promotion, was issued as
Circular No. 1, 1887, and was cordially welcomed by the friends of
higher education in all parts of the country,—north, south, east, and

west. Aside from the generous public interest indica in the honora-

ble history and sad misfortunes of this oldest of Southern colleges, next
to Harvard the oldest in the country, the publication of this circular
accomplished the more practical result of arousing the State of Vir-
ginia to a consciousness of its educational inheritance and to an appro.
priation to restore the old coilege to a career of active usefulness. If
no other end than this had been effected by the above circular, the Bu-
reau of Education would have been justified in entering the field of
Southern educational history, where historical and quickening work is
most needed. ‘To illustrate the effect upon the educators of the North
as well as at the South, it may be added that this monograph furnished
materials for a presidential address at a well-known Northern University
and for an historical oration at one of the most influential Southern
universities.

The immediate success of this pioneer monograph on William and
Mary College led the way to the larger thought of treating the history
of higher education by States. Accordingly the remaining colleges of
Virginia were grouped together by the editor in authorized sketches,
supplementary to a study of Thomas Jefferson and the University of
Virginia. The idea was favorably received. The need of making gen-
erally known throughout the whole country the higher educational sys-
tems of individual States and sections is illustrated by the remark of a
college trustee in Massachusetts concerning the University of Virginia:
‘7 had not the faintest idea that any such university ever existed or
that education ever was on so high a plane in the South.” Jefferson’s
ideas concerning university education, and indeed concerning education
in general for this country, were farin advance of his time. Through
the instrumentality of professors like George Long, Thomas Hewett
Key, Charles Bonnyeastle, Dr. Robley Dunglison, and other professors
introduced from Europe, Jefferson’s plan for an elective system and for
real university work in schools of language and science, was practi-
cally realized more than fifty years ago. The publication of the facts
regarding Jefferson’s unique creation, in the vicinity of his own home
at Monticello, has proved not only of historical interest but of positive
educational value.

The work of organized inquiry into the history of American higher
education by States and groups of States was demonstrated by experi-
ence to be practicable, and, by general encouragement, to be welcome
to all parts of the country. Certain general principles were adopted in
the further prosecution of the investigation. Under the direction of an
editor, aided by the resources and documentary collections of the Bu-
reau of Education, the preparation of the State monographs was as-
signed to representative and scholarly men from the State or section of
country especially concerned. In all cases the active co-operation and
assistance of the various higher institutions of learning in each State
were enlisted through a sub editor. An attempt was made to make the
reports at once compact and readable, with a goo analysis of contents
and a few attractive illustrations of college or university buildings, the

plates being by no means confined to the showing of externals, such as
dormitories and facades, but picturing also in many cases library and
laboratory interiors. In compensation for the lack of absolute his-
torical completeness, full bibliographies of the sources of information
were to be appended to each chapter or great subject, so that future
students of our educational history might profit by the way-marks left
by pioneers.

Although unaided by any special appropriations, and absolutely de-
pendent upon the slender resources of the bureau for the preparation
of circulars of information, the work has been extended from Virginia,
the oldest of American commonwealths, throughout all the Southern
States, where monographs are either completed, or well advanced. The
report on North Carolina has lately been published. The returns from
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida are already in the lands of the
Government printer. The work has not been restricted to the South.
In anticipation of the historical interest connected with the observance
of the centenary of the settlement of the old northwest territory organ-
ized inquiry was early extended beyond the Ohio River. A monograph
upon the History of Higher Education in Wisconsin, prepared by Mr.
David Spencer, under the general direction of Prof. William IF, Allen,
of the University of Wisconsin, has been accepted and sent to the Pub-
lic Printer. Ata meeting of the American Historical Association, held
in the National Museum during the Christmas holidays, an introductory
paper upon the whole subject of higher education in the Northwest
was read by Prof. George W. Knight, of the Ohio State University at
Columbus, a graduate of the University of Michigan and author of a
scholarly monograph upon Federal Land Grants for Education in the
Northwest Territory, published among the papers of the American
Historical Association, vol.1. More elaborate monographs, based upon
pioneer work in a vast and unknown field, and representing the history
of colleges and universities in the States of Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan,
will soon be completed.

Here upon this desk lies a manuscript History of Higher Education
in the State of Indiana, mother of the President recently inaugurated.
This history was prepared by Prof. J. A. Woodburn, of the State Uni-
versity at Bloomington, who has studied for two years in Baltimore.
While no brief description can do justice to an exhaustive and laborious
work, it may be summarized as representing—

(1) The services of the old Continental Congress and of the Federal
Government towards education in the old Northwest Territory.

(2) The early beginnings of higher education in the Territory of In-
diana and the rise of State seminaries and academies, with their growth
into the State University.

(3) The work of the State normal school and of the various polytech-
nic and industrial institutions in the State of Indiana.

(4) The organization and early history of the denominational colleges.
and of other institutions of learning in Indiana,
708 THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

(5) The development of the school system and the final union or ar-
ticulation of the same with the colleges and the university.

Work of this kind has been pushed not only throughout the North-
west but through the Southwest. It has been carried beyond the Mis-
sissippi River, to the Pacific slope. The leading idea has been to do
pioneer work in the West and South, where almost nothing has been
hitherto accomplished towards a systematic history of colleges and uni-
versities. But the older sections of country have not been left out of
consideration. State monographs are in preparation or contemplation.
in all of the New England States, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylva-
nia, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. Everywhere
the attempt has been made to secure the co-operation of good men and
scholarly investigators, with proper historical training for the work en-
trusted to their hands, and with a scientific spirit rising above all con-
siderations of sectional, or sectarian, or economic interest. In all cases
the work has virtually been a labor of love. The funds available for
this wide-reaching and important undertaking have barely sufficed to
pay expenses actually incurred, to say nothing of properly compensa-
ting local contributors for their time and painstaking research.

An illustration of the practical value to the whole country of inves-
tigations like these, lies upon the desk before you. Here is an elaborate
monograph, which has occupied many months of patient toil, on the
History of Federal and State Aid to Higher Education. The work was
done by Dr. F. W. Blackmar, for several years a professor in a California
college and now professor of history in the University of Kansas. Some
of the State superintendents of education here present have doubtless
received numerous inquiries from Dr. Blackmar, who for the past three
years has been studying in Baltimore. When this monograph begins
to come forth in proof from that tomb of manuscripts, the Government
Printing Office, some of you will probably be asked to look over the
portions concerning your own State, as Dr. Dickinson has already done
for Massachusetts, Mr. Hine for Connecticut, Dr. Murray for New York,
etc.

Without anticipating the interesting facts and figures contained in
this important monograph, (facts which have been kept back from indi-
vidual applicants for information until results could be published to the
public at large,) it may be said that the work describes:

(1) The attitude of every American colony and State in this Union
towards the higher education, considered from an historical point of
view.

(2) The chief legislative enactments by colonial courts and State leg-
islatures concerning the establishment and encouragement of higher

education.
(3) The history of all financial aid and support given to higher edu-

cation by every colony and State in this country. The author has
found out, from a laborious examination of original statutes, the actual
amounts of money appropriated and of lands granted for education by
a ey aie

each of the several States and by the Federal Government, throughout
our entire history. There is not a practical educator, college president,
or trustee in the land who will not appreciate the importance and util-
ity of such a financial history of higher education in America.

(4) The monograph further shows the progress, development, and
present tendencies of higher education in these United States. The
history is given of West Point Military Academy, of the Naval Acad-
emy at Annapolis, of the Congressional Library, of the Smithsonian
Institution, the National Museum, and of the United States Bureau of
Education, together with all the financial relations of the General Goy-
ernment towards science and education since the beginning of our life
as a-nation.

These matters are here communicated to the assembled superintend-
ents of education from all parts of the Union because it is important
that you should appreciate their scope and significance, and because
you are in a position to strengthen and upliold the highest work of the
Bureau of Education. The bureau was originally founded, in the year
1867, ‘for the purpose of collecting such statistics and facts as shall
show the condition and progress of education in the several States and
Territories” (Barnard’s First annual Report, 186768, p. 63. Garfield’s
speech). What better method could there possibly be of showing the
condition or progress of education in these United States than by an
historical review of the origin, growth, development, and present ten-
dencies of American institutions of learning, beginning with the high-
est, as did our forefathers, with colleges and universities, and gradually
enlarging the horizon of inquiry until the whole field of secondary and
common school education is embraced in the retrospect? The broaden-
ing plains are best seen from the hill-tops. Unless American educators
see to it that the higher education is properly recognized in our State
and National reports, our whole system of educational inquiry will
degenerate into common school statistics and essays on pedagogical
methods. The Bureau of Education ought to take a commanding place
in the educational work of the country. By the highest kind of original
investigations, at home and abroad, it ought to win the respect and
confidence of the best men engaged in educational work, whether college
presidents or superintendents of schools. Why is it that the interests
of labor and agriculture can be raised to the dignity of Departments
in the United States Government, with a Secretary of Agriculture hold-
ing a Cabinet office, while the educational interests of the Republic are
allowed to remain upon a lower level? Simply because the educa-
tors of the country are content with that level, because they do not
exert one-half the compelling energy of either the farmers or the labor-
unions. The Bureau of Education ought to become a ministry of pub-
lic instruction, with a recognized place in the Cabinet, and with a con-
stantly energizing influence proceeding from the capital of this country
throughout the length and breadth of the land, stimulating the colleges
and the universities, as well as the school systems of the whole country,
710 THE STATE AND HIGHER EDUCATION.

by publishing the results of organized inquiry. The present Commis-
sioner of Labor touches the vital interests of American labor and of all
American society by his reports on the condition of working classes
and on the statistics of divorce. The bureau can attain an honorable
and influential position in the educational life of the country only by
keeping the vantage-ground already gained, by pursuing higher lines of
activity, by pressing boldly forward for larger appropriations and higher
objects, and by enlisting the cordial support of the best friends of ed-
ucation throughout all these States. Thus gradually the pressure of
public opinion will be brought to bear upon Congressmen, and Congress
and the nation will recognize at last that the interests of public educa-
tion are quite as important to the entire American people as are the
interests of any one class, like our American farmers or our American
workingmen, however honorable the aims of both classes may be.

Strengthen all existing foundations of the higher education in
America, whether in the individual States or at Washington. Bring
the representatives of public school systems and of our American col-
leges and universities into more hearty and efficient alliance. Co-oper-
ate with every respectable agency for the higher education of the
American people, whether by summer schools, teachers’ institutes, the
distribution of good literature in popular form, or by the institution of
home reading circles and university extension lectures, now so popular
in the manufacturing towns and mining districts of England. Break
down the antagonism between mental and manual labor. Make in-
dustrial and technical education as honorable as classical culture and
the learned professions. Teach the science of government and social
science, European as well as American history, in the puble school.
Then shaJl we all have greater respect and toleration for our fellow-
men; then will all begin to appreciate the necessity of supporting all
forms of education, even the highest, by the combined eftorts of socicty
and the State. A noble popularity must be given to science and art in
America. The people of every State should be led to see that the higher
learning is not for the benefit of a favored few, but that it is beneficial
and accessible to the sons of citizens, of whatever station. In the
proper co-ordination of the common school system with the high school
and university, the Western States are leading this Republic to a more
thoroughly democratic state of soviety, with fewer artificial distinctions
of culture, with more of the spirit of human brotherhood than the world
has hitherto seen. The Eastern colleges and universities will continue
to train professors and to develop science, but the West and South will
apply both men and ideas to democratic uses. The whole country
needs this popularization of culture. With universal suffrage and the
sovereignity of the people at the basis of our political life, popular in-
telligence must be cultivated so that it may be both able and willing to
hold fast all that is good in human history, not only civil and religious
liberty, but all that makes for happiness and righteousness in a great
nation. .
THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER.*

By WILLIAM ANDERSON.

Five years ago, at Montreal, in his address to the Mathematical Sec-
tion, Sir William Thomson took for his subject the ultimate constitu-
tion of matter, and discussed in a most suggestive manner the very
structure of the ultimate atoms or molecules. He passed in review the
theories extant on the subject, and pointed out the progress which had
been made in recent years by the labors of Clausius, of Clerk Maxwell,
of Tait, and others,—among whom his own name (I may add) stands in
unrivalled prominence. I will not presume to enter the field of scien-
tific thought and speculation traversed by Sir William Thomson. I
propose to draw attention only to some general considerations, and to
point out to what extent they practically interest the members of tlus
Section.

In a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution last May, Professor
Mendeléeff attempted to show that there existed an analogy between
the constitution of the stellar universe and that of matter as we know
it on the surface of the earth, and that from the motions of the heav-
enly bodies down to minutest inter-atomic movements in chemical re-
actions, the third law of Newton held good, and that the application of
that law afforded a means of explaining those chemical substitutions
and isomerisms which are so characteristic, especially of organic chem-
istry. Examined from asufficient distance, the planetary system would
appear as a concrete whole, endowed with invisible internal motions,
travelling to a distant goal. Taken in detail, each member of the
system may be involved in movements connected with its satellites,
and again each planet and satellite is instinct with motions which,
there is good reason to believe, extend to the ultimate atoms, and may
even exist, as Sir William Thomson has suggested, in the atoms them-
selves. The total result is complete equilibrium, and, in many cases, a
seeming absence of all motion, which is, in reality, the consequence of
dynamic equilibriam, and not the repose of immobility or inertness.

The movements of the members of the stellar universe are many of
them visible to the naked eye, and their existence needs no demonstra-
tion; but the extension of the generalization just mentioned to sub-

stances lying (to all appearances) inert on the earth’s surface is not so
obvious. In the case of gases, indeed, it is almost self-evident that
they are composed of particles so minute as to be invisible,—in a condi-
tion of great individual freedom. The rapid penetration of odors to
great distances, the ready absorption of vapors and other gases, and
the phenomena connected with diffusion, compression, and expansion
seem to demonstrate this. One gas will rapidly penetrate another and
blend evenly with it, even if the specific gravities be very different.
The particles of gases are (as compared with their own diameters) sep-
arated widely from each other; there is plenty of room for additional
particles; hence any gas which would, by virtue of its molecular motion,
soon diffuse itself uniformly through a vacuum will also diffuse itself
through one or more other gases, and once so diffused, it will never
separate again. A notable example of this is the permanence of the
constitution of the atmosphere, which is a mere mixture of gases. The
oxygen and the nitrogen, as determined by the examination of samples
collected all over the world, maintain sensibly the same relative pro-
portions, and even the carbonie acid, though liable to slight local ac-
cumulations, preserves, on the whole, a constant ratio, and yet the
densities of these gases differ very greatly.

Liquids (though to a much less degree than gases) are also composed
of particles separated to a considerable relative distance from each other,
and capable of unlimited motion where no opposing foree—such as gray-
ity—interferes; for under such circumstances their euergy of motion is
not sufficient to overcome the downward attractions of the earth; hence
they are constrained to maintain a level surface. The occlusion of gases
without sensible comparative increase of volume shows that the com-
ponent particles are widely separated. Water (for example) at the freez-
ing point occludes above one and three quarter times its own volume of
carbonic oxide, and about 480 times its volume of hydrochloric acid,
with an increase of volume in the latter case of only one-third. The
quantity of gas occluded increases directly as the pressure, which seems
to indicate that the particles of the occluded gas are as free in their
movements among the particles of the liquid as they would be in
an otherwise empty containing vessel. Liquids therefore are porous
bodies whose constituent particles have great freedom of motion. It
is no wonder consequently that two dissimilar liquids, placed in con-
tact with each other, should interpenetrate one another completely, if
time enough be allowed; and this time, as might be expected, is con.
siderably greater than that required for the blending of gases, because
of the vastly greater mobility of the particles of the latter. The diffu-
sion of liquids takes place not only when they are in actual contact,
but even when they are separated by partitions of a porous nature,
such as plaster of Paris, unglazed earthenware, vegetable or animal
membranes, and colloidal substances, all of which may be perfectly
water-tight, in the ordinary sense of the term, but powerless to prevent

"
THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER. 713

the particles of liquids making their way through simultaneously in
both directions.

When we come to solid substances the same phenomena appear.
The volumes of solids do not differ greatly from the volumes of the
liquids from which they are congealed, and the solid volumes are gen-
erally greater. The volume of ice (for example) is one tenth greater
than the water from which it separates. Solid cast-iron just floats on
liquid iron, and most metals behave in the same way; consequently,
if the liquids be porous the solids formed from them must be so also 3
hence, as might be expected, solids also occlude gases in a remarkable
manner. Platinum will take up five and a half times its own volume
of hydrogen, palladium nearly 700 times; copper, 60 per cent.; gold, 29
per cent.; silver, 21 per cent. of hydrogen, and 75 per cent. of oxygen 3
iron from 8 to 124 times its voluine of a gaseous mixture chiefly com-
posed of carbonic oxide. Not only are gases occluded, but they are
also transpired under favorable conditions of temperature and pressure,
and even Hae e san make their way through. Red-hotiron tubes will
permit the passage of gases through their substance with great readi-
ness. Ordinary si gas—when under high pressure—is retained with
difficulty in steel vessels, and it is well known that mercury will pene-
trate tin and other metals with great rapidity, completely altering their
structure, their properties, and even their chemical compositions.

The evidence of the mobility of the atoms or molecules of solid bodies
is overwhelming. Substances when reduced to powder, may even at
ordinary temperatures be restored to the homogeneous solid condition
by pressure only. Thus Professor W. Spring some ten years ago pro-
duced from the powdered nitrates of potassium and sodium—under a
pressure of thirteen tons to the square inch—homogeneous transparent
masses of slightly greater specific gravity than the original crystals,
but not otherwise to be distinguished from them. More than that, from
a mixture of copper filings and sulphur, he produced—under a press-
ure of thirty-four tons per square inch—perfectly homogeneous cuprous
sulphide (Cu, 8), the atoms of the two elements having been brought
by pressure into so intimate a relation to each other, that they were
able to arrange themselves into molecules of definite proportion; and
still more remarkable, the carefully dried powders of potash, saltpeter,
and acetate of soda, were by pressure caused to exchange their metallic
bases, and form nitrate of soda and acetate of potash.

At high temperatures the effects are more easily produced on account
of the greater energy of motion of the atoms or molecules. In the
process of the manufacture of steel by cementation, or in cz se-hardening,
the mere contact of iron with solid substances rich in carbon is suffi-
cient to permit the latter to work its way into the heart of the former,
while in the formation of malleable cast-iron the carbon makes its way
out of the castings with equal facility ; it is a complete case of diffusion
of solid substances through each other, but on account of the inferior
714 THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER.

and restricted mobility of the particles at ordinary temperatures, a
higher degree and longer time are needed than with liquids or gases.
Again, when by the agency of heat, molecular motion is raised to a
pitch at which incipient fluidity is obtained, the particles of two pieces
will unite into a homogeneous whole, and we can thus grasp the full
meaning of the operation known as “ welding.” By the ordinary coarse
methods but few substances unite in this way, because the nature of
the operation prevents, or at any rate hinders, the actual contact of
the two substances; but when molecular motion is excited to the proper
degree by a current of electricity, the faces to be joined can be brought
into actual contact, the presence of foreign substances can be excluded,
and many metals not hitherto considered weldable, such as tool steel,
copper, and aluminium, are readily welded.

The movement which we term radiant heat, acting through the instru-
mentality of the luminiferous ether (which is believed on the strongest
grounds to pervade all space and all matter) is competent to augment
the quantity of movement in the particles of substances, and generally
to cause an eplargementof volume. Again, energy in the form of light
operates changes in the surface of bodies, causing colors to fade, and
giving to photography the marvelous power which it possesses ; decom-
posing the carbonic acid of the atmosphere in the chlorophyl of green
leaves, and determining chemical combinations, such as chlorine with
hydrogen to form hydrochloric acid, or carbonic oxide with chlorine to
form chloro-carbonie acid. It is inconceivable that these effects could
be produced unless the undulations of light were competent to modify
the molecular motions already existing in the solid, liquid, and gaseous
bodies affected.

Electricity exerts a similar influence. Generated by the molecular
movements caused by chemical activity, whether directly, as in the pri-
mary battery, or indirectly, as in the dynamo, it is competent to increase
the molecular movements in bodies so as to produce the effects of heat
directly applied; it is capable of setting up motions of such intensity as
to produce chemical changes and decompositions, to say nothing of the
whole series of phenomena connected with magnetism, with induction,
or the action through space and through non-conducting bodies, which,
as in the case of radiant heat and light, seems to imply the existence
of an interatomic ether. Conversely, changes of molecular equilibrium,
brought about by the action of external forces, produce corresponding
changes in electrical currents; witness the effects of heat, for example,
on conductivity, and the wondrous revelations of molecular change
obtained by the aid of Professor Hughes’s induction balance.

The behavior of explosives illustrates also, and in a striking manner,
the effects of disturbing molecular equilibrium. An explosive is a sub-
stance which contains in itself, in a solid or liquid form, all the ele-
ments necessary to produce a chemical change by which it is converted
into the gaseous state. The application of heat, of pressure, or of im-
THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER. 715

pact, causes chemical union to take place, first at the spot where the
equilibrium is disturbed by the application of external force, and after-
wards, with great rapidity, through the mass, the disturbance being
propagated either by the air surrounding the particles or by the lumi-
niferous wether, with all the rapidity of light; the chemical re-action is
accelerated by the pressure which may arise, for example, if the explo-
sive be confined in the chamber of a gun or in the bore-hole of a blast.
High explosives (as they are termed) are comparatively inert to ordi-
nary ignition; but when the molecular equilibrium is suddenly disar-
ranged throughout the mass by the detonation of a percussion fuse, com-
bination takes place instantly throughout, and violent explosion follows.
In asimilar manner some gases, such a acetylene, cyanogen, and others,
can be decomposed by detonation and reduced to their solid constituents.
Professor Thorpe has devised a very beautiful lecture experiment, in
which carbon disulphide is caused to fall asunder into carbon and sul-
phur by the detonation of fulminate of mercury fired by an electric
spark. In these cases a reverse action takes place, but it illustrates
equally well the conversion of one form of energy into others, and the
consequent disturbance of molecular equilibrium in the substances
affected. It seems to me clear therefore the time has come when the
conception of dynamic equilibrium in the ultimate particles of matter
in all its forms must take the place of the structural system of inert
particles.

I cannot conceive how the phenomena which I have enumerated can
be explained on the supposition that matter is built up of motionless
particles ;—how for example a stack of red and yellow bricks could
ever change the order of arrangement without being completely pulled
asunder and built up again, in which case an intermediate state of chaos
would exist: but I can easily comprehend how a dense crowd of people
may appear as a compact mass, Streaming it may be in a definite
direction, and yet how each member of that mass is endowed with lim-
ited motion, by virtue of which he may push his way through without
disturbing the general appearance; how the junetion of two crowds
would form one whole, though perchance altered in character; and
how even Professor Spring’s experiments may be explained by the sup-
position that bystanders on the edge of a crowd would be foreed, by
external pressure, to form part of it and partake of its general move.
ments.

When it is conceded that molecular motion pervades matter in all its
forms, and that the solid passes (often insensibly) into the fluid, or even
direct into the gaseous, it follows, almost of necessity, that there must
be a, borderland, the limits of which are determined by temperature
and pressure, in which substances are constantly changing from one
state to another. ‘This is observable in fusion, but to a marked degree
in evaporation, where the particles are being incessantly launched into
space as gas and return as constantly to the liquid state.
716 THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER.

If steel be looked upon as a solution of carbon and iron, then the
hardening of steel is explained by the theory that dissociation has taken
place at the temperature at which it is suddenly cooled, the sudden
cooling fixing the molecular motion at such an amplitude or phase that
it gives a characteristic structure, one of the properties of which is ex-
treme hardness. In tempering, the gradual communication of heat
causes dissociation again to take place, the molecular equilibrium is
modified by the increased energy imparted to the particles, and when
suddenly cooled at any point there remains again a distinct substanee,
composed of iron and carbon, partly in various degrees of solution and
partly free, and again possessing special mechanical qualities. - - -

There is one more circumstance connected with my subject to which
I must draw your attention, because, though its application to the me-
chanical properties of substances is very recent, if promises to be of
great importance. I allude to the Periodic Law of Dr. Mendeléef
According to that law, the elements arranged in order of their atemie
weights, exhibit an evident periodicity of properties, and as Professor
Carnelley has observed, the properties of the compounds of the ele-
ments are a periodic function of the atomic weights of their constitu-
ent elements. Acting on these views, Professor Roberts-Austin has
recently devoted much time and labor to testing their exactness with
reference to the mechanical properties of metals. The investigation is
surrounded by extraordinary difficulties, because one of the essential
features of the inquiry is that the metals operated cn should be abso-
lutely pure. For chemical researches, a few grains of a substance-are
all that is needed, and the requisite purity can be obtained at a mod-
erate cost of time and labor; but when mechanical properties have to
be determined, considerable masses are needed, and the funds necessary
for obtaining these are beyond the reach of most private individuals.

In view of the difficulty of obtaining metals of sufficient purity, he
selected gold as his base, because that metal can be more readily
brought to a state of purity than any other, and is not liable to oxida-
tion. In a communication to the Royal Society made last year, he
shows that the metals alloyed with gold which diminish its tenacity
and extensibility have high atomic volumes, while those which increase
these properties have either the same atomic volumes as gold or have
lower ones. The inquiry has only just been commenced, but it appears
to me to promise results which, to the engineer, will prove as important
and as fruitful of progress as the great generalization of Mendeléef
has been to chemists. A law which can not only indicate the existence
of unknown elements, but which ean also define their properties before
they are discovered, if capable of application to metallurgy, must surely
yield most valuable results, and will make the compounding of alloys
a scientific process instead of the lawless and hap-hazard operation
which it is now.

THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER. (17

The practical importance of the views I have enunciated are I think
sufficiently obvious. Every one will admit that an external force can
not be applied to a system in motion without affecting that motion;
consequentiy matter, in whatever state, can not be touched without
changes taking place which will be more or less permanent. The ap-
plication of heat will cause a change of volume, and at last, a change
of condition; the application of external stresses will also produce a
change of volume; and it is natural to infer that there must be some re-
lation between the two, and accordingly Professor Carnelley has drawn
attention to the fact that the most tenacious metals have high melting-
points, though here again there is a great want of exactness, partly on
account of the difficulty of measuring high temperatures, and partly
by reason of the searcity of pure materials. Again, long-continued
stresses, or stresses frequently applied, may be expected to’ produce
permanent changes of form, and so we arrive at what is termed the
fatigue of substances. Stretched beyond their elastic limits, (which
limits I do not suppose to exist except when stresses are applied
quickly,) substances are permanently deformed, and the same effects
follow the long application of heat.

The constant recurrence of stresses, even those within the elastic limit,
causes changes in the arrangement of the particles of substances which
slowly alter the properties of the latter, and in this way pieces of ma-
chinery, which theoretically were abundantly strong for the work they
had to perform, have failed after a more or less extended period of use.
The effect is intensified if the stresses are applied suddenly, if they
reach nearly to the elastic limit, and if they are imposed in two or more
directions at once, for then the molecular disturbance becomes very
intense, the internal equilibrium is upset, and a tendency to rupture
follows. Such cases occur in artillery, in armour-plates, in the parts of
machinery subject to impact; and, as might be expected, the destructive
effects do not always appear at once, but often after long periods of
time. When considerable masses of metal have to be manipulated by
forging, or by pressure in a heated condition, the subsequent cooling of
the mass imposes restrictions on the free movement of some, if not all
of the particles; internal stresses are developed which slowly assert
themselves, and often cause unexpected failures. In the manufacture of
dies for coining purposes, of chilled rollers, of shot and shell hardened
in an unequal manner, spontaneous fractures take place without any
apparent cause, and often after long delay, the reason being that the
constrained molecular motion of the inner particles gradually extends
the motion of the outer ones until a solution of continuity is caused.
Similar stresses occur in such masses as crank shafts, screw shafts, gun
hoops, ete. - - -

The influence of time on steel seems to be well established; the high-
eSt qualities of tool steel are kept in stock for a considerable period ;
718 THE MOLECULAR STRUGIURE OF MATTER.

and it seems certain that bayonets, swords, and guns are liable to
changes which may account for some of the unsatisfactory results which
have manifested themselves at tests repeated after a considerable inter-
val of time. As all these things have been hardened and tempered,
there must necessarily have been considerable constraint put upon the
freedom of motion of the particles. This constraint has gradually been
overcome, but at the expense of the particular quality of the steel which
it was originally intended to secure.

I have now laid before you the views respecting the constitution of
matter which J think are gaining ground, which explain many phe-
nomena with which we are familiar, and which will serve as guides in
our treatment of metals, and especially of alloys; but I must admit that
the subject is still by no means clear, that a great deal more definition
is wanted, and that we are still awaiting the advent of the man who
shall do for molecular physics what Newton did for astronomy in ex-
plaining the structure of the universe.

PETROLEUM.

One of the most remarkable features of the last thirty years is the
introduction of petroleum, and the wonderful development to which the
trade in it has attained. Under the generic name of petroleum is
embraced a variety of combinations of carbon and hydrogen, each of
which is distinguished by some special property. Atordinary tempera-
tures and pressures some are gaseous, some are liquid, and some solid,
and most are capable of being modified by suitable treatment under
various temperatures and pressures. The employment of petroleum in
the arts is still extending rapidly. Used originally for illuminating
purposes, it is now einployed as fuel for heating furnaces and steam-
boilers, and as a working agent in heat engines: valuable medicinal prop-
erties have been discovered ; and as a lubricant it stands unrivalled.

As a working agent in heat engines itis employed in two ways: First,
as a vapor generated from the liquid petroleum contained in a boiler,
very much in the same way as the vapor of water is used in an engine
with surface condenser, the fuel for producing the vapor being also
petroleum. Very signal success has been obtained by Mr. Yarrow and
others in this mode of using mineral oil, especially for marine purposes
and for engines of small power; there seems to be no doubt that by
using a highly volatile spirit in the boiler a given amount of fuel will
produce double the power obtainable by other means, and at the same
time the machinery will be lighter and will occupy less space than if
steam were the agent used. The other method is to inject a very fine
spray of hot oil associated with the proper quantity of air into the cylin-
der of an ordinary gas-engine, and ignite it there by means of an elec-
tric spark or other suitable means. Attempts to use oil in this way
date back many years, but it was not till 1888, that Messrs. Priestman
Brothers exhibited at the Nottingham show of the Royal Agricultu-
ral Society an engine which worked successfully with oil, the flashing
point of which was higher than 75° F., and was therefore within the
THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER. (19

category of safe oils. The engine exhibited was very like an ordinary
Otto gas-engine, and worked in exactly the same cycle. A pump at
the side of the engine forced air into a small receiver at a few pounds
pressure to the square inch. The compressed air, acting by means of
a small injector, carried with it the oil in the form of fine spray, which
issued into a jacketed chamber heated by the exhaust, in which the oil
was vaporized. The mingled air and oil was thus raised to a temper-
ature of about 300°, and was then drawn, with more air, into the cylin-
der, where, after being compressed by the return stroke of the piston,
it was exploded by an electric spark, and at the end of the cycle the
products of combustion were discharged into the air after encircling
the spray chamber and parting with most of their heat to the injected
oil, The resuits of careful experiments made by Sir William Thomson
and myself on different occasions were, that 1.73 pounds of petroleum
were cousumed per brake horse-power per hour; but the combustion
was by no means perfect, for a sheet of paper held over the exhaust pipe
was soon thickly spattered with spots of oil.

The enormous consumption of petroleum and of natural gases fre-
quently raises the question as to the probability of the proximate
exhaustion of the supply; and without doubt many fear to adopt the
use of oil, from a feeling that if such use once becomes general the de-
mand will exceed the production, the price will rise indefinitely, and
old methods of illumination, and old forms of fuel, will have to be re-
verted to. From this point of view it is most interesting to inquire
what are the probabilities of a continuous supply ; and such an investi-
gation leads at once to the question, ‘* What is the origin of petroleum ?”

In the year 1877, Professor Mendeléef undertook to answer this ques-
tion; and as his theory appears to be very little known, I trust you will
forgive me for laying a matter so interesting before you. Dr. Mendeléef
commences his essay by the statement that some persons assume (with-
out any special reason excepting perhaps its chemical composition), that
naphtha, like coal, has a vegetable origin. He combats this hypothesis,
and points out, in the first place, that naphtha must have been formed
in the depths of the earth. It could not have been produced on the sur-
face, because if would have evaporated ; nor overa sea bottom, because
it would have floated up and been dissipated by the same means. In
the next place he shows that naphtha must have been formed beneath
the very site on which it is found,—that it can not have come from a
distance, like so many other geological deposits, and for the reasons
given above, namely, that it could not be water-borne, and could not
have flowed along the surface, while in the superficial sands in which
it is generally found no one has ever discovered the presence of organ-
ized matter in sufficiently large masses to have served as a source for
the enormous quantity of oil and gas yielded in some districts; and
hence it is most probable that it has risen from much greater depths
under the influence of its own gaseous pressure, or floated up upon the
surface of water, with which it is so frequently associated. -— -
720 THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF MATTER.

The process of the formation of petroleum seems to be the following:
It is generally admitted that the crust of the earth is very thin in com-
parison with the diameter of the latter, and that this crust incloses soft
or fluid substance, among which the carbides of iron and of other metals
find a place. When, in consequence of cooling or some other cause, a
fissure takes place through which a mountain range is protruded, the
crust of the earth is bent, and at the foot of the hills fissures are formed ;
or at any rate the continuity of the rocky layers is disturbed, and they
are rendered more or less porous, so that surface waters are able to make
their way deep into the bowels of the earth, and to reach occasionally
the heated deposits of metallic carbides, which may exist either in a
separated condition or blended with other matter. Under such cireum-
stances it is easy to see what must take place. Iron, or whatever other
metal may be present, forms an oxide with the oxygen of the water;
hydrogen is either set free or combined with the carbon which was as-
sociated with the metal, and becomes a volatile substance—that is,
naphtha. The water which had penetrated down to the incandescent
mass was changed into steam, a portion of which foundits way through
the porous substances with which the fissures were filled, and carried
with it the vapors of the newly-formed hydro-carbons, and this mixture
of vapors was condensed wholly or in part as soon as it reached the
cooler strata. The chemical composition of the hydro-carbons produced
will depend upon the conditions of temperature and pressure under
which they are formed. It is obvious that these may vary between very
wide limits, and hence it is that mineral oils, mineral pitch, ozokerit,
and similar products differ so greatly from each other in the relative
proportions of hydrogen and carbon. I may mention that artificial pe-
troleum has been frequently prepared by a process analogous to that
described above.

It is needless to remark that Dr..Mendeléef’s views are not shared by.
every competent authority; nevertheless, the remarkable permanence
of oil- wells, the apparently inexhaustible evolution of hydro-carbon gases
in certain regions, almost forces one to believe that the hydro-carbon
products must be forming as fast as they are consumed, that there is
little danger of the demand ever exceeding the supply, and that there
is every prospect of oil being found in almost every portion of the sur-
face of the earth, especially in the vicinity of great geological disturb-
ances. Improved methods of boring wells will enable greater depths
to be reached ; and it should be remembered that, apart from the cost
of sinking a deep well, there is no extra expense in working at great
depths, because the oil generally rises to the surface or near it. The ex-
traordinary pressures, amounting to 300 pounds per square inch, which
have been measured in some wells, seem {o me to yield conclusive evi-
dence of the impermeability of the strata from under which the oil has
been forced up, and tend to confirm the view that it must have been
formed in regions far below any which could have contained organic
remains.

ALUMINUM.*
By H. C. Hovey.

The formal opening of the great works of the Aluminum Brass and
Bronze Company, at Bridgeport, Connecticut, makes it desirable, as a
preliminary, that we state a few facts about the unalloyed metal itself.
Quite learned men have indulged in wild talk about the metal, which
is more widely distributed over the globe than any other, being known
to exist in two hundred different minerals, including all granites and
common clays.

The problem has been to extract the metal cheaply, and chemists of
every land have labored for a solution. Qérsted suggested a process
of obtaining aluminum by treating the chloride with an alkali metal.
Adopted by Woehler, and modified by Deville, the process was “a
reduction of the double chloride of aluminum and sodium by means of

; metallic sodium in the presence of eryolite.” It was thus that Deville
‘was able to show at the Paris Exhibition in 1855, as the greatest of mod-
ern chemical wonders, a bar of what he styled “silver-white metal
made from clay.” He sold aluminum first at $15 an ounce, but in 1857
he reduced the price to $2 an ounce. Improvements cheapened the
product still further, so that Colonel Frishmuth, who cast the tip of
the Washington Monument in 1884, was able to furnish the metal in
bars at $15 a pound. In that year however he made only 1,800 ounces,
and the entire import was but 590 pounds.

Prior to 1887, the entire amount manufactured annually was but
10,000 pounds, and it sold that year at $10 a pound. To get even this
small amount required the annual manufacture of 106,000 pounds of
the double chloride and 40,000 pounds of sodium. To cheapen these
two preliminary processes was essential to the cheap production of
aluminum.

Hence the importance of the process patented by Mr. Hamilton Y.
Castner, June 1, 1886, which was the first patent ever granted for an
aluminum process in the United States. Its special feature was a cheap
way of getting sodium. He reduced and distilled it in large iron ecruci-
bles, raised automatically through apertures in the bottom of the fur-
nace, where they remain until the reduction is completed and the sodium

distilled. Through tubes in stationary coyers the distilled metal passes
to condensers, where it is solidified. When the process is completed,
the crucible is lowered and a new one with a fresh charge is substituted
and raised into the furnace. The residues are carbonate of soda and
metallic iron, both of which can again be utilized. The process is as
simple as it is ingenious, and the temperature required is very moderate,
the sodium distilling as eazily as zinc. One charge requires about an
hour, and a battery of four furnaces can yield a ton of sodium a day.
The metal is kept from oxidation by a covering of mineral oil till used.

The Deville-Castner process takes the double chloride finely divided
and mixed with thin slices of sodium, and empties the mixing cylinder
on the hearth of a reverberatory furnace, where the mass quickly melts,
and a re-action takes place that finally liberates a silvery stream of
molten aluminum, that is drawn out from below, while the melted slag
runs off from above. The first run is purest and contains about three-
fourths of the charge. The remainder is scraped off from the hearth,
or found entangled with the slag, from which it has to be separated.
The aluminum is finally re-melted in plumbago crucibles, and cast into
ingots, bars, or plates.

The Journal of the Society of Arts, from whose very extended account
the foregoing is abridged, adds that day by day, as the manufacture
progresses, improvements are made which either enhance the economy
of production or the purity of the product, and speaks in the highest
praise of the skill, energy, and perseverance of Mr. Castner and his
assistants, by whom, more than any others, aluminum has been brought
into the market on commercially practicable terms and in a condition
of almost perfect purity.

Grabau’s process may be brietly described. Powdered cryolite put
into a solution of the sulphate of aluminum gives by re-action the fluoride
of aluminum, which is then heated till ready to evaporate. The heated
fluoride is pulverized and thrown upon melted sodium contained in a
vessel lined with eryolite. The heat generated by the violent re-action
melts the aluminum as well as the cryolite; and the molten mass being
poured out, the pure aluminum settles at the bottom, while the cryolite
is at the top. The main advantage of this method over the Castner
process is that it goes on at a lower temperature and is extremely simple.

Numerous other processes are described by Richards in his exhaustive
work on the subject ; e. g., reduction by cyanogen, by hydrogen, by car-
buretted hydrogen, by carbonand carbon-dioxide, concerning all of which
Dr. T. Sterry Hunt remarks that “there has been no pure aluminum
made commercially save from the chloride by the use of sodium.” Web-
ster is the chief manufacturer in England on his own patents, and large
works have been erected in France on Bunsen and Deville’s process by
electrolysis.

But after all, the only true rival of the Castner-Deville process seems
to be the Hall process, on patents of Charles M. Hall, and carried on by

the Pittsourgh Reduction Company, who are now selling pure aluminum
at a rate cheaper than nickel; and tons of metal are rolled by the Sco-
ville Manufacturing Company, of Waterbury, into sheets, bars, rods, and
tubing at a price less than German silver. Briefly, the Hall process is
this: A flux being discovered that at a moderate temperature takes the
aluminum ore into solution, and that is of lighter specific gravity, and
that also is unaffected by the passage of an electric current, he fills a
series of carbon-lined steel pots with the flux, which is kept in a melted
condition. Carbon electrodes are plunged into these baths, through
which passes the electric current, which acts to send the aluminum to
the sides and bottom of each pot. The baths are constantly replenished
with ore, and the process thus goes on for an indefinite period, night
and day, at small cost, and demanding but little attention.

Aluminum, whether pure or in combination, deserves to rank with
the noble metals ;—although in certain forms it makes the basis of our
common clay, every cubic yard of which is said to contain 800 pounds
of the metal; in other forms it is massed in mountains; and in others
still, it shines among the most precious stones, entering into the compo-
sition of the ruby, sapphire, topaz, garnet, lapis-lazuli, and tourmaline.

Cryolite, found in Greenland, and beauxite, first found at Beaux, in
France, but since in Austria, Ireland, and elsewhere, are the ores relied
on for the manufacture of aluminum. Cryolite is a snow-white mineral,
though often tinged red or yellow by impurities. Beauxite is a hard
white clay, occurring in beds many feet thick. Corundum, found in
Georgia, is the material relied on in America especially for making the
alloys. It varies from dull blue to black, and exists in massive form, as
well as in crystals. The cost at the factory of these different minerals
varies from $60 to $140 a ton.

The properties of aluminum are now generally known. Its color is
white delicately tinged with blue, and it resembles silver more than any
other metal. It takes a brilliant polish,and may be rolled or forged as
easily as gold or silver, and may be beaten into very thin leaves. It can
be pressed or stamped into all sorts of shapes, or drawn into very fine
wire. Its elasticity and tenacity are about the same as virgin silver, but
change greatly under the hammer. It is said to resist the graving-tool
till properly varnished, ~vhen it may be cut like copper. Its sonorous-
ness is very curious. Cast in bell form its sound is sharp, and not pro-
longed; but struck as a bar, it is remarkably sweet, pure, and resonant.
Its sound is resolved into two tones, related to each other as are D and
A. Fora musieal instrument, fine effects might be had from a series
of chromatic bars.

In estimating the relative cost of aluminum as compared with other
metals, we must take its specific gravity into the account. A bar of
aluminum weighing 1 pound would be about four times as large as a simi-
lar bar of silver, brass, bronze, tin, or iron. Hence, at an equal price,
aluminum would be four times as cheap as silver, but as it now costs by
124 ALUMINUM.

weight only one-eighth as much, it must be relativeiy about thirty-two
times as cheap. In other words, the purchaser would find it economi-
cal to use aluminum in preference to silver for everything to which it is
adapted. As aconductor of electricity it equals silver, and is eight
times better than iron, and as a conductor of heat it excels any other
metal known. Neither air nor water, hot or cold, affects it, and it re-
sists all acids except hydrochloric. Itslowly yields to a mixture of salt

and vinegar with a result as harmless as clay itself. It does not seem.

to be affected by saliva, perspiration, or other animal agents. Hydro-
gen, nitrogen, sulphur, and carbon do not affect it, but it is rapidly
attacked by chlorine, fluorine, iodine, and bromine. From the above
observation aluminum does not seem to have an intimate analogy with
any other known metal, though Richards and Woehler place it near to
silicon and boron in the carbon series.

Aluminum melts slowly at about 700° C, (1292° F.), without a flux, and
in an ordinary uncovered earthen crucible lined with carbon. The
pieces of divided metal are first dipped in benzine to clean them, and
if necessary, are treated with nitric acid and then put in the crucible
little by little. a.

A cinder remains at the bottom of the crucible. The molten metal
may be cast either in metallic molds or in very dry porous sand with
numerous vents. Deville prefers a plumbago crucible without a lid, and
exposes the red-hot metal for a long time to the open air to allow the
exhalation of the acid fumes, after which the surface is skimmed without
loss of metal. It is then cast intoingots. To get perfectly clean results
this process is repeated three or four times. The pure metal thus ob-
tained improves in color with using, while what is less pure tarnishes in
time, though perhaps equally brilliant on first casting.

The Aluminum Company, with offices at 115 Cannon street, London,
and works at Oldbury, near Birmingham, issued a price-list Novem-
ber 1, 1889, from which we quote aluminum, 994 to 99% per cent., purity

guarantied, 15 shillings per pound; 98 to 99, 15 shillings per pound 5

95 to 96, 12 shillings a pound.

The first article manufactured from pure aluminum was a rattle for
the young Prince Imperial of France, in 1856, the sonorousness of which
was much admired. It was next made into jéwelry, medals, and inlaid
work. Its extreme lightness led to its being used for sextants, eye-
glasses, opera-glasses, and the tubes of telescopes. It has been found
useful for the beams of balances, for delicate weights, and in the form
of fine wire for embroidery. Culinary articles made from it were to be
seen at the London exhibition in 1862, for which it seemed admirably
adapted on account of its lightness and immunity from corrosion.

Experiments have been rapidly mutiplied of late, under the encour-
agement given by reason of the increased cheapness of the metal, and
a promising field is surely opening for its employment for many orna-
mental and useful purposes. The processes of soldering, welding, ve-

neering, gilding, and silvering aluminum are minutely described in
Richards’s work on the subject.

The aluminum industry is on a firm footing, both in Europe and
America. There have sprung up two distinct lines of manufacture;
the one a chemical process, and the other strictly metallurgical. The
former produces pure aluminum, and continues to be a complicated
process demanding skill and patience. The latter produces only the
alloys of aluminum, and has been made extremely simple by certain
methods not necessary to be here described.

ALLOYS OF ALUMINUM.*

By J. H. DAGGER.

Deville’s method, modified in detail, is still the chief of the chemical
processes for the production of aluminum, and is dependent upon the
cost of metallic sodium. The greatest value of aluminum is however
in its alloys, and the successful application of the intense heat of the
electric are to their production on a commercial scale marks a depatt-
ure in electro metallurgy of which we can not overestimate the impor-
tance, rendering it possible to produce rich alloys of this metal at half
the cost of any other method, and so widening the field of their appli-
cation to an extent hitherto unknown.

At the works of the Cowles Company, Lockport, New York, there are
in operation fourteen furnaces, the electricity for which is generated by
three dynamos, capable of supplying a current of 3,000 to 3,200 am-
peres, and E. M. F. of 55 to 60 volts. These furnaces can produce 2,500
pounds of aluminum bronze (10 per cent.) and 1,800 pounds of ferro-
aluminum (10 per cent.), or a total yield of 430 pounds of contained
aluminum per twenty-four hours. The English works of the company
at Milton, Staffordshire, contain twelve furnaces with a500-horse power
dynamo, built by Messrs. Crompton, and said to be the largest machine
in England and probably in the world; it furnishes a current of 5,000
to 6,000 ampéres, with an E. M. F. of 50 to 60 volts. The production of
these works is 2,500 pounds aluminum bronze (10 per cent.) and 1,800
pounds ferro-aluminum (10 per cent.) per twenty-four hours, or 410
pounds of contained aluminum.

The furnaces are rectangular in form and are of fire-brick ; into each

_end is built a cast-iron tube, through which the carbon electrodes

enter the furnace; each electrode consists of a bundle of nine car-
bons, each 24 inches diameter, attached to a head of cast-iron fora
ferro-aluminum furnace and of cast copper for aluminum bronze or
alloys containing copper. This head is secured to copper rods, or
‘‘ Jeads,” which can be readily connected with or disconnected from the
flexible cables supplying the current. Each cable is secured to slides
travelling on an omnibus bar of copper overhead, and so can be brought
into position opposite the turnaces to be used. The electrodes are ar-

ranged so that it is possible by means of a handle and screw to advance
or withdraw them from each other in the furnace.

The first furnaces were lined with charcoal, but it was found that the
intense heat converted it into graphite, which, being a conductor, not
only meant loss of power, but the destruction of the furnace walls. This
difficulty has been overcome by soaking the charcoal in lime-water and
carefully drying before use; each particle of charcoal is thus coated
with an insulating shell of lime.

Lining the furnace is the first operation; the bottom of the trough
is covered with a layer of prepared charcoal, the electrodes are arranged
in the furnace, and a “former,” a sheet-iron box without top or bottom,
each end being arched to fit over the electrodes, is inserted; charcoal
is then rammed into the space between it and the fire-brick walls.
This done, the charge of ore, mixed with coarse charcoal and the metal
to be alloyed with the aluminum, in form of turnings or granules, is
placed inside the iron box, after which this is carefully withdrawn; the
space between the electrodes is bridged by some broken pieces of ecar-
bon, the charge is covered with coarse charcoal, and the furnace closed
by a heavy cast-iron cover having a hole in the center for the escape of
gases evolved during the reaction; the cover is luted so as to prevent
the entrance of air.

The commencing current is about 3,000 ampéres, and is gradually
increased to 5,000 amperes; a “run” occupies about one and one-half
hours. The furnace is allowed to cool; the next, ready charged, is con-
nected with the cables so that the process is a continuous one, the fur-
naces being successively charged and connected. The crude metal from
the furnace is then re-melted in an ordinary reverberating furnace, a
‘sample being taken from each run and assayed for aluminum. The
nature of the re-action that takes place in the electric furnace is not very
easy to ascertain; the conditions are unlike those of any other process
known. The reduction of the aluminum taking place in absence of air
and in presence of an enormous excess of carbon, it may be assumed
that at the intense heat of the electric arc, the ore melts and gives up
its oxygen to the carbon:

~ Al,O,+3C0=3C00+ Al.
In the absence of copper, the liberated aluminum absorbs carbon and

is converted into a carbide of the metal. The escaping gas which burns
at the orifice in the cover is almost entirely composed of CO.

The most valuable of the alloys are those with copper. Aluminum
bronze has great tensile strength. A bar containing 11 per cent. alumi-
num made by the electric furnace and tested by the Leeds Forge Com-
pany, limited, gave a tensile strain of 57.27 tons, or 128,400 pounds to the
squareinch. One, containing 7.5 per cent. aluminum, tested by Professor
Unwin, broke under 36.78 tons = 89,743 pounds to the square inch. In
resistance to compression this alloy equals the best steel; its transverse
strength, or rigidity, is about forty times greater than ordinary brass.
Its elastic limit is higher than that of mild steei, and it can be worked
at a bright-red heat as easily as wrought iron. Its mechanical and
physical properties render it useful for every variety of metal work, its
high price only having hitherto restricted its use. Its enormous
strength and anti-corrodible qualities recommend it as valuable above
any other alloy for propeller blades, stern and rudder frames, and for
hydraulic and engineering work generally. With above 11 per cent. the
alloy becomes brittle; and at 20 per cent. can be powdered readily in a
mortar. The addition of small quantities of aluminum lowers the fus-
ing point of iron, and this is utilized in the “ Mitis” castings. Itinsures
freedom from blow-holes, increased tensile strength, and high elastic
limit. Mr. Keep found that 0.1 per cent. aluminum raised the transverse
breaking strength of a one-half inch bar, 12 inches long, from 379 pounds
to 545 pounds, or 44 per cent., and the resistance to impact from 239
pounds to 254 pounds, or 6 percent. The tensile strength of Mitis cast-
ings may be as high as 27 tons per square inch, with an elongation of 20
per cent. Another alloy made in the electric furnace is silicon bronze,
which, owing to its great strength and tenacity, its resistance to corro-
sion, combined with high electrical conductivity, is perhaps the best
metal extant for electric light, telephone, and telegraph wires.

THE EIFFEL TOWER.*

By G. EIFFEL.

The notion of a tower 1,000 feet in height is not new. It has
haunted the imagination of Euglishmen and Americans. As early
as 1833, the celebrated English engineer Trevitick proposed to construct
a cast-iron tower 1,000 feet high, of which the diameter should be
100 feet at the base and 4 feet at the summit. But his project was
never put in execution, and was but imperfectly worked out even on
paper.

At the time of the Exhibition in Philadelphia, in 1876, the great
American engineers, Messrs. Clarke and Reeves, brought forward a new
project. Their tower was to consist of an iron eylinder 9 meters in
diameter as a nucleus, and supported by a series of metal buttresses
disposed round if and starting from a base with a diameter of 45
meters. This was a distinct improvement on the English project,
although it still left room for criticism; and yet the Americans, in
spite of their enterprising sp:rit and the national enthusiasm excited
by this conception, shrank from its execution.

In 1881, M. Sébillot proposed to light Paris by an electric lamp
placed at a height of 1,000 feet. This idea, which has, in my opinion,
no practical value, had no better fate than its predecessors. I need
only mention the designs, some in masonry, some in metal work and
masonry combined, others, lastly, in wood, like the proposed tower for
the Brussels Exhibition, which were produced at the same time as my
own. But all these remained in the domain of fancy, proposals easy
to frame but hard to execute. I come to the project which has been
‘realized.

In 1885, after the studies which my engineers and I had oceasion to
make with regard to the lofty metal piers which support railway via-
ducts like that of Garabit, we were led to believe that it was possible
to construct these without any great difficulty of a much greater
height than any hitherto made which did not exceed 230 feet. We
planned on these lines a great pier for a viaduct which should have a
height of 395 feet and a base of 131 feet.

730 THE EIFFEL TOWER.

The result of these studies led me, with a view to the exhibition of
1889, to propose the erection of the tower, now completed, of which the
first plans had been drawn out by two of my chief engineers, Messrs.
Nouguier and Keechlin, and by M. Sauvestre, an architect.

The fundamental idea of these pylons or great archways is based on
a method of construction peculiar to me, of which the principal con-
sists in giving to the edges of the pyramid a curve of such a nature
that this pyramid shall be capable of resisting the force of the wind,
without necessitating the junction of the edges by diagonals, as is
usually done.

On this principal the tower was designed in the form of a pyramid,
with four curved supports, isolated from eacb other and joined only by
the platforms of the different stories. Higher up only, and where the
four supports are suffi ciently close to each other, the ordinary diagonals
are used,

In June, 1886, a commission nominated by M. Lockroy, then min-
ister of commerce and industry, finally accepted the plans I had sub-
mitted to it, and on January 8, 1887, the agreement with the State and
the City of Paris was signed, fixing the conditions under which the
tower was to be constructed.

It is needless to state that considerable energy and perseverance
were required to attain this result, for there was much resistance to
overcome, and my project had many opponents.

But I was sustained by the belief that what I proposed would con.
tribute to the honor of our national industry and to the success of the
exhibition, and it was not without a legitimate sense of satisfaction that
I saw an army of navvies begin, on January 28, 1887, those excavations
at the bottom of which were to rest the four feet of the tower which
had never been out of my thoughts for the last two years.

I felt moreover—in spite of the violent attacks to which my project
had been exposed —that public opinion was on my side, and that a crowd
of unknown friends were ready to honor this bold enterprise as soon as
it took form. The imagination of men was struck by the colossal di-
mensions of the edifice, especially in the matter of height.

The towers of Notre Dame de Paris reach a height of 217 feet; the
Pantheon 260 feet; the dome of the Invalides, which is the highest
monument in Paris, 344 feet; Strasburg Cathedral is 466 feet; the
Great Pyramid of Egypt 479 feet; the Cathedral of Rouen rises 492
feet from the ground, and is only surpassed by Cologne Cathedral,
which, lately completed, attains to 522 feet; but the Americans again
outdid this by erecting at Washington an immense obelisk in masonry
which reaches a height of 555 feet, and was constructed with immense
difficulty.

Experience has shown however that masonry is not suitable for a
construction of the kind. With iron, on the contrary,—of which the
properties are so remarkable, since it may be as readily employed in ten-
eas

sion as in compression, and can be put together perfectly by rivetting—
the execution presented no insurmountable difficulties. Moreover,
metl constructions can now be planned with such accuracy as to sane-
tion the boldness which results from full knowledge.

Lastly, without any desire to flatter our national vanity, I may be
allowed to say that French industry has held and still holds a high
place in Europe in the art of building in iron.

Hence the material of which the tower was to be built was deter-
mined not only by the fact that it rendered construction possible, but
also because it would supply a brilliant example of a modern industry
in which France has been more especially distinguished since its intro-
duction.

The base of the tower consists of four great piers, which bear the
names of the four cardinal points. The first matter which offered itself
for consideration was the question of the solidity of the foundation of
these four piers. <A series of borings showed that the subsoil in the
Champ de Mars was composed of a deep stratum of clay capable of
supporting a weight of between 45 pounds and 55 pounds to the square
inch, surmounted by a layer of sand and gravel of varying depth, ad-
mirably calculated to receive the foundations. The actual position of
the tower was determined by considerations relative to the depth of
this stratum, since it was impossible to rest the piers directly on the
clay. The foundation of each pier is now separated from the clay by
a sufficient thickness of gravel.

Hach of the main supports of the tower rests on blocks of masonry,
and the masonry rests on beds of concrete which cover an area of 60
square meters. In the center of each pile of stone-work, are two great
iron bars 25 feet 6 inches in lengtb and 4 inches in diameter, which, by
means of iron cramps, unite almost all parts of the masonry. This
anchorage, which is not necessary to the stability of the tower—suffi-
ciently assured by its own weight—gives nevertheless additional secu-
rity, and has moreover been useful in the construction of the iron-
work.

It will be seen from the foregoing description that the foundations
are established under conditions of great security, and that in the
choice of materials and in the dimensions ample margin has been
allowed, so as to leave no room for doubt with regard to their solidity.

Nevertheless, to render perfectly certain that the feet of the tower
should remain absolutely level in any event, we have made room, at
the angles of the piers where they rest on the masonry, for hydraulic
presses of 800 tons. By means of these presses each pier can be dis-
placed and raised as much as is vecessary by inserting steel wedges
beneath it.

The raising into place of the iron-work which forms the upper part
of the tower was accomplished by derricks and windlasses. As soon
as the piers reached a height of 100 feet their inclination rendered
132 THE EIFFEL TOWER.

scaffolding necessary to carry on the construction to a height of 169
feet, at which point are established the horizontal beams uniting the
four piers and forming the skeleton of the first story. The solid con-
struction of the first platform was a great step toward the success of
the work.

The raising of the pillars between the first and second platforms was
rapidly accomplished by the same method as that employed between
the ground and the first story, i.e, the pieces of iron were raised by
four cranes attached to the beams of the lift placed in each pier.

The work went forward so rapidly that in July, 1888, the four pillars
were united by the beams of the second story, at a height of 387 feet,
and by the 14th of the month the second platform was fixed, on which
fireworks were displayed at the Féte Nationale.

The erection of that part of the tower comprised between the second
platform and the summit was carried out by means of the same cranes
as had served for the lower part; but these no longer worked on an
inclined plane, but were raised along an upright, formed by the central
guide of the higher lifts.

The total weight of the ironwork in the tower is rather more than
7,000 tons, without counting that in the caissons, which form a portion
of the foundations, or that in the machinery of the lifts.

The different parts of the tower are reached by staircases and lifts
There are easy stairs in the east and west piers, which give access to
the first story, and it is calculated that by using one for ascent and one
for descent they will allow more than two thousand persons to go up
and come down in the hour. From the first platform to the second
there are four winding staircases, one in each pier, and from the second
platform to the summit there is a single winding staircase, which how-
ever (unlike the others) is not intended for the use of visitors, but for
officials only.

On the first platform is a covered gallery, with arcades, whence visi-
tors can enjoy a view of Paris and its environs, as well as of the Exhi-
bition, with four refreshment rooms in the center,—Anglo-American,
Flemish, Russian, and French. On the second story is a second cov-
ered gallery ; and in the center is the station where passengers change
from the lifts which move on an inclined plane of the lower half of the
tower, to the vertical lifts of the upper portion.

On the third story is a great saloon more than 50 feet square, shut
in by glass on all sides, and whence, sheltered from wind and weather,
the spectator can contemplate the magnificent panorama, 45 leagues in
extent, which is displayed beneath him. Above this room are labora-
tories and observatories for scientific purposes, and in the center the
winding stair leading to the light-house whence the electric light shines
over the whole of Paris.

The lifts are on three different systems, and all are provided with
breaks, and otherwise insured against the possibility of serious accident.
THE EIFFEL TOWER. 138

They are all worked by hydraulic power, and together are capable of
conveying 2,350 persons in an hour to the first and second stories, and
750 to the summit, the whole ascent being effected in seven minutes.
If we include the staircases it will be possible for 5,000 persons to visit
the tower in the space of an hour.

The tower is now known to the whole world; it has struck the imagi-
nation of every nation, and inspired the most remote with the desire of
visiting the Exhibition. The press of all countries confirms this state-
ment, and I have myselfreceived continual proofs of the universal curi-
osity and interest excited by the monument.

The visitors who go to the top of the tower have beneath their eyes
a magnificent panorama. At their feet they see the great city, with
its innumerable monuments, its avenues, its towers, and its domes; the
Seine, which winds through it like a long ribbon of steel; farther off,
the green circle of the hills which surround Paris; and beyond these,
again, the wide horizon stretching 112 miles from north to south. At
night the spectacle is no less beautiful. Paris with all its lights is like
fairy-land, but in this aspect it has hitherto been known only to aeron-
auts, on whom its beauty has always made a strong impression. The
construction of the tower will enable thousands to contemplate a spec-
tacle of new and incomparable loveliness.

Then too for scientific and defensive purposes the gigantic monu-
ment will be of great utility. A recent writer, M. Max de Nansouty,
Says:

‘In case of war or seige the movements of the enemy might be ob-
served from the tower within a radius of 50 miles, and that above the
heights which encircle Paris, and on which are constructed our new
fortifications. Had we possessed the tower at the time of the seige of
Paris, in 1870, with the powerful electric lights with which it will be
furnished, who knows if the chances of the strife would not have been
profoundly modified? The tower would be a means of constant and
easy communication between Paris and the provinces by the aid of
optical telegraphy, which has in various forms attained such a remark-
able degree of perfection.”

The tower is itself at such a distance from the fortifications that it is
absolutely out of reach of the enemy’s battery.

It will be moreover a wonderful meteorological observatory, whence
the direction and the force of atmospheric currents can be usefully
studied, from the point of view of science and hygiene, as well as the
condition and the chemical composition of the atmosphere, the amount
of electricity and moisture it contains, the variations of temperature
at different heights, atmospherical polarization, ete. It is specially
adapted for an astronomical observatory; for the purity of the air at
this great height above the low-lying mists, which so often cloud the
horizon of Paris, will allow of a number of observations often impossi-
ble in our climate.
734 THE EIFFEL TOWER.

I will not weary my readers with the enumeration of all the experi-
ments to be made on the tower, of which a programme has been already
drawn up by our scientific men, and which include the study of the fall
of bodies through the air the resistance of the air to varying velocities,
certain laws of elasticity, the study of the compression of gases of
vapors under the pressure of an immense manometer of 400 atmos-
pheres, a new realization on a great scale of Foucault’s pendulum
demonstrating the rotation of the earth, the deviation toward the East
of a falling body, ete., ete. ; lastly, a series of physiological experiments
of the deepest interest.

I may even goso far as to say that there are few scientific men who
do not hope at this moment to carry out, by the help of the tower, some
experiment connected more especially with their own investigations.

Thus it will be an observatory and laboratory such as was never until
now at the disposal of science ; and from the first ail our scientific men
have encouraged me with their warmest sympathy. On my side, and
in order to express in a striking manner that the monument which I
have raised is dedicated to science, I decided to inscribe in letters of
gold on the great frieze of the irst platform, and in the place of honor,
the names of the greatest men of science who have honored France,
from 1789, down to our own day.

Besides all these uses, which I might have explained in greater de-
tail, but which, even in this rapid summary, will serve to show that we
have not erected. an object of barren wonder, the tower possesses in my
eyes a usefulness of a totally different order, which is the true source
of the ardor which has inspired me in my work.

The public at large understood this, and it 1s also the reason of the
very general and warm sympathy which has been displayed toward me.

My object was to show to the whole world that France is a great
country, and that she is still capable of success where others have
failed.

The Scientific American said, in 1874, with reference to the tower of
Philadelphia, destined to celebrate the centenary of the national inde-
pendence: ‘*The character of the project is closely connected with the
purpose of its erection; the hundredth anniversary of our national ex-
istence ought not to be allowed to pass without a permanent memorial,
which an exhibition lasting a few months cannot furnish. It is evident
that in the space of two years no monument of imposing aspect and
original in conception can be constructed with other material than iron;
from every point of view we could not choose a more national construc-
tion. We will celebrate our centenary by the most colossal iron con-
struction that the world has seen.”

Can we not apply to ourselves these words which, remaining a dead
letter in America in 1874, have become for us in France a living reality ?

May I be allowed to recall here a few words which I pronounced in
“THE EIFFEL TOWER. 735

inaugurating the first stage of the tower, and which sum up my ideas
on the subject :

“The beginning was difficult, and criticism as passionate as if was
premature was addressed to me. I faced the storm as best I could,
thanks to the constant support of M. Lokroy, then Minister of Com-
merce and Industry, and I strove by the steady progress of the work
to conciliate, if not the opinion of artists, at least that of engineers
and scientific men. I desired to show, in spite of my personal insignifi-
cance, that France continued to hold a foremost place in the art of iron
construction, in which from tie earliest days her engineers have been
more particularly distinguished, and by means of which they have cov-
ered Europe with the creations of their talent. Doubtless you are not
ignorant that almost all the great engineering works of this nature, in
Austria, Russia, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, are due to French engin-
eers, and the traveller discovers with pride, as he passes through foreign
countries, the traces of their activity and their science.

‘The tower, 1,000 feet high, is before everything a striking manifesta-
tion of our national genius in one of its most modern developments ; and
this is one of the principal reasons for its existence. If I may judge by
the interest which it inspires, abroad as well as at home, I have reason
to believe that my efforts have not been unavailing, and that we may
make known to the world that France continues to lead the world, that
she is the first of the nations to realize an enterprise often attempted or
dreamed of: for man has always sought to build high towers to mani-
fest his power, but he soon recognized that the laws of gravity hampered
him seriously, and that his means were very limited. It is owing to the
progress of science, of the engineer’s art, and of the iron industry, that
we are enabled to surpass in this line the generations which have gone
before us by the construction of this tower, which will be one of the
characteristic feats of modern industry.”

Soit is that I have wished to raise to the glory of modern science, and
for the more especial honor of French industry, a triumphal arch as
striking as those which earlier generations have raised to honor con-
querors.
736 THE EIFFEL TOWER.

THE EIFFEL TOWER.*

By WILLIAM A. Eppy.

A tower about 1,000 feet in height was first thought of during the
organization of the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, in 1876, and
its possible construction was discussed in the newspapers at the time.
But consultation with engineers and architects probably resulted in
the conviction that the scheme was impracticable, and the expense be
yond the value of the investment, especially if masonry were used.
Aside from the question of outlay, a serious difficulty in the construc-
tion of any kind of material to such an altitude, there are questions of
pressure and danger that daunt experienced engineers. M. G. Wiffel,
constructor of some of the greatest works in France, notably the trestle-
work viaduct at Garabit, 407 feet high, concluded that the building of
such a tower had not been attempted in ancient timés, so far as known,
because iron construction then lacked the lightness, strength, and adapt-
ability seen in modern work. The enormous weight of masonry in so
great a mass would not only imperil, by its tremendous pressure, the
courses of stone near the ground, but would cause an irregular settling
of the foundations, as in the well-known ipstance of the Leaning Tower
of Pisa. In modern work, a pressure of 66 pounds for each square cen-
timetert is considered dangerous. It is admitted that 55 pounds in
this proportion is too extreme for safety, although, owing to peculiari-
ties of construction, this has been exceeded in some of the following
instances cited by M. Navier:

M. Navier includes an estimate of 99.25 pounds for the church of La
Toussant 4 Angers, which is in ruins, and so not a convincing example.
It thus appears that the resistance in some daring structures is from
33 to 44 pounds, and only rises to nearly 65 in two instances. M.
Hiffel cites the Washington Monument, which in its simplicity and
boldness he considers remarkable. In M. Navier’s estimates given for
thé greatest feats of architectural engineering in the Old World, this

huge obelisk stands high on the list of wonderful structures, the press-
ure at its base amounting to 58.35 pounds in the proportion above
given. With the exception of the Hiffel tower, it is easily a bolder
undertaking than any other of its hind known in the world, because it
stands upon a relatively small base, with no side support, with a weight
upon its foundations of 45,000 tons. This immense square shaft, about
55 feet on a side, served as an illustration of the danger in attempting
to carry masonry to a greater height than before achieved. Fortu-
nately, the foundation settled evenly, but to prevent probable demo.
lition, part of the base was re-constructed and filled in with concrete.
Meantime the structure began to lean to an extent that caused great
uneasiness, and finally the suspension of the work. The construction
was begun in 1848, and in 1854, when it reached a height of 152 feet,
its dangerous condition became somewhat marked. Its original in-
tended altitude of 600 feet was then reduced to 500. In 1880, after
great difficulties, the base had been widened and the foundation en-
larged and deepened. Work was then recommenced, and the masonry
continued upward at the rate of about 100 feet yearly, until the top-
most stone was laid December 6, 1884. The inauguration took place
February 21, 1885.

An additional source of peril in the use of masonry, not included in
the danger of settling, as in the Washington Monument, is the insuffi-
cient adherence of modern mortar to great masses of stone, causing
serious crumbling, and a reputation for danger much to be dreaded.
An attempt to extend stone work to a height of 1,000 feet would cause
an expense too great for the end attained, and the danger of fracture
would be incessant and unavoidable. It seems that we can excel the
ancients very little in the treatment of masonry. There is no easily
discovered evidence that they built any such structure higher than the
great Pyramid of Cheops, originally 450 feet in height. They had good
reasons for this caution. If the foundations are solid, the stone may
disintegrate, owing to the unequal distribution of the enormous weight,
due to the limited power of the mortar to act as a cushion to equalize
the force. The Egyptian and other ancient builders constructed some
masonry without mortar by polishing and closely fitting the stone, but
jt is not probable that they tried to carry such work to a very great
height. In some modern buildings it is found that the resistance of
very hard stone increases that of the mortar. Stone or brick work
might reach a higher point than the Eiffel tower by the invention of
cements more efficient than any now known,

In considering the important question of the foundations for this
great tower, elaborate borings were made in the Champ-de-Mars at
Paris. This is a level field or park, about two thirds of a mile long and
half as broad, devoted usually to the drilling of troops and to reviews,
upon which the Exposition buildings for 1889, are now approaching
completion, in commemoration of the storming of the Bastile one hun-

dred years ago, July 14 and 15, 1789, that memorable event of the
French Revolution. It is intended to show the great advances in sci-
ence, art, and industry, since that crude attempt to establish a republic.

In selecting this location near the river Seine, much thought was
given to the question of a foundation, because even a slight giving way
would be so magnified in the great height of the structure’ that the
strain sustained by cross-pieces and braces would be far greater than
calculated. Fortunately, it was found that the soil consisted of a com-
pact bed of plastic clay, 53 feet in thickness, surmounted by a bank of
sand and gravel, and all inclined toward the Seine. This seemed well
fitted for the purpose. M. Hiffel was not however entirely satisfied
with it. He therefore increased the solidity of the foundations by
means of caissons (heavy iron boxes with open bottoms) of compressed
air which made their way downward into the soil partly by their own
weight and partly by the excavation of the earth beneath them. The
air prevented the possible rising of soft clay to smother the workmen.
Incandescent electric lamps furnished light beneath the caissons, which
were filled with heavy concrete that hardened, making as it were huge
bricks of great solidity that sank still deeper. It was owing to this
modern device, the compressed-air caisson, that a great danger was
averted. The remains of unquestionably ancient masonry were found,
which might have caused a dangerously uneven settling of the founda-
tion. At each corner of the tower, which is square at the base and
about 300 feet on a side, there is a lattice-work pillar that slants inward
as it rises upward to a distance of about 600 feet from the ground,
from which point the four like pillars continue together to the summit.
These corner pillars are each 50 feet square at their bases, and are
connected by open curved arches. Any unimportant subsidence of the
foundation is provided for by hydraulic presses applied to iron wedges
that lift each corner of the entire structure, and so any defect or strain
due to contraction or expansion can be regulated. The relative light-
ness and strength ef the material is such that the total weight will not
be more for each square centimeter than that of a usual five-story
house, certainly not as great as in very high buildings in New York
and other large cities. The pressure upon the base of the tower is not
more than 9 pounds for each square centimeter, while in the case of the
Washington Monument it is, as we have seen, more than 58 pounds in
like proportion.

The foundations became practicable, but there was a powerful and
irregular force involved in the tremendous side pressure of the wind
upon a tower presenting so much vertical surface in spite of its open
lattice-work. It is evident that the height of the great Washington
Monument has been surpassed only by the use of iron, which has the
power to bend and still resist the force of the wind and which is well
able to witbstand marked contractions and expansions. The horizon-
tal vibration is considerable under a high wind, at such a distance
THE EIFFEL TOWER. 139

above the earth. The swaying of the long curved uprights will not be
felt much by people at the summit. The height of the tower is such
that the nature of the motion is gradual and less observable than in
light-houses constructed of masonry, in which the elasticity is some-
times remarkable, owing to the quality of the mortar used. It is in
recent years only that metallic beams have been made that enable
engineers to erect structures to a height of 200 feet. Still further ad-
vances in the manufacture of iron make it now easy to attain 250 or
even 350 feet. So many unknown quantities require consideration in a
tower 1,000 feet high that the problem becomes serious and hard to
solve. M. Hiffel points out the significant fact that the obstacles re-
semble those met with in extending a bridge from 500 feet to twice that
distance horizontally, because of the great and accumulating side pres-
sure of the wind exerted upon high vertical structures. It is thus seen
that the construction is a greater achievement than would be at first
imagined. It was desirable, while estimating the tremendous wind
pressure, to avoid the multiplication of upright beams, involving diag-
onal braces more than 300 feet in length, which would result in an im-
mense ugly iron fraine-work resembling an elongated cage, or trestle-
work railway bridge set up on end, with a deplorable architectural
effect. Clumsy masses of beams and braces were necessarily omitted.
The curved lattice-work before mentioned disposed of this question.

The corner pillars narrow from about 50 feet on a side at the base to
16 feet near the summit. They are anchored on solid foundation walls,
and above, are bound together by horizontal girders, which serve as
supports for several large halls or assembly rooms at different heights.
These floors increase the security of the structure. The uncertainty of
the wind force and its extent as calculated has led M. Eiffel to be pecu-
liarly prudent in his methods of construction. He assumes for purposes
of safety that the force goes on increasing from the base to the summit
until the pressure is doubled. In making estimates of resistance the
iron lattice-work was considered a solid wall taking the full force of
the wind. In the more open parts of the tower the actual surface of
the iron was multiplied by four to secure safety from the effects of a
severe tempest. The wind in Paris ordinarily exerts a strain of from
13 to 15 pounds for each square meter.* A pressure of 22 pounds is
allowed for in Germany, and Austria, in metallic frame works not sub-
jected to the tremors of passing trains. This rulealso holds in France.
But it becomes necessary to provide for a much severer strain when
only one end of the structure is supported, as in the Eiffel tower.

The inclination of the stone-work supporting each corner is at an
angle of 50°. In extending upward the slanting ponderous iron-work,
it was very difficult to maintain absolute stability, especially before the
masses had been made secure by girders at the first gallery. As the
work progressed this danger of displacement (requiring the utmost

*39.37 inches on a side,
740 THE EIFFEL TOWER.

care) was lessened by the decreasing length of the girders that bound
the whole together. In high trestle work, the apparently slight metallic
bars seem insecure to the casual observer, an effect peculiarly notice-
able in the high skeleton iron-work of the Manhattan Elevated Rail-
road near Eighth avenue and One hundred and tenth street, New
York City. The spindling frame work, in this case suggests weakness;
but this is an illusion due to an association of strength with the pon-
derous solidity of masonry or earth-work.

The tower is spread much at the base to enhance its stability. Per-
haps its height is exaggerated by the distant view of buildings in the
Exposition grounds. The first gallery, which consists of an immense
hall, is to be used as a promenade or for restaurants. IJt is 230 feet
from the ground. Still further up is the second gallery, about 100 feet
square and at a height of 377 feet, which exceeds the altitude of the
following well-known structures:

Continuing up the Hiffel tower until it has narrowed to about 75 feet
on a side we come to a point where the four great pillars combine, at
about the height of the Washington Monument, the next highest
known structure in the world. Only three of the following publie edi-

After adding 306 feet to the height of the Washington Monument,
making 861 feet, the third gallery of the Hiffel tower is reached, where
there is a glass-inclosed room 32 feet square, surrounded by a balcony.
Surmounting this and 124 feet higher is a small observation room, with
two windows on a side, from which can be seen Paris and its environs
for a radius of about 75 miles.

The elevators, four in number, are to be worked in pairs, two to be
used for. visitors ascending and two for those descending, that an in-
cessant stream of people may move in each direction. The ascent is
to be made no faster than 20 inches a second, because great speed in
stopping and starting would be decidedly alarming and disagreeable.

The escape of lightning is to be provided fer by twu east-iron con-
ducting pipes, about 20 inches in diameter, reaching from the summit to
the base and thence 60 feet into the ground, —
THE EIFFEL TOWER, 741

The construction of a tower composed of curves that will best with-
stand the wind has produced a very graceful architectural outline. The
air of trimness in the realization of the design is due to the fact that
there has been no waste of material. An upward moving force in tak-
ing the direction of least resistance would doubtless assume approxi-
mately the form of this structure. Nearly all kinds of growth acquire
something like this cone shape while manifesting concentrated motion
necessitated by surrounding forces. Many beautiful designs are founded
upon the tapering forms of flowers and of leaves, as in the delicate
tracery of frost-work. In building to secure safety from the action of
the elements, M. Eiffel has perhaps unintentionally followed the meth-
ods of nature, and thus the arechitecural beauty of his work has the best
possible confirmation.

The well-worn criticism that this scheme lacks utility is ever present
in all daring scientific enterprises. But the value of this tower is ad-
mitted by eminent French scientists. It will take the place of the great
balloon let up into the air by means of a cable worked by steam, which
was so suecessful during the Exposition of 1878. An aseent ean be
made without the danger of collapse or gas explosion caused by light-
ning, often present in a captive balloon. The unexpectedly rapid ap-
proach of a local storm might cause loss of life before the winding-in of
a balloon couid be completed. The view of Paris at night, with its
seemingly interminable boulevards brilliantly lighted, is marvellous,
and such as aeronauts only have witnessed. The feeling of distance
and height will not be lessened by intervening lower slopes as in most
mountain views. «

It is proposed to put upon the tower a number of electric lamps,
powerful enough to light thecity. The advantage of sucha system had
been long thought of, but it was a very difficult project to carry out,
owing to the great intensity necessary. It has been decided however
that the Exposition buildings and grounds are to be lighted in a man-
ner never before equalled. In 1881, M. Sebillot proposed to place elec-
tric lights at an elevation of 1,000 feet, but the idea involved difficulties
of construction and a waste of illumination that made it impracticable.
It has been found that to make printed matter sufficiently legible in the
park and gardens of the Exposition, not less than three concentric zones,
numbering forty-eight lamps, would be required at so great a height.
With special reflecting mirrors concentrating the light within prescribed
limits, it is believed that the effect would be better than anything be-
fore accomplished, so far as known.

Many eminent men promptly admit the value of the tower for scien-
tific purposes. M. Hervé-Mangon, of the Meteorological Society of
France, points out the importance of observations made at different dis-
tances from the earth’s surface under these conditions, and that experi-
ments of the greatest interest are possible. The law of the decrease of
the temperature with the height would be demonstrated better than
742 THE EIFFEL 'TOWER.

from high points of land or from vast structures of masonry, which re-
tain much heat, causing currents of air that interfere with observations
or make them inexact. The variability of rain-fall could be well ob-
served, also the average height to which fogs reach above the earth’s
surface near Paris. <A relatively complete knowledge might be gained
of the volume of water held in different air strata. This would make
clear the reason why clouds light in volume sometimes precipitate so
much water. As the condition of the air varies with the height, the
advantage of having instruments far enough apart, one above the
other, is obvious. On calm days, the general direction of the wind
would be free from the effect of local heat accumulation due to the in-
fluence of neighboring buildings. All these phenomena could be care-
fully observed at a height to which only balloons ascend for an appre-
ciable length of time. At this distance from the ground, the atmos-
pheric conditions, freed from the surroundings of a mountainous or
hilly region, are not precisely known.

A position above the fogs that very often obscure the horizon of Paris
will facilitate astronomical observations impossible in ordinary weather.
The vibration of the tower will doubtless exclude it from use in obtain-
ing the precise positions of the stars, as pointed out by some astrono-
mers, but it will leave the field free to researches regarding the chemi-
eal constituents of the stellar universe. Observations intended to es-
tablish the proper motions of stars by the displacement of lines in the
spectrum would be more exact at a height of 1,000 feet than at that of
the observatories. Photographie apparatus at the summit of the tower
would be moré efficient in case of an eclipse near the horizon, but work
upon stars or nebule, requiring steadiness of position, ought to be re-
served for calm nights. In every case the moon and the planets could
be studied and drawn under more favorable conditions. The known
temperature of the air at different heights is also of great importance
in astronomical observations, because the resulting variation in refrac-
tion is so often a matter of conjecture.

In addition to the above experiments in meteorology, electrical science,
and astronomy, there remain to be considered further questions of vege-
table chemistry, peculiarities of growth under various conditions, and
more exact data respecting the material constituents floating in the air.
Further and finer investigations can be made, showing with additional
interest the value of Foucault’s well-known pendulum experiment de-
monstrating the rotation of the earth. The possible relation between
magnetism and gravitation, which Faraday investigated with a falling
body, might be carried further with advantage.

The instantaneous transmission of time signals for the benefit of all
Paris, the more exact measurement of the velocity of sound under
various atmospheric conditions, the estimated resistance of the air as a
body falls at given rates of speed, the law of metallic elasticity. in the
contraction and expansion of the iron-work of the structure, the study

of compressed gases and vapors with such extensive vertical possibili
ties,—these are some of the objecis to be attained by this tower, des-
tined to be one of the landmarks of scientife advancement. It may be
of use as an army signal station in case of war as a position from which
to observe the movement of an enemy. Ata time of siege or of inter-
ruption to telegraphic communication the tower could be used as a cen-
ter for optical military signaling for long distances, such as the 70
miles from Paris to Rouen. In such instances an answering signal
might be sent from a high hill near at hand.

The immense outlay of work in this great structure cost only 6,500,000
franes, $1,300,000. There are twenty-seven iron panels, each of which
required a separate diagram, that in turn formed the basis of a series
of geometrical designs calculated by means of tables of logarithms.
The metallic pieces number about twelve thousand, and the position of
each, and the places for its rivets, had to be decided without error. In
the iron plates were drilled 7,000,000 holes, which if placed end to end
would form a tube 43 miles long. There were five hundred engineers’
designs, and twenty-five hundred leaves of working drawings. It was
necessary to employ forty designers and calculators, for a period of
about two years. Itis thus seen that the iron forms a vast complicated
net-work not easily realized when contemplating the gracefulness of
the completed tower. The large halls at Levallois-Perret had almost
the appearance of a government administration.

M. Eiffel did not employ workmen of special skill, acsustomed to very
high scaffolding. It was feared that few could be found not subject to
vertigo. But in the tower they did not work high in the air, with an
open and dangerous footing. They were on platforms 41 feet wide, and
as calm as on the ground.

Itis proper that two great republics should, regardless of nationality,
recognize the constructive genius of M. Hiffel, as they have already
done in the instance of M. Bartholdi, designer and constructor of the
wonderful statue of Liberty enlightening the World. Mr. Roebling’s
great work, the Brooklyn Bridge, thus seems extended into new condi-
tions. The idea of a tower 1,000 feet high first assumed definite form,
it will be remembered, in the United States, and it remained for a man
of constructive genius in another and newer republic to crystallize it
into an accomplished fact*. The power of thought over the refractory
materials of the earth, as shown by the ingenuity of Thomas A. Edison,
a power which Emerson illustrated in various ways, is thus emphasized
anew. The limits of scientific achievement slowly recede.

* The tower is designed to be 300 meters (984 feet) high. A slight addition, mak-
ing it 1,000 feet, could be easily made.
THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE AT THE PARIS EXHIBITION.*

Some time before the opening of the Paris Exhibition it was announced
that one of tbe attractions of the show would be a great terrestrial globe,
one millionth of the actual size of the earth. The globe is now exhib-
ited in a buildivg specially erected, near the Eiffel Tower, for the pur-
pose, and it excites the warmest interest among all visitors who have
devoted the slightest attention to geographical science. It was designed
by MM. Villard and Cotard, and these gentlemen, who have received
many congratulations on their success, have lately issued an account
of the manner in which their project has been realized.

Maps on a plane surface give, of course, a very inadequate impression
of the real appearance of our planet; and ordinary globes are too small
to indicate, even vaguely, the extent of the spaces represented on them.
The idea of making a globe one millionth the size of the earth deserves,
therefore, to be described as a*‘happy thought,” for although the mean-
ing of a million may not be fully appreciated, it is not absolutely inac-
cessible to the human mind. When we see a place or a district marked
on a globe, and learn that the reality is a million times larger, the pro-
portions are impressively suggested, with at least some approach to
accuracy.

The diameter of the globe constructed by MM. Villard and Cotard is
12.73 meters, (42 feet). It has a circumference of 40 meters (131 feet),
and a millimeter of its surface represents a kilometer (a little more
than 153 miles to the inch). The globe consists of an iron frame-work
made chiefly of meridians united to a central core. This structure
is carried by a pivot resting on an iron support. To the meridians
pieces of wood are attached, and on these are fixed the panels compos-
ing the surface of the globe. These panels are made of sheets of card-
board bent by hand to the required spherical shape, and covered with
plaster specially hardened. Fig. 1 shows how they are applied to the
underlying structure. The total surface is divided into forty spindle-
shaped spaces, the breadth of which at the equator is exactly one meter.
Each “spindle” or gore is itself sub-divided, so that there are 600 panels
of various dimensions. The designs are painted on the panels before
they are put in their place, in order that the globe may ultimately be
easily dismantled and removed.

distant about 150 kilometers (93 miles.) The diameter of a globe repre-

admiration in the age of Louis xIv, but it has only a diameter of about
5 meters, and is much less effective for its purpose than its successor in

GEOGRAPHICAL LATITUDE.

By WALTER B. ScAIFE, PH. D. (Vienna).

Introduction.—TLhe designation of the situation of places on the sur-
face of the earth by their latitude and longitude is such a common oe-
currence that one rarely stops to ask how these quantities are deter-
mined, much less to consider the evolution of the ideas which form the
basis of the usage, or to study the slow progress of events through
which (even after the theory was perfected) accuracy of observation and
measurement was first made possible, while new and improved meth-
ods were being invented for representing the results thereof. Though
latitude and longitude are so intimately connected in usage and thought,
the methods of determining them are different, and each has its own
peculiar historical development. Hence they can be separately treated
without injury to the whole subject; and this article accordingly is
confined to the consideration of the historical evolution of geographical
latitude alone.

The word latitude, signifying breadth, was adopted by the early geog-
raphers to designate situation to the north or south, in contradistince-
tion to east and west, because the then known world was longer from
east to west, which was hence called the length, than from north to
south, which was then naturally styled the breadth.’ The fact that
the earth is spherical and so can have, accurately speaking, no length or
breadth, has not altered the nomenclature adopted in the infancy of the
science. The technical meaning of the word latitude now includes how-
ever much more than the crude idea of mere distance north or south of a
given point. It takes for granted the sphericity of the earth and its
division by imaginary lines running east and west, whose distances from
each other, though not exactly equal, mark the intersection with the
earth’s surface of plumb lines forming equal angles, each one to the
next.?

The very fact of thinking of the earth as a whole shows that an in-
dividual or a people has made considerable progress in civilization, for

' Ptolemus, Geographica, lib, i, cap. vi. The origin of the idea is ascribed to
Democritus of Abderos. (D’Avezac, Coup d’cil, 286, note 10; Lelewel, 1, vi.)
*When we speak of the latitude of a place, then, we mean in reality not its dis-
tance from the equator, measured on the earth’s surface, but the angle which a plumb
line at that place forms with the plane of the equator,

among savages this conception seems to be lacking. But as soon as one
forms an idea of the whole and begins to comprehend its vastness,
there arises the necessity of systematic division, in order to avoid men-
tal confusion. Even among fairly educated people of to-day, there ex-
ists frequently no adequate conception of the size of the various conti-
nents, not to speak of the earth asa whole. Thoughtful men at an
early period recognized this necessity of division and hit upon a rude
method for establishing one; but there was a long distance between
the first crude trials and the marvellous accuracy of the methods, in-
struments, and results of the present. From the conception to the at-
tempt at pictorial representation was a step which was certain sooner
or later to be taken, and progress in the art of map-making has held
equal pace with the advance of geographical science.

Sphericity of earth—As the theories of the orientals as to the form
and nature of the earth generally rested upon fantasy, and not upon a
scientific basis, they may be neglected in the consideration of the sub-
ject in hand, and the attention beat once directed to the Greeks,! who
created the science of geography.

The beginnings of astronomy and geography were very closely con-
nected; not as now, when the earth is recognized as a mere atom in
the immensity of the universe, but considering the earth as the very
center, toward which all was attracted”? and around which the uni-
verse revolved.2 As to who first taught the doctrine of the sphericity
of the earth it is difficult to decide. To Thales,‘ Parmenides,°® and
Pythagoras,® respectively, this honor is ascribed. However that may
be, there was scientific proof of the doctrine lacking till the great
minds of Aristotle and Archimedes took the subject in hand.” Before
scientific grounds were arrived at, various reasons were given by the
several philosophers for their opinions. The well known one of the
Pythagorean school, that the earth, being the center of the universe,
must have the most perfect form, viz, spherical, is perhaps as good as
any. Strabo, although much later, considers it sufficient to maintain
that the spherical form of the earth follows, as a matter of course, from
the construction of the universe.’

qwil nous faut chercher lorigine et les monuments d’une science quwils ont créée et
que seuls ils ont eu les moyens de créer.”

Lelewel, vii. ‘Ils [les Grecs] ont pu voir et examiner les cartes égyptiennes, phé-
niciennes et des orientaux: mais il n’y trouvaient rien pour leur schéme, qu’ils élabo-
raient sur leur propre terrain.”

It was early seen that the earth, with its numerous elevations and
depressions, could not be a perfect sphere ;! which Strabo in truly phil-
osophical manner avoids by remarking that in immensity things so
small disappear.? Pliny however offers another solution of the sub-
ject by maintaining that an ideal circumference resting on the tops of
the mountains would form a perfect sphere. Although, as has been
shown, a few learned specialists among the Greeks and Romans believed
and taught that the earth is spherical, this belief not only never
descended to the masses, but was rejected by such scholarsas Herodotus?
and Tacitus. °

First circles.—The comprehension of a subject often involves two
processes of thought, viz, a conception of the whole, which is then
divided into parts, in order by the investigation of the several parts
to arrive at length at a just understanding of the whole. In this man-
ner the science of geography has been brought to its present high
level. There could be no other divisions of the surface of the earth
than those arising out of natural physical features or of political
borders, before man had formed an idea of the whole. Having arrived
at this point, it was a natural step that the five circles by which Thales
had divided the heavens® should be applied to the earth’s surface.’
Strabo quotes Poseidonius as authority for regarding Parmenides as
the inventor of the division into five zones, who however made the
torrid zone extend beyond the tropics, to which limits it was re-
duced by Aristotle. The latter however is also criticised by Strabo
for making the “burned” zone too broad, inasmuch as at least half
the distance between the Tropic of Cancer and the equator is known to
be inhabited. As it was accepted as fact that the ‘ burned” zone was
uninhabitable, its northern limit could not extend farther than the
southern boundary of Ethiopia.s Later Strabo seems to have forgotten
his objection to Aristotle’s division and himself adopts the zones as

exactly corresponding to the five circles of the heaven.! Pliny, on the
other hand, takes the names of the zones literally, and considers the
whole torrid zone uninhabitable, and so preventing all intercourse
between the two temperate zones.”

The Greeks however did not arrive at one bound at the exact divis-
ion of the earth’s surface. The starred heavens passed over their heads,
making it impossible to see and study much while remaining at the
same place. Exact knowledge of the world was not thus attainable;
practical information gained by observation and travel was necessary
as a foundation for the complete application to geography of the lines of
astronomy. Though adopting theoretically the five main parallels of
the astronomers, the early geographers felt the necessity of having a
working basis; and, leaving the equator at one side as a practically un-
known quantity, they adopted as a central line, a parallel passing
through a place, (Rhodes,*) not only important in itself, but also for
them, the practical middle between the north and south, inhabited world.
This line was proposed by Eratosthenes, and passed from the Pillars of
Hercules through the Strait of Messina, Southern Greece, Rhodes, then
on through Asia to the mountains forming the (imaginary) northeast
boundary of India| This parallel is known as the Diaphragm, and
is generally supposed to have been so named by the Greeks,® but a
modern French investigator says he was unable to find this designation
among the ancient Greek geographers.® Following the policy of em-
ploying an arbitrary line as a center, largely if not mainly because of
its local importance, other parallels to the north and south were adopted
because they passed through well known places. The spaces thus
divided off, had no fixed arithmetical relation, but were supposed to mark
climatical differences, and received hence the name climates. Eratos-
thenes made a division of the entire known earth into four great rect-
angles which he called Sphragides,’ and these in turn into twelve eli-
mates. The latter were reduced to eight by Hipparchus,® and later
increased until they became, in the work of Ptolemy, twenty-three."
However, the division of the earth into five zones, as is now cus-
tomary, was adopted by Parmenides, sanctioned by the authority of

Aristotle! and accepted by Strabo, although the latter expressly says,
the whole of the “ burned” (torrid) zone is not rendered uninhabitabie
by excessive heat, “as we conclude from the Aithiopians above
Egypt.”? At the same time the theoretical division of circles into
equal parts was not lost sight of. From Babylon the Greeks received
the duodecimal division of the Kcliptic, from which was developed the
present custom of dividing a circle into 360 degrees. The latter was
also borrowed from Babylon,’ or first proposed by Hipparchus;* but
for a long time gave way to the Eratosthenian division into 60 degrees,°
until revived and made popular by the authority of Ptolemy. - Cleom-
edes proposed a division into 48 degrees, allowing 4 toeach sign of the
zouiac,® but seems to have had no following.

Methods and instruments.—In these days of exact scientific research
one can scarcely realize the crudity of method and the indifference to
exactness which characterize the work of many of the scholars of
antiquity, and this is-particularly striking in their geographical in-
vestigations.7, Not only did they accept the tales of sailors as facts,
and found theories thereon,’ but they were so easy-going as not to
hesitate to change the result of their most careful calculations in order
to have round numbers to work with.? That the sun changes its posi-
tion in the heavens at the different seasons of the year and that the
length of shadows varies accordingly, were matters of early obser-
vation; also that the duration of the longest day is different according
to position north orsouth. These facts combined furnisied the earliest
basis for determining latitude. The known account of the well at
Syene, directly over which the sun stood at noon at the summer
solstice, whether true or not,'® gives an idea of the rude method of
determining astronomical, or in this case also geographical points,

then in vogue. Accepted as true, it was made the basis of the geo-
graphical latitude of antiquity. The parallel of Syene was hence con-
sidered the Tropie of Cancer, aud from this point distances and degrees
were computed north and south.

The only scientific method then known. of determining latitude
was by observing the length of shadow cast, either at the equinox
or summer solstice, by a simple instrument called a gnomon. It
has been suggested that the obelisks of Egypt served this purpose.!
Two varieties of this instrument are mentioned as in use among
the ancients. One was formed by a hollow hemisphere having in
its center an upright whose length was equal to the radius of the
sphere; so that the proportional length of the shadow to the distance
between the base of the upright and the periphery of the hemisphere,
as observed at the summer solstice, gave the proportion of the
distance of the place of observation between the Tropic of Cancer
and the north pole. This instrument is said to have been imported
from the Chaldeans,’ and used only by Eratosthenes among the Greeks.°
The usual form of gnomon had a flat base, and the latitude of the
place of observation was indicated by the ratio of the length of
the shadow to the upright, as observed at the equinox. Whether
this instrument was brought from the East or invented inde-
pendently in Greece, it seems impossible to decide. There is prob-
ably no good reason for doubting that it was already in use
among the Chinese eleven hundred years before Christ. But with
them directly the Greeks had no intercourse. Bailly, who finds the
beginning of all things in the Orient and allows the Greeks no in-
ventive genius whatever, relates that Pherecides erected such an in-
strument on an island in the Syrian Sea, and that Anaximander
perhaps carried the knowledge thereof to Greece,® while Pliny ascribes
its invention to Anaximenes of Miletus, a pupil of Anaximander,’ and
a modern investigator of great learning maintains that Pytheas ‘is
the first of whom it is historically certain that he determined the
altitude of the pole of a place by the length of the sun’s shadow.”?

Be that as it may, this instrument must be recognized as one of the
most important aids to the early development of geography, and,
whether borrowed or invented by the Greeks, they deserve the credit
of having made the best use of it. In all probability the number of
places whose latitude was determined by its use was exceedingly
limited,' as the geographers employed other means also for attaining
the same end. The rising and setting of certain fixed stars served as
one basis for calculating the latitude of places, while even untrust-
worthy data as to climate, wind, color of inhabitants, varieties of
animals, vegetable products, etc., were used to supply the lack of better
kinds of information. The ancients were right in considering the
length of the longest day an important factor in determining latitude,
and Hipparchus is said to have calculated what it should be for each
degree.2 However, the want of accurate time-pieces rendered it im-
possible to make exact observations. As to the instruments em-
ployed for astronomical observations we know almost nothing. Hip-
parchus, who was an ardent advocate of using the results of astronom-
ical observation for geographical purposes, does not mention by name
a single instrument which he employed, nor does he use even the generic
term instrument.’ Eratosthenes used the hollow gnomon (mentioned
above) to determine the latitude of Alexandria, and at his request the
king ordered to be made and placed on the roof of the museum the
famous armillary spheres, with which he determined the declination of
the Eeliptiec to within six minutes of arc, a praiseworthy exactness for
that age.” T'o this may be added the known fact of Ptolemy’s use of
the astrolabe at Rhodes*® and the invention of the sun-dial by Anaxi-
mander.? With such simple means were the beginnings of the science
of geography made.

Application.—It is difficult for us to realize the length of time re.
quired to make such small- advances as have been indicated, but the
history of other branches of science is parallel. The inertia to be over-
come in advancing from utter ignorance of a subject to the commence-
ment of real knowledge, and founding the principles on which investi-
gation should be carried on, is immense. Knowledge does not spring
into being, Minerva-like, completely developed, but resembles much
more the insignificant acorn, which, slowly growing and battling with
the elements, becomes in the course of time the mighty oak. Ages may
pass in the almost unheeded dreaming and theorizing of philosophers

and investigators before a science is matured ready for prosaic, worldly
application. So for example were the calculations (though erroneous)
of the old Greeks one day to bear practical fruit by encouraging Co-
lumbus to make the famous voyage which resulted in the discovery of
America.

These humble beginnings and the men who made them are then not
to be despised because no more was effected, but much rather, to be
honored that under the circumstances so much was accomplished.
They might perhaps have made more progress, had they theorized less
as to how far north and south the earth is inhabitable,' a matter neces-
sarily beyond their power of determination, and instead of that have
spent their energies in more accurately investigating that which lay at
hand. There is however a strong temptation in all men to strive for
the attainment of the unknowable; and, whether this tendency leads
to religious enthusiasm, spiritualism, or philosophical dreaming, it is but
taking on different forms of expression of the same factor in human nat-
ure. Accordingly we must not blame the early geographers even if
the number of places where the altitude of the pole was actually ob-
served does not exceed half a dozen.? There were very few specialists,
and they without co-operation; travelling was difficult and expensive,

and general interest in geographica! theory practically null. Further-’

more, they knew their observations did not give perfectly exact results ;°
but thought that Jay in the nature of the work to be done, and not in
defects of their theories or instruments.

Their base line was the parallel of Syene, which they reckoned in
round numbers to be in latitude 24° N., instead of the true latitude of
24° 5/ 23.” But they made a still greater mistake in accepting the
same parallel as the Tropic of Cancer;* although Eratosthenes’s caleu-
lation is supposed to have given 23° 51/ 19/.5 for that line, and Ptole-
meus quotes Hipparchus as employing 23° 51/ 20.”° After the twenty-
fourth parallel, the one most frequently referred to was probably that
of Alexandria, the great commercial center of the age, from which voy-
agers toward all directions calculated distances, which calculations were
much relied upon for fixing latitude. It was accordingly recognized as
of prime importance to determine its true latitude, the result showing
30° 58/5 instead of 319° 11,’7 according to recent observations. Rhodes,
through which the “ Diaphragm” passed, was said to be on the thirty-

fahrungen thun konnte.”

sixth parallel,' although they knew that that was not exact.2 Other
points whose latitude is given by Hipparchus are Athens, 36°; Alex-
andria in Troas, 41°; Byzantium and Massilia (Marseilles), 43°; Syra-
cuse, 36° 44’; mouth of the Xanthus in Lycia, also 36° 44’; and Baby-
lon, 33° 30’.. One of the easy-going methods of the early geographers
was to bring as many places of importance as possible on the same
parallel, of which there are several lists. That this at best could
be only an approximation to the truth, and that opinions would neces-
sarily vary, is amatter of course. One well known case gives a strik-
ing example, viz: Strabo’s rather sharp criticism of Hipparchus for
placing Byzantium on the same parallel with Massilia and then him-
self making the still greater error of placing the former to the north,‘
while in reality it is more than 2 degrees farther south... Hipparchus
dreamed of the possibility of fixing the locations of all places on the
surface of the earth by the use of a common standard, viz, that of lat-
itude and longitude, ® and did all in his power to show his successors
how to attain that possibility. But all were not willing to follow the
lines laid down by him, and even so good and late a geographer as
Strabo combated his theory, while not being able to propose a better
and in fact adopting in great part that which he condemned.’ First
at the hands of Marinus of Tyre ® and of Ptolemy ° was made a prac-
tical application on a large scale of the ideas of Hipparchus, which
even now form the basis of our usage.

Maps.—The use of maps dates from a very early period. Like first
essays in general they must have been very crude. In the first place
their makers had an extremely imperfect knowledge of the earth, and
what is not accurately known can not be pictorially well represented.
Moreover, there is an inherent difficulty in the matter, owing to the
sphericity of the earth, whose form necessitates distortion of some sort
when represented on a flat surface. If drawn in perspective, as one
looking at the earth from some distant point in space would see it, the
portions toward the circumference of the resulting circle become falsely
curved and much too narrow for their length. If drawn according to
Mercator’s projection, the meridians remain parallel instead of converg-
ing at the poles, and so give a false picture of the comparative breadth
of bodies of land and water at the equator and to the north and south.
So each possible kind of projection on a plane surface has its peculiar

accompanying distortion. As to how the earliest maps were drawn, we
have no exact information; but they were in all probability mere
sketches of the outlines of known lands, with a river and a city here
and there indicated, without any thought of perspective.' As to who
projected the first map of the world based on scientific principles, mod-
ern critics are not agreed ; but it seems probable that it originated with
Eratosthenes and was greatly improved by Hipparchus.2. This was
called a “ planisphere ” and supposed the known world hollow as seen
from a point on the opposite surface of the earth, directly vis-a-vis to
the center of the part represented.? Hipparchus, dividing the distance
between the equator and the poles into 90 degrees, according to the di-
vision of the entire circle into 360 degrees, drew for each degree a paral-
lel of latitude, and, knowing himself the true latitude of but few places,
gave the astronomical conditions for determining it as groundwork for
his successors.* Strabo,we have seen,did not favor Hipparchus’s mani-
fold divisions of latitude ;° but he himself did not attempt to project a
new map, preferring the easier method of making changes in that of
Eratosthenes.®

However, in the text he goes into some detail as to his ideas of map-
making, prefers on the whole a globe of not more than 10 feet diam-
eter, and considers the next best thing a drawing of at least 7 feet
diameter, on which the lines of latitude would be parallel and the me-
ridians converge; the two ‘main lines,” evidently the parallel and
meridian of Rhodes, to be at right angles.2 Marinus of Tyre, with
much better information than Hipparchus, tried to realize the lat-
ter’s ideal of representing all places by their latitude and longitude.®
Having nothing direct from him however, we pass at once to his
successor and improver, Ptolemy.'? With this great scholar, classical

geography reaches it highest point of development.!. He not only
possessed all the available knowledge of his time bearing upon the
subject, but based his work so thoroughly on scientific principles that
its revival in modern times gave the starting point to many of the im-
provements of the new geography. That his maps were but improve-
ments on those of Eratosthenes? and Hipparchus,*® and not absolutely
new, is not matterof censure. He recognized the justness of their prin-
ciples and simply added thereto what his taient and the better facili-
ties for obtaining knowledge afforded by his time and circumstances
rendered possible. He not only wrote the principles of map-drawing,
but put the same into practice, producing a very fair representation
of the then known world, and he added thereto special maps on alarger
scale to the number of twenty-six. Here it is not in place to go deeply
into the details of Ptolemy’s projection, which however is interesting.
- The ground-plan is that of an open fan, the radii forming the meridians
of longitude, the lines parallel to the outermost curve representing
the parallels of latitude. Of these there were four principal ones,
the outermost being the supposed southern limit of the habitable zone.
From the center of this line to the point forming the pivot of the fan
was a line to be divided into one-hundred and thirty-one equal parts.
Starting from the south, sixteen of those parts bring us to the equa-
tor, on which 180 degrees of longitude were marked, forming the ex-
treme limits east and west of the known world. Counting then thirty-
six parts toward the north, came Rhodes, whose parallel was the most
important line of ancient geography. Twenty-seven parts more bring
us to the parallel of Thule, the limit to the north of the habitable world.
The other parallels were those of important places, without an attempt
to make equal divisions, as is done with the meridians, although at one
side the parallels are marked at distances of 10 degrees. At the other
side an unequal division into climates is indicated. Theoretically,
however, Ptolemy advocates the division into equal parts by parallels
of latitude. He gives also rules for another kind of projection in
which the meridians should be curved lines, as this would better rep-
resent the middle latitudes. At the same time he says that this pro-

duction of classical geography. As far as latitude is concerned the
theory is completely developed, while the practice remains extremely
imperfect. Though recognizing the usefulness of equally distant par-
allels,he makes his drawing moreeasily by adopting only those of known
places. Furthermore, he still clings to the old idea of divisions into
climates, the absurdity of which he would have appreciated if he could
have seen the modern isothermal lines.

How much or how little geographical knowledge the Greeks derived
from the Orient or from Ancient Egypt, it is at this day impossible to
determine. Of one thing we may be certain, viz, that it was at best
only fragmentary. With this as a starting point, they, in the course
of centuries, developed a sound theory as to the form of the earth,
then proved it mathematically; though often going astray, as one does
in the beginning of every science, they arrived at a fair, almost an
accurate, computation of the earth’s size. Though acquainted in
reality with only a small portion of the globe, they hit upon the only
truly scientific method of indicating position on a body which, having
neither breadth nor length, presents a puzzling problem. As far as
circumstances permitted they put their theories into practice,! and
laid down many of the lines on which modern scholarship is still de-
veloping the science.

In the mean time a movement had begun in Palestine which was to
produce great changes in the civilized world and from whose influence
the subject now under consideration was not to remain free. Rejecting
almost as a whole the literature and art with which they were familiar,
as an inseparable part of that heathenism which they were struggling
to overcome, the church fathers sought to find in the Bible the only
source of true knowledge.? They accordingly rejected the doctrine of
the sphericity of the earth, which had become, at least among special-
ists, firmly established, and with childish religious arguments, settled
for themselves and their followers the whole matter, e. g.. by asking,
‘‘ How, on the day of judgment, could the people on the other side of
a ball see the Lord descending through the air?”*? or maintaining that
if there were antipodes Christ would have gone to them. They were
not united as to what form the earth really has, one believing it to be
square, another circular, because the Bible uses the expressions ‘ the
four corners of the earth” and “circle of the earth.” The latter being
the more popular, the so-called “‘ wheel maps” were accordingly much
in vogue,® while again the Tabernacle was thought to be a mystic

symbol of the earth, and that the latter must therefore be rectangular
and twice as long as it is broad.'| In the north was a lofty mountain,
behind which the sun took his course at night in order to appear
again the next morning in the east.2. That the earth was the center of
the universe could not be doubted by an orthodox Christian.’ It
stands to reason that with such conceptions of the world there was
felt no necessity for the use of parallels of latitude, and this branch,
together with the whole science of geography, fell into decay during
the period of the supremacy of the church. Nothing more is heard
of astronomical observations to determine the location of places; the
gnomon, the sphere, together with most of the products of Grecian
culture, are buried in the dust, awaiting resurrection at the hands of
another race, itself now in the bonds of darkness, but soon to start on
a course of conquest over men and ideas unprecedented in its rapidity
and brillianey.

Though a wrong conception of the form of the earth was generally
accepted by the Christian Church up to the time of the great dis-
coveries and circum-navigation of the globe, there were not wanting at
periods a few great minds which had a clearer idea of the truth.
Clemens, Origen, Ambrose, Basil,‘ John Scotus Erigena,’ the Vener-
able Bede,® Virgilus of Juvavo,? Adam’ of Bremen,® and some others
are mentioned as having testified to a belief in the rotundity of the
earth. One fact notwithstanding remains certain, viz, that the church
officially opposed the doctrine in spite of the contrary opinion of a few
learned fathers, and the science of geography failed to receive any ad-
dition “to the knowledge which the ancients had of the globe and the
habitable zones.” ”

The Jews believed the earth to be fat and Jerusalem in the center,!
which idea was adopted by the earlier Christians along with the rest of
Jewish doctrine; and we find accordingly a number of crude maps of
the world with Jerusalem in the center and Paradise to the east, which
on account of its importance was placed at the top of the map.” With

such fundamental ideas it was not possible to bring into harmony the
work of Ptolemy, and we accordingly find other maps preferred ; !
though it is but just to add that the Roman itineraries were more
practicable for travelling, and probably also more easily acquired than
those of Ptolemy. On the other hand, if we turn to the greatest
known geographical work of Christendom in the Middle Ages, that of
the unnamed geographer of Ravenna, written in the seventh century,
we find ‘“‘no notion of geographical latitude? The French geog-
raphers of the twelfth century paid no regard to the relative position
of cities,’ and the English, even in the following century, gave their
entire attention to the itineraries.t| As navigation increased in activity
there came into popular use among the mariners the so-called compass
maps, which, disregarding projection, latitude, and longitude, were
based on observations of the compass, starting from one or more fixed
centers. These maps generally neglected the inland, but in course of
time came to picture very accurately the most frequently visited coast
lines. Lelewel (11, 16, n. 32) maintains that this kind of map is very
ancient, that one in fact served as a model for the world-map of Era-
tosthenes, but he fails to mention his authority for the statement,
and the writer has not seen elsewhere the suggestion of such an
idea. Furthermore, as we have no evidence of the Greeks having
. possessed the compass, how can they have drawn ‘compass maps,”
whose foundation is not a general idea of direction in reference to
the equator and the poles, as was the case in Greek maps, but rather
of direction from given local centers, if we may be allowed the expres-
sion? 2

So we see that Christendom, as a whole, remained for centuries in
ignorance and neglect of the principles of geographical latitude, though
it had conquered the very region where in better days the theory had
been perfected and the practice greatly advanced. Preceding the dawn
of the Renaissance travelling became more common; the cultivation of
geography followed as a matter of course. Already in the thirteenth
century works on geography began to multiply,’ interest in the sub-
ject increased, and progress in knowledge of facts was made, though
but little in theory until the beginning of the fifteenth century, when
Ptolemy was translated into Latin,® which act signalled the commence-
ment of a new era in the science.

To understand how Grecian knowledge was preserved during this
period and handed on with additions to the later world, it will be
necessary to turn the attention fora moment to another field of activity.
The Arabs, converted to Mohammedanism, having made immense con-
quests in arms and established a great realm, turned a part of their
energy to intellectual pursuits. Having produced too little of their

own to act as a foundation of future development, they drew from a
rich fountain ready at hand—Greek literature and science—which
through the medium of translations they soon made their own. Not
only did the extent of their possessions and trade demand considerable
geographical knowledge, and at the same time provide much of the
material for it, but a stringent rule of their religion, requiring all
prayers to be said with the worshiper’s face turned toward Mecca,
made necessary the determination in every part of the realm of the
exact direction toward the holy city. Although they were at first
guilty of the same fundamental errors as other Oriental nations in
conceiving the earth as a great plane or as having the form of a shield
or a drum,! they came into possession of Ptolemy’s work, probably as
early as the beginning of the ninth century,’ and from that time the
rotundity of the earth was among them an almost universally accepted
fact. That geography received a large share of attention is shown by
the considerable number of works on the subject written by them,
which have come down to us. One author, citing the Koran as au-
thority, calls geography ‘a science pleasing to God.”* They not only
established by observation with the gnomon the latitude of a consider-
able number of places, but discovered also the error of one-fourth of a
degree inherent in all observations with that instrument, because the
shadow measures the angle to the uppermost edge of the sun instead
of its center.t| Having a passion for astrology and a climate favorable
for observing the heavens, they made rapid progress in astronomy,
and accordingly in the theoretical part of geography connected with
it; but the geographers seem to have been unable both to value this
knowledge rightly and to use it in the preparation of their maps. To
read the praises of their work by one’ who has made a specialty of it
and constructed maps on nineteenth-century lines as an illustration of
their production, must give a false idea of their true position in the
history of geographical development. He names Ptolemy’s great work
a monument monstrueux,” and finds the purported translation, known
as “yvasm,” much better than the original, the translators having
adopted its principles without its errors of detail.6 Though not a
single Arabic map now known has a net representing latitude and

longitude,! Lelewel says that the “produits cartographiques de cette
époque prouvent que toutes les cartes arabes furent élaborées sur les
latitudes et les distances.”” He seems to have been unaware of the
fact that the geographers regarded as too confusing—and so neglected
to use on their maps—the mathematical determination of places fixed
by the astronomers.’ They employed theoretically the division of the
circle into degrees and minutes for giving in lists the position of in-
dividual places, but seem to have preferred as a general division of
their maps that into climates, of which they reckoned only seven, con-
necting them with the seven planets. Though in the ninth century
they were satisfied with a degree of accuracy in determining latitude

approaching to one-third or one-sixth of the truth, they improved

greatly later, and made some very exact observations, including two
correct to the minute, viz, those of Toledo and Bagdad.’

It is to this people that we must look for much influence, direct and
indirect, in the renaissance of classical learning in Christian Europe.
As early as in the tenth century we catch a faint glimmer of reflected
light in the field of geography in a globe made for Pope Sylvester 11,°
who had studied in Mohammedan Spain. In the middle of the twelfth
century there was to be found at the Court of Roger a copy of
Ptolemy’s geography, and there still exists a thirteenth-century copy
thereof in Venice ;* but being in the original tongue, which was as a
sealed book to the Italians of that period, it probably had no influ-
ence on the development of the science.’ The first Latin translation
of Ptolemy was made in 1405 by a Florentine named Angelo, and
gradually found its way into all the countries of Europe.’ This was
contemporaneous with the opening of the period of oceanic discoveries
under Henry the Sailor of Portugal. From this time the influence of
Ptolemy was great,” gradually driving out the itineraries and works of

each would be half an hour longer and the shortest half an hour shorter than that of
the next one to the south. Aboulfeda, 1331, gives another division as follows: I, from

like class, to make way for those constructed on the more reliable
method, because based on scientific principles ;' and his was destined
to become the fundamental work to which the maps of modern geogra-
phers might be added as a supplement.’ If. this substitution of
Ptolemy’s method was at first disastrous in producing maps less prac-
ticable and perhaps also less accurate than those in vogue for mariners,
it was due to the fact that the mariners had in their compass maps exag-
gerated the size and importance of the bodies of water at the expense of
theland.* Accordingly it was necessary to take this apparent step back-
wards once for all, in order to establish for the future correct lines for
the development of the science. For some time there contiuned to be
published maps of the Middle Age type, as Fra Mauro’s map of the
world, 1459, and Bennicasa’s nautical map, circa 1476;4 and even at
times such were issued in the same work with re-productions of
Ptolemy’s maps, as in the work of André Bianco,’ 1436. But at the
end of the fifteenth century the work of the great Grecian was so
widely circulated, at least among scientists, so generally accepted,
that from that time we may consider the rotundity of the earth-as
scientifically established® in Christendom, and therewith the theory of
latitude. That was however only the beginning. The real latitude
of but comparatively few places had been determined, and that gener-
ally inaccurately, while there still remained the great work of measur-
ing exactly a degree of latitude and thence calculating the size of the
earth.

Herewith we enter upon a-new era in the development of geograph-
ical latitude. The first essential for the required accuracy was improve-
ment in the instruments and methods of astronomical observation.
The gnomon is at best but a crude instrument, and the practice of
waiting for noon on the four days of the year when the suw’s position
was accurately known hindered the accumulation of observations
which is necessary to exactness. Not only were new instruments there-
for invented, but the astronomers turned to the observation of the pole
star, by which it is easier to determine latitude, and later came the
tables of the daily position of sun and stars in the heavens, which

provided the sky is comparatively free from clouds. Not only is the
position of each individual place of importance for the science of geog-
raphy, but the distance between places, as well as their direction one
from another, is also of great weight. So long as navigation was
confined to coasting, simple compass-directions and compass-maps
answered all necessary requirements; but when mariners began to
strike out into the ocean, where they might wander for weeks without
seeing land, and it was found that the compass did not always point
directly north, but is liable to considerable variation, the old method
no longer sufficed; a method of determining latitude at all times
became a pressing want, which, as is generally the case, resulted in
corresponding new inventions. The natural curiosity of civilized man
causes a longing to know the size of the planet on which he dwells.
This knowledge can be most readily gained by measuring accurately a
degree or rather various degrees of latitude. To accomplish this, gov-
ernments have provided immense sums of money, and scientists have
borne—not only without murmur, but with enthusiasm—the heat of

tropical summers and the cold of polar winters, the winds and fogs of

the mountains, and deluging rains in the plains, have suffered from
hunger and thirst, and even met bravely at their post, the one uncon-
querable, Death. It is to the contemplation of this gigantic work,
already continued for more than three centuries and still being vigor-
ously pursued, that we now turn.

It may be well however to say first something as to the principles
which lie at the foundation of this work.

Position of the tropics.—It was matter of very early observation that
the sun changes from time to time its position in the heavens in refer-
ence to the stars, and that this change is a regular one, and the period
of time occupied in returning to the same position determines the length
of the year. The path thus formed is called the Ecliptic.!. An imagi-
nary line on the surface of the earth formed by connecting those points
over which the center of the sun passes vertically at noon on each sue-
cessive day of the year, receives the same name. In connection with
this change of the sun’s position, it was noticed that the length of the
shadows cast on the earth at noon at different seasons of the year is
variable,’ and this fact gave the first means of determining absolute
position on the globe. Noting in Egypt, where no shadow was east,
only on one day of the year, gave the position of the northern tropic.
Half the difference between this point and that over which the sun
stood perpendicularly when farthest south, (accordingly when the

1 Briinnow, Astron., p. 75, defines the Ecliptic as ‘‘ der Kreis den der Mittelpunkt der
Sonne, vom Mittelpunkt der Erde gesehen, im Laufe eines Jahres unter den Sternen
von Westen nach Osten beschreibt.”

? That the sun’s course is not parallel to the Equator is said to have been discovered
by Anaximander of Miletos (Strack’s Plinius, lib. ii, 8 6. Vol. 1. p. 78).

ee
GEOGRAPHICAL LATITUDE. 767

shadow at the first point was the longest), gave the position of the
equator, or the middle distance between the poles. So there was one
point on the earth, viz, that of the Tropic of Cancer, apparently fixed,'
and a relation was established between the position of the sun at two
other points, and the length of shadows cast on the earth. This may be
called the first foundation stone of scientific geography ; for without
such a sure grounding in nature itself, the science is impossible. Pre-
supposing that the rays of the sun come to us parallel to each other, it
happens from the nature of a sphere that the ratio between the length
of a shadow at noon, cast by an object perpendicular to the plane of
the horizon to the object itself, is equal to the ratio of the distance
between the place of observation and the point where the sun casts no
shadow. Having thought out this principle, the earliest astronomers
waited for noon at the summer solstice to make their observations, and
somewhat later came to use also the winter solstice and the equinoxes
therefor. But the position thus gained was not absolute and unchange-
able, as the ancients supposed.

In the first place, accuracy of observation was not possible, owing to
defective instruments; they supposed the position of the tropic marked
by the position of the upper edge of the sun at the summer solstice,
instead of by its center. And in the second place, they could not sus-
pect that the ecliptic plane is itself subject to a secular variation of
between one and two degrees in about ten thousand years; as a result
of which—during the historical period—the earth’s axis has been
slowly becoming more perpendicular to the plane of its course around
the sun. The obliquity is now 24’ less than it was 2,000 years ago.
This causes a slight approach of the tropics toward the equator and of
the polar circles toward the poles. Syene, whose position was accepted
as marking that of the tropic, lay in 24° 5’ 32” north latitude, and ae-
cording to modern calculations was under the edge of the sun at the
summer solstice about 700 B. C., when the obliquity of the Ecliptie
was probably 23° 51/2) Though Eratosthenes determined with a fair
degree of accuracy the obliquity at 23° 51’ 19.5, the ancients gen-
erally accepted the round sum of 24 degrees. Later classical authors
made no improvement on this, and these figures passed with the remain-
der of Greek learning to the Arabs. Though the latter added little or
nothing to the theory of the Greeks, they were much better observers.$
Accordingly we find Albategnius in the second half of the ninth cen-
tury observing with carefully divided parallactic rules the distance
between the sun and the zenith at the solstices. The difference he
found to be 47° 10’, from which he determined the obliquity of the
EKcliptic to be 23° 35’... Delambre names this “the most trustworthy
ancient observation,” and comparing the result with that of his own

work in 1800, determines the diminution of the obliquity at 0.505 per
annum. He adds however that one can not say that the Arabian
observation was exact to the minute.!. Remarking that their result did
not agree with that of the Greeks, the Arabs thought that the “ obli-
quity of the Ecliptic oscillates.” ?

However, it was not until toward the middle of the eighteenth century
that the diminution of the Ecliptic obliquity was generally admitted.®
Louville was the first who attempted to measure the amount of the move-
ment and announced in 1716 the result, 60’ acentury.t| The elder Cas-
sini believed it to be 45”,° which is practically that at present accepted.®
However, opinions have varied much; Ximines in 1756 calculated it to
be 30.7, Hornsby (1769) believed it to be no more than 32” or 34” in
the century, although his observations had given 3” per annum.’ La-
lande gives 33/.33, Delambre, 46” to 48”, as the result of observations ;
but the latter accepts as the best those of La Caille, 44” per century.®

It belongs also to the childhood of the race to have noticed that some
stars never go below the horizon and that one seems to be stationary,
round which the others revolve. This star marks the prolongation of
the earth’s axis to the north, and pre-supposes its rays to come from
an infinite distance and fall on the earth parallel to each other. It
happens then, from the nature of a sphere, that it can not be seen from
the equator, or further to the south; but in proportion to the distance
of the observer north from the equator that star appears above the
horizon. This fact gave a second principle founded in nature on which
to build the science of geography. This star however is not abso-
lutely stationary in the sky, but itself describes daily a small circle, so
a simple method was invented to find the center of this circle, which
then should be the absolute north pole. This was to observe the alti-
tude of any one of the circumscribing stars when at its highest and
lowest points, 7. e. at its culminations, and halve the result, which gives
a truer north point. It was the good fortune of the English astron-
omer-royal, Bradley (1692-1762), to discover that even this point is not
absolutely fixed, but describes periodically a small ellipse. Even this
is not a regular curve, for the line is a wavy one.

Still a third method of determining latitude was employed as early
as the time of Poseidonius (first century B.C.) which was however at
first so crude as to be perfectly unreliable in its results, but which in
the end was so far useful as to call attention to the fact that other stars

than the circumpolar ones can be used in determining latitude. This
method was to observe certain stars which in one place just graze the
horizon and in another appear higher. The altitude in the second place
gives the difference in latitude of the two places of observation.!

Instruments.—No one art or science is so independent that it can stand
or fall, advance or retrograde, without influencing and being influenced
by the others. Accordingly we find progress in the knowledge of geo-
graphical latitude dependent not only on that of general information
regarding the earth’s surface, but also on that of astronomy, and even
of mechanics, the latter being necessary to increase accuracy of astro-
nomical observations, on which all the rest depends. The beginnings
with two kinds of rude gnomons have already been mentioned. To
the Chinese was known a third sort, more accurate because provided
toward the top with a small hole, through which the sun shone, thus
terminating the shadow to be measured at the point corresponding to
the center of the sun. The Arabs also made use of this sort of gno-
mon, but it seems doubtful if the Greeks ever came to a knowledge of
it. Eratosthenes employed besides the gnomon the armillary spheres
already mentioned, with which he observed the obliquity of the Ecliptie.
Further progress was marked by the introduction of the astrolabe, the
first mention of which is made by Ptolemy, who says he used one
at Rhodes, which however may have been invented by Hipparchus.?
Between this and modern times, the only improved instruments for ob-
servation are the similar but more complicated torquetum of Regio-
montanus (1436-1476), and the quadratum geometricum, which was
known to the Arabs, but is generally ascribed to the invention of Pur-
bach* (1425-1461). In about 1600, observations at sea were much
improved by the invention of a portable quadrant by the English sea-
captain, John Davis.* In the mean time the instraments for use on land
were being made larger and larger, and, though admitting of more ae.
curate division, they becaine unwieldy. Then came the application of
magnifying glasses, to which Huyghens first applied the cross-threads
to mark the mutual focus of the two glasses of the telescope; and in
1667, Picard first applied (in concert with Auzout) the telescope to the

1Tn recent times it has been customary to observe any selected star, measuring its
distance on the meridian from the pole or zenith. The latitude is found by compar-
ing the relative position observed with the star’s absolute position, which will be
found in tables prepared for that purpose. On account of atmospheric refraction
stars near the zenith are now generally chosen for such observations.

With the advance toward perfection of the instruments of observa-
tion has naturally gone hand in hand the progress in the accuracy
of the astronomical observations themselves. Though Hipparchus
was far ahead of his predecessors in the kind of instruments he used,
his observations were still liable to an error of balf a degree.? Lelewel
gives the latitude of several places according to two Arabian authors,
which vary in each case three (!) degrees or more.’ There is a long dif-
ference between this and Picard’s results, whose observations, accord-
ing to his own statement, did not vary one from another more than five
seconds. Somewhat more than a century later Delambre made about
twelve hundred observations to determine the position of one of his
stations, and found them accord to within half a second.® Another
series gave a variation of only one-third of a second,’ and still a third,
consisting of eighteen hundred observations, made by Delambre and
Mechain, showed a difference of but one-sixth of a second in the results
of the two observers.?. These are the achievements of the most careful
observations with the finest instruments. About the same time Bohnen-
erger, writing of ordinary observations with the mirror-sextant, gives, as
the greatest possible error in observing the altitude of the sun, 23.5 sec-
onds,’ a tremendous advance on classical and medieval results. How-
ever, all modern observers do not find the same happy agreement in
their observations as did Mechain and Delambre. Even at the begin-
ning of this century a complaint is made that the latitude of the best
astronomical observatories is scarcely within three to four seconds cer-
tainly fixed, while that of Paris had varied between 1667 and 1721 a
quarter of a minute,? and that of Berlin still later varied a whole
minute, according to the observations of two astronomers.”

of being able to determine each day and even moment his latitude; and
with the occasion of the necessity, were invented the means of meeting
it. Not only were new instruments of observation placed at the dis-
posal of astronomers and mariners, but tables of the daily positions of
sun, moon, and stars, have been worked out with ever-increasing ac-
curacy, so that what was once a matter of impossibility to the best in-
formed astronomer and mathematician, viz, to determine any day his
geographical position on the earth, is now an easy matter for any mar-
iner of fair education. Though such tables were constructed by the
Greeks and Arabs, we must look to the French astronomer, La Caille,
and the German, Tobias Mayer, for the first approach to accuracy in
this regard.! The former, using alike the work of his predecessors and
his own numerous cbservations, constructed about the middle of the
last century a table of 397 stars, which receives the highest praise from
Delambre. Mayer took up the work where La Caille left it, and sim-
plified the mathematical formule, receiving a prize’from the English
government for the benefit therefrom to navigation. This work was
then collated with the observations of the astronomer royal of England
by the mathematician, Mason, whose name in America is so well known
in connection with the Mason and Dixon’s line. The accuracy of the
tables was thereby increased to such an extent that Maskelyne ex-
pressed the belief that the greatest error would not surpass thirty sec-
onds. Later laborers in the same field have materially diminished even
this small margin of possible error.°

Refraction —Several causes united to make possible a degree of accu-
racy which for ages was held to be unattainable. Among the most po-
tent of these factors were the discovery by Bradley of the aberration of
light and the nutation of the earth’s axis; and the great progress made
in determining accurately the amount of refraction in connection with
astronomical observations. As the latter was a matter of slow develop-
ment, it may be advantageous to consider it Somewhat more in detail.
Astronomical refraction has been defined as the amount which the rays
of light are bent from their entrance into the atmosphere to us.4. The
first recorded notice taken of this phenomenon was about the time of
the Christian era, when Cleomedes, in his work Circularis Inspectio Me-
teorum, relates an account which he had received of an eclipse of the
moon taking place when both sun and moon were visible above the hor-
izon. Though disposed to doubt the truth of the story, he gives a pos-
sible explanation of the phenomenon in remarking: ‘ Even as a ring in
a vessel will be raised visibly above the edge by water poured in, so
can the sun be seen by refraction when it is in reality still below the hor-
izon.”° The fact of refraction was known to Ptolemy, and that its

quantity decreases from the horizon to the zenith, where it disap-
pears.! However, though he had a better idea of the subject than the
earliest of iedent astronomers, he failed to discover any of the laws of
its action.2, The subject was merely mentioned by Sextus Empiricus,
ina work entitled Adversus Astrologus (in the third century); was taken
up by Alhazen about 1100, in his work on optics; then remained un-
noticed till the Nuremberger astronomer, Walther, about 1500, com-
menced to estimate, at least near the horizon, the effects of refraction.‘
He was probably the first who ever really observed astronomical re-
fraction, which he had done before becoming acquainted with the an-
cient works wherein it is mentioned.? About a century later Tycho
Brahe was lead to a re-discovery of the phenomenon while trying to de-
termine the latitude of his observatory. For greater accuracy he made
observations of a circumpolar star and of the sun at the solstices, and
found a difference of four minutes in the results. In anew instrument,
built with more care for similar observations, showing the same diver-
gence, he believed the difference to be caused by refraction, and fell to
making a special study of the subject, from the results of which he con-
structed the first table of astronomical refractions; but he not only
missed an important truth, which had been already guessed by Ptol-
emy, viz, that refraction ceases only at the zenith, but he believed
that refraction for the sun and the stars ceases at different altitudes, and
found the latter at an end of 26 degrees above the horizon, while at 45
degrees the sun’s rays still suffered a refraction of five seconds. Here
was indeed a valuable beginning, but the whole matter rested upon an
empirical basis; for as yet there was no conception of the laws of the
action of light. The first of these, that of the relation of the angle of
incidence to the angle of refraction, was first published by Descartes
in his Dioptrice, though the honor of precedent discovery belongs to
Suellius, who unfortunately died before he could publish his work.’
Tycho himself remarked that refraction is not always the same, but of-
tered no explanation of the fact. Cassini and Picard found that it was
greater in winter than in summer, by night than by day, and by a happy
chance the latter was led to the true explanation of this irregularity ;
for, observing once at sunrise, he found the horizontal refraction sud-
denly change twenty-five seconds, which could have no other cause
than the increased warmth of the air,® caused by the appearance of
the sun. Two other laws of nature discovered about the same time
aided materially in increasing the knowledge of astronomical refrac-
tion, the first being the one discovered by Edmund Mariotte, that the

density of the air is proportional to the pressure resting upon it, and
the second, that established by Hawksbee’s experiment in 1702, viz,
that the refracting power of the atmosphere is as its density.

In order to render practical—for determining astronomical refrac-
tion—the knowledge gained by these various discoveries it was neces-
sary to have the means of arriving at the amount of pressure on the
great body of atmosphere through which the light comes to the
observer, and also of measuring the temperature of the atmosphere.
These means were provided just at the right time by the invention of
the thermometer by Drebbel in 1638, and its perfecting nearly a century
later by the labors of Fahrenheit and Réaumur; also by the (if possible)
still more valuable invention of the barometer by Torricelli in 1643.
Thus at the beginning of the eighteenth century we find all the means
at hand, by which the cause and amount of astronomical refraction were
to be determined with the greatest accuracy, supplying the last requisite
to the exact determination of geographical latitude. Halley, by his ob-
servations in 171415, was led to the conclusion that the change of
refraction is proportional to the change in the height of the barometer,”
which was for astronomical refraction only the confirmation of the law
already proved for terrestial refraction by Hawksbee, viz, that refraction
is proportional to the density of the atmosphere, while later in the cen-
tury Euler called attention to tue fact that refraction is almost exactly
in the inverse ratio of the degrees of heat, when the star is not too near
the horizon.*? Thus a large body of facts had been gradually brought
together, which was then systematized, and thereby was made possible
the establishing of theories as to the action of light on its way through
the atmosphere. Theyin turn became the foundation for calculating
accurately the amount of refraction when the conditions of the observa-
tions were known. The details of the matter lie outside of the scope of
this article; but a few of the most important points are worthy of a
moment’s attention. Though Kepler brought his great talents to bear
on the subject he failed to add anything to its elucidation. Tobias
Mayer (already mentioned) was the first to give a rule for calculating
the amount of refraction in connection with the variation of the barom-
eter and thermometer.’ Oriani in 1788 showed that the change of
density of the air is without influence on refraction from the zenith to
a distance of 70 degrees® (though of course the regular increment of
density and refraction continues), and Laplace showed that the same
is true to 74 degrees,’ and in fact he takes no account of the variation
of density in his formula up to 80 degrees. This probably accounts for
the fact that some early tables were quite accurate up to that point, as
was the case with Kepler’s.2 The genius of Newton and of Huyghens

was brought to bear also on this subject, and though starting with an
entirely different hypothesis, their results were both quite accurate.
The former, believing light to be a material substance, supposed that
the heavier medium attracted more powerfully and thus produced re-
fraction; the latter, having proposed the wave theory of light, taught
that it is more difficult for the waves to force their way through a dense
medium than through one less dense; that their motion is thereby re-
tarded, and when striking the denser medium at an oblique angle that
their direction is changed.

The earliest astronomers who considered the subject supposed the
atmosphere of the same density everywhere, and hence presumed that
‘the light-ray was only bent once and formed a straight path through
the air; but from the time of Newton and Huyghens this idea was
shown to be untenable and that the path is really a curve. What the
exact nature of this curve is it is extremely difficult to determine, on
account of the presence of a large number of possible disturbing ele-
ments. With the gradual increase of accuracy, the older tables of
Cassini, Bradley, Berg, and Burckhardt and others have given way,
one after the other, to ever newly appearing ones. The present ones of
Laplace, Bessel, Schmidt, and Ivory are models of accuracy and fully
answer the needs for furnishing the amount of refraction in all cases.'

Progress of determining the latitude of fixed points.—At the renais-
sance of geography, almost the entire political face of Europe was found
changed from what it had been when Ptolemy’s work was written. In
that work but few latitudes had been given, and these were generally
seriously lacking in exactness. The Arabs had added considerable
thereto, but in the region foreign tothose with whom the advancement of
the science now rested. At first the modern geographers dared not dis-
pute the authority of the great master, and the first to print a map with
corrections offered therewith excuses for breaking with the tradition.
The need of accurately fixing latitudes was soon felt. The gnomon was
revived and made larger and better. Even as late as the elder Cassini,
a gnomon of 20 feet in height was used to determine the latitude of
Bologna;? and still later (1744) Lemonnier added to his gnomon a burn-
ing glass of three inches diameter and 80-foot focus, by means of which
latitude could be as accurately determined as by the great quadrants
of the time? But the days of gnomons were numbered, and the newer
instruments took precedence. There followed a general improvement in
the determination of latitude by observation, a few examples of which
may be of use to show the rate of progress.

Surveys.—In the history of geographical latitude the most conspic-
uous role has been played by the surveys which have been made to

determine the length of a degree, and therefrom, by further deductions,
the size and form of theearth. The principal aim of this great work
was, to be sure, purely scientific; but thatit has a most practical appli-
cation also is pithily stated by Maupertuis as follows: ‘Sur des routes
de 100 degrés, en longitude, on commettroit des erreurs de plus de 2
degrés, si naviguant sur la sphéroide de Newton on se ecroyoit sur
celui du livre De la grandeur et figure de la terre: and combien de
vaisseaux ont péri pour des erreurs moins considérables.! -For ages
those who believed in the rotundity of the earth thought it to bea
perfect sphere; butin the seventeenth century the two great physicists
of the day, Newton and Huyghens, again starting with different hypoth-
eses, came to a like result, viz, that the earth is not a true sphere, but
rather a spheroid, flattened toward the poles. The announcement of
these theories, nearly at the same time (1686 and 1688, respectively),
caused great excitement among the astronomers and geographers; two
camps were formed contending respectively for the old and the new
theory and each demanding proof of its theory by surveying: for if
the earth is flatter toward the poles, a degree of latitude will be longer
near the pole than near the equator. France, which was already the
leading country in such work, offered a good field for it; the French
astronomers were eager to undertake it, and Louis X1v authorized the
survey of a meridian extending throughout the land. The northern
and southern stretches being put under leading specialists for survey,
the result showed the degree to be longest in the southern section; a
repetition only confirmed the result. If the surveys were correct, this
proved the earth to be elongated toward the poles, instead of flattened.
Great was the delight of the French at this defeat of the foreign
theorists. But the latter contended that the matter was by no means
settled ; that the only sure method would be to make surveys near the
equator and near the pole, and await the result. This plan was carried
out during the first half of the eighteenth century, and resulted in the
complete triumph of the defenders of the theory of flattening toward
the poles. This point settled, the earth was still supposed to be a per-
fectly symmetrical figure; but as surveys becaine more extensive and-
more accurate there appeared inequalities which were not compatible
with that theory, and it is now generally accepted that beyond the
irregularities of mountains and valleys, discernible to every eye, the geo-
detic form of the earth is also irregular.

We have already seen that astronomy gives us the means of deter-
mining accurately and with comparative ease the latitude of any one
place. If then the latitude of two places which are on the same merid-
ian is known and the distance between them is accurately measured,
supposing the earth to be a perfect sphere, a simple arithmetical cal-
culation will give the earth’s circumference; for the latitade being
expressed in degrees, of which 360 form the circumference, the distance

GEOGRAPHICAL LATITUDE. T77

between the points of observation will be to the entire circumference as
the difference in latitude is to 360 degrees. The earth being a spheroid
makes the calculation much more complicated, though the same princi-
ple of proportion between distance and degrees of are remains as the
basis thereof. Butinasmuch as it is known that the earth has consider-
able irregularities, it is not possible to determine its exact form from
one or two measured lines; but for entire accuracy the whole surface of
the land should be surveyed. To carry out as far as possible this object,
there was formed in 1861, the Middle European Commission for meas-
uring degrees.

This commission working steadily from year to year will aradualty
cover the entire surface of Europe with a net-work of surveyed tri-
angles, and thus be able to add greatly to our knowledge of the true
form of the earth.

The improvement in measuring distances on the surface of the earth
has kept equal pace with the advance in astronomical accuracy. The
ancients accepted the distances as reckoned by travellers or at best the
land measurement of government employés on a line not straight.
The Arabs measured one or more lines of a degree’s length, by what
means we do not know, and with so little accuracy that there was a
difference in the results of three-quarters of a mile. The first measure-
ment of modern times was made in the sixteenth century by counting
the revolutions of a carriage wheel on an ordinary road. Finally in
1615, in The Netherlands, was made the first application of trigonome-
try to land measurement, and though the result was not nearly so
accurate as that of the wheel measurement, a new principle had been
introduced, which was destined to revolutionize investigations of this
nature, and by gradual improvement in its application, to furnish re-
sults so accurate as to leave practically nothing to be desired. This
principle is that which forms the foundation of trigonometrical sci-
ence, viz, that the value of a line and two angles of a triangle being
known the other quantities can be determined. From that time this
has been the method employed, with the exception of the attempt by
Mason and Dixon to measure an entire degree in Pennsylvania, which
failed to produce an accurate result, and of Norwood’s survey from
London to York in 1634~35,. The best method having been discovered,
there remained still the possibility of enormous progress in accuracy,
especially in two directions: (1) in measuring the angles of the tri-
angles; (2) in measuring the base-line. These have now been brought
to such perfection that a leading authority is of the opinion that
further improvement in this direction can not increase the accuracy of
the result so much as the outstanding uncertainty due to irregularities
in the form of the earth.!

Before passing to a chronological consideration of the most impor-
tant surveys made to determine the length of a degree, it may be well

Vist. GEOGRAPHICAL LATITUDE.

to say something of the work in connection with measuring a base line
and fixing and measuring the triangles connected therewith. In the
first place, choosing the ground for the entire survey is no easy mat-
ter. Two points nearly or quite on the same meridian should be sought,
which are favorable to the astronomical observations necessary to de-
termine their latitude; near the course of the line there should bea
convenient plane, as flat as possible, advantageous for running the base
line in a direction favorable for connecting it with the main series of
triangles, while the tract as a whole should be of such a nature as to
permit the making of triangles as large as_ possible, i. e., furnishing
high points at long distances with uninterrupted view, with all the an-
gles as large as possible, for the measurement of very acute angles is
more liable to error than that of large ones.!. The situation of the base
line once selected, its end points are marked with the utmost care by
contrivances which vary according to the ideas of the surveyor. In
order to keep the true direction with perfect accuracy while measur-
ing, the line is staked out with the utmost care, wooden stakes being
driven into the earth at short distances, and nails driven into the top
of the stakes to mark the exact point where the line passes. Then fol-
lows the actual work of measuring. That this may be accomplished
with the most extreme accuracy, a great variety of rules have been con-
structed from time to time, the standard of length generally being the
toise of Paris, or of Peru, as it was called after the completion of the
Peruvian survey. The first care is to procure a rule as nearly as possi-
ble just so long or double so long as the standard and determine its
absolute length. Then, since the substance thereof (of whatever sort)
is liable to variation of volume dependent on change of temperature, ex-
periments must be made to establish the amount of this variation, and
a thermometer is so attached as to give the temperature of the instru-
ment. There must be an attachment to the rule which enables it to be
placed at a perfect level, or if not, then to measure the amount of the
declination. An arrangement for placing it firmly on the ground and
at the same time for changing its level must also be thought out and
constructed. Furthermore, since it is practically impossible to place
one heavy rule against another without displacing more or less the one
already in situ, ingenuity has been taxed to invent methods by which
the main rules could be placed in line without touching and the small
intervals be accurately measured. ‘This difficulty can be obviated by
the application of the principle of wheel measurement, by which, a per-
fectly smooth way being constructed between the two points whose dis-
tance is to be measured, a cylinder, of special construction, the length

! Bouguer (Figure de la terre., p. 79) says in this connection: ‘‘Ces erreurs, quoique les
mémes, produiront cependant ensuite différens effets, selon que les angles seront plus
ou moins grands; une minute apporte beaucoup plus de différence dans le sinus d’un
petit angle que dans le sinus d’un grand; et les cétés qu’on caleule par le moyen
des triangles, doivent étre sujets 4 la méme erreur que ces sinus, puisqu’ils changent
dans le méme rapport.” See also pp. 88, 85, 88.

of whose circumference is accurately known, is rolled over the way,
thus producing the effect of a continuous rule. This has been applied
with good result, though it has not been used frequently. As the work
of measurement can not be completed in one day, it is necessary to
mark with care the place of quitting at evening, for commencing in the
morning. This is done, when measuring with rules, by dropping a
plumb line from the end of the last rule placed at evening and mark-
ing the spot where it falls ona plate sunk into the ground, which is
then carefully covered, so that neither storm nor wandering beast can
change its position during the night. With all these precautions and
the most careful noting of every circumstance that can in the least in-
fluence the result, the line is generally measured twice, and as a con-
trol of the accuracy of the measurement, there is often measured a sec-
ond line distant from the first.

Added to this is the labor of running the net of triangles between
the ends of the line to be surveyed and connecting it, as accurately as
possible, with the base line. The points for the angles of the triangles
having been selected, there are the necessary preparations for observa-
tions to be made, including, where necessary, the building of wooden
towers of greater or less height. As the summits of mountains are
frequently selected therefor the difficulties of procuring all necessaries
of life and for the work are thereby materially increased, while the
violent action of the elements often disturbs and sometimes destroys the
work of a long period. The stations established, it remains to measure
the angles, not only once, but a number of times; and not only two
angles of each triangle (which theoretically would be sufficient), but in
order to insure the greatest possible accuracy, all three are measured
with extreme care. For this work, the improvement in signals and
instruments has been immense.

These surveys have led to some valuable observations on the varying
conditions of the atmosphere. Perhaps the most interesting of these
after those relating to refraction are those which prove a periodic dis-
turbance or movement in the atmosphere, even on so called still days.
There are four phases daily, two of agitation and two of quiet. The
period of greatest quiet or of least motion is in the night, for which
reason it has often been found advantageous to make the observations
at that time, using artificial lights as signals.!

After the angles have been measured it is necessary to calculate the
difference in altitude of the various observing points, in order to reduce
all to the same plane, when these, together with the base line itself, are
reduced by elaborate mathematical calculations to the level of the sea,

1 An excellent illustration of this was given in carrying the French-Spanish merid-
ian to the Balearic Islands. ‘Die Dreyecks-Seite von Sierra Morella bis Silla de
Torellas auf Mayorca betriigt 93080 Toisen. Ein einziges Reverbere auf Mayorea hat

tageous to use fire signals at night. See Picard, Mesure de la terre, p. 9.

on which level and changed to an are the length of the line whose value
is sought is determined.

There still remains the astronomical determination of the latitude of
the end points of the surveyed line, which is done by a great number
of observations, the mean is accepted as the final result. The differ-
ence in latitude compared with the length of the surveyed line, gives
the mean length of a degree of latitude in the meridian line surveyed.

More than two thousand years have elapsed since the first scientific
attempt to measure the size of the earth. Interest in the matter has
increased with the spread of knowledge, while vast improvements in
science and art have gradually rendered possible the solving of the
problem with great accuracy. The commencement of this grand work
was made by Eratosthenes (276-196 B. C.), the librarian of the famous
library at Alexandria and a man whose talents found occupation in
several fields of science and art. Accepting the common belief that
Syene was on the Tropic, he observed at Alexandria with the hollow
gnomon at the summer solstice and found the shadow to be one fiftieth
of the circumference. The distance between the two places he valued
at 5,000 stadii, from which he deduced the earth’s circumference,
250,000 stadii. How he arrived at the valuation of 5,000 stadii is
matter of dispute. General Baeyer, according to whose calculations
there was a failure in the given size of the earth’s circumference of
only 8 geographical miles,' says he measured with rules, but fails to
give any authority for thestatement; against which we have the author-
ity of Martianus Capella for the much more probable statement that he
learned the distance ‘per mensores regios Ptolemwi,”? and of Strabo,
who says he calculated it from the course of the Nile,’ while Kiepert
is of the opinion that he reached his result by comparing many inaccu-
rate lengths of the ways, gathered from various sources ;* to all which
may be added the assertion of Marcian of Heraclea, that he stole the
whole calculation from his predecessor, Timosthenes.° However this
may be, the result remains the same, that in Eratosthenes’s time there
was an attempt by scientific method to arrive at the size of the earth,
by which the circumference was determined to be 250,000 stadii, to
which he added 2,000 stadii, in order to have the convenient number
700 for the length of each degree. One is naturally curious to know

how this first essay compares with those made recently with the appli-
cation of all the means for securing accuracy known to modern science.
The comparison is not however so easy as at first thought appears
and leading specialists are by no means in unison on the matter. The
real difficulty lies in our not knowing the value of the stadium which
was employed as the standard of measure.' In order to bring harmony
into classical accounts of distances, French authorities adopted the
idea that there were different standards in use, even to the number of
eight.2,. German investigators were rather inclined to scout this
method as an easy one for avoiding a dilemma, while an English writer
puts all differences down to ignorance on the part of the Greeks, and
adds: ‘“* The more frequented the route, the more populous the country
through which it passed, the more civilized and ‘lettered the people,
the more nearly we find the reported distance to approach that stand-
ard [600 Gr. feet] of the stadium.”* But the excavations at Olympia
have revealed the fact that the stadium there was 192.27 meters long,
instead of 176.76 meters, as was earlier thought to be the case;* and
Dr. Dorpfeld, one of the directors of the excavations, assures the
writer that this length differs from that of all other stadii found in Greece.
This proves at least that there existed in Greece itself different stand-
ards; but whether there were five or eight, or more or less,° it is not
within the province of this article to decide. The idea seems to be
modern; for, though some classical writers seem to employ different
standards, they do not expressly mention the existence of such. Hum-
boldt says he finds the first trace of the opinion broached by Mossen
Janne Ferrer in a letter to Columbus on the means of tracing with pre-
cision the line of demarkation which should divide the globe between
Spain and Portugal.®

With these preliminary remarks we turn to the conclusions arrived
at, which vary according to the hypothesis of each writer. The two
extremes are represented by General Baeyer and Sprenger. The first
finds an error of only one seven-hundredth of the distance measured,
and says this proves that the ancients went to work with great care and
understood quite well how to measure,’ while Sprenger maintains that
Eratosthenes simply re-discovered the method for measuring the size
of the earth, and proved it mathematically; that he however made no

actual survey, but relied blindly on the map of the world.! Between
these two extremes are found those who prefer to take the results as
they are reported to us, and interpreting them in accordance with what
is known as to the then condition of science, come probably nearer the
truth. Thus attention is called to the sources of error in the work:
that the length of the are between the end points, Alexandria and
Syene, was accepted as much greater than it is, Syene lying north of
the Ecliptic; that these places are not on the same meridian,’ and, fur-
thermore, that no account was taken of the apparent radius of the sun.
With these important sources of error at hand it may well be accepted
in accordance with the opinion of Lepsius,’ Gtinther,t and Ideler® that
the error amounted to about 14 per cent., for which however consid-
ering all the circumstances, we are not justified in complaining of the
work.

Though this was the nearest approach to the truth made in ancient
times, there were other figures accepted by various classicai writers,
and one which later received more general acceptance among the an-
cients and exercised more influence in modern times. Thisis that which
gives to the earth the circumference of 180,000 stadii, generally attrib-
uted to Poseidonius, and probably verified by Simplicius. The former
enters into considerable detail also as to how he arrived at another re-
sult, 240,000 stadii,® and then he rejects it without explanation in favor
of the much smaller and less accurate estimate, namely 180,000 stadii.
Simplicius, on the other hand, describes minutely the manner of arriv-
ing at this result. ‘The astronomers sought out, he says, two stars ex-
actly one degree apart, found the places where these stars passed
through the respective zeniths, and by ‘‘ operations” measured the ter-
restrial distance, finding it to be 500 stadii.?’ Delambre is positive that
this was only imagined and never carried out. But why not? <Ac-
cording to a calculation of Alexander von Humboldt, this is as nearly
accurate within 7,000 toises (though on the other side), as the measure-
ment of EKratosthenes.? When one considers the great crudity of the
means then at command, it is a perfectly possible result of an actual
measurement. If it rested on no good foundation, how came it that
the great authority of Eratosthenes and Hipparechus, still followed in
other respects, was rejected by Ptolemy and his successors as to this ?

Aristotle and Archimedes, for instance, thought the earth to be much
larger than the measurement of Eratosthenes showed it to be; and
their abstract calculations, notwithstanding their general authority,
gave way in this matter before the better grounded result. {s it likely
that this latter would in turn be rejected without what was at least sup-
posed by the learned to be equally well-founded reasons ?

Thus stood the matter at the close of classical times; and the litera-
ture of the subject was inherited by the Arabs, when they reached
their flourishing period, along with the great mass of Greek learning.
One of the early caliphs, Almamoun (813-833), who took an active inter-
est in scientific matters, ordered (A. D. 827) the measurement of an arc of
meridian in order to determine independently the size of the earth.
Several different accounts of how this order was carried out have come
down to us and vary considerably the one from the other. There
seem however to have been two separate and distinct measurements
made, resulting respectively in 57 and 564 Arabic miles for the value of
a degree of latitude.’ As the mean, 562 miles was adopted officially
for the length of a degree, But what was the true length of the Arabic
mile? It contained 4,000 so-called black cubits; a cubit, 4 palms; a
palm, 4 polles; and a polle, 6 barley grains laid side by side. But all
barley grains are not equal in thickness and as this variable quantity
is the foundation of the numerical system, modern experts have differed
greatly in the resulting value of a degree of latitude, the one giving it
at 54,563 toises, another at 63,750 toises, etc.2. The method of procedure
was in each case as follows: Two parties were sent to the same start-
ing point and, having there observed the altitude of the sun (by what
means is not known), the one party measured® toward the north, the
other toward the south, till by new observations they found they had
advanced 1 degree, where they ceased work and reported the distance
measured.* itibu Jounis, who furnished the most detailed account of
the operation, describes also the precaution necessary to insure accu-
racy in the result, but leaves us in the dark as to whether or not these
precautions were actually observed.® Albategnius, who in most respects
was among the most accurate of the Arabic scientists, gives the length
of a degree at 85 miles, which however may be the result of a typo-
graphic error in the printed translation;® while Edrisi is said to have

'Delambre, 66, quotes ‘‘Abilfedea” (Aboulfeda) as saying that the astronomers
found only 56 miles for the value of a degree.

3 Peschel (133) and Delambre (78) give different accounts of the manner of meas-
uring the line, the one by rules and stakes, the other by long cords, placing each
time the end of the last at the middle of the preceding to preserve a straight line.

given 75 miles to the degree.‘ and Aboul Hassan, 663 miles.2 The
measurement of 56% miles to the degree, which seems to have been
most generally accepted by the Arabs,’ is nearer the truth than either
of the two generally accepted classical ones, as the error is probably
only one-tenth.!

This, then, is the best result of Mohammedan science added to the
knowledge of classical antiquity. Christian Europe had as yet done
nothing toward solving this problem ; was even disposed to regard as
heretical a belief in the foundation principles thereof, until circum-navi-
gation of the globe proved beyond the possibility of a doubt the rotund-
ity of the earth. In the same decade in which the first voyage round
the world was completed, Jean Fernel, a French physician, undertook to
measure a degree of latitude, whose result, by amarvellous series of com-
pensating errors, turned out to be extremely accurate. The actuality of
this measurement also has been doubted;° but his relation is so cir-
cumstantial in all its details that it seems difficult to doubt his having
in reality carried out the plan he describes. Remarking that different
authors give varying lengths of the degree of latitude and that even
among the best, one did not know which to choose, he determined him-
self to make the experiment, and he found by a careful calculation the
length of a degree to be 68 Italian miles, 954 feet, which equal 544
Roman stadii, 4517 feet.6 Taking from Paris a carriage on which he
had made an attachment for counting the revolutions of one of the
wheels, he drove on theroad toward Amiens which led directly north,
until by observation he found he had passed a degree of latitude. His
carriage wheel had made 17,024 revolutions. The diameter of the
wheel was 6 feet and a little more than 6 digits; hence the circumfer-
ence 20 feet or 4 paces ; which gave for the whole distance, 68,096 paces
or 68 Italian miles, 90 feet,’ which, reduced to toises and taking into
account the alteration made in the length of the standard toise in 1668,
gives 57,070 toises for the length of a degree in the latitude of Paris.’
Bessel calculates that the true length is 57,055 toises.2 According to
Picard’s calculation, Fernel measured a line of only 56/36,” which short-
coming was compensated by calculating the direct distance too long.”

utes of are in his latitude of Paris, and Bauernfeind' calls it “‘einen vol-
lig werthlosen Versuch die Grésse der Erde zu messen.” Fate was
kinder to Fernel than his critics, and he cannot be deprived of the
unique honor of having first given to the world the nearly exact length
of a degree of latitude.’

Almost a century later (1615) Willibrord Snellius, a famous Dutch
physicist, made his celebrated trigonometrical survey of a line between
Bergen-op-Zoom, Leyden, and Alkmaar, which line, according to his
calculation, has a length of 34,018.20 perches of the Rhine. The dis-
tance in latitude he determined at 1° 1134’; and this, compared with the
distance surveyed, gives a mean value of the degree of latitude of 28,-
500 perches=55,100 toises of Paris. The result was, according to more
recent calculations, 2,000 toises too short, an error of nearly 34 per
cent. He himself was persuaded that the result was not accurate and
therefore undertook a second survey in 1622, but was prevented by
sickness and death from completing it with the necessary calculations.®
The base line was only 326.43 perches long (=631 toises and about 1
foot), an extremely short scale, considering the imperfection of his in-
struments and the fact that his triangles contained very many acute
angles.

The first English survey of a degree of latitude was made by a
sailor, Richard Norwood, who determined astronomically the latitude
of London and York, then measured with a chain the intervening dis-
tance, allowing in his calculations for the unevenness of the land, the
windings of the way, and also for refraction, declination, and parallax.
He found the difference in latitude to be 2° 28,’ instead of 2° 25’. His
measurement gave 367,176 feet for the degree of latitude, which, aliow-
ing 2.1315 English yards to the toise, gives 57,420 toises as the value of
a degree. He had been led to make the survey from the practical
need of information as a mariner, and published the results thereof in
1637 in a work entitled “The Seaman’s Practices.”?

About the middle of the seventeenth century (1645) Father Riccioli,
an Italian Jesuit, ran a series of triangles in the neighborhood of
Bologna, measured a base of 1,094 paces 24 feet, and by observations of
a number of stars for determining the distance in latitude between the
end points of his line, arrived at very different results, so that taking

them separately the value of a degree would vary, according to Cassini,
from 56,130 toises to 62,000.' Riccioli’s own calculations, combining all
the elements, gave 62,650 toises for the value of a degree, an error of 10
per cent.2. He seems not only not to have observed all three angles of
each triangle, but also to have employed very acute angles, even as
small as two degrees, which practice, as before remarked, increases
greatly the liability to error.

The year 1669 is memorable as that of the first survey whiCh is used
as a Starting point for the best of modern work. It was conducted by
Jean Picard, a French physicist, who, by improvements in instruments
and methods, showed a decided advance over any of his predecessors.
The line extended from Malvoisine to Sourdou in Picardy, which points
were connected by a series of thirteen triangles, two of which were
principally for verification. Cassini complains of him that he ob-
served only two angles in each two triangies, and only one angle of a
third triangle.‘ This serves to show that up to that period even the
most careful savant had not arrived at the recent conception of extreme
accuracy. Cassini himself, as we shall see later, made a survey which
was by no means faultless. Picard based his calculations on the
measurement of two base lines, each of which he measured twice. The
principal one was on the highway from Villejuive to Juvisy, the ad-
vantage of which for the base line was one of the reasons for choosing
this region for the survey.° Here he measured with two wooden rules,
each 4 toises long, a line which, according to the first measurement,
was 5,662 toises 5 feet long, the second, 5,663 toises 1 foot. He
adopted the mean of 5,663 toises. His second base had a length of
3,902 toises.6 His calculations gave as a result 57,057 toises for the
length of a degree; but he adopted the more convenient number of
57,060.7. Later he remarks that on the ocean the length would be 8
feet less, but thinks this unworthy of consideration.’ It may be well
to add that though he was acquainted with the fact of refraction, and
discovered the influence of temperature thereon, he takes no notice of
it in his calculations, nor did he make allowance for the precession of
the equinoxes or the aberration of light, and was still ignorant of the
flattening of the earth at the poles; consequently calculated on the

basis of the absolute sphericity of the earth. Later Maupertuis made
 acalculation of the length of a degree, based on Picard’s geodetic work,
but taking into account the precession of the equinoxes and the ab-
erration of light, and found it to be 57,183 toises;® or according to
another calculation, including the effect of refraction also, he finds the
value of a degree to be 56,925 toises.'"° As Picard was the first to ap-

ply the telescope to the quadrant, he was enabled to make more accu-
rate observations than his predecessors; but it is not to be wondered
at that he committed an error of a few seconds. He acknowledged
himself that he could not be responsible for errors of 2 seconds, not-
withstanding his exactitude, which error would make a difference of 32
toises on each observation.! This error however was happily com-
pensated by his toise being about one-thousandth shorter than the
standard.” Recent authorities find the length of a degree at this
latitude to be 57,011.825 toises,* so that Picard’s error amounted to
45.175 toises, or 0.79 per cent.

To settle a point of such importance Louis xiv ordered (1700) a
survey of a meridian line stretching throughout the entire length of
France. As early as 1680 a survey had been commenced with the
ideaof giving it this extent, but had been discontinued without coming
to any result. Now the line was divided into two parts, the one ex-
tending from Paris north to Dunkerque, the other from Paris south to
Collioure. Tie survey of the first was intrusted to La Hire, and was
found to have an amplitude of 2° 12’ 9” 30/4 and a length of 125,454
toises, which, reduced to sea-level and calculating on the basis of the
sphericity of the earth, gives to the degree 56,960 toises. Jacques
Cassini conducted the survey of the second and much longer line, found
its amplitude to be 6° 18’ 57” and its length 360,614 toises, which gives
for the degree 57,097 toises.2. Combining the two surveys, one has a line
with an amplitude of 8° 31’ 11/2, with a length of 486,156 toises ; this
gives as the mean length of a degree 57 ,061 toises, which approaches so
nearly to that determined by M. Picard that it was thought it should
conform to it.6 A base of 7,246 toises 2 feet was measured? for the
southern division, which varied 3 toises from ‘‘the calculated length con-
tinued from Paris,” in consequence of which various corrections in the
observed angles were made, by which the result was brought very near
(a trés peu prés) to that measured on the ground.® For the northern
division, Picard’s old base-line from Villejuive to Juvisy was adopted
without re-measuring, and a second base-line near Dunkerque was
measured for purposes of verification. This had a length of 5,464
toises 3 feet,? which was within almost 1 toise of the length found by
calculating the line from Picard’s base. All the angles of each tri-
angle of the entire survey were actually observed," and, for purposes of

comparison, nine triangles of Picard were also inclosed in the net.!
Great was the exultation of the French, for the results of this unprec-
edentedly great undertaking showed not only that the earth was not
flattened at the poles, as Newton and Huyghens taught, but that it
was actually elongated in that direction. Doubts were naturally ex-
pressed by the Newtonians as to the accuracy of the operations by
which the result had been obtained. To satisfy these there were repe-
titions with different instruments and different methods, the entire
work continuing at intervals from 1701 to 1736, and always with the
same result, viz, that the more southerly part gave the greatest length
of a degree.? Still the party of theory was not to be quieted, objecting
that the portions of the meridian were too near together to afford in-
controvertible proof of the earth’s form, and maintaining that the
true solution could only be furnished by surveying one meridian line
near the equator and another near the poles and comparing the re-
sults. This opinion gradually gained force, till finally the French
government undertook to provide the means for carrying out this proj-
ect, and the French Academy of Sciences to furnish the specialists to
conduct with commanding ability the operations.

For this purpose two expeditions were fitted out with all the care
possible at that date, to secure accuracy in the result of their respect-
ive surveys. The first set out for Peru in 1735, but did not return till
1744. In the mean time a second expedition had been sent to Sweden,
where it finished its work and returned to France in 1737; the result of
the latter survey as compared with those in France showed beyond a
doubt the flattening of the earth at the poles, without awaiting returns
from the equator. The instigator and chief of this enterprise was
the famous mathematician, Maupertuis, whose quarrel with Voltaire at
the court of Frederick the Great is probably much better known than
his perils and hardships’ in surveying a meridian line which crosses the
polar circle. His line was a short one, extending from Tornea to the
mountain Kittis, with an amplitude of only 57’ 283,’ the mean result of
the observations of the same two stars at both end stations. The mount-

perches pesantes, qu’il falloit continuellement poser sur la neige et relever ; pendant

cidens plus grands encore. Tandis que les extrémités de nos corps étoient glacées, le

ainous nature of the region favored large triangles, generally of a form
advantageous to the ease and accuracy of observation. The frozen
surface of the river Tornea offered an excellent opportunity to measure
a base line; so good in fact that Maupertuis neglected to take any ac-
count of its fall. This action has been censured by later mathemati-
cians, who have consequently corrected his result by 5.355. toises.'
His base line was 7,406.86 toises long, the two measurements differing
only 4 inches’ from each other. Calculating from this basis, he found
his meridian line to be 55,0234 toises long, which, compared with the
amplitude,’ gives the length of a degree of latitude crossing the Polar
circle 57,438 toises.6 Comparing this result with Picard’s measure-
ment and leaving out of the reckoning the aberration of light, which
was unknown to the latter, Maupertuis’s are would have an amplitude of
57/ 25,’ and this, compared with the length, would raise the value of a
degree at the polar circle to 57,497 toises or 437 toises greater than P1-
card’s result in France; and, taking theaberration into account, Mau-
pertuis’s result differs 950 toises from that which it ought to be, follow-
ing Cassini’s calculations based on the supposition of the earth being
elongated at the poles.°

The expedition to Peru met with a series of difficulties, which, com-
bined with party strife and the length of the line surveyed, detained the
experts nine years; so that the principal question, which caused their
going, viz, as to the form of the earth, was already settled forever before
their return, and the results achieved only served to add another factor
toward arriving at exactness in the solution of the matter. A couple of
Spanish representatives also took part in the operations. The company
was provided with several quadrants, on one of which was the first
micrometer ever so applied. Their astronomical observations were
made with a sector of 12-foot radius, and their base line was measured
with wooden rules 20 feet long. On the ends of these were fastened
projecting copper plates, so arranged that, in measuring, those of neigh-
boring rules stood at right angles to each other. In measuring, three
rules were laid on the ground in a straight line, level being secured by
means of wedges. The line was maintained by means of a stretched
cord, and the surveyors had to lie on the ground ‘pour les disposer”.’
They knew that these rules were subject to variations according to
changes in the humidity and temperature of the atmosphere, and found
themselves ‘obliged to examine each day and often several times the
little equation or correction that was necessary to apply to them.”® For

this purpose they had a bar of iron whereon was marked a toise. This
was kept in the shade in the guard tent, but no regard seems to have
been paid to the fact that the iron also was subject to constant changes
in length. In computing the final result an allowance was made for its
expansion by heat, probably for the average temperature of Peru above
that of Paris. This toise was afterward adopted as the standard of
measure under the name of toise of Peru, and with it all subsequent
surveys have been compared. All the angles of each triangle were
actually observed, many of them twice, with different instruments and
by different observers, and some of them even three times.' Experi-
ments were made to determine as nearly as possible the constant fail-
ure of the quadrants, which of course was taken into account in the
observations, besides which other corrections were made to reduce the
sum of all three angles to 180°, the amount of this last correction sel-
dom reaching 30 seconds.” The first base line was measured by two
different parties starting at the opposite ends, and had an extent of 6,272
toises. The second line, for verification, was 5,259 toises long, which
according to Bouguer was within 3 to 4 feet, according to La Condamine,
within one toise, of the trigonometrically calculated length. The entire
line had an amplitude of 3° 7’ 3.”3,3 crossed the equator, and measured
176,940 toises, according to Bouguer,‘ or 176,930,according to Condamine.®
The operations were carried on at an altitude of more than 1,000 feet
above sea level, to which all measurements must be reduced. Accord-
ing to actual measurement the first degree from the equator is 56,767
toises long, from which 212 toises were subtracted to reduce to sea
level, and 6 to 7 toises added for expansion of the standard in the heat,
giving for the true value of a degree of latitude at the equator 56,753
toises.6 The entire operation was subjected to a searching criticism at
the beginning of the present century, in the light of more recent re- —
searches, with the following result: ‘* Wenn wir daher nach sorgfalti-
ger Erwigung aller vorher erérterten Umstiinde der Ungewissheit in
der Grosse eines Breiten-Grades am ASquator noch auf 80-100 Toisen
festsetzen, so glauben wir keine Ungerechtigkeit gegen die franzosi-
schen und spanischen Messkiinstler zu begehen, deren Arbeiten keines-
wegs aus Mangel an Geschicklichkeit, sondern enizig wegen Unvol-
kommenheit der damaligen Instrumente nicht den Grad von Genauig-
keit haben konnten, der zu einer Gradmessung erfordert wird.”?

The next great survey was also the work of French savants, but was
undertaken for a different purpose. It was now admitted on all sides
that the earth is flattened at the poles; but there was in France at

least a strong desire for a more correct determination of the size of the
earth than had yet been made, in order to deduct therefrom a stand-
ard of measurement founded in nature, so that if ever lost it could be
recovered; and further that there might be a standard which was in
its character not national, but universal. This was one of those plans
for universal improvement so rife at the beginning of the French Revo-
lution, and the one perhaps of all which has been most permanent
and wide-spread in its results. The work of carrying out the project
was intrusted to Delambre and Mechain, two prominent scientists of
the day. They surveyed a meridian line extending from Dunkerque
to Barcelona, with an amplitude of 9° 40’ 24/.75, and a length of
551,584.72 toises. The line was later extended to Formentera in the
Balearic Islands, but too late to change the result, which had been
accepted for the standard of measurement. For this survey the most
careful preparations were made to secure the utmost accuracy. Instead
of the old-fashioned quadrants and sectors, with their unwieldly bulk
and subject to a variety of changes from temperature, position, their
own weight, ete., the then newly invented repetition circles of Borda
were used with excellent result. The same expert also provided rules
for measuring the base line, which were of a pattern entirely new and
capable of an accuracy hitherto impossible. The measuring part was
formed of platinum, whose relations to the toises of Peru and Lapland
were accurately determined. Upon this a rule of copper 16 inches
shorter was fastened securely at one end. The ratio of expansion of the
two metals and the difference of length at a fixed temperature being
known, an observation of the temperature and of the difference of their
lengths by means of a vernier provided for that purpose, which was
fixed to the metal and protected from the sun’s rays, gives the amount
of expansion at the moment of observation. Here was also adopted
for the first time a plan which afterwards became universal in such
operations, namely in measuring the base, to place the rules ata dis-
tance from each other to prevent the effect of the shock of contact, and
measure carefully the interval. For this purpose there was attached
at one end of each rule a small slide, accurately divided into hundred-
thousandths for measuring minute distances, and provided with a
microscope for reading them. After both rules were placed in line this
was moved forward with the greatest care till it covered the interval
between the rules, and the distance was at once read off and noted.

In reference to the actual labor in determining a meridian line, De-
lambre remarks:' “De toutes les opérations qui concourent a la
mesure des degrés du méridien, les observations de latitude sont celles
qui demandeut plus de précautions, plus de soins et plus de temps.”
As an example of the extreme care taken in this work, may be cited the
fact that to determine the latitude of the Panthéon at Paris, Mechain
and Delambre each made eighteen hundred astronomical observations,

' Base du systéme, 1, 158,

the results agreeing to the sixth of a second.! This was to establish
the exact position of one point in the middle of the surveyed line; and
similar observations were necessary at both ends of the same. Two
base lines were measured, 6,075,90 and 6,006,25 toises long, respect-
ively. In fixing the permanent ends thereof and in the work of
placing the rules in the true direction, etc., this survey furnished the
model for the future; and though more recent experts have changed
details of practice, they have offered nothing new in principle. In
reducing the length actually measured to the true basis of the survey,
certain slight alterations were necessary, which were made with the
greatest nicety. For instance, the line of Melun was not perfectly
straight, but was broken at one point by an angle of 179° 10/ 49/.09,
which necessitated calculations to give the length of the corresponding
straight line; even the thickness of the cord bearing the plummet was
subtracted, and corrections for temperature, for inevitable errors in
tracing the line, and for the thickness of the rules, were added.?, When
all this was done it remained to reduce this to the are of a circle and
then to sea-level. Delambre says that the greatest error to be feared is
that of the “ vernier des languettes,” or slides for measuring the inter-
vals between the rules, which error will not surpass one inch in 6,000
toises, z3s'500 Of the whole length.2 Work of such nicety is necessarily
slow, and it need not surprise one to learn that it took forty-one days of
actual work from 9 o’clock A. M. to sun-down to measure one line, and
that the greatest attainable speed was to place in a day ninety rules
end to end, or in other words—measure 360 meters.‘

Equal care was taken in locating the triangles, as witness a search
of six days for a place from which at one time three important points
might be seen or the measuring an angle 170 times (!), because of
the peculiar effect of the sun’s light at different times of the day on
a belvédére, which formed the point of a neighboring angle. With
Borda’s circle was observed not only the angle between the two lines
of the triangle, but also the zenith distance of each point. The size
of the angle was determined by the use of a series of twenty angles in
favorable cases, and of repeating doubtful cases at different hours of
the day.6 The result of the survey was to give to the forty-fifth degree
of latitude the value of 67,027 toises.

Thus the eighteenth century proved conclusively what the genius of
the seventeenth had only made probable on theoretical grounds,
namely, the flattening of the earth at the poles. It remained for the
nineteenth not only to determine exactly the quantity thereof, but to
bring to light another fact not dreamed of heretofore, 7. ¢., that the
earth, even in its geodetic lines, has no regular geometrical figure
whatever. This was the finishing touch to the dream of the Pytha-

gorean school. First, it was proven that the earth is not only not
the center of the universe, but that it is merely as a grain of sand in
the illimitable ocean of space. Then its sphericity gave way before
the genius of Newton and the work of French enthusiasts. Finally
the gradual increase in accuracy in all branches of science deprived
us of the last poetic idea as to its form, struck the death knell of the
Pythagorean theory, and left us with the bald fact that our beautiful
earth cannot lay claim to any ideal form.
