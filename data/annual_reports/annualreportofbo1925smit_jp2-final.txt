OF THE
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
CuarLes D. Watcottr

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1925

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith the customary
annual report showing the activities and condition of the Smith-
sonian Institution and the (government bureaus under its adminis-
trative charge during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925. The first
27 pages of the report contain an account of the affairs of the Insti-
tution, and in Appendixes 1 to 10 are given more detailed summaries
of the operations of the United States National Museum, the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of
American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National
Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the United States
Regional Bureau of the Iniernational Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture, the Smithsonian Library, and of the publications issued under
the direction of the Institution.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America, “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of
the executive departments.”

2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925
THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of
the House of Representatives, together with six other persons other
than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the
city of Washington, and the other four shall be inhabitants of some
State, but no two of them of the same State.” One of the Regents
is elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has fallen
upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suitable person is
chosen by the Regents as secretary of the Institution, who is also
secretary of the Board of Regents and the executive officer directly
in charge of the Institution’s activities.

The following changes occurred in the personnel of the board
during the year: The Hon. Charles G. Dawes, as Vice President, be-
came on March 4, 1925, a Regent of the Institution ex officio. Sena-
tor Reed Smoot, of Utah, was appointed a Regent on December 2,
1924, to succeed Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, deceased. Senator
George Wharton Pepper, of Pennsylvania, was appointed a mem-
ber of the board on December 8, 1924, to succeed Senator Medill Mc-
Cormick, resigned. Senator Woodbridge N. Ferris, of Michigan,
was appointed on March 11, 1925, to succeed Senator A. Owsley
Stanley, whose term as a Regent expired with his retirement from
the Senate.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United States, chancellor;
Charles G. Dawes, Vice President of the United States; members
from the Senate, Reed Smoot, George Wharton Pepper, Woodbridge
N. Ferris; members from the House of Representatives, Albert
Johnson, R. Walton Moore, Walter H. Newton; citizen members,
George Gray, Delaware; Charles F. Choate, jr., Massachusetts;
Henry White, Washington, D. C.; Robert S. Brookings, Missouri;
Irwin B. Laughlin, Pennsylvania; and Frederic A. Delano, Wash-
ington, D. C.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

The past year marks a crisis in the affairs of the Institution. For
several years past it has grown more and more difficult to stretch
the income from its meager endowment sufficiently to cover the
steadily increasing costs of even the limited amount of research
which can be undertaken and of the administration of the eight
erowing Government bureaus. 'The cost of publishing is more than
twice that of 10 years ago, which has resulted in materially de-
creasing the output of Smithsonian publications. The research work
of the Institution is now limited practically to the paleontological
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

work of your secretary and the work on the solar constant of radia-
tion under Doctor Abbot’s direction, and both of these investigations
are partially supported by private financial aid. The Institution
has for several years been undermanned, and the ordinary running
expenses are met only by the exercise of rigid economy.

This condition has been recognized for some years, and attempts
have been made from time to time to increase the endowment. But
during the past year the situation has become acute, and it has been
realized that without a marked increase in the Institution’s resources
it would no longer be able to hold its place among the great research
institutions of the present day, the annual income of several of which
is greater than the Smithsonian’s entire endowment. If allowed to
eo on under these circumstances, the Smithsonian, America’s na-
tional scientific establishment, which was the guiding light during
the formative period of scientific activity in this country, and which,
las been the parent of most of the present great scientific bureaus of
the Government, would be relegated to second or third rank, and its
world-wide reputation as a center of scientific effort in America
would rapidly diminish.

With a definite realization of these facts, the administration of
the Institution has concentrated during the year upon a direct effort
to increase its resources, and by the close of the year several plans
were under way and one definite step had been taken toward that
end. An agreement was entered into with the William T. De Van
Corporation, of New York, to issue a series of popular scien-
tific books, to be known as the Smithsonian Scientific Series, a
project similar in general plan to the Chronicles of America series,
published by the Yale University Press, which proved so success-
ful under Mr. De Van’s direction. In the Smithsonian series it
is intended to present in readable form, and profusely illustrated, the
activities of the Institution and the bureaus under its direction in
many branches of science. The series will consist of 20 volumes, and
the following tentative titles of a few will indicate their nature:

Sun-Rays in the Welfare of Man.

Man’s Origin and Development.

Gems, Meteorites, and Stones.

North American Indians.

The Study of Our Seas.

Birds and Their Ways.

The preparation of manuscripts was well under way at the close
of the year, and it is hoped that before very long the sale of these
books will add materially to the Institution’s annual income. Two
other projects, each holding promise of a large increase of endow-
ment, were under consideration, but final action had not been taken
by June 30, and their discussion at this time would be premature.
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMJTHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

However, it is believed that as a result of the concerted effort of the
administration the outlook for the future is brighter regarding the
possibility of increased resources for research and publication.

lowing:

6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925
RESEARCHES AND EXPLORATIONS

An important part of the Institution’s work in increasing scientific
knowledge is the exploration of regions imperfectly known to science.
Although the limited funds of the Institution sharply restrict the
number of expeditions which it is able to put in the field, neverthe-
less it is often found mutually advantageous to cooperate with other
agencies in field work, and the Institution thus has an interest in a
considerable number of expeditions each year. Many of them are
conducted under the direct supervision of the heads of several of
the bureaus under the Institution, and accounts of these will be
found in the reports appended hereto on the National Museum, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Astrophysical Observatory.
A few of the expeditions will here be described briefly, in order to
give an indication of the nature of the work undertaken.

GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

During the field season of 1924, your secretary carried on his usual
geological work in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, with the inten-
tion of completing the reconnaissance begun some years ago of the
pre-Devonian formations north of the Bow Valley. The weather
was unusually unfavorable, and on 42 days out of the season it
was very difficult and sometimes impossible to carry on the field
work. The chief problem attacked was the determination of the
proper classification of the great Lyell limestones. In order to
solve this it was necessary to find fossils in them, and during the
past six seasons all such attempts were unsuccessful.

A section was measured from Fossil Mountain, situated northeast
of Lake Louise station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, eastward
into Oyster Mountain, the main north and south ridge of which was
found to be formed of the Lyell limestones. Two glacial cirques,
named Cotton Grass and Tilted Mountain, cut deeply into this ridge,
and in these the base of the Lyell formation was uncovered, as well
as the shales and oolitic limestones of the underlying Bosworth
formation. The brook running out of the glacial lake in the bottom
of the southern cirque was followed over the ledges of Lyell lime-
stone westward to Tilted Mountain Falls, where it drops into the
canyon valley of upper Baker Creek. Everywhere the hard, un-
fossiliferous, light gray limestone was encountered, except near the
edge of the cliffs above and east of the falls, where long narrow
strips covered with grass and trees occur between the north and
south ledges. An approach was made from the southern bank of
the brook, and on a rounded, glaciated ridge of the gray magnesian
Lyell limestone there was found, interbedded in the Lyell, an out-
crop of thin layers of a bluish-gray limestone which contained frag-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Fi

ments of Upper Cambrian trilobites. The next day these layers
were traced back to the brook, and a little lower in the section we
found two bands of shale and bluish-gray limestone which contained
fossils. The lower of the two contained many fragments of trilo-
bites, which were later identified as closely related to Upper Cam-
brian Franconia trilobites from Wisconsin, and the upper band
contained fossils of the same type as the fauna of the St. Lawrence
member of the Trempeauleau formation of Wisconsin.. Thus after
a search occupying a portion or several field seasons, fossils were
found which definitely located the Lyell limestones as of Upper
Cambrian age.

After the Lyell problem was definitely settled, further collections
of fossils were made in the Ozarkian upper Mons limestones of
Fossil Mountain, and later in the Mons formations of Wild Flower
Canyon, which heads on Johnston Creek Pass.

During the past eight seasons considerable progress has been
made in the understanding of the pre-Devonian geological forma-
tions and their faunas in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, but much
remains to be done, particularly in the region between the Canadian
Pacific Railway and the Arctic Ocean.

ZOOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN WESTERN CHINA

In my last report mention was made of the tragic ending of the
Institution’s collecting expedition in China conducted under the
auspices of Dr. W. L. Abbott. Mr. Charles M. Hoy, in charge of
the work, following a series of misfortunes, was stricken with a
severe case of appendicitis, and died shortly after. In order that
Hoy’s work might be continued, his collecting outfit was transferred
to the Rev. David C. Graham, who for a number of years has col-
lected zoological material in the vicinity of Suifu for the National
Museum. In 1923 he had carried out very successful collecting
operations in the region about Tatsienlu, to the northwest of Suifu,
and in May, 1924, plans were completed for an expedition to Song-
pan, in the northern part of the Province of Szechwan, using Hoy’s
outfit.

The distance from Suifu to Songpan was about 400 miles, and in
order to keep down expenses Mr. Graham covered most of this
distance on foot. His party, including carriers, skinners, and other
helpers, reached Songpan on July 14, after a strenuous journey of
22 days. In September Mr. Graham wrote as follows:

The Songpan trip has been taken, and we are safely at Suifu with 50 boxes
of specimens, most of which are about ready to be mailed by parcel post.

This has been a harder and rougher trip than the one of Tatsienlu or any

other previous trip. It is much harder to secure food and other necessities
around Songpan than at Tatsienlu. There were times when we could pur-
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

chase no fruit, vegetables, eggs, or meat. At Songpan it was impossible to go
west or north, where large mammals were found in abundance, so that the only
place we could go was east to the Yellow Dragon Gorge. Even there we had
to have an escort of six Chinese soldiers and had of course to pay all their
expenses! ~ #°) #1

The reason we could not go north of Songpan or west of that place was
that the Bolotsi aborigines are so savage and so inclined to murder and
brigandage that the Chinese can not control them and are afraid of them,
and the officials could not protect us in those regions. Just before we returned
from Songpan the Bolotsis attacked a company of Chinese soldiers, killed seyv-
eral of their number, stole several rifles, and drove the scared and defeated
soldiers back to their barracks. I have not heard that the Chinese have
dared to go into the Bolotsi country with a punitive expedition.

The catch of mammals is not large. We are very sorry about this. It is
due primarily to the fact that the mammal-catching districts around Songpan
were closed to us. Yellow Dragon Gorge was a fine place for birds and
insects, but a great festival had just been held there, in which aborigine and
Chinese hunters from all directions had joined in the chase, and woodcutters
were busy in the woods cutting timber for the new temples that are being
constructed. The mammals had been scared away.

Mr. Graham also sent native collectors out to work in other
regions, and regarding their work he says:

This year’s catch is bigger than that of last year. There are 50 boxes of
specimens on hand, and I expect to send them off by parcel post as early as
possible. Besides the 50 boxes just mentioned, there is the entire catch of the
netter Ho for at least three months, who has been collecting about Beh Luh
Din, Chengtu, and Kuanshien during the summer, and specimens now being
secured by two collectors on Mount Omei, one at Shin Kai Si and one on the
higher altitudes.

The collections resulting from the season’s work include about
5,000 insects, notably two-winged flies, butterflies, and moths; 558
birds, of which at least a dozen proved to be new to the Museum
collections; about 250 mollusks; and a smaller number of mammals,
fishes, reptiles and batrachians, earthworms, and plants.

30TANICAL EXPLORATION IN PANAMA AND COSTA RICA

Mr. Paul C. Standley, associate curator of the division of plants,
United States National Museum, engaged in botanical exploration
during the latter part of 1923 and the first four months of 1924 in
Panama and Costa Rica. The work in Panama was carried on with
the cooperation of the government of the Panama Canal, and had
for its purpose the collection of specimens and data for a report on
the plant life of the Canal Zone which will be published later.
Regarding the exploration in Panama, Mr. Standley writes:

Part of November, December, and most of January were spent in botanical
exploration in and near the Zone. Nearly all parts of this area were visited,
and 7,000 numbers of plants were obtained, represented by about twice as
many specimens. These collections are now being studied and have been

found to contain a number of species new to science, besides many not col-
lected previously in the area.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

The vegetation of the Zone is typical of that existing in Central America
at low elevations, but it is here possible to study in close proximity the floras
of the Atlantic and Pacific slopes, these floras being sharply differentiated in
Central America because of differences in the climates of the two watersheds.
The Pacific slope has well defined wet and dry Seasons; on the Atlantic slope
there is usually plentiful moisture throughout the year.

Although the original vegetation of the Isthmus of Panama has been greatly
modified in many places because of long occupation by man, and especially
because of operations incident to the construction and management of the
canal, there remain near the canal extensive areas of virgin forest whose
animal and plant life is of great interest. Advantage has been taken of this
fact to establish recently a station for tropical scientific research on Barro
Colorado Island in Gatun Lake, the island having been set aside for the pur-
pose by the governor of the canal. Upon this island, largely as a result of
the energy and enthusiasm of Mr. James Zetek, there has been constructed
this year a laboratory building with accommodations for students, and trails
have been cut to make the virgin forest, which covers several hundred acres,
available for study.

From Panama, Mr. Standley proceeded to Costa Rica, where he
spent two and one-half months in botanical exploration and col-
lecting. Costa Rica is, from a botanical standpoint, probably the
richest part of the North American continent, and in the highland
region, where a temperate rather than tropical climate prevails, the
luxuriance and variety of the vegetation is extraordinary. Of the
Costa Rica work, Mr. Standley reports:

The collection consists of 8,000 numbers of plants, many of which will doubt-
less prove to be new. Special attention was given to the orchids, of which
about 1,500 numbers were obtained. ‘These are now being studied by Mr.
Oakes Ames, through whose interest the work in Costa Rica was undertaken.
Of orchids Costa Rica possesses probably a larger number of species than
any other portion of the American tropics of equal extent. Over 1,000 species
have been reported from this small Republic, and it is certain that many
more await discovery. While most Costa Rican orchids, like those of other
countries, have inconspicuous flowers, some, such as the Cattleyas, are of un-
surpassed beauty.

Visits were made to the Volcano of Poas, celebrated for its great crater,
which contains a lake that erupts frequently; to the Voleano of Turrialba,
whose forests are noted for their wealth of ferns; and to many other rich
localities in the central highlands.

A short visit to the comparatively arid Pacific coast proved that the flora
of this part of Costa Rica is relatively meager and uninteresting. Several
visits were made to the wet lowland forests of the Atlantic watershed, where
the vegetation is even more luxuriant than in the mountains and the species
are almost equally numerous. Little is known of the plants of the Atlantic
lowlands of Central America, although it is probably that no other region
will better reward exploration.

ARCHEOLOGICAL EXPEDITION TO CHINA

An expedition to China under the joint auspices of the Freer
Gallery of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and directed
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

by Mr. Carl Whiting Bishop, associate curator of the Freer Gal-
lery, conducted successful archeological investigations at I Chou,
Province of Chihli, and at various localities in the Province of
Shensi. To the southwest of I Chou, which is built upon the ruins
of an ancient city, Mr. Bishop discovered parts of old earthen
walls of considerable size, and to the east of the city were found
groups of large mounds rising from the plain. These were exam-
ined, and many fragments of pottery and tile collected on the sur-
face of the mounds. A survey of the locality was made by airplane,
in order to determine the extent and plan of the ancient site.

Although the work of this expedition commenced during the
previous fiscal year, it was continued into the present year; and,
us no detailed account was given in my last report, I will quote a
few paragraphs from the report of the curator of the Freer Gallery
upon the work at Shensi:

In Shensi the members of the field staff visited the Western Han (206
B. C.—A. D. 25) capital of Ch’ang-an, securing sufficient data while there to
make a fair reconstruction of the ancient city. In the same Province they
inspected also two large mounds of the usual truncated pyramidal form, as-
cribed to early Han emperors; the supposed tomb of the Emperor Ch’in Shih
Huang-ti (221-210 B.C.), and the tombs of the famous Emperor Han Wu
Ti (140-87 B. C.), and his General Ho Ch’ii-ping. The tomb of Han Wu Ti
is an unusually large one, measuring 278 yards at its base, and presents
opportunities of great archeological interest, as does also that of General
Ho Ch’ii-ping, where Mr. Bishop saw not only the well-known stone figure
of a horse trampling on a recumbent warrior but examined also several other
partially exposed stone sculptures of the early Han period. Photographs and
scale plans of several of the tombs and temples in this vicinity were made.

The first actual excavation work conducted by the expedition was begun
in the spring of this year at Yii-ho Chén, about 17 miles west of Hsin-yang
Chou, in the Province of Honan. This specific undertaking has an added sig-
nificance archeologically, in that it is the first work of the kind to be con-
ducted in China by any foreign Government in cooperation with the Chinese
authorities. At Yii-ho Chén two tombs of the Han dynasty (206 B. C.—A. D.
221) were excavated; the work revealed interesting data on ancient tomb
construction, and brought to light Chinese cultural objects dating from pre-
historic times to the Han period. Specimens in metal, stone, and pottery
were found in the tombs; chariot fittings, mirrors, and arrow points of bronze;
one or two gold rings; cast-iron implements; a stone ax, and parts of stone
doors and lintels; a jade chisel; slate arrow-heads, and a number of pieces
of ancient pottery—some intact, some fragmentary—among them a kind of
glazed pottery which, if it be of Han production, is a type hitherto scarcely
known to us.

In August the Yii-ho Chén finds were exhibited for one day, under Mr.
3ishop’s direction, at the Historical Museum in Peking; between 5,000 and
6,000 visitors attended the exhibit.

In the early autumn Mr. Bishop, together with Doctor Barbour, professor
of geology at Peking University, and Doctor Tegengren, a Swedish mining
geologist, examined a mound in Peitaiho, on the Gulf of Chihli, which dis-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ti

closes evidences of what Mr. Bishop believes to be a Han dynasty naval base
or fortress, one-.of three which are said to have been built at that time, and
of which two only have been located.

MARSH-DARIEN EXPEDITION

An expedition under the auspices of Mr. R. O. Marsh explored
during a part of 1924 the little-known Isthmus of Darien, in
Panama. A number of men representing several institutions and
various branches of science accompanied the expedition at the invi-
tation of Mr. Marsh, the Smithsonian Institution being represented
by Mr. John L. Baer, who was particularly interested in the
anthropological phase of the work. This expedition, like that of
Mr. Hoy mentioned in last year’s report, had a tragic ending, so
far as the Institution was concerned, for while the party was pro-
ceeding up the Chucunaque River Mr. Baer was taken suddenly
ill, and, although hurriedly transported to the coast, he died within
a few days.

A brief report of the work of the expedition, written by the head
curator of anthropology of the National Museum, reads in part as
follows:

The route followed was from Balboa to San Miguel Bay, through Darien
Harbor, and up the Tuyra River to the village of Real. There a change was
made to smaller boats and the Rio Chucunaque ascended to Yavisa, near which
a permanent camp was established. A visit was made to the Choco Indians,
who occupy the middle river valleys above tidewater, and to the Cuna, who
live in the higher river valleys and mountain district. The Choco have a
local government, live in large, well-built community houses, and subsist on
rice, bananas, plantains, corn, and yucca. They are expert fishermen, diving
into deep pools and catching certain kinds of rock fish in their hands. ‘heir
religion is a form of primitive belief in the influence of good and bad spirits.
Mr. Marsh observes that they are a happy, careless, childlike people, friendly
if well treated, very Polynesian-like, wearing breech-cloths, but decorated with
beads, silver earrings, and wrist bands, and wreaths of gay flowers.

The Cuna have a higher culture than the Choco, are monogamous, have
hereditary chiefs, families have separate houses, and large houses are used
for tribal meetings and ceremonies. They raise long-staple tree cdtton, dye
and weave cotton into cloth and hammocks, grow corn, plantains, bananas,
yucca, coffee, chocolate, and sugar cane. They are adepts with the bow and
arrow and blowgun.

The party proceeded up the Chucunaque River with great difficulty, owing
to barriers of drift logs, at last reaching the Cunas Bravos, who were regarded
as hostile. The Cunas Bravos are agriculturalists and exhibit a lower degree
of culture than the Cunas of the lower river. The chief of the Cunas Bravos
spoke good English, having as a young man shipped at Colon on an English
vessel, and in 12 years had sailed over half the world. It was at this point
that John L. Baer became ill.

Activities were next transferred to the San Blas Indians, who inhabit a
long stretch of the north coast of Panama. These Indians, who number
approximately 40,000, have always kept aloof from the white man, realizing
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

that contact with other races would work their undoing. Amicable relations
were established with them and many interesting specimens of their arts and
industries were collected for the National Museum. The San Blas Indians
have an advanced social organization, with a ruler who could perhaps be prop-
erly classed as a king. Through the San Blas, Mr. Marsh came in contact with
hundreds of “ white Indians” whose presence in Panama has been known
for a long time but who have not been examined by scientific observers.
Individuals brought by Mr. Marsh to the United States have been carefully
examined and tentatively stated, before field studies go more fully into the
matter, to present a form of albinism.

ADDITIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY

For several years there has been recognized the need of an addi-
tional assistant secretary to relieve the pressure on the Institution
of administration of the eight Government bureaus, several of which
have developed rapidly in recent years. This need was laid before
Congress, and in the last appropriation bill provision was made for
the new position. After a thorough study of the qualifications
needed for the position, Dr. Alexander Wetmore was appointed on
April 1, 1925, as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
with general supervision of the National Museum, the National
Gallery of Art, and the National Zoological Park.

Doctor Wetmore graduated from Kansas State University in 1912,
having specialized in biology. He carried on post-graduate studies
in biology at George Washington University, receiving the degree
of M. S. in 1916 and Ph. D. in 1920. Since 1910 he has served in
the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, first as agent,
then as assistant biologist, and finally as biologist, with official sta-
tion at Washington, D. C.

During Doctor Wetmore’s connection with the Biological Survey
he conducted numerous investigations dealing with birds and mam-
mals, and in 1923 directed the U. S. S. Zanager expedition which
engaged in general scientific exploration of islands in the Pacific.

On November 18, 1924, he was appointed superintendent of the
National Zoological Park, where he exhibited unusual administrative
ability, and on April 1, 1925, he was installed in his new position.

SMITHSONIAN RADIO TALKS

In my last report there was described the beginning of a series
of radio talks by the Smithsonian Institution in cooperation with
station WRC of the Radio Corporation of America, as an addition
to the Institution’s established methods of the diffusion of knowl-
edge. The entire matter was placed in charge of Mr. Austin H.
Clark, curator of echinoderms in the National Museum, and under
his able and enthusiastic direction the series of talks was a distinct
success, as attested by calls and letters from many listeners.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

On October 2, 1924, the series of talks was begun again, with
increased scope, and between that date and May 14, 1925, twenty-
eight 15-minute talks were presented to the radio audience under
the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution through station WRC,
four of these having been broadcast jointly with stations WJY and
WJZ of New York City, thus considerably extending the audience.
Ten of these talks were given by members of the staff of the Insti-
tution, the other 18 having been given by scientists representing
other establishments selected by and presented under the auspices
of the Smithsonian. A list of the talks given during the year
follows:

This Smithsonian radio series has proved to be an excellent means
of disseminating authentic scientific information, and Mr. Clark
had already begun at the close of the fiscal year to arrange the
program for the coming year. It is intended to increase not only
the scope of the talks, but also the audience to be reached by
exchanging material with Westinghouse station WBZ, of New
England.

Plans were under way also, near the close of the year, for a distinct
series of radio talks on the National Zoological Park, to be presented
by the superintendent of the park and others who have a special
knowledge of certain groups of animals shown in the park. It is
expected to begin this series in October, 1925.

PUBLICATIONS

A total of 155 volumes and pamphlets were issued during the year
by the Institution and the Government bureaus under its adminis-
tration. Of these, 171,865 copies were distributed, including 262
volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl-
edge, 24,008 of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 26,825
volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Annual Reports, 6,102
special Smithsonian publications, 104,596 volumes and separates of
the various series of National Museum publications, 7,354 publica-
tions of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 68 volumes of the
annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, 44 reports on the Harri-
man Alaska expedition, and 1,057 reports of the American Historical
Association.

The publications of the Institution constitute its principal means
of carrying out one of its main purposes, “the diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” With the 11 distinct series now issued, a very
wide field of readers is reached, as in addition to the technical
papers, intended for use by scientists and students, a semipopular
account of progress in all branches of science is presented to the
general reader in the appendixes to the annual reports of the Institu-
tion. As explained in last year’s report, these reports have since
the war been issued over two years late. Last year, however, funds
were provided to enable the Institution to bring them up to date
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

by issuing two reports in one year, and this has now been accom-
plished, the report for 1923 having been received from the printer
in June, 1925, and the 1924 report promised for delivery in October,
1925. This is probably as nearly on time as the reports can be
issued, owing to their complicated nature, which involves the assem-
bling of material from foreign as well as American sources and the
submitting of proof to some 30 authors in all parts of the world.

Allotments for printing—The congressional allotments for the

of the Institution were practically used up at the close of the year.
The appropriation for the coming year ending June 30, 1926, totals
$90,000, allotted as follows:

Committee on printing and publication—The Smithsonian advis-
ory committee on printing and publication considers and makes
recommendations concerning all manuscripts offered for publica-
tion. It also assists in determining the publication policy of the
Institution and endeavors to insure the most efficient administration
of all funds for printing and binding. During the year five meet-
ings were held and 75 manuscripts acted upon. A vacancy was cre-
ated in the personnel of the committee by the death of Mr. N. Hollis-
ter, superintendent of the National Zoological Park. Dr. Alexander
Wetmore, who succeeded him as superintendent of the park, also took
his place on the committee. Upon Doctor Wetmore’s appointment as
an assistant secretary of the Institution, he in turn was succeeded
on the committee by Dr. William M. Mann, the present superin-
tendent of the park. The membership of the committee is as fol-
lows: Dr. Leonhard Stejneger (chairman), Dr. George P. Merrill,
Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, Dr. William M. Mann, Dr. Marcus Benjamin,
Mr. Stanley Searles, and Mr. W. P. True, secretary.

LIBRARY

During the year the most important change in the staff of the
Smithsonian library was the appointment of Mr. William L. Corbin
as librarian. Mr. N. P. Scudder, assistant librarian in charge of the
National Museum library for the past 38 years, died May 19, 1925.
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

The accessions to the libraries, exclusive of those to the library of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, which is reported on by the
chief of the bureau, totaled 12,537. The most outstanding gift of the
year was the entomological library of the late Col. Thomas L.
Casey, numbering about 4,500 volumes and pamphlets, chiefly on
coleoptera, which will be deposited in the section of insects of the
National Museum.

The loans totaled 10,657. Special effort was made to supply re-
quests for missing volumes or parts of volumes, and 2,009 were ob-
tained. There were sent to the Library of Congress 7,287 publica-
tions to be added to the Smithsonian deposit and 7,408 documents of
foreign governments for the document division. Seven thousand
one hundred and thirty-two volumes and pamphlets were catalogued
and much general work was done on the collections, including a de-
tailed investigation by the librarian of the needs of the lbrary.

NATIONAL MUSEUM

By the action of the Congress in providing for the appointment of
an additional assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution te
have general supervision of the National Museum and certain other
Government bureaus under administrative charge of the Institution,
Dr. Alexander Wetmore was appointed to that office on April 1,
1925. The application of the reclassification act resulted in the
adoption of a more just salary scale for the scientific staff, and for
the first time in many years every position in the Museum personnel
was filled, the salaries previously available for certain positions
having been too small to attract men properly equipped to hold
them. The increase of $52,396 in the Museum appropriations over
last year was sufficient to cover the larger salaries, but does not
allow for proper advancement for efficient service, as provided in
the reclassification act. Additional funds are urgently needed for
this purpose and also for the normal expansion of the Museum, in-
cluding the purchase of specimens, and for use in minor explorations.

The Museum contributed during the past winter seven speakers to
the series of Smithsonian radio taiks, organized last year under the
direction of Mr. Austin H. Clark. This new field for the dissemina-
tion of knowledge offers great possibilities.

The Loeb collection of chemical types has made splendid progress
under the direction of Mr. O. E. Roberts, jr., curator, 616 new speci-
mens having been added to the collection during the year.

The Museum received during the year 363,490 specimens, a slight
increase over last year’s accessions, and 1,232 additional lots of ma-
terial were received for examination and report. A total of 23,244
duplicate specimens were distributed as gifts to educational institu-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY LZ

tions or exchanged for specimens needed to complete collections in
the Museum, and 33,966 specimens were distributed as loans to spe-
cialists and students for study and identification.

The accessions to the Museum collections in all its departments
are described in detail in the report of the assistant secretary, Ap-
pendix 1, and only a few of the outstanding gifts will be mentioned
here. In the department of anthropology, the ethnological collec-
{ions were enriched by the addition of a unique series of objects illus-
trating the material culture of the Indians of eastern Panama, re-
sulting from the Marsh-Darien expedition, and by a collection of
California Indian baskets bequeathed by the late Miss Ella F.
Hubby, of Pasadena. In physical anthropology, a number of casts
of the remains of early man were received, including several of the
famous Trinil man of Java, Pithecanthropus erectus, from Dr.
Eugene Dubois, and also much valuable skeletal material. The de-
partment profited especially through explorations conducted by the
Bureau of American Ethnology, and by the National Geographic
Society under the direction of Mr. Neil M. Judd, which resulted in
valuable additions to the collections.

The most notable gift to the department of biology was the collec-
tion of Coleoptera and mollusks bequeathed to the Museum by the
late Col. Thomas Lincoln Casey. The beetles alone in this collec-
tion are estimated at 90,000 specimens, representing 16,000 species.
A wonderful store of rich material also has been added to the depart-
ment. in the large collections presented by the National Geographic
Society as the result of expeditions in China by Dr. J. F. Rock and
Mr. F. R. Wulsin, which include 4,500 specimens of vertebrates and
68,000 plants. Additional collections from China have also been
received from the Rey. D. C. Graham and Mr. A. de C. Sowerby.

In the department of geology, the paleontological collections have
been the chief beneficiaries, having received the results of your secre-
tary’s field work for the past four years, as well as collections made
by Doctor Bassler, Doctor Resser, and Doctor Ulrich. The other
divisions have all received valuable additions, including a number
of interesting minerals contributed by Col. W. A. Roebling, and a
crystal of the new mineral, afwillite, donated by Mr. Alpheus F.
Williams. One of the most interesting exhibits is a crystal ball of
unusual size and perfection, weighing 110 pounds and measuring
1314 inches in diameter, shown through the interest of Mr. Worces-
ter R. Warner and the courtesy of the Fukushima Co. (Inc.), New
York. This ball is said to be the largest of its kind in the world
and has attracted much attention from visitors.

In the division of mechanical and mineral technology there was a
slight falling off in the number of accessions received, principally
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

due to a lack of exhibition and storage space. Interesting additions
were made, however, in the transportation section, including one .
early type of automobile, a Knox car, made in 1901, presented by
Mrs. Lansing Van Aluken, of Watervliet, N. Y.

The division of textiles, under which are administered also wood
technology, organic chemistry, foods, and medicine, received over
8,800 objects during the year, more than twice the number received
Jast year. These included several series of industrial specimens
illustrating the manufacture of rubber, sealing wax, and the prepa-
ration and dyeing of furs; samples of silk, cotton, and wool fabrics
for the textile collections; specimens of woods used in the furniture
industry; and, for the public health exhibit, models and posters
showing advances in sanitary science.

The exhibits of the division of graphic arts have been greatly
improved during the past year by the addition of valuable new
material and the rearrangement of the collections, Fourteen special
exhibitions of prints in various media, mainly the work of con-
temporary artists, were held and the two traveling exhibits prepared
by the division were widely circulated among the art museums and
graphic art organizations of the eastern part of the country.

Among the objects of special interest added to the historical col-
lections were a presentation sword, flags, uniforms, medals, and
badges of the late Lieut. Gen. Nelson A. Miles; additional numis-
matic material, including 800 publications on numismatics trans-
ferred from the Treasury Department; and four portraits added
to the portrait collection.

The Museum participated in a number of field expeditions, de-
scribed in the report on the Museum, appended hereto, which have
resulted in the addition of much valuable material in all of the
departments of the Museum. The auditorium was in frequent de-
mand by scientific and other societies and organizations for meet-
ings and lectures. Visitors to the Natural History Building totaled
557,016; to the Arts and Industries Building, 304,858; to the Air-
craft Building, 52,787; and to the Smithsonian Building, 107,342,
making in all a total of 1,022,003. This is the first time in the
history of the Museum that the year’s attendance has exceeded
1,000,000 individuals. Five volumes and 70 separates were pub-
lished as the result of Museum activities during the year, and 104,596
copies of Museum publications were distributed.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

During the past year additions to the gallery collections were
less than in previous years owing to the lack of exhibition space.
The art works awaiting approval at the present time do not ex-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

ceed $100,000 in estimated value, while, with a suitable art build-
ing, it is thought that gifts and bequests to the value of a million dol-
lars or more would be received annually.

Work has been continued by Mr. Platt on the preparation of
preliminary plans for the proposed gallery building, made possible
by the raising of $10,000 by private subscription as noted in last
year’s report, and the plans could now be made ready for the begin-
ning of construction within six months. It is estimated that three
years would be required to erect the building. The movement for
such a building suffered a severe loss in the death of Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge, who was deeply interested in the national collections
of art and history. In 1924 he offered in the Senate an amend-
ment to the deficiency appropriation bill providing $7,000,000 for
a gallery building to accommodate the collections not only of art
but also those of American history now housed in the National
Museum.

The annual meeting of the National Gallery Commission was held
on December 9, 1924. The report of the secretary mentioned the
following action on problems considered at last year’s meeting:
The approval by the Board of Regents of the commission’s recom-
mendation to include a division of historical architecture in the
National Gallery of Art; the appointment of Mr. Charles A. Platt
as architect of the proposed gallery building; and the approval
by the commission of the inclusion in the prospective gallery of
collections of both American history and art. The question of the
acceptance of works of art by correspondence was discussed, and
it was resolved that hereafter a majority of the advisory committee
be required to examine personally all works of art offered the gal-
lery before making recommendation. Mr. Edmund C. Tarbell was
selected to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Edwin
H. Blashfield. The annual election resulted in no changes in the
officers or personnel of the commission for the coming year. Ap-
preciation was expressed of the activities of the American Federa-
tion of Arts and the Federation of Women’s Clubs in behalf of the
proposed new art building.

Permanent accessions to the gallery during the year included seven
paintings, several pieces of sculpture, and a collection of French and
other art objects, part of the bequest of the late Rev. Alfred Duane
Pell. Several loans were accepted and about an equal number with-
drawn during the year, and five paintings belonging to the gallery
were lent for exhibition elsewhere. Four special exhibitions were
held during the winter and early spring, catalogues for which
were issued by the gallery.
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

FREER GALLERY OF ART

The year’s work in the preservation of the collection included the
remounting of a considerable number of prints, bringing the total
number of objects in the print collection which have been put in
final condition to over 1,000. Additions to the collection included
a pastel by Whistler, an Indian bronze, Indian paintings, Chinese
bronzes, a Chinese painting, and Near Eastern pottery. A list
of the Freer Gallery collection of paintings, pastels, draw-
ings, prints, and copper plates by and attributed to American and
European artists, together with a list of original Whistleriana, was
in press at the close of the year.

Ninety books and periodicals and 127 pamphlets were added to
the library. Several hundred photographs and a number of lantern
slides were made and sold to persons requesting them. An increased
number of requests have reached the gallery for translations of
Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan inscriptions, and for other informa-
tion bearing on the work of the gallery.

The total attendance for the year was 109,862. Of this number,
431 used the study rooms to view objects not on exhibition or to
consult reference works in the library.

The gallery’s archeological expedition in China was still in the
field at the close of the year, and a condensed report on its work will
be submitted later for publication in the Smithsonian annual ex-
ploration pamphlet.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

The function of the Bureau of American Ethnology as defined
by Congress is to conduct ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excava-
tion and preservation of archeologic remains. The results of these
researches are published in technical monographs as well as in arti-
cles of a more popular character, and reliable information regarding
the American Indian is thus made available for students. The
aboriginal Indian culture is rapidly disappearing through contact
with the white man’s civilization, and when the older men of the
tribes who know the rites and customs of their fathers have passed
away, much of the ancient lore will be lost forever. The bureau is
recording as much as possible of this material before it is too late
to secure it.

An important Indian culture area is that of the southeastern
United States, and the bureau has recently begun an archeological
reconnaissance, so far as its resources will permit, in Florida, Ala-
bama, Tennessee, and Mississippi. It is possible to reconstruct from
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Pah

historical sources the main outlines of this Gulf culture, but much
more information is needed regarding the rituals, idols, ceremonial
objects, and symbolism on pottery before we can form a complete
idea of this interesting aboriginal culture.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, chief of the bureau, spent several weeks
in reconnaissance near Florence, Ala., where a number of interesting
Indian mounds were located which will be submerged with the com-
pletion of the Wilson Dam at Muscle Shoals. Mr. Gerard Fowke
continued the excavation of two of these mounds, which yielded a
considerable collection including rare copper ornaments, among the
largest known from the Tennessee Valley. Doctor Fewkes also pre-
pared during the year an illustrated report on a collection of archeo-
logical objects from Youngs Canyon, near Flagstaff, Ariz., a region
of great importance in determining the relationship of the various
culture areas of the Southwest.

During the past year, Mr. Earl H. Morris, under the direction
of Doctor Fewkes, did necessary repair work on the famous tower
of the Mummy Cave House in the Canyon del Muerto, Ariz., which
will go far toward preserving what is considered one of the finest
examples of aboriginal architecture in the entire Southwest.

Dr. John R. Swanton discovered further material bearing on the
social and religious life of the Creek Indians, and embodied this
information in papers now being prepared for publication. He
also prepared a paper as a result of his recent study of the smaller
culture centers within our present Gulf States, entitled “Culture of
the Southeast ” and a short report on the “ Ethnology of the Chick-
asaw,” and he continued work on the now extinct Timucua language.

Dr. Truman Michelson continued his studies of the Fox Indians,
transcribing and translating a number of texts relating to their
customs and beliefs. He also renewed his researches among the
Algonquian tribes of Iowa, spending part of the summer in that
State.

During the year, Mr. John P. Harrington continued his work on
the Burton Mound Indian village situated at Santa Barbara, pre-
paring for publication the material resulting from last year’s excava-
tions in cooperation with the Museum of the American Indian, and
carrying on additional excavations at the same site which have
yielded much important material. In addition, he prepared a report
on the archeology of the Santa Barbara region along both historical
and archeological lines. Mr. Harrington also made an exhaustive
study of the language of the Tulé Indians of Panama, eight of
whom were brought to Washington by Mr. R. O. Marsh in October,
1924, and remained until January, 192%, thus giving him an excellent
opportunity for this investigation.

92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

In May, 1925, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt left Washington for Brantford,
Canada, to resume his researches among the six nations, or tribes,
of the Iroquois. With the aid of the two best Mohawk informants
available, Mr. Hewitt made a free English translation of one of the
most important of the ancient rituals, and took up the literary
interpretation, revision, and textual criticism of previously recorded
voluminous Iroquoian texts. An interesting résumé of this work is
presented in the report of the chief of the bureau which forms
Appendix 4 of this report. Mr. Hewitt also visited the Chippewa
of Garden River, Canada, and the Seneca in Missouri and Oklahoma.

During the year, Mr. Francis La Flesche completed his paper on
two versions of the child-naming rite of the Osage Tribe. In May,
Mr. La Flesche visited the Osages and remained through June work-
ing at the laborious task of properly recording the gentile personal
names used by the full-blood members of the tribe and by some of
the mixed bloods. Mr. J. George Wright, of the Osage Agency,
cooperated in this work by giving Mr. La Flesche access to the
records of his office. Mr. La Flesche coliected during his stay in the
region some interesting plants used as food or medicine among the
Indians.

Miss Frances Densmore continued her special research on the
music of the Indians during the past year, resulting in the prepara-
tion of five manuscripts comprising transcriptions of 69 songs, to-
gether with the original phonograph records and analyses of the
songs, which were purchased by the bureau for future publication.
Miss Densmore’s manuscripts included also one on the uses by the
Makah Indians of 26 plants in food, medicine, and dyes. She took
advantage of the presence in Washington of the group of Tulé In-
dians, mentioned before in connection with Mr. Harrington’s study
of their language, to make a study of their music. Their favorite
musical instrument was found to be the “ pan pipe” of reeds, and
they also used another reed instrument known as the “mouth flute”
that had not before been observed in primitive music.

The publications of the bureau issued during the year consisted of
two reports and one bulletin. Three other reports were in press
at the close of the year. 7,354 copies of the publications of the
bureau were distributed during the year.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

The total number of packages handled by the exchange service
during the year was 468,731, weighing 506,164 pounds, an increase
in the number of packages over last year of 8,073 and a decrease in
weight of 60,943 pounds, due to the smaller size of the packages of
publications received for transmission through the service.
“REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23

Fifty-eight full sets of United States official documents and 40 par-
tial sets are now sent regularly to depositories abroad. This is a re-
duction of one full set from last year and an addition of two partial
sets. At the request of New Zealand, a partial set is now being
sent to the General Assembly Library instead of a full one and the
Stadtbibliothek of the Free City of Danzig has been added to the list
of those receiving partial sets. The immediate exchange of the
Official Journal has been entered into during the year with India
and the Free City of Danzig.

A committee of experts on the international exchange of publica-
tions was called together by the committee on intellectual cooperation
of the League of Nations at Geneva, July 17-19, 1924. Mr. W..
Dorsey, chief clerk of the Institution, represented the Smithsonian
on this committee. The committee recommended an additional
protocol to the Brussels convention of 1886, enabling the states that
are not yet parties to the convention to adhere thereto with reserva-
ions. The committee also gave consideration to various other mat-
ters looking to the improvement of the international exchange service
and the extension of its activities.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

I regret to have to record the death on November 3, 1924, of Mr.
N. Hollister, for eight years the able superintendent of the park.
Dr. Alexander Wetmore succeeded Mr. Hollister and served until
April 1, 1925. On that date he was appointed an assistant secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, and Dr. William M. Mann, ento-
mologist of the Department of Agriculture and widely known as
an explorer in the interests of zoology and entomology, was ap-
pointed superintendent of the park on May 18, 1925.

The collection of animals in the park has been somewhat dimin-
ished in value during the year by a number of deaths among the
older animals. This loss has been offset to a certain extend by the ac-
cession of 130 animals presented by various donors and 70 mammals
and birds born or hatched in the park, but among the older stock lost
were many valuable specimens that can be replaced only by purchase,
and funds for this purpose are very limited. The more notable of
the new gifts to the park included a splendid young male chimpan-
zee, from Mr. Victor J. Evans, and a Bateleur eagle, an Abyssinian
falcon, and two South American stone plover from Mr. B. H. Swales.

The total number of individuals in the park collection at the close
of the year was 1,620, 25 less than reported last year. The species
represented, however, show an increase of 17 due to judicious selec-
tion and purchase of small species offered for sale at moderate prices.
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

The attendance for the past year was the highest the National.
Zoological Park has even known, the number of visitors recorded
reaching a total of 2,518,265.

During the year the animal warehouse, construction of which was
begun last year, was completed and put into service, a double bear
cage of steel was erected, and many minor repairs were made on old
buildings. In many instances these, even when carefully repaired,
are poorly adapted to the present needs of the park and should be
replaced by new ones that would not only safely and comfortably
house their inmates, but would also better accommodate the great
throngs of visitors to the collections. The buildings most urgently
needed are a house for birds and one for reptiles.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Much progress has been made during the year in the study of
the sun and its application to weather forecasting. Through the
generous assistance of Mr. John A. Roebling, the experimental fore-
casts by Mr. H. H. Clayton for the city of New York, based on daily
telegraphic reports from the observing stations in Chile and Arizona,
mentioned in last year’s report, were continued. Four papers have
been issued in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, reporting
in detail on the results of this work. While it is still largely experi-
mental, the forecasts have certainly indicated a moderate degree of
foreknowledge. A higher degree of accuracy in the solar measure-
ments upon which the forecasts are based will undoubtedly lead to
better results, and to this end the staff of the observatory is now
engaged in completely revising the methods of observing, measuring,
and recording the solar radiation. The station at Harqua Hala,
Avriz., has been removed to Table Mountain, Calif., to obtain better
atmospheric conditions and greater convenience of access. This
transfer was made possible through the aid of Mr. Roebling.

The director occupied the Mount Wilson station during the sum-
mer and autumn of 1924. He continued work on the three projects
outlined in last year’s report with the following results: The solar
cooker was greatly improved; measurements of atmospheric ozone
were made with the Fabry type of apparatus; and new devices were
tried in stellar energy spectrum measurements which seem to open
the way for great advances in that line.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE

Attention is again called to the urgent need of financial assistance
to enable the International Catalogue to resume publication of the
17 annual volumes which for so many years were depended on to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

furnish references to the world’s literature of science. Ever since
war conditions made it necessary to suspend publication in 1921,
it has been the hope that foreign political and financial conditions
would improve sufficiently to enable the cooperating countries to
again furnish the necessary funds through subscription as hereto-
fore, but with the exchange rates of several of these countries now
at a lower level than ever before, it seems that this hope will be
futile for some time to come.

Although actual publication has ceased for the present, the organ-
ization is in no sense bankrupt, for, according to an agreement made
at the Brussels Convention in 1922, the regional bureaus continue
their work of assembling current bibliographical data, thus keep-
ing the organization working, and when publication is resumed it
is believed that new subscribers will purchase the back issues of the
catalogue now held in storage. It would be difficult to find an ob-
ject more worthy of endowment than this unique international,
cooperative undertaking, for no similar enterprise has ever filled
the place occupied by the catalogue and no new organization could
hope to gain the official recognition held by the International Cata-
logue of Scientific Literature.

NECROLOGY

HENRY CABOT LODGE

Henry Cabot Lodge, United States Senator since 1893 and Regent
of the Smithsonian Institution for 22 years, died November 9, 1924.
Born in 1850, Mr. Lodge was admitted to the bar in 1876, and dur-
ing the early part of his career served as editor of the North Ameri-
can Review and later of the International Review. He next served
for two years as a member of the Massachusetts House of Repre-
sentatives, and in 1887 was elected to Congress, where he remained
until 1893. In this year began his career as a United States Sena-
tor, to which office he was continually reelected until the time of his
death, and the last term for which he was chosen to represent the
people of Massachusetts would not have expired until 1929.

Mr. Lodge was a very influential member of the Senate, having
served as Republican floor leader from 1918 until the year of his
death. In addition to his political activity, he was the author of
inany important historical works and essays.

Through his long period of membership on the Board of Regents
and his interest and active participation in the affairs of the Insti-
tution, Senator Lodge had become a valued adviser, and his loss
is keenly felt by the board and the officers of the Institution.
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

NED HOLLISTER

Ned Hollister, superintendent of the National Zoological Park
since October 1, 1916, and one of the foremost mammalogists of the
world, died on November 3, 1924.

Mr. Hollister was born at Delavan, Wis., November 26, 1876, where
he received his education and began the study of zoology. From
1902 to 1909 he conducted zoological field work for the United States
Biological Survey in Texas, New Mexico, Alaska, British Columbia,
Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Nevada, Louisiana, and
Arizona. In 1910 he began his connection with the Smithsonian
Institution, being appointed assistant curator of mammals in the
United States National Museum, which position he held until 1916
when he was selected for the responsible position of superintendent
of the National Zoological Park.

In 1911, Mr. Hollister was a member of the Canadian Alpine Club
expedition to explore the Mount Robson region of British Columbia
and Alberta, and in 1912 he represented the Smithsonian Institu-
tion on the Smithsonian-Harvard expedition to the Altai Moun-
tains, Siberia and Mongolia. The results of Mr. Hollister’s scien-
tific work have appeared in the publications of the Institution and
in various technical journals for many years. Besides over 100
minor papers on zoological subjects, he was the author of a number
of large works, including The Birds of Wisconsin (1903); Mam-
mals of the Philippine Islands (1911); Mammals of the Alpine
Club Expedition to Mount Robson (1913); East African Mammals
in the United States National Museum (vol. 1, 1918; vol. 2, 1919;
vol. 3, 1923.) This last is probably Mr. Hollister’s greatest contri-
bution to science, being a complete technical account of the great
collections made in East Africa by Theodore Roosevelt, Paul Rainey,
and other collectors.

During Mr. Hollister’s term of office as superintendent the Na-
tional Zoological Park showed a steady growth and development,
the collection of animals in the Park being greater in numbers and
in scientific value than ever before, and the number of visitors to
the park having increased steadily until it reached during the past
year a total of over 2,500,000. It was largely through Mr. Hollis-
ter’s efforts that Congress a few years ago provided funds for the
purchase of a frontage of 625 feet at the Connecticut Avenue
entrance to the park, thus insuring for the future a dignified and
appropriate approach.

Mr. Hollister was a member of many scientific societies and editor

of the Journal of Mammalogy.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 24

WASHINGTON I. ADAMS

Washington I. Adams, who was connected with the Institution
from 1896 until his retirement in 1924, died at Watertown, Mass.,
April 19, 1925. Mr. Adams came to the Institution as chief clerk of
the International Exchange Service, which position he held until
1905 when he was appointed chief disbursing agent, a position he
held until his retirement. Mr. Adams’s duties and responsibilities
were greatly increased in recent years due largely to the receipt of
the Freer bequest of over $3,000,000.

NEWTON P. SCUDDER

Newton P. Scudder, assistant librarian of the National Museum,
died on May 19, 1925, two months after his retirement from active
service. Mr. Scudder was given an appointment as clerk in 1882
and five years later was made an assistant librarian in the Museum,
which position he held until his retirement on March 9, 1925.

Mr. Scudder was born in Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1853, and graduated
from Wesleyan University in 1879. His first work was with the
Bureau of Fisheries, and under its auspices he made a trip to the
halibut banks. As a result of this investigation two papers by him
on “The Halibut Fishery, Davis Strait,” and “The Salt Halibut
Fishery,” were published by the Bureau of Fisheries. Following
this work, Mr. Scudder came to the Museum library, where he re-
mained until his recent retirement.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the con-
dition and operations of the United States National Museum for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1925.

The appropriations for the maintenance of the National Museum
for the fiscal year amounted to $584,792, an increase of $52,396 over
the previous year. ‘This increase, however, is more apparent than
real so far as providing additional funds for the operation of the
Museum is concerned, since $44,534 of the amount represented
the sum required for increase of salaries from the inauguration
of the schedules authorized by the reclassification act of 1923, which
became effective July 1, 1924, while subsequent reallocations of
employees by the Personnel Classification Board resulted in increas-
ing salary allotments approximately $9,000 beyond the estimated
amount. It thus transpired that the amounts available for actual
operating expenses were less than during the previous year. More-
over, the reclassification act had the effect of reducing the amount
provided for printing and binding since increase in salaries in the
Government Printing Office inaugurated under it resulted in
increased cost in printing, thus reducing the production value of the
sum allotted for that purpose to the eee

Attention has been called repeatedly in these aria reports on
operation to the great disproportion between the increase in the
appropriations provided for the maintenance of the Museum and
- the increase in the size of its collections, as well as in the quantity,
scope, and importance of its exhibition and research work and its
service to the public at large. Through the unselfish efforts of the
personnel and the practice of the most rigid economy it has been
possible until now to maintain a high degree of efficiency, but the
very fact of its steady growth will curtail the usefulness of the
Museum as a factor in the field of science and education unless it
can be assured of sufficient funds to cover its natural and proper
expansion. There is urgent need now for additional funds for
operation, and for reasonable sums for the purchase of specimens
and for use in minor explorations. Rich additions to the collections
are received each year through specimens deposited by Government
agencies or presented by private donors. Definite gaps in all lines
exist, however, that may be filled only by purchase of desirable

28
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

things or by small sums spent in field work to acquire them. Speci-
mens actually needed are obtainable usually only at long intervals
and if such opportunities are allowed to pass further chance to
acquire them may be remote or uncertain. Highly desirable things
offered at reasonable prices are refused nearly every week. The
Institution should have available moderate funds that might be used
for such purposes.

Need of funds for exploration is also imperative since through
this means only is it practicable to obtain data and information of
importance in connection with many objects desired for the collec-
tions. Definite research on the part of experts is often required to
clear up doubtful points in source or relationship of many things.

More and more each year the National Museum is approached
for authentic information in a wide range of subjects not to be ob-
tained elsewhere. Its vast collections of carefully arranged and
classified specimens afford a full record of industrial, social, and
esthetic progress as well as of painstaking and exhaustive research
work in the natural sciences. In it are gathered the results of
governmental activities and private donations aggregating many
millions of dollars. The Museum collections serve as a foundation
for the economic work of such great Government organizations as
the Department of Agriculture, the Geological Survey, and others,
and the members of the scientific staff assist materially in the work
of these institutions through identification and report on the various
objects with which they are concerned. To maintain its position of
constantly increasing importance in the field of Government service
and to fulfill its function as a truly national museum, it is absolutely
necessary that adequate funds be provided for its proper main-
tenance. It is sincerely hoped that its needs in this direction will
be recognized and provided for by suitable appropriations.

Final establishment of the salary schedules under the reclassifica-
tion act brought the salaries paid to members of the scientific staff in
the National Museum in most cases to a parity with those doing simi-
lar work in other departments, and has thus in large part corrected a
lamentable condition in which members of the staff were paid at
rates established many years ago and which in modern circumstances
had become wholly inadequate. The increased salaries available
have allowed the filling of several vacancies that have existed for
some time and to fill which there were no suitable candidates at
previous rates of pay. Adjustments in allocation in certain posi-
tions still remain to be made before the scale in force is just and
equitable in all its features, as it is felt that the rates assigned in
some positions do not correspond with the grades or emoluments
applied to similar positions in other branches of Government service.
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

The financial assistance accorded to members of the scientific staff
has been greatly appreciated but attention is drawn to the necessity
of keeping this matter in mind so that faithful service may be
further rewarded. Provision is made in the reclassification act for
increase in salary to the average amount in the various grades, pro-
vided a suitable record of efficiency is maintained. Two surveys of
efficiency of the entire staff have been made in accordance with regu-
lations laid down by the Personnel Classification Board, and in fur-
ther accordance with the regulations of that board the ratings
assigned have been transmitted to the staff. It is highly gratifying
to record that with very few exceptions these ratings have been
excellent and have been of such a degree that they warrant promo-
tion. Under existing appropriations, funds for the proper advance-
ment indicated are not available. The matter is earnestly recom-
mended for serious consideration to the end that money may be pro-
vided to make the necessary increase. Such action has been taken in
other departments and it is sincerely desired to avoid falling behind
in this respect as was the case under former salary regulations.

Though not universally recognized as an element in educational
activities, the National Museum fulfills a threefold function in that
field. Through the care and preservation of its vast and inestimably
valuable collections and their careful arrangement and classification,
it affords a visual record of progress and development of our own
and foreign peoples, of important advances in the history of our
country, and of achievements in science, industry, and art. As a
museum of research it affords opportunity to the trained specialist
and to the serious student to pursue studies of all kinds with facili-
ties not elsewhere obtainable. It is seen as a museum of education by
the visiting public, who come to examine the many treasures in the
exhibition halls, while through its publications, correspondence, and
distribution of duplicate specimens it reaches thousands who are not
so fortunate as to be able to visit its halls. It may be safely said
that no textbook, work of reference, or encyclopedia of facts has been
issued in this country in recent years that has not based some of its
statements on information originating in the National Museum.

As a modern feature for the dissemination of knowledge may be
mentioned the radio program of the Smithsonian Institution organ-
ized last year which has continued under the direction of Mr. Austin
H. Clark of the Museum staff in cooperation with the broadcasting
station WRC, Radio Corporation of America. In all, 28 talks, of
15 minutes each, were given during the winter, 10 being by members
of the staff of the Institution, including 7 from the Museum. Four
of these talks were broadcast also by stations WJY and WJZ in
New York City, reaching thus a broad audience. The talks, which
began October 2, 1924, and were concluded on May 14, 1925, were
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

delivered by 25 individual speakers. The subjects chosen came from
a wide range in the field of science and proved highly popular as
attested by the many letters received from listeners far and near.
Some of them have been published in permanent form. Possibilities
in the spread of authentic scientific information through this means
are great, since in this way informational talks prepared in an inter-
esting manner go out to an extended audience fully appreciative of
what they hear. It is possible thus to present the newer facts and
changing aspects of science in a manner unequaled by other means.

As was anticipated when the Loeb collection of chemical types was
placed under the special charge of a paid curator, splendid progress
has been made. Through the activities of Mr. O. E. Roberts, jr., the
curator, and cooperation on the part of many chemists and organiza-
tions, 616 new specimens have been added to the collection during
the year. The importance of such a collection is only just begin-
ning to be realized, but the interest already taken in it by specialists
in chemical research work in indicative of the important results
eventually to be achieved.

COLLECTIONS

The results of the year show a most satisfactory growth in the
collections, the total number of specimens received amounting to
363,490, while additional lots of material received for examination
and report numbered 1,232. The number of additions exceeds
slightly the very high mark attained last year, while material for
report also shows a slight increase. The increases are highly grati-
fying and have brought a great amount of extremely valuable ma-
terial to the collections.

As in previous years, duplicate specimens were distributed as
gifts to educational institutions or utilized in the making of ex-
changes for specimens needed toward completing the collections.
The material thus disposed of amounted to 231,244 specimens, of
which 2,099 represent gifts. An additional lot of material, com-
prising 33,966 specimens, was distributed in the form of loans to
specialists and students for study and identification.

The following résumé of the more important accessions received
during the year is submitted by the heads of the several depart-
ments or divisions of the Museum:

Anthropology.—The department of anthropology reports a year
of satisfactory progress in all lines of its activities.

In the division of ethnology there was received a unique series
of objects illustrating the material culture of the Indians of eastern
Panama as a result of the explorations of the Marsh-Darien expedi-
tion cooperating with the Smithsonian Institution. This collection is
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

regarded as of such scientific interest that a special paper describing
it has been prepared and submitted for publication. Another acces-
sion of particular beauty and rarity was the remainder of the
collection of California Indian baskets bequeathed by the late Miss
Ella F. Hubby, of Pasadena.

Among additions in American archeology may be mentioned col-
Jections from Town Creek, Ala., on the site of Wilson Dam, Muscle
Shoals, and from Weeden Island, St. Petersburg, Fla., collected by
Gerard Fowke and Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, respectively, and trans-
ferred from the Bureau of American Ethnology. ‘The first of these
is especially valuable, since it comes from a locality that will be
covered by water when impounded by the dam.

The accessions in the division of Old World archeology include a
copy of the Welsh version of the Bible from David W. Evans and
numerous Egyptian and Graeco-Roman antiquities and ancient
glassware loaned by Edward Sampson.

In physical anthropology there were added several casts of the
remains of the famous Trinil man of Java, Pithecanthropus erectus,
received from Dr. Eugene Dubois, who has been engaged in ex-
haustive studies of this highly important fossil. Also there has
been received from the British Museum a cast of the skull found re-
cently at Broken Hill in Rhodesia. Other important casts repre-
sent remains of ancient man from Czechoslovakia. These will all be
of great assistance in studies of ancient man. ‘The Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology transferred skeletal material from Florida, and the
National Geographic Society presented important skeletons found in
excavations at Pueblo Bonito and Pueblo del Arroyo, New Mexico.
The Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences donated a collection of Iro-
quois skeletal material collected in Erie County, N. Y.

Mr. Hugo Worch has added to the Worch collection of pianos
four splendidly decorated harpsichords of the sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries. Miss Frances Densmore completed her study of the
collection of musical instruments and submitted a manuscript de-
scriptive of it.

The ceramic collection was augmented by a collection of English
porcelain and glass, gift of Mrs. Frances Roome Powers.

In art textiles, the valuable laces of the late Mrs. H. K. Porter
were continued as a loan by her daughter, Miss Hegeman. By be-
quest of the late Miss Emily Tuckerman, all specimens belonging
to her on deposit in the Museum were made a gift. The Misses
Long contributed several fine specimens of embroidery and lace.

The department profited especially through explorations by the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the National Geographic Society,
and the Marsh-Darien expedition. Neil M. Judd, in charge of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 33

the excavations carried on under the auspices of the National Geo-
eraphic Society at Pueblo Bonito, remained in the field for several
months and secured excellent collections and highly important in-
formation. Henry B. Collins, jr., conducted explorations at ancient
village sites in Mississippi, where valuable studies have resulted
from intensive work in the field.

Biology.—tIncrease in the collections in the various divisions of
this department have equaled and in some cases have excelled those
recorded for the previous year. Of outstanding interest is the col-
lection of coleoptera and mollusks that came to the Museum by
bequest of the late Col. Thomas Lincoln Casey. The beetles alone
in this collection are estimated at approximately 90,000 specimens
representing 16,000 species of which 5,000 were described by Colonel
Casey and are represented by the types.

The large collections presented by the National Geographic
Society as the result of expeditions in China by Dr. J. F. Rock and
Mr. F. R. Wulsin include a total of over 4,500 specimens of verte-
brates and 68,000 plants, a wonderful store of rich material that has
added greatly to the representation from that area, for, in addition
to a number of forms previqusly unknown to science, there are in the
collection many species not before represented in this institution.
Additional collections from China have come through the continued
efforts of Rey. D. C. Graham in western Szechwan, which have added
vertebrates and valuable insects. China has been further represented
in our accessions by material collected by A. deC. Sowerby, pre-
sented through the continued interest of Mr. R. S. Clark.

Mr. B. H. Swales has continued his important additions to the
collections of birds by the purchase of a considerable number of
species not previously represented including a number of rarities
from Madagascar. Further acquisitions through the interest of Dr.
Casey A. Wood have resulted in additional specimens from Fiji.
Dr. Hugh M. Smith, now in Siam, has begun presentation of
valuable material from a region almost unknown in our collections
and has included among other things in his first sending a highly
valuable lot of marine invertebrates.

Valuable collections of fishes have come from the H. K. Mulford
Co., of Philadelphia. Certain important specimens have been pur-
chased for the collections of mollusks from the income provided
for that purpose by the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund.

In the exhibition halls there was installed a new group of Rocky
Mountain goats prepared from material collected by Secretary and
Mrs. C. D. Walcott; the case represents a family of four with an
appropriate background of rockwork. A number of older mounts
of other mammals have been replaced by material prepared by
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

modern methods and additions have been made to the collections
exhibiting the local fauna. A second group not quite completed is
that of the dik-dik, a diminutive antelope from Africa.

Geology.—Although a decrease is shown in the number of acces-
sions and amount of material received in this department as com-
pared with 1923-24, reference to earlier reports shows the present
year to be an average one, with a total of 198 accessions, aggregating
79,674 specimens.

The paleontological collections are again the chief beneficiaries,
notable among the acquisitions being the results of Secretary Wal-
cott’s field work for the past four years, as well as collections made
by Doctors Bassler, Resser, and Ulrich in the summer of 1924.
Gifts also materially increased the collections of invertebrate fossils,
particularly those of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic periods, and one
bequest added many thousands of specimens, including types.

In vertebrate paleontology the most important acquisition is a
series of footprints from Permian deposits secured by Mr. C. W.
Gilmore from the Hermit Trail, Grand Canyon National Park,
working under the auspices of the National Park Service. Dr. J. C.
Merriam, of the Carnegie Institution, of Washington, who was
instrumental in perfecting the arrangements under which this ma-
terial was secured, supplemented it by additional specimens taken
personally. The fossil cetacean collection has also been materially
increased and is now thought to be probably the largest and best
preserved assemblage of these forms in any American institution.

A series of unusual forms of stalactites and stalagmites from
Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, presented by the National Geo-
graphic Society, permitted the installation of an important addition
to the exhibits showing cave phenomena.

In the field of applied geology the most important material re-
ceived was that obtained by Assistant Curator Foshag while work-
ing with a United States Geological Survey field party in New Mex-
ico. Doctor Foshag also collected much mineralogical material
needed for the study collections. A few striking exhibition speci-
mens of ores were obtained from various sources.

Col. W. A. Roebling was the chief contributor to the mineral col-
lections, 6 accessions comprising 51 specimens being credited to him
during the year. The most notable of these is a group of axinite
crystals thought to be the largest of this mineral yet found.

A crystal of the new mineral, afwillite, donated by Mr. Alpheus
F. Williams, is of particular interest in being one of the type lot
which consists of less than a pound of the material. Notable speci-
mens for exhibition were furnished through Mr. F. L. Hess, of which
a group of large wulfenite crystals from Mexico, and a mass of
pink muscovite and amblygonite from New Mexico are prominent
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

Through the interest of Mr. Worcester R. Warner and the courtesy
of the Fukushima Co. (Inc.), New York, the department of geology
has been privileged to exhibit a crystal ball of unusual size and per-
fection, weighing 110 pounds and measuring 1314 inches in diameter,
which is said to be the largest of its kind known. This has attracted
much attention from visitors.

Exchanges have added materially to the collections in all divisions
of the department, both for exhibition and study, and a few objects
have been acquired by purchase. Several additions have been made
to the meteorite collection, consisting chiefly of fragments of mod-
erate size, which, while important from a scientific standpoint, add
little to the exhibits. A number of gems have been added to the
Isaac Lea collection through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund.

Secretary Walcott continued his researches in British Columbia;
Dr. R. S. Bassler, in Tennessee, in cooperation with the geological
survey of that State; Dr. C. E. Resser, in the Rocky Mountain re-
gion of the United States; and Dr. W. F. Foshag was detailed to
accompany 2a geological survey party in New Mexico. Mr. C. W.
Gilmore spent some weeks in the Grand Canyon National Park,
under the auspices of the National Park Service.

Work on the exhibits has been chiefly confined to cleaning and
rearranging, no important changes having been made. In strati-
graphic paleontology much time and effort have been consumed in
expansion of the collections and in general cleaning and rearranging
of the paleobotanical collections. The efforts of the force in verte-
brate paleontology have been confined almost wholly to the prepara-
tion of the huge dinosaur skeleton, collected last year, with satis-
factory results.

Research work has continued to the extent permitted by other
duties.

Arts and industries—Growth in this department has been satis-
factory in the main though hampered in many lines by crowding.
Materials for accession are selected with great care, but so much
that is wholly desirable is offered that available facilities for ex-
hibition are greatly overtaxed.

In the division of mechanical and mineral technology there was a
slight falling off in the number of accessions received and a material
decrease in the number of specimens catalogued during the year, due,
primarily, to a lack of exhibition and storage space. This condition
is aggravated more and more each year and will lead to further de-
crease in the rate of acceptance of objects for the collection since
now choice may be made only of things urgently required.

In the transportation section one early type of automobile was re-
ceived, a Knox car made in 1901, presented by Mrs. Lansing Van
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

Auken, Watervliet, N. Y. The signal section of the American Rail-
way Association added to its series of specimens, showing develop-
ments in railway signaling, 16 objects that indicate some of the
early efforts in block signaling. The Buda Co., of Harvey, IIl., pre-
sented a full-size gasoline automobile engine operated by an glec-
tric motor specially arranged for exhibition. By pressing a but-
{on it may be put in operation, thus permitting study of many of
the working parts in action. Mr. Henry Ford presented a specially
prepared exhibit of the planetary transmission used in the Ford
uutomobile. As this is one of the distinctive types of automobile
transmissions it will form an interesting part of an exhibit now
under way designed to illustrate the various fundamental units com-
posing the automobile.

The Portland Cement Association, of Chicago, Ill., through its
local office, presented a full-size photographic copy, suitably framed,
of the original patent on Portland cement granted by King George
III to Joseph Aspdin in 1824. The presentation of this interesting
paper was made in the presence of about 12 officials representing
various departments of the Government interested in Portland
cement and was accepted on behalf of the Museum by Secretary
Walcott. The framed copy now hangs in close proximity to the
exhibit on Portland cement in the division of mineral technology.

The collections under the supervision of the curator of textiles,
which, besides textiles, embrace wood technology, foods, animal
products, organic chemistry, and medicine, were increased by many
eifts and by transfer of material from other Government bureaus,
amounting in all to over 8,800 objects. A statement concerning the
most important of these follows:

Series of industrial specimens illustrating many branches of
rubber manufacture, the manufacture of sealing wax, and a model
showing the preparation and dyeing of furs were added to the
collections from the field of industrial chemistry. The textile col-
lections were increased by gifts of fibers, yarns, silk and cotton
dress and drapery fabrics, wool fabrics, mohair plushes, and machine
embroideries; also many examples of modern handicraft. To the
collections arranged to show the importance of wood and the indus-
tries based thereon were added veneered panels of wood used in
the furniture industry, showing the different kinds of finishes used,
a series of specimens demonstrating the manufacture of lead pencils,
and a large timber of Douglas fir to represent an important product
of the forests of the Pacific Northwest. The collections added to
the division of medicine were chiefly in the field of public health,
and consisted of models and posters showing advances in sanitary
science. Specimens of materia medica and numerous objects asso-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37

ciated with the history of medicine in America were among other
additions to this division.

Work of the devision of graphic arts continued mainly along lines
developed in past years, and consisted of improving and completing
existing series of specimens and the continuance of special exhibi-
tions. Fourteen of the latter held during the year attracted favor-
able attention. Valuable additions to exhibit materials have been
received or promised as a result of these exhibits.

One important new exhibit of microengraving has attracted much
attention. It consists of “'The Lord’s Prayer” engraved on glass in
a square space about ;,455 of an inch on a side, so arranged that
it is viewed under a miscrope through the eye of a needle. ‘The
entire exhibit was prepared and presented by Alfred McEwen, of
New York City.

The exhibit of mezzotints has been completely rearranged, with
additions of new specimens to the historical series and of two series
of plates and prints to the technical set, so that it now presents a
clear idea of the early and modern methods of engraving mezzotints.

The collection illustrating methods used in printing for the blind
has also been greatly improved by the incorporation of additional
material which gives a clear idea of the method of making and print-
ing the special plates required in this work and the manner in which
the characters are read by the blind.

Three Babylonian tablets about 4,000 years old, inscribed with
cuneiform writing, acquired by purchase, have been placed with the
exhibits on the history of writing where they make an interesting
addition. Two of these of small size are of baked clay and represent
a skillful form of writing. The other represents the effort of a
schoolboy learning to write, and, while crude, is of considerable in-
terest. Tablets of this latter kind are very rare, as they are of un-
baked clay and were not intended to be permanently preserved.

From Mr. B. M. Comerford, of Washington, D. C., were received
four examples of the rare and beautiful art of fore-edge decorating,
which consists of painting on the small portions of the leaves of a
book that are exposed when the back is pushed out of normal posi-
tion. The picture disappears when the book is closed. This art is
said to have been originated by Samuel Mearne, who is reported to
have practiced it as early as 1662.

The aquatone process, which was mentioned in last year’s report
as a new and beautiful development among modern photomechanical
processes, is now represented by an exhibit indicating the technical
steps in the process of preparing and printing such a plate. This
is the gift of Wiliam Edwin Rudge, of New York, and shows well
the simplicity of the process and the beauty of the results obtained.

76041—26——4
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

The two traveling exhibits prepared by the division have been out
almost continuously, and have been shown by various art museums
and graphic art organizations in the eastern half of the country,
including those in Milwaukee, Wis., Brooklyn, N. Y., and Houston,
Tex., as well as many intermediate points. Four other smaller ex-
hibits are being prepared, which likewise depict the technical side
of graphic arts but on a smaller scale. These consist of 25 mats,
measuring 14 by 17 inches, weighing approximately 30 pounds, that
can be shipped by mail at very small expense. The larger exhibits,
which weigh 320 and 480 pounds, respectively, are forwarded by
express.

The collection of photographs in the section of photography is
becoming one of the most important public collections in the coun-
try, due to the efforts of A. J. Olmsted, custodian, and Mr. Floyd
Vail, of New York City.

History.—The additions to the historical collections surpass both
in number and scientific importance those received during the previ-
ous year. The military collections have been increased by the addi-
tion of a number of objects of special interest, among which are a
presentation sword, flags, uniforms and accessories, and medals and
badges owned by Lieut. Gen. Nelson A. Miles. The sword was pre-
sented to General Miles in 1887 by citizens of the State of Arizona
in recognition of his services in connection with the capture of the
Indian chief, Geronimo, and his band of hostile Apaches. The
medals and badges include the Congressional Medal of Honor and
the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati. An object of special in-
terest in this connection is a large heart-shaped shield of silver and
bronze which was presented to General Miles by the officers of the
Fifth United States Infantry. These objects have been received by
the Museum from Mrs. Samuel Reber and Maj. Sherman Miles,
United States Army. A number of presentation and service swords
owned during the nineteenth century by Maj. Gen. Frank Wheaton,
United States Army, have been presented to the Museum by Mrs.
Frank Wheaton. From Gen. John J. Pershing was received a num-
ber of military flags, maps, and posters, and the office desk and acces-
sories which he used at the headquarters of the American Expedi-
tionary Forces at Chaumont, France, during the World War.

The naval collections have been increased by the addition of a
sword and two uniform coats owned during the early part of the
nineteenth century by Commodore Samuel Woodhouse, United
States Navy, which have been presented by Dr. Samuel W. Wood-
house, jr., and also by the transfer from the Navy Department of a
series of 17 models illustrating the development of the United States
Navy during the period from 1776 to 1920,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

Through the cooperation of the United States Treasury Depart-
ment, a number of valuable United States and foreign coins and
medals have been added to the numismatic collections. Of special
interest in this connection has been the transfer from the Treasury
Department to the Museum of about 800 publications, forming a
highly useful library, on the subject of numismatics.

The portrait collection was increased by the following additions:
A portrait of Elizabeth Cady Stanton by Anna E. Klumpke was
presented by the National American Woman’s Suffrage Associa-
tion; portraits of Gen. John J. Pershing and Marshal Ferdinand
Foch were presented by the artist, Victor Perard. A portrait of
President Warren G. Harding, by John Innes, showing the former
delivering an address at Stanley Park, British Columbia, July 29,
1923, was presented to the Museum by the National Press Club,
Washington, D. C.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

The greater part of the material added to the collections during
the current year was as usual derived from expeditions and ex-
plorations under the auspices of private organizations and Govern-
ment agencies.

In biology the National Geographic Society was a large con-
tributor through its expeditions in China, in the Arctic, and in this
country. From the former extremely valuable and extensive col-
lections, comprising some 68,000 plants, over 1,600 birds, 60 mam-
mals, and other specimens, were received from the society’s expedi-
tion under Dr. Joseph F. Rock, principally from the Province of
Yunnan. The bulk of the material collected by the society’s expedi-
tion under Mr. F. R. Wulsin, which has been referred to in previous
reports, was received during the past fiscal year. It comprised im-
portant and extensive collections of birds, mammals, reptiles, and
fishes from inner Mongolia, the Alashan Desert, and Western Kansu,
in the region of Lake Kokonor, northeastern Tibet, as well as from
the Min Sha Range, which marks the boundary between the
Provinces of Kansu and Szechwan. The specimens from this source
are of particular importance, since they afford topotypes of numer-
ous species described from Przevalski’s famous exploring trip of 50
years before. They also include important ethnological material
from a region not heretofore represented in this institution. The
collections from these sources supplement those made by Mr. R. S.
Clark and Mr. Arthur deC. Sowerby in 1908-9 in Kansu, Thansi,
and Shensi, and the important collections made during the past
year by Rev. David C. Graham in Szechwan. The latter were
secured on a difficult trip to Songpan and the Yellow Dragon Gorge,
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

and comprise many specimens new to the Museum. Incidental to the
Arctic explorations undertaken for the National Geographic So-
ciety in Bering Sea and Arctic America during the summer of 1924
by Capt. R. A. Bartlett, and by Mr. D. B. Macmillan in the Bowdoin
in Greenland in 1924, some interesting zoological material was se-
cured and presented to the Museum. In August, 1924, Mr. Paul C.
Standley was detailed as a member of the Carlsbad Cavern expedi-
tion of the National Geographic Society, his association in the en-
terprise resulting in a collection of some 500 specimens of plants,
many of species not previously known from New Mexico. A popu-
lar account of the vegetation of the Carlsbad Cavern region has
been prepared for publication largely on the basis of this field
work. Under the auspices of Mr. Robert S. Clark, several eastern
Provinces in China were visited by Mr. Arthur deC. Sowerby, from
whom extensive collections were received. Dr. Hugh M. Smith,
who is at present fisheries adviser to the Siamese Government, for-
warded interesting zoological material from that country.

As a result of his visit to Haiti during the spring of 1925, Mr.
Gerrit S. Miller, jr., of the Museum staff, secured a collection of
the extinct vertebrate cave fauna as well as miscellaneous specimens
of the living mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, and plants of the
island. Doctor Bartsch continued his experiments with Cerions,
through the assistance of the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
his visit to the experimental colonies of these mollusks planted on
the Florida Keys resulting in the addition of some 2,700 specimens
to the collections. In addition, through the cooperation of the
United States Coast Guard, he was able, with the assistance of Mr.
W. B. Marshall of the Museum staff, to do some dredging in the
inner leads of Cape May and in the shallow waters off the coast
of New Jersey, which resulted in adding quite a number of speci-
mens from a region little explored. A survey of the fisheries of
the Republic of Salvador, undertaken by 8S. F. Hildebrand and
F. J. Foster, of the United States Bureau of Fisheries, at the request
and at the expense of the Salvadorean Government, resulted in the
collection and subsequent transfer to the Museum of a large collec-
tion of fishes and some crustaceans from the region referred to.
Secretary Walcott’s field work in the Canadian Rockies, in addi-
tion to yielding important paleontological material, added a num-
ber of valuable zoological specimens, some of which have been
utilized in preparing a new exhibition group of Rocky Mout.tain
goats in the Mammal Hall of the Museum. As the result of the
‘detail by the Department of Agriculture of Mrs. Agnes Chase, of
the Bureau of Plant Industry, to field work in the eastern high-
lands of Brazil, important botanical material was received for the
National Herbarium.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 4]

Dr. William Schaus, honorary assistant curator of insects, through
personal efforts raised the sum of $50,000 for the purchase of the
famous collection of Lepidoptera gathered by M. Paul Dognin,
Wimile, France, comprising a series of specimens highly valuable
for studies of these important insects. Doctor Schaus went to
France to supervise the packing of this collection for shipment to
the museum, where it has been received, although not in time to be
included in more detail in report.

The material secured by the Marsh-Darien expedition to Panama,
referred to in last year’s report, was received during the past year.
It contained so much interesting ethnological material of a class
not previously represented in our collections that it has been made
the basis of a special report prepared by Mr. H. W. Krieger, curator
of ethnology. Mr. Neil M. Judd, curator of American archeology
in charge of the Pueblo Bonito expedition of the National Geo-
graphic Society, secured important collections for the Museum, and
equally important material was secured by Mr. Gerard Fowke
under the auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology from
burial sites near Muscle Shoals, Ala., which will soon be covered by
water impounded by the Wilson Dam. Doctor Fewkes, Chief
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, assisted by Mr. M. W.
Stirling, of the department of anthropology, conducted an explora-
tion of ancient Indian mounds at St. Petersburg, Fla., which resulted
in important finds and material valuable to the collections. Dr.
AleS Hrdli¢ka, of the Museum staff, assisted by a generous grant
from the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences, left in March for
an extended trip through the Far East, Australia, and South Africa
for the purpose of observing at first hand a number of peculiar
races of men and to collect data on various discoveries of ancient
man.

Under the auspices of the United States Geological Survey, Dr.
W. F. Foshag, of the Museum staff, was enabled to make collections
and to visit mineral properties in western Nevada where acquaint-
ances made with mine owners and collectors will inure greatly
to the benefit of the Museum. He also collected a series of minerals
from California. Short trips to various localities in Maryland
were made by Mr. Earl V. Shannon, of the Department of Geology,
in cooperation with the State geological survey, and to Connecticut
through an arrangement with the geological and natural history
survey of that State, which resulted in necessary additions to our
collections. Aided by grants from the O. C. Marsh and Joseph
Henry endowment funds of the National Academy of Sciences,
Secretary Walcott continued his field work in western Alberta
for the purpose of completing his reconnaissance of the pre-Devonian
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

formations north of Bow Valley, the main objects of this year’s
work being to determine the correct geologic horizon of the Lyell
limestone. Many attempts to do this during the past six years
resulted in failure, and it really seemed that these great lime-
stone beds were barren of fossils. In measuring geologic sections
in the Tilted Mountain Area, however, interbedded bluish-gray
layers containing fragments of Upper Cambrian trilobites were at
last found, which proved their correct geologic horizon.

Dr. Charles E. Resser continued his field explorations of the Cam-
brian and associated formations. Dr. R. S. Bassler, in cooperation
with the geological survey of Tennessee, continued his work in that
State, and at the same time made collections of Mississippian fossils
for the Museum. Mr. Erwin R. Pohl was detailed for a short time
to make collections from the celebrated Rysedorph conglomerate of
northern New York, which resulted in a good series of fossils for the
Museum.

In cooperation with the National Park Service, Mr. C. W. Gilmore,
curator of vertebrate paleontology, visited the Grand Canyon Na-
tional Park, Ariz., for the purpose of accompanying the Doheny
scientific expedition as an observer to investigate and make col-
lections of fossil tracks exposed in the Coconino sandstone and to
prepare an exhibit of the tracks in situ by the side of the Hermit
Trail leading into the Grand Canyon. His trip was a most success-
ful one in all of its aspects, a series of slabs some 2,000 pounds in
weight and containing a splendid series of the fossil footprints being
collected and shipped to the Museum. Dr. J. W. Gidley, of the geo-
logical staff of the Museum, visited the region around Melbourne,
Fla., on two occasions during the year and secured an interesting
collection of fossils. He also visited Adele, Iowa, for the purpose of
studying the geology of a formation in which had been found certain
human artifacts. Continuing the practice of previous years, Mr.
Norman Boss made several short trips to the Calvert Cliffs along
Chesapeake Bay in search of Miocene fossils.

A movement which promises important results to the Museum was
inaugurated in the summer of 1924, when the Secretary of the Navy
invited the Smithsonian Institution to participate in a conference of
representatives of the executive departments and scientific establish-
ments of the Government of the United States for the purpose of
formulating plans for a naval expedition to undertake investigations
in oceanography. Mr. Austin Clark, Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt, and Dr.
Paul Bartsch, of the Museum staff, were designated as representa-
tives of the Institution on this occasion, and at the close of the meet-
ing Mr. Clark was chosen as representative of the Smithsonian In-
stitution and its branches on an executive interim committee.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 43
BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

The various buildings of the Museum have been kept in good con-
dition throughout the year through minor repairs, which have con-
sisted largely in painting walls, ceilings, and floors, repairing cracks
in plaster and cement surfaces, painting tin gutters and roofs, and
work of a similar character. In the Arts and Industries Building
new floors were laid in a few of the rooms and the ventilation im-
proved.

In the Smithsonian Building it was necessary to replace with
beaded sheets the entire plaster ceiling of the main hall on the third
floor, occupied by the Museum’s division of plants. The work was
done partly by contract and partly by the Museum force.

Under a special appropriation for the purpose, four modern fire
hydrants were installed under the direction of the District Commis-
sioners in the Smithsonian Park.

The cost of heating for the year was considerably less than during
the previous year, due partly to the lower cost of coal and partly to
the fact that for the first time in many years it was possible to
secure coal from the New River fields, which is better adapted to the
heating apparatus. During the year, 3,292 tons of bituminous and
15.5 tons of anthracite coal were used. The total electric current
generated during the year was 476,709 kilowatt-hours, at a total cost
of 2.362 cents per kilowatt-hour, including labor, material, interest,
and depreciation on the plant.

A total of 346.3 tons of ice were produced during the year at a
cost of $2.309 per ton. A new compressor has been purchased which,
with increase in the size of the condenser made during the year, will
increase the capacity of the ice machine from 2 to 2% tons per day.
Even with the cost of the new compressor included, the cost per ton
of ice will be under the wholesale price paid for ice by the Govern-
ment.

During the year 18 exhibition cases and bases and 127 pieces of
storage, laboratory, office, and other furniture were acquired by
purchase and construction. Of the storage cases 11 were purchased
and 116 built in the Museum shops.

MEETINGS AND RECEPTIONS

The Department of Agriculture was granted the use of the audi-
torium on October 27, 28, and 31 for a series of lectures by Dr.
Vernon H. Blackman, of the Imperial College of Science and Tech-
nology in London, and on January 26 for a lecture on Agricultural
Research and the Community, by Sir Daniel Hall, scientific adviser
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

to the Minister of Agriculture in England, all lectures being open
to department workers and others. Other bureaus of this depart-
ment using the auditorium were the Forest Service for a series of
five lectures extending from October to June, the Bureau of Agri-
cultural Economics for an exhibition and talk on the evening of
April 20 by Mr. L. M. Estabrook, and the Federal Horticultural
Board on June 29 and 30, for public hearings on fruit and rose
stocks and the white-pine blister rust (when room 43 was also used),
and again on September 20 by the same board for a conference on
the white-pine blister rust quarantine. The auditorium and all com-
mittee rooms available were used for a naticnal conference on utiliza-
tion of forest products called by Secretary Wallace on November 19
and 20. On the afternoon of May 22, the department’s post, Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars of the United States, held memorial services
in the auditorium in honor of the late Henry C. Wallace, and of the
men of the Department of Agriculture who lost their lives in the
World War.

The Department of Commerce occupied the auditorium for the
National Radio Conference on October 7 and 8.

Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, of the Museum staff, gave two courses of lec-
tures on anthropology during the period from October 24 to Decem-
ber 19—Man’s Origin, on Friday afternoons in the auditorium,
and Man’s Physical and Physiological Characteristics, on Monday
afternoons in room 48. These proved highly popular and were well
attended.

Under the auspices of the School of Foreign Service, a series of
12 lectures were given in the auditorium by Dr. Edmund A.
Walsh, S. J., of Georgetown University, on Russia in Revolution.
These extended over a period from February 13 to May 15 and
attracted much attention.

Associations and societies using the auditorium and room 43 for
their annual meetings were the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, December 29 to January 3, and the American
Society of Mammalogists, April 8 to 10. The American Surgical
Association met in the auditorium May 4, 5, and 6, and on the same
dates the eighth annual meeting of the American Association for
Thoracic Surgery was held in room 43. On the evening of Janu-
ary 2 the division of insects of the Museum was thrown open to
members of the Entomological Society of America and the Associa-
tion of Economic Entomologists, who were in attendance at the
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Sci-
ence.

In addition to the foregoing the auditorium was used on various
occasions by the Wild Flower Preservation Society, the Audubon
Society of the District of Columbia, the District of Columbia Dental
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 45

Society, Washington Society of Engineers, Washington Chapter of
the American Association of Engineers, Practical Psychology Club,
and the Boy Scouts of the third division.

Among the scientific and other societies that met regularly in
room 43 were the Anthropological Society of Washington, the Ento-
mological Society of Washington, the American Horticutural So-
ciety, and the Society for Philosophical Inquiry. ‘Those using the
room from time to time were: The Audubon Society of the District
of Columbia during February and March for a series of talks by
Dr. Alexander Wetmore; the Helminthological Society of Washing-
ton, when Prof. E. Brumpt, of the University of Paris, made an
address; the Biological Society of Washington, for an address by
F. Johansen; the Washington Chapter of the American Institute
of Chemists; the directors and assistant directors of municipal play-
grounds; the Camp Fire Girls, and the Camp Fire Guardians; and
the Garden Homes Association for addresses intended “ to encourage
people to own a home and garden.”

Mr. Chr. Thams, minister of the Prince of Monaco to France,
on November 29 gave a lecture on the results of a journey under-
taken into eastern Africa for the purpose of advancing the cause
of conservation of wild life. The lecture was illustrated by a fine
series of moving pictures impressive for their accuracy in revealing
the habits of big game under natural conditions.

At the request of the Air Service Officers Reserve Corps, pictures
illustrating the flight around the world were shown in the audi-
torium on the evening of April 8.

On the evening of May 2 the auditorium was used for a private
showing of the historical picture made for the Commission of Re-
lief in Belgium, before Secretary Hoover, who was chairman of
that organization during the years of its operation from 1914 to
1919.

The auditorium was also used by the following: The Filipine
Club of Washington, on the evening of July 3, for a meeting to
celebrate the Fourth of July; El Club Cervantes, on the evening

46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

At the request of the Washington Chapter of the American In-
stitute of Banking all of the exhibition halls on the ground, first,
and second floors of the Natural History Building were opened on
the evening of July 19 for a reception to the members of the In-
stitute meeting in Washington at that time.

A joint meeting of the Anthropological Society of Washington,
the Washington Academy of Science, and the Art and Archeology
League, in conjunction with the Archeological Institute of America,
was held in the auditorium on the evening of December 16, during
which Count Byron Kuhn de Prorok gave a lecture on the “ Carthage
excavations, 1924,” and “'The dead cities of the Sahara.” After
the lecture a reception was held in the Art Gallery.

As one of the features of the meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, on the evening of December 29,
members and their guests were received in the Art Gallery by the
Secretary of the Institution and Mrs. Walcott, at which time the
entire first floor of the building was open. On the evening of
June 10, the halls on the first and second floors were opened for
a reception to the delegates of the National Association of Credit
Men attending the convention held in Washington from June 8 to 13.

MISCELLANEOUS

For the first time in the history of the Museum the total number
of visitors to the several buildings reached more than 1,000,000.
These .were recorded at the several buildings as follows: Arts and
Industries, 304,858; Natural History, 557,016; Aircraft, 52,787;
Smithsonian, 107,342; a total of 1,022,003.

The Museum published 5 volumes and 70 separate papers during
the year while its distribution of publications amounted to 104,596
copies of books and pamphlets.

Additions to the library numbered 1,457 books and 1,894 pam-
phlets, mostly obtained by exchange or donation. With the funds
available, only a few books could be purchased. Important con-
tributions which have not yet been catalogued are the bequest by the
late Col. Thomas L. Casey of approximately 4,500 books and pam-
phlets, mostly relating to Coleoptera, which were not entirely as-
sorted until after the close of the year, and the transfer from the
Treasury Department of 800 books and pamphlets relating to the
science of numismatics.

Through the operation of the reclassification act, which became
effective July 1, 1924, the salary standards in the Museum, partic-
ularly of the scientific staff, were materially improved and for the
first time in many years every position in the Museum personnel was
filled. The staff in the department of anthropology was completed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47

through the appointment of Mr. Herbert W. Krieger as curator
and Mr. Henry B. Collins as assistant curator of ethnology. In the
department of arts and industries Miss Aida M. Doyle was appointed
aid to succeed Mr. Harry W. Rabinowitz, resigned, and in the divi-
sion of history Miss Hortense Hoad was appointed aid.

In accordance with the special provision, included in the last
appropriation act, creating a new Assistant Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution to have general charge of the museum interests
of the Institution, including the United States National Museum, the
National Gallery of Art and the National Zoological Park, the pres-
ent incumbent was honored with appointment to that office on the
Ist of April, 1925.

The Museum lost two employees during the year through the
operation of the retirement act, viz, Mr. N. P. Scudder, assistant
librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the Museum
library, and Robert Ghor, fireman. The only death among em-
ployees on the active rolls of the Museum was that of Israel Free-
man, a laborer, employed in the Museum over 15 years, who died on
July 16, 1924.

Respectfully submitted.

ALEXANDER WETMORE,
Assistant Secretary.
Dr. Cuartes D. Watcort,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
affairs of the National Gallery of Art for the year ending June
30, 1925.

The activities of the gallery for the fifth year of its status as a
separate administrative unit of the Smithsonian Institution cor-
respond closely with those of previous years. The staff, which is
limited to the director and the recorder, has been occupied during
the year with the current work of the gallery; with the receipt,
record, installation, and care of the collections, permanent and tem-
porary; with the affairs of the gallery commission; with the devel-
opment of an art library; and with promotion of the gallery’s diver-
sified interests. Other employees are: a stenographer, a gallery at-
tendant, three watchmen, two laborers, two charwomen, and a
carpenter who is assigned to the gallery by the National Museum
when his services are required.

Additions to the gallery collections have fallen short of the aver-
age of previous years, the art works received by the Institution and
awaiting approval by the advisory committee of the gallery com-
mission not greatly exceeding a hundred thousand dollars in esti-
mated value. This falling off is due, at least in part, to the shortage
of exhibition space. Further important enrichment of the collec-
tions must thus await the erection of a gallery building, since collec-
tors seeking a final resting place for their treasures consider very
carefully their prospective installation and care. Mention may be
made here of the fact that during the period between 1904 and 1924,
the period during which suitable exhibition space happened to be
available in the museum buildings, accessions by gift and bequest
averaged in value approximately half a million dollars per year.
With a gallery building such as the nation should have, it is believed
that a million or millions annually would be within reasonable ex-
pectation. It is hardly within the range of possibility that a
second benefactor will appear who is willing to present the Govern-
ment with a building for his gift as did Mr. Freer, in order that the
gift might be accepted.

During the year much attention has been given to the prepara-
tion of preliminary plans for a gallery building. Although Con-
gress in 1921 set aside an appropriate site for a building, it was left

48
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

to the Institution to obtain funds necessary for the employment of
an architect to prepare the preliminary plans. As the result of an
appeal for this purpose by the Institution, $10,000 was raised by
private subscription, and Mr. Charles A. Platt was selected to pre-
pare the necessary plans. During the winter of 1923-24 Mr. Platt
spent several months in Europe engaged in the study of the more
important art galleries. The committee appointed by the Regents
of the Institution to collaborate with Mr. Platt on the plans, which
included in its membership Henry White, chairman, Frederic A.
Delano, Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, J. H. Gest, and C. D. Wal-
cott, met in the Regents’ room on February 18, 1925, and Mr. Platt
presented the sketch plans, which he stated had been carried just
far enough to be submitted for consideration by the Institution.
Two hours were spent in examining the drawings, which comprised
plans of the three floors, sections of the building, and a detailed
drawing of the south front. Plans of a number of European gal-
leries were submitted for comparison, and details of hghting and
adaptation of space to the various requirements of the structure
were considered. Mr. Platt stated that if the regents desired to
have the work proceed the plans could be ready for the beginning
of construction within six months, and that if appropriations were
made available, the building could be completed in three years. It
was expected by Mr. Platt that granite would be employed in the
building. Questions of construction, employment of builders, and
cost were discussed at length. Mr. Platt stated that the building,
which as planned is 300 feet in width by 500 feet in length, will
contain 10,000,000 cubic feet of stonework, and that the cost will
hardly fall short of $1 per cubic foot. The committee accepted the
plans as entirely satisfactory and reported to that effect to the
Regents of the Institution.

The Platt drawings were first published in an article which ap-
peared in the American Magazine of Art, March, 1925, where they
were accompanied for purposes of comparison by the plans of a
number of the principal art museums of both Europe and America.
It is expected that the Regents of the Institution will, at the proper
moment, present these preliminary plans to the committees of Con-
gress having the erection of Government buildings in charge, for
their consideration.

The death of Senator Lodge, a member of the Board of Regents
of the Institution, who in 1924 offered in the Senate an amendment
to the deficiency appropriation bill providing seven millions for a
gallery building, leaves the movement without a militant head, but
another will doubtless take his place since the urgent need of a
building is now very generally recognized. The movement is Te-
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

garded as having much added strength as a result of the fact that,
as indicated in the Lodge resolution, the building when completed
is expected to accommodate the collections of American history as
well as those of art. The historical collections are of great popular
interest, occupying to-day 120,000 square feet of floor space in-the
Smithsonian and the two Museum buildings—space urgently needed
for the legitimate activities and vast collections of the several
branches of natural science.

MEETINGS OF THE GALLERY COMMISSION

The annual meeting of the gallery commission was held in the
Regents’ room of the Smithsonian Institution, on December 9, 1924.
The members present were: Gari Melchers, chairman, Herbert
Adams, Joseph H. Gest, John E. Lodge, Frank J. Mather, jr.,
Charles Moore, James Parmelee, Edward W. Redfield, Charles D.
Walcott, and William H. Holmes.

The very important problem of the inclusion in the prospective
gallery building of collections both of art and history, as indicated
in the Lodge resolution, was given attention and the view prevailed
that it would be advantageous, at least for a time, to have the two
departments in the same building, although definitely separated.

The question of the acceptance of works of art by the advisory
committee through the medium of correspondence was raised, and
after discussion it was resolved that hereafter, a majority of the
advisory committee be required to personally examine the works
before making recommendation. As a result of this action and the
impracticability of calling the committee to Washington for the
consideration of works offered from time to time, the practice has
been adopted of having all works of exceptionally high merit offered
to the gallery accepted by the Smithsonian Institution for submis-
sion to the advisory committee at the annual meeting of the com-
mission or on occasions of particular importance, at especially called
meetings of the committee.

Mr. Edmund C. Tarbell was selected a member of the commis-
sion to succeed Mr. Edwin H. Blashfield, resigned, and his appoint-
ment was recommended to the Board of Regents. Regarding the
expiration of the three-year terms of three members of the commis-
sion, Messrs. John KE. Lodge, James Parmelee, and E. W. Redfield, it
was decided to recommend to the Board of Regents the reelection
of these members for the succeeding term of four years. The pres-
ent members of the executive and advisory committees and the pres-
ent officers of the commission were reelected for the year 1925.

The Platt plans for the proposed National Gallery Building were
then presented by the secretary and were given careful considera-
tion by the members of the commission.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 51

ACTIVITIES OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ARTS AND 'THE FEDERATION
OF WOMEN’S CLUBS

The work of the American Federation of Arts, in promoting the
development of the national gallery, deserves appreciative mention.
At its 1923 convention in St. Louis the following resolution was
unanimously adopted :

Whereas the United States is the only civilized nation which has no national
gallery of art; and whereas there is great need for a building to house our
Lip ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

national art collection which in the past few years has greatly increased in
size and value through gifts and bequests of public-spirited collectors and
individuals; and whereas, on account of the lack of space in which to exhibit
such gifts, this channel of beneficence is now checked; Be it

Resolved, That the American Federation of Arts undertake a campaign of
education and promotion throughout the United States, in order to acquaint
the people of existing conditions, in the hope that it may be their will when
the facts are known, that a sufficient sum be appropriated by Congress to
erect a suitable building at the National Capital to house the national col-
lections and to evidence to the world that we, as a people, recognize art to
be a factor in our national life.

Miss Leila Mechlin, secretary of the American Federation of
Arts, states that the federation has at present 375 chapters or affili-
ated organizations in all parts of the United States. The intention
of the federation is to secure the cooperation of these organizations,
and to interest a membership numbering several hundred thousand
individuals in the gallery movement.

Of like importance in the promotion of the national gallery are
the activities of the Federation of Women’s Clubs under the ener-
getic direction of Mrs. Rose V. S. Berry, chairman of the art
department of the federation. This great organization, whose ac-
tivities extend to every State in the Union, seeks as one of its pri-
mary responsibilities to promote the cause of art, and especially to
further art education in the most comprehensive manner. It seeks
to have the world realize that the place given the arts of taste in a
nation is an infallible test of the place that nation holds in the
scale of civilization; it maintains that the promotion of these arts
is thus a national responsibility. In its lecture courses and publi-
cations it utilizes the national collections, taking occasion to lay
stress upon the humiliating fact that the American nation makes no
adequate provision for the acquirement, care, and utilization of
collections illustrating the world’s achievements in the many
branches of art, ignoring the example of all other civilized nations.

SPECIAL EXHIBITIONS HELD IN THE GALLERY

An exhibit of exceptional interest held in the middle room of the
gallery March 3 to April 13 comprised 19 miniatures by Mr. Alyn
Williams and 34 works of sculpture by Mr. Cecil Thomas, both
exhibitors being Englishmen, although Mr. Williams spends much
of his time in the United States. The exhibitors very generously
prepared and had printed at their own expense a catalogue of the
exhibits, copies of which were freely distributed. During the ex-
hibit and for a short period thereafter Mr. Thomas was permitted to
occupy one of the gallery spare rooms as a studio where he modeled
two figure groups, The Duet and The Spirit of the Dance, the
inspiration for which had come to him while in Washington. While
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 53

thus engaged Mr. Thomas was fortunate in having sittings for a por-
trait bust by Sir Esme Howard, British ambassador to the United
States. This work met with gratifying approval and a replica in
plaster was presented by the sculptor to the Smithsonian !nstitution
at a dinner given in honor of Sir Esme by the Washington Branch
of the English-Speaking Union, on May 13. Presentation was
inade by the presiding officer of the occasion, and it was accepted by
Doctor Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with
appropriate words of appreciation.

A collection of portraits in oil and various studies in other tech-
niques by Leo Katz of Vienna, Austria, was shown in the two north
rooms of the gallery January 10 to February 15, and the exhibit,
comprising 35 items, proved of very special interest to the people of
Washington.

The gallery was fortunate in being permitted to place on view
from December 16 to February 15 a collection of art works in bronze
and terra cotta, nine in number, mainly busts of important person-
ages, by Mrs. Nancy Cox-McCormack. These were mounted on
appropriate pedestals in the south room of the gallery and included
busts of Benito Mussolini, Italian premier, in black marble, and
Henry P. Fletcher, ambassador to Italy, in bronze.

A collection of 72 water-color paintings of the scenery of the
national parks of the Rocky Mountain and Pacific coast regions, by
Gunnar Widforss, was exhibited in the middle room of the gallery
December 10 to January 10. These paintings were vivid and highly
realistic presentations of many remarkable subjects and attracted
much favorable attention.

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the re-
searches, office work, ond other activities of the Bureau of Ameri-
‘ran Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1925, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress approved June 7, 1924. The
act referred to contains the following item:

American ethnology: lor continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including the necessary employees and the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals, $57,160.

The policy of the Bureau of American Ethnology in the past
has been that of a pioneer, but from necessity the field work of the
staff has been both intensive and extensive, mainly reconnaissance.
As a pioneer, the bureau has opened up new lines of research in the
study of the ethnology of the American Indians and has blazed a
trail for others in several fields. While contributing to science tech-
nical monographs on certain Indian tribes, it has at the same
time prepared and circulated, through publication, articles of a pop-
ular character covering the whole subject. The object has been to
furnish reliable data for students wishing accurate knowledge of
the American Indians.

The aboriginal culture of our Indians is rapidly disappearing
and being replaced by the white man’s civilization. Certain tribes
have already lost almost all their native customs, and others will
follow rapidly until little of scientific value remains for ethnologi-
cal field work. The older men among them, who in their prime
knew the native cults and rituals, are passing away, and the younger
generation of Indians who are taking their places are almost en-
tirely ignorant of the significance of the rituals or ceremonials.
Current fables and metaphoric stories, mainly explaining the char-
acteristics of animals, are now often claimed to be mythologic, al-
though many of them have value as tales, not as myths. The In-
dian culture is passing away and soon will be lost. It is the inten-
tion of the Bureau of American Ethnology to record it before its
extinction.

The excavation and preservation of archeologic remains, from
which much valuable scientific material may be obtained, constitute

60
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

a task which is only just begun. The bureau has for many years been -
a pioneer in-this work, and in many areas it has been the only
investigator. The first publication of the Smithsonian Institution
was on an archeological subject, and with the passing years the
bureau has followed this line of work with vigor.

It is a traditional, sound policy of the Institution, as a result of
the relatively small allowance for the field study of the Indians, to
cooperate, rather than to attempt to compete with those who have
a much larger income. This policy has been pursued by the bureau
during the past year.

The chronicles of De Soto’s wonderful trip through our south-
eastern States introduced to the attention of historians a remark-
able aboriginal American culture, one of the most advanced in
North America outside of Mexico. It was, as has generally been
the case, built on agriculture, and the dominant tribal religion of
its civilization was a complex of Sun, Fire, and Great Serpent
cults. From Tampa: Bay to the Mississippi River, De Soto en-
countered numerous tribes differing in language and in minor eth-
nological features, but all belonging to the same culture with a wor-
ship characteristic wherever agriculture served as a source of food.
As time went by and renewed exploration brought Europeans into
more intimate contact with the Indians of the Gulf States, his-
torians and others published many articles on their ethnology, but
as the tribes were moved west of the Mississippi and the oppor-
tunities for the field worker were diminished, the time came for
the ethnologist to yield to the archeologist to make his contribution
to the subject. Here lies a great field for further studies, with
ample work for both the historian and the archeologist.

The two areas in aboriginal America north of Mexico in which
agriculture reached its highest development were the Southwest, or
that part of our domain bordering on Old Mexico, and those States
bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, including the mound builders
from the Ohio River to the Gulf. The investigation of the south-
western or pueblo region is at present attracting many archeologists
amply furnished with funds, but the Southeastern or Gulf States
have been more or less overlooked. The bureau has begun an
archeological reconnaissance, as far as its resources will allow, in
Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. Last year special
attention was given to the Indian mounds at Muscle Shoals in
Alabama. The work in Tennessee, southern Florida, and Missis-
sippi, So auspiciously begun by the late Mr. W. E. Myer, has been
continued by Mr. P. E. Cox, State archeologist of Tennessee. Mr.
Collins, assistant curator, division of ethnology, United States Na-
tional Museum, was allotted a small appropriation for preliminary
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

investigations and reconnaissance along the Pearl River in Missis-
sippi, the prehistoric home of the Choctaw Tribe. The results of
this work were very satisfactory.

Work on the Muskhogean culture, or the antiquities of the Gulf
States, promises important results in comparative ways, and will, it
is hoped, shed light on the religion of aboriginal tribes of North
America. We are able to reconstruct, in a way, from historical
sources, the main outlines of the Gulf culture, but the documentary
references to the material culture of the Muskhogean tribes are
incomplete. More information is needed regarding the ritualistic
sacra, idols, ceremonial objects, and symbolism on pottery, before
we can reconstruct the cultus. The material for this study is now
buried in the soil, but intensive archeological work will bring it to
light. In essentials, the culture of the prehistoric people of the
Gulf States is such as we find universal among agricultural people
in America emerging from savagery into barbarism, and the religion
has much in common with that of the pueblos.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

The chief spent several weeks in reconnaissance near Florence,
Ala., making excursions to several mounds in that vicinity, espe-
cially those that will be submerged when the Wilson Dam at Muscle
Shoals is flooded. Mr. Gerard Fowke, who had immediate charge
of the excavations in two of these mounds, obtained a considerable
collection containing unique objects, among which are three rare
copper ornaments, the largest ever found in the valley of the Ten-
nessee. His report will be published later.

The chief at that time visited Montgomery, Ala., where he was
most hospitably received. While there he made an examination of
the Graves collection, one of the most remarkable in the State.

The chief has given advice to the National Park Service of the
Interior Department on the new National Monument near Flagstaff,
Ariz., which is now called by the Hopi name Wupatki. This monu-
ment includes the well-preserved buildings near Black Falls on the
Little Colorado, first described and figured by the writer a quarter
of a century ago, at which time he recommended that they be made
a National Monument, and this has now been done by proclamation
of the President.

The most important collection of archeolgical objects received dur-
ing the past year was contributed by Mr. J. C. Clarke, of Flagstaff,
Ariz., custodian of the Wupatki ruin. It consists of about a hun-
dred specimens of pottery, shell and bone implements, and other arti-
facts from a burial mound at Youngs Canyon excavated by work-
men in the course of construction of a road near the city. These
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

objects were received at a time when material from that region of
the Southwest was particularly desirable. The chief has prepared
an illustrated report on this collection in which he calls attention
to its importance. The collection contains unique specimens and
is accompanied by a good catalogue by Mr. Clarke. One of the most
interesting of these is a black and white pottery ladle, the handle
of which is molded into a cradle containing a clay figure. There is
also a finely incised head-ornament of bone, recalling those worn
by the Bow priesthood at Zufi, and suggesting similar ornaments of
the Hopi idol of the war god. The collection shows evidence of
cremation and urn burial.

The pottery objects are archaic, and the interiors of certain black-
and-white food bowls are decorated with artistic figures similar to
those on polychrome ware from Tokonabi, near March Pass, in
northern Arizona. It is probable from the pottery that the people
who buried their dead at Youngs Canyon were related to a population
antedating pueblos, which was scattered over a great area in Arizona
from the Little Colorado north to the San Juan, and from the west-
ern boundary of the state into New Mexico. This people had no
circular kivas or ceremonial rooms like those at the Mesa Verde, or
the San Juan area, but they were fine potters who decorated their
ware with artistic geometrical designs.

The number of written requests for information on ethnological
subjects the last few years has more than doubled, and the time of
the chief, as well as of the members of the staff, is correspondingly
absorbed.

During the past year Mr. Earl H. Morris, under the direction of
the chief of the bureau, did necessary repair work cn the famous
tower of the Mummy Cave House in the Canyon del Muerto, Ari-
zona, which once contained three rooms. All woodwork on the
first ceiling has been torn out; only the haggled ends of a few sup-
ports remain embedded in the walls. The cleanly peeled poles which
supported the second ceiling are in place, and the third ceiling, or
original roof, is still intact. Itis probably the most beautiful ceiling
remaining in any ruin in the Southwest, its only rivals being the
coverings of one or two rooms in the north side of Pueblo Bonito,
and in Spruce Tree House, Mesa Verde.

This tower has been in a dangerous condition for a long time.
There was originally a retaining wall below it, rising from the very
brink of the ledge, which held in place the fill of loose rock and
refuse upon which the House of the Tower stands. Eventually,
through erosion, all but the eastern end of this wall collapsed, prob-
ably because of the insecure foundation afforded by the abruptly
sloping rock, and much of the material behind it washed over the
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

cliff. Later, the not infrequent winds which sweep over the cave
with unbelievable force, blew out the dust and rock pebbles until the
southwest corner of the tower was undermined more than 3 feet and
the wall eastward weakened almost to the opposite corner.

The cracks in the west wall were wider in November, 1924, than
they were a year previous. A removal of half a dozen shovelfuls
from the unconsolidated mass of earth beneath the front would have
loosened the large block just beyond its western end, which pre-
vented the entire collapse of the masonry. In addition to the periodic
action of the wind, each visitor who passed from the eastern to the
western part of the cave trod his portion of the loose mass below
the wall farther down the slope, and sent clods and pebbles rattling
over the cliff. Before many years this block would have been
loosened and the tower would have fallen.

During the repair work, buttresses were built beneath and in-
closing the large blocks under the west end of the tower and under
the undermined portion of the tower, continuing back to the limit
of undermining, and extending well forward of the masonry. At
the junction of the two, wedges were driven to knit the new work
firmly to the old. From the east end of the buttress a retaining wall
was built to connect with the remnant of the old one on the brink
of the ledge, and the space behind it was filled, thus providing a
platform instead of the former steep slope at the southeast corner
of the tower. This repair work will temporarily preserve one of the
finest gems of aboriginal architecture in the entire Southwest, but
it should be supplemented by the addition of “ turnbuckles” an-
chored to the cliff and by the rebuilding of the southeast corner,
which should be bonded to the east and front wall to preserve it for
centuries to come.

During the fiscal year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, dis-
covered further material bearing on the social and religious life
of the Creek Indians, and this was extracted and incorporated into
his papers on those subjects which are now being prepared for pub-
lication by the editor. A study also was made of the various smaller
culture centers within the region covered by our present Gulf
States, and a paper on the “Culture of the Southeast ” was pre-
pared as a result of this work. A short paper on the “ Ethnology
of the Chickasaw ” was begun and carried nearly to completion,
end the work of carding references to all words from the publica-
tions of early Florida missionaries in the now extinct Timucua
language has been continued, and all of the words from three of
the five texts and from more than half of the fourth had been ex-
tracted by the end of the year. An abbreviated handbook of the
Indian tribes in the United States and Alaska was prepared to ac-
company a map of the same section.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, prepared for publication a
manuscript entitled ‘A Sauk and Fox Sacred Pack.” He also wrote
the Indian text of one of the great sacred packs of the Thunder gens
of the Fox Indians and worked out the English version thereof.
Doctor Michelson also prepared an Indian text, with English ver-
sion, of the Owl dance which belongs to the Bear gens. He began
translating a Fox text on the sacred pack named “ Sakimage ” which
belongs to the Bear gens of the Fox Indians and which was taken
care of by Pushetonequa, the last chief recognized by the Govern-
ment. He corrected the galley proofs and the first page proofs of
the fortieth annual report of the bureau, which made it possible to
incorporate some additional material appurtenant to the White
Buffalo Dance and Fox mortuary customs and beliefs. Doctor
Michelson employed Horace Powesheik to translate 1,000 pages of
Fox text which contains additional information on the Fox society
known as “Those Who Worship the Little Spotted Buffalo.” In
June Doctor Michelson went to Tama, Iowa, to renew his researches
among the Algonquian Tribe of that State. He verified the new
data on the Fox society named above, and some Fox texts on the
Buffalo Head Dance of the Thunder gens, obtaining much additional
information of this dance and other information on the Thunder
gens. A translation of the Fox text on the Sturgeon was obtained
as well as certain information on the Wolf gens.

During the fiscal year Mr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, was
engaged in the preparation for publication of his material on the
excavation and early history of the Burton Mound Indian village
situated at Santa Barbara, Calif., the principal rancheria of the
Santa Barbara Indians. The Ambassador Hotel, which had stood
on the mound for many years, and had completely barred it to scien-
tific investigation, was destroyed by fire in the spring of 1921. By
joint arrangement with the Museum of the American Indian, a
thorough excavation of this mound was made, and a large and attrac-
tive collection of artifacts was obtained, as well as a mass of archeo-
logical and historical material. Mr. Harrington completed the elab-
oration of this material and it was submitted for publication, includ-
ing maps and numerous photographs.

The old Indian name for the Burton Mound village was Syujtun.
Mr. Harrington’s work revealed the interesting fact, not previously
pointed out, that this rancheria is mentioned four times in the
“ Relacion ” of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who discovered Alta Cali-
fornia in 1542. Father Crespi, who kept the diary of the Portola
expedition, writing in 1769, describes this village in some detail.
Other early accounts tell that Yanonalit, its chief, had under him
12 other villages besides the Burton Mound. After the Indian popu-
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

lation was removed to the near-by Santa Barbara Mission, which
was accomplished gradually after the establishment of the mission
in 1782, the Franciscans erected a massive adobe warehouse on the
mound, the old Indian canoe landing place in front of the mound
having become “el puerto de Santa Barbara,” the port of Santa
Barbara. Ships visiting Santa Barbara used to get water from the
large spring on the southern slope of the mound. Joseph Chapman,
a young Englishman who had been captured when pirates made a
raid on the California coast, purchased the mound from the Fran-
ciscans in the early twenties and started a flour mill there. In the
forties the mound became the property of George Nidiver, famous
otter hunter and friend of General Fremont. In the sixties the
mound property was owned by Lewis T. Burton, whose name it still
bears. The hotel was erected on the site in 1901. The shape and
extent of the Indian village and graveyards was laboriously worked
out by excavation and successive cultures traced, for the site proved
to be very ancient.

In the cemetery plots, most of the bodies were buried in hunched-
up positions with the head to the north, that is, in the direction of the
mountain range. Many of the graves had been lined with whale-
bone slabs, some fine specimens of which were obtained. A great
variety of belongings, large and small, had been stowed away with
the bodies, and traces of matting, basketry, and wooden utensils in-
dicated that the areheologist had been deprived of the richest treas-
ures through decomposition in the ground. One complete wooden
awl for basketry, such as is described by the early fathers, was re-
covered. Several of the graves contained caches of large and beau-
tifully finished steatite bowls; these were manufactured at the stea-
tite quarries on Santa Catalina Island and were brought up the
channel for barter in Indian canoes. Screening the earth brought a
surprising variety of shell and glass beads. The shell beads have
been sorted and classified, and the kind of native shell used for each
variety has been determined.

In 1924 the Burton Mound property was sold and subdivided.
Extensive grading of the property for new streets and trenching for
pipe lines of various kinds was carefully watched and reported on by
Prof. D. B. Rogers, who has cooperated with Mr. Harrington in this
work, and yielded new information about the stratification of the
mound and a good sized additional collection of artifacts. A new
hotel with large cellar excavations is about to be built on the crest of
the mound and observation of these operations will doubtless add
still further data to that already presented in the report.

On completing the Burton Mound paper, Mr. Harrington prepared
a report on the archeology of the Santa Barbara region, dealing with
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

the sites adjacent to the Burton Mound along both historical and
archeological lines. ‘This is a virgin field of research and has al-
ready yielded important contributions to our knowledge of the cul-
ture sequences of the ancient California Indians of this region, which
had the most specialized and highly developed culture of the State.

This work illumines the fact that the early population of the chan-
nel was dense and that there were numerous wars and tribal shift-
ings. The section of the coast from which the islands were popu-
lated and the comparative ages of rancheria sites are also apparent
from this work.

In October, 1924, Mr. R. O. Marsh brought to Washington a
party of eight Tulé Indians from Panama, who remained in the
city until January, 1925. This afforded opportunity for studying
the language, which is a peculiarly interesting one. Possessing only
18 letters and employing them both short and long, it sounds to
the ear more like Finnish than like the average American Indian
language. The language may be described as melodious, simple
and flexible in structure, yet very rich and extensive in vocabulary.
It is spoken, with slight dialectic differences only, by a very large
body of Indians, who formerly held a strip of Caribbean coast more
than 240 miles long between the Canal Zone and the south of the
Rio Atrato, together with the numerous fertile keys off the coast.
Lists were obtained of sociological terms, names of places, plants and
animals, and designations of material culture objects. Songs and
speech were recorded on the dictaphone.

The Indians have been called Tulés, Cunas, Comogres, and San
Blasenos. Of these names the first is preferable because it is the
native name of the tribe. The word Tulé means merely “ Indian,”
it being understood that it refers to Indians of that peculiar kind
and language. It is related to the word tula, meaning 20, that is, all
fingers and toes, an entire Indian.

The collection of Tulé ethnological objects donated by Mr. Marsh
to the National Museum was examined with the Indian informants
and the native names of the objects were recorded, together with
information about their use.

The best informant in the party was Chief Igwa, who is “ captain ”
over some 10 keys, and is one of the leading men in the councils of
the tribe. He has traveled much about the Tulé country and knows
hundreds of places by name, being a good ethnogeographical in-
formant. The chief prepared a large map showing these places.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, left Washington in May, 1925,
for Brantford, Canada, to resume his researches among the Six
(originally Five) Nations, or Tribes, of the Iroquois, the Mohawk,
the Seneca, the Onondaga, the Oneida, the Cayuga, and the ‘Tus-
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

carora, and also among the Munsee of the Delaware Algonquian
group of languages who dwell on the Haldimand grant on the Grand
River in Ontario, Canada.

Here Mr. Hewitt took up the literary interpretation, revision, and
textual criticism of previously recorded voluminous Iroquoian texts
relating to the Constitution of the League or Confederation of the
Iroquois tribes, embodying its laws and ordinances and the rituals
of the council of condolence for the deceased, and the installation of
new members of the Federal and the tribal councils.

With the aid of the two best Mohawk informants available who still
retain some definite knowledge of portions of the ancient institutions
of the league of the Iroquois, Mr. Hewitt made a free English trans-
lation of an important one of these rituals, in addition to the free
rendering of the chant of “* The seven songs of farewell,” and thereby
recovered the symbolic reason for the very peculiar name of the
former. This ritual is called Ka‘trhawé™“hra’to’, in Mohawk, and
Githawe™hii’di’, in Onondaga, meaning, “ Cast or thrown over the
grand forest.” When used ceremonially both these chants are sep-
arated into two portions, and the four portions alternate in their
rendition in such manner that part one of the one chant is followed
by part one of the other; and part two of the first is followed by
part two of the second chant. But when chanted “a veil of skins ”
(shawls or blankets serve in modern times) must be’ hung across the
place of assembly in such wise as to divide the mourning from the
other side of the league.

Ceremonial or legislative action by the tribe or by the league is
taken only through the orderly cooperation of two sisterhoods of
clans for the former, or of two sisterhoods of tribes for the latter.
This dualism in the highest organic units of organization was orvigi-
nally based on definite mythic concepts. In either organization one
sisterhood represented the female principle or the motherhood in
nature, and the other sisterhood the male principle, or the father-
hood in nature. This dualism is thought to be so important that the
janguage of the rituals and of official courtesy employ terms embody-
ing the ethnic and mythic significance of it.

By a searching study of all symbolic terms and phrases occurring
in the chants of these rituals, which impliedly might refer to the
highest dramatized situation revealed by these two divided chants,
the parts of which are recombined as described above, Mr. Hewitt
was able to identify beyond all reasonable question the phrase “ the
veil of skins” with the other phrase “the grand forest.” The
“grand forest” represents ritualistically the totality of the forests
which intervene between the lands of the mourning side of the league
and those of the other side, represented as symbolically intact in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

mind. It must not be overlooked that either the mother side or the
father side may be the “ mourning side”; the designation, of course,
alternates between the two sides, depending on the fact of the loss of
one or more of the members of the Federal council belonging to it at
any given time.

The sisterhood of tribes functioned by the independent action of
its constituent institutional units—every several tribe. In turn
every tribe functioned through the organic units of its own internal
organization—each several clan, to execute its prescribed part in the
larger Federal action, which otherwise would not be authentic or
authoritative; so that a clan or an individual in 9a clan, in special
cases involving personal rights, might prevent vital Federal action.
So personal rights were abundantly safeguarded.

Mr. Hewitt purchased a very fine specimen husk mask of the Corn
Mother, with a short explanatory text.

Mr. Hewitt also made a reconnaissance trip to the Chippewa of
Garden River, Canada, for the purpose of expanding and deepening
his knowledge of certain Chippewa texts, recorded in 1921 by him
from the dictation of Mr. George Gabaoosa, of Garden River, and
also to obtain data in regard to the derivation of two very important
proper names, Chippewa and Nanabozho (appearing in literature
also as Nenabojo, Menaboju, and Wenaboju), and also to inform
himself as to the ethnologic value to be placed on the fast-fading
remains of the ethnic culture of this and cognate tribes in like situa-
tions and antecedents. The myth of Mudjikewis, “The First-Born
(on Earth),” commonly called the story of Nanabozho (i. e.,
Inabé‘oji‘o‘), remarkable for beauty and comprehensiveness, details
the circumstances which gave rise to the name “ Nanabozho.” In
that recital the name appeared as /ndbi‘oj7‘o‘) and means “ Created,
or formed, by the look (of the Great Father spirit) .”

The name Chippewa appears in literature in no less than 97
variant spellings, with a half dozen or more unsatisfactory defini-
tions. But to those who first gave the name Chippewa (in its native,
not Europeanized, form) to these people, picture-writing was ethni-
cally distinctive and characteristic of them as the well-known birch-
bark records of these people amply testify. So the name Chippewa
signifies literally, “' Those who make pictographs,” and thus empha-
sizes one of the distinctive arts of these peoples.

The Seneca in Missouri and Oklahoma were visited for the express
purpose of identifying them tribally, if the available information
made this possible. Since the middle of the eighteenth century
these Seneca have not been closely affiliated with the Seneca Tribe
of New York State and Canada. There has been expressed doubt
that these western Seneca had the right to this name. But after

76041—26——_6
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

visiting and interviewing many families of these western Seneca
dwelling about. Seneca, Mo., and Miami and Picher, Okla., Mr.
Hewitt was convinced that they are mainly emigrants from the
parent Seneca Tribe of New York and Canada and from the Cayuga
of these last-named places; naturally, there are also some families of
other Iroquoian Tribes, such as the Wyandot and possibly the
Conestoga. A porcupine clan and a fox clan were reported. The
Jast was a Conestoga clan.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, completed his paper on two
versions of the child-naming rite of the Osage Tribe. ‘The first ver-
sion belongs to the In-gthon-ga or Puma gens, and the second to the
Tsi-zhu Wa-shta-ge or Tsi-zhu Peacemaker gens. Each gens has its
own version of the rite and no other gens can use it without per-
mission. This paper contains 201 typewritten pages and 20 illus-
trations. Mr. La Flesche spent a part of the month of May and all
of June, 1925, among the Osages. In the early part of this visit he
and his assistant, Ku-zhi-si-e, a full-blood Osage, undertook the la-
borious task of properly recording the gentile personal names used
by the full-blood members of the tribe and by some of the mixed
bloods. Superintendent J. George Wright, of the Csage Agency,
kindly permitted them to use as a guide in doing this work an annu-
ity pay roll of the third and fourth quarters of the year 1877, which
was found in the files of his office. This roll contains about 1,900
Indian names, most of them misspelled. Besides correcting the
spelling of the names, Mr. La Flesche and his assistant added to the
name of each annuitant the name of his or her gens. Ku-zhi-si-e
was much amused to learn that his boy name, “ I-tse-tha-gthin-zhi,”
was carried on the pay roll as “ Ii-stah-o-gra-she,” and that the
boy name of his friend “ Wa-non-she-zhin-ga”’ was put on the rolls
as “ Me-pah-scah,” instead of “ In-bae-sca,” the correct name.

When the work of revising the names on the annuity roll was
concluded, Ku-zhi-si-e drove over the hills on his farm with Mr.
La Flesche and showed him many wild plants which were useful
to the Indians as medicine or food. Some of these plants were
woven into large mats for house covering, and into rugs to spread
on the floor of the house to sit upon.

Wo-non-she-zthin-ga (the chief of the tribe) also took tramps
among the trees on his farm with Mr. La Flesche, and showed him
a number of trees and explained to him their uses, and gave to
him their native names, which he recorded. This man pointed out
a tree which he called “Zhon-sa-gi,” hard wood. The saplings
of this tree he said were used for the frames of the houses. When
green the wood was easily cut with a knife or ax, but when sea-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 4 tare

soned it was very hard to cut. The chief cut a branch from a
small tree and carried it with him when he and Mr. La Flesche
returned to the house. The chief whittled off some of the bark
from the branch and dipped the shavings in a glass of water and
the water quickly became blue like indigo. Mr. Paul C. Standley
identified this tree as the blue ash, or Fraxinus quadrangulata.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

The following manuscripts of Indian music have been purchased
during the fiscal year from Miss Frances Densmore: “ War, wed-
ding, and social songs of the Makah Indians,” “Songs connected
with Makah feasts and dances,” “ Music and customs of the Tulé
Indians of Panama,” “Songs and instrumental music of the Tulé
Indians of Panama,” “Songs for children and material culture
of the Makah Indians,” and 17 mathematical groups analyses of
167 Papago songs, according to the method of such analyses in
previous work. This material (apart from the group analyses)
comprises 150 pages of text, numerous photographic illustrations,
and the transcriptions of 69 songs, together with the original phono-
graph records and descriptive and tabulated analyses of individual
songs. The last named are the analyses from which the mathe-
matical analyses are made, these showing the peculiarities of the
songs of an entire tribe with results expressed in percentages.
These in turn form the basis for comparative tables, which show
the characteristics of the music of different tribes. Such tables
of comparison in “ Mandan and Hidatsa Music” comprise 820 songs
collected among six tribes, and material awaiting publication will
add more than 500 songs to this number, including songs of widely
separated tribes. It seems possible that these tables may show
a connection between the physical environment of the Indians and
the form assumed by their songs, as interesting contrasts appear
in the songs of different tribes.

The final paper on the Makah Indians included a description of the
uses of 26 plants in food, medicine, and dye. Specimens of the
plants had been obtained on the reservation, and their botanical
identification was made by Mr. Paul C. Standley, of the United
States National Museum. The Makah were head hunters and a
detailed account of their war customs was presented. The caste
system prevailed in former days and families of the upper class had
wealth and leisure. The wedding customs were marked by festivity
and by physical contests, the songs of which were submitted.

The presence in Washington of a group of Tulé Indians from the
Province of Colon, Panama, made possible a study of forms of primi-
we . ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

tive music which, it is believed, have not hitherto been described.
The Tulé Indians are unique in that they do not pound on a drum,
a pole, or any other object. Their favorite musical instrument is
the “ pan pipe ” of reeds. ‘Two men usually play these pipes, sound-
ing alternate tones. The music of these pan pipes was phonograph-
ically recorded and transcribed as nearly as is possible in musical
notation. An instrument which, as far as known, has not been pre-
viously observed, is a reed flute having two finger holes but no
“whistle opening.” ‘The upper end of the reed is held inside the
mouth, possibly touching the roof of the mouth, and for this reason
the instrument is designated as a “mouth flute.” A gourd rattle,
conch shell horn, and bone whistle complete the musical instruments
of these Indians.

The words of the songs narrate a series of events, such as the
preparation for a wedding and a description of the festivity, or the
illness and death of a man, followed by “talking to his spirit.”
Chief Igwa Nigidibippi, who recorded the songs, was a trained
singer.

As compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 1924, there was a
decrease of 6,609 publications distributed. ‘This was undoubtedly
due not to a decrease in applications, but to the fact that only one
publication was distributed during the year just ended, whereas four
publications were issued in the preceding fiscal year and distributed
to the mailing list.

ILLUSTRATIONS
Mr. Delancey Gill, illustrator, with the assistance of Mr. Albert

Sweeney, continued the preparation of the illustrations of the bureau.

as last year. About 7,000 negatives have so far been catalogued.

LIBRARY

The reference library has continued under the immediate care of
Miss Ella Leary, librarian, assisted by Mr. Thomas Blackwell.
During the year 480 books were accessioned. Of these 100 were
acquired by purchase, 280 by gift and exchange, and 100 by binding
of periodicals. The periodicals currently received number about
975, of which 40 are by subscription, the remainder through ex-
change. The library has also received 187 pamphlets. The aggre-
gate number of volumes in the library at the close of the year was
26,101; of pamphlets, 15,512; also several thousand unbound peri-
odicals. The Library of Congress, officers of the executive depart-
ments, and out-of-town students have made use of the library through
frequent loans during the year.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
operations of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1925:

The congressional appropriation allowed for the support of the
exchange service during the year 1925 was $49,550, $6,550 more than
the amount granted for the fiscal year 1924. Of this increase about
half was to cover the extra amount necessary for reclassification of
salaries. The usual appropriation of $200 for printing and binding
was granted by Congress. There was collected by the Institution
on account of repayment from departmental and other  establish-
ments $4,900.22, making the total resources available for carrying
on the Smithsonian system of exchanges for the fiscal year 1925
$54,650.22.

During the year the total number of aes handled was 468,731,
an increase over the number for the preceding year of 8,073. ‘These
packages weighed a total of 506,164 pounds, a loss of 60,943 pounds.
This decrease in weight is due to the smaller size of packages of
publications received for transmission through the service.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are
indicated in the following table:

The value of the material passing through the International Ex-
change Service can not be estimated by the mere number of packages
handled. Many of the packages each contain a number of valuable
scientific publications. It may be estimated that annually there pass
through the service both to and from foreign countries, considerably
more than a million publications.

Although the United States Government sends abroad more publi-
cations than it receives in exchange, the disparity is not so great

75
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

as appears in the above table, for many foreign publications are
received direct by mail by correspondents in this country.

Latvia, which joined both conventions in 1924, has established a
service of international exchanges under the state library at Riga.

The total number of boxes used in despatching consignments was
4,325. This was a decrease of 139 from the preceding year and is
accounted for by the smaller size of the packages received for trans-
mission abroad, as referred to above. Of the total number of boxes
shipped abroad, 268 were for the foreign depositories of full sets
of United States governmental documents, and the remainder (2,057)
was for distribution to miscellaneous establishments and indi-
viduals. While the Smithsonian Exchange Service, as a rule, trans-
mits its consignments to other countries in boxes, sometimes the pack-
ages that accumulate for a particular country are not of sufficient
bulk to warrant their transmission by freight, and they are mailed
directly to their destinations. In addition, quite a number of pack-
ages are forwarded by mail to remote places which can not be reached
through the existing exchange agencies. During the year the num-
ber of packages sent abroad in this manner was 39,499.

The number of boxes sent to each country is given in the following
table:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 4

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

In accordance with the terms of a convention concluded at Brus-
sels March 15, 1886, and under authority granted by Congress in
resolutions approved March 2, 1867, and March 2, 1901, 58 full sets
of United States official documents and 40 partial sets are now sent
through the exchange service regularly to depositories abroad. ‘This
is a reduction of one full set from last year and an addition of two
partial sets. New Zealand requested that a partial set be sent to
the General Assembly Library instead of a full set. The Stadt-
bibliothek of the Free City of Danzig was added to the list of
those receiving partial sets. The number of full and partial sets
of governmental documents forwarded to foreign depositories there-
fore is 98. The total number provided by law for this purpose
and for the use of the Library of Congress has been increased by
act of Congress approved March 3, 1925, from 100 to 125.

The convention referred to above, which was the first of two con-
ventions concluded at Brussels March 15, 1886, and is referred to
as Convention A, provides for the international exchange of offi-
cial documents and scientific and literary publications. The sec-
ond convention, referred to as Convention B, provides for the
interparliamentary exchange of the official journal as well as of the
parliamentary annals and documents. Convention A was rati-
fied by the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Serbia,
(now Yugoslavia), Spain, and Switzerland. Convention B was rati-
fied by the same countries except Switzerland. Since the ratifica-
tion of the Brussels conventions the following countries have signi-
fied their adherence thereto in the order in which they are listed:

. Uruguay—both conventions, 1889.

. Argentine Republic—convention A, 1889.

. Paraguay—convention A, 1889.

. Czechoslovakia—both conventions, 1919.
Poland—convention A, 1920; convention B, 1921.
Roumania—both conventions, 1923.

. Hungary—hboth conventions, 1923.

Dominican Republic—both conventions, 1923.

. Latvia—both conventions, 1924.
. Free City of Danzig—both conventions, 1924.

SHHNATIRwWNHH

It therefore will be seen that 18 countries have thus far joined
the Brussels conventions of 1886. In order to give consideration
to the question of having a larger number of countries adhere to
the exchange conventions, the committee on intellectual cooperation
of the League of Nations called together at Geneva in the summer
of 1924 a committee of experts on the international exchange of
publications, a brief report of which is given elsewhere.
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF PUBLI-
CATIONS, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

The committee on intellectual cooperation of the League of Na-
tions called together at Geneva July 17-19, 1924, a committee of
experts on the international exchange of publications, of which
Prof. O. de Halecki, of the University of Warsaw, was made chair-
man. Mr. H. W. Dorsey, chief clerk of the Institution, who has
been closely in touch with the exchange service for many years, was
sent as the Smithsonian representative. The other members of the
committee were Mr. J. Luchaire, Inspector General of Public Edu-
cation of France; Mr. E. Bacha, Director of the Belgian Service of
International Exchanges; Mr. V. Benedetti, Director of the Italian
Service of International Exchanges; and Mr. B. M. Headicar,
Librarian of the London School of Economics and Political Science.

The above committee, without making any change in the Brussels
convention of 1886, recommended an additional protocol, enabling
the states that are not yet parties to the convention to adhere
thereto with reservations. The resolutions of the committee of
experts regarding this matter are as follows:

The states which have not yet adhered to the convention of 1886 and might
consider the obligation carried in Article II as too burdensome, either on
account of the very great number of their official publications or on account of
their financial condition, or on any other ground, may accept the convention
with the reservation that they would agree with each nation as to the number
of publications to be sent. The exchange of those states with states that have
unreservedly adhered to the convention would be governed by the same
principle.

The Belgian Government is asked kindly to make a text of the foregoing
resolution known to the states parties to the convention of March 15, 1886.
These states will at the same time be informed that partial adhesions that
may occur under this resolution would be made known to them by the same
Government as fast as they took place, the said adhesions becoming com-
pulsory only as between the said parties that accepted them and the adhering
states.

All applications for partial adhesion would be made known to the Belgian
Government and notified by that Government to every one of the states parties
to the convention of 1886, including those who shall have been allowed to
give partial adhesion to that treaty, each one of the states being at the same
time requested to advise the said Government within one year after the date
of such notification whether, so far as it is concerned, it has accepted the
partial adhesion. Any state which shall not have notified its acceptance
within that time shall be considered as refusing to accept the adhesion.

These resolutions were brought to the attention of this Govern-
ment by the Belgian Government. The Department of State referred
the matter to the Smithsonian Institution, which replied that it saw
t REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85

no objection to the assent of this Government to the principle of
limited adhesions to the exchange convention of 1886. It was pointed
out, however, that as the principle of partial exchange of official
documents has been adopted by the United States Government, the
proposed reservations to the convention would not materially affect
the exchange conditions now existing between the United States and
other countries.

The committee of experts considered not only the possibility of im-
proving the exchange of official documents as referred to above, but
also the best way of encouraging the exchange of scientific and lit-
erary works. The committee’s recommendations are embodied in
the following extract from a draft convention:

ArTIcLE I. Independently of the obligations which might result for each of
them from the previous conventions relative to the exchange of publications,
the high contracting parties undertake to exchange, as fast as they are pub-
lished, at least one copy—

(a) All the current repertories of national bibliography of a general char-
acter.

(b) As far as possible documents of every kind giving information on the
recent acquisitions of their scientific libraries.

Arr. II. Each contracting State agrees to take all measures which it judges
desirable—

(a) In order to make easily accessible to all interested parties the lists
communicated to it according to Article [.

(6) In order to secure favorable consideration of all the proposals of ex-
change which might be addressed to it by all the contracting States with regard
to scientific or literary publications included in the above-mentioned lists.

Arr. III. To facilitate generally the exchange of works which are the most
important or most representative of the various types of national culture, the
high contracting parties shall collect or catalogue the publications received by
gift or otherwise which are available for international exchange. They will
publish from time to time a list of these works.

This list will also give the names of works existing in duplicate in libraries
which may be exchanged.

Art. IV. The high contracting parties undertake to encourage in every way
the multiplication of exchanges of scientific and literary publications, whether
State-subsidized or not, between academies and learned societies, universities,
and scientific institutions, as laid down in Article VII of the Convention of
1886.

Art. V. The high contracting parties undertake to publish annual reports on
the work of their exchange services. These reports shall be transmitted to the
committee on intellectual cooperation, which shall publish extracts therefrom,
together with a general report on the work of the international exchanges
during the period in question.

The text of the above draft convention was brought to the atten-
tion of this Government by the secretary general of the League of
Nations with the request that consideration be given to the feasi-

76041—26——7
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

bility of agreeing to it. The State Department referred the matter
to the Institution, which replied in part as follows:

While it is realized that the articles in the proposed new convention would
greatly facilitate the dissemination and interchange of published information
among the various countries, it is also realized that it would be impossible to
earry out their stipulations even partially without the expenditure of a con-
siderable sum of money annually. So far as the Smithsonian Institution is
concerned, it would be impossible to do so without a large increase in the
appropriation made to it for the support of the International Exchange Service.

The Smithsonian Institution is, therefore, not in a position to carry out
even partially the terms proposed in the new convention unless adequate addi-
tional funds were appropriated for the purpose. The Institution has, however,
always done everything in its power to promote this subject since it inaugu-
rated a system of international exchange in 1850, and believes that it might
be well for this country to consider again at a later and more favorable time
the question of adhering to the proposed convention.

The committee of experts also gave consideration to various other
matters looking to the improvement of the international exchange
service at large and the extension of its activities.

Respectfully submitted.

Assistant Secretary, in charge of Library and Exchanges.
Dr. Cuartes D. Watcort,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1925.

Mr. N. Hollister, superintendent of the park since 1916, died on
November 3, 1924, and was succeeded by Dr. Alexander Wetmore,
who served until April 1, 1925. On that date Doctor Wetmore was
appointed an assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and
the writer was honored by appointment as superintendent of the
park on May 18, 1925.

The appropriation made by Congress for the regular maintenance
of the park was $148,237. From the printing and binding appro-
priation of the Smithsonian Institution, $300 was allotted to the
National Zoological Park. A special appropriation of $38,250 was
made by Congress for laying a water main and installing two fire
hydrants in the park. This sum proved to be inadequate, and it was
necessary to allot money from the regular maintenance fund of the
park to complete the work.

As regards the collection, the year has not been a satisfactory one.
Many of the specimens in the park representing major types of ani-
mals are very old, and occasional deaths are beginning to thin their
ranks, as has been expected, which has resulted during the past year
in the loss of valuable specimens in several representative groups,
thus greatly diminishing the value of the collection.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts—One hundred and thirty animals were presented to the
park or placed there on indefinite deposit during the year. Notable
among these are the splendid young male chimpanzee and a pair of
turacous placed on deposit by Mr. Victor J. Evans, who maintains
a continual interest in the collection; a series of five valuable mon-
keys presented by Mr. and Mrs. E. R. Grant, of Washington, D. C.;
a Bateleur eagle, an Abyssinian falcon, and two South American
stone plover, by Mr. B. H. Swales; a brocket deer by Mr. P. W. Shu-
feldt, of Belize, British Honduras; a black bear by Mr. Fred N. Bent,
of De Leon Springs, Fla.; and a large monitor lizard by Capt.

Births —During the year 74 birds and mammals, hatched or born
at the park, were added to the collection. Among the mammals
were: Manchurian tiger, 3; plains wolf, 3; coyote, 5; European
brown bear, 4; Rocky Mountain sheep, 3; mouflon, 1; tahr, 2; Ameri-
can bison, 3; yak, 1; Indian buffalo, 1; black buck, 1; American elk,
1; red deer, 4; Barasingha deer, 1; Japanese deer, 4; fallow deer, 3;
hippopotamus, 1; grasshopper mouse, 5; rhesus monkey, 1; Javan
macaque, 1; Japanese macaque, 1; fiying phalanger, 1; great red
kangaroo, 3; rufous-bellied wallaby, 1; brush-tailed rock wallaby, 1.

The park was again fortunate in raising two blue geese (Chen
carulescens). Other birds hatched were as follows: Mute swan,
black duck, peafowl, silver gull, and black-crowned night heron.

Purchases, eachanges, and transfers—Only 91 specimens were
purchased during the year. Of these special mention should be made
of a De Brazza’s guenon, a serval, a pair of viscachas, an Arabian
gazelle, a llama, and a male gemsbok. The last named is a magnifi-
cent specimen, the second of its kind to be received at the park.
90 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

A small number of animals were received in exchange for surplus
stock from the collection.

The Biological Survey, United States Department of Agriculture,
transferred a number of animals taken by field agents of the bureau,
including some large western ravens, western porcupines, two sand-
hill cranes, and two whistling swans.

Deposits——Among the animals received on deposit, which repre-
sented species not exhibited in the collection, were a sarus crane, a
jabiru stork, and a pair of adjutants, deposited for a time by Mr.
Victor J. Evans. Of species placed on deposit which were new to
the park records, a lesser white-nosed guenon is especially notable.

REMOVALS

Forty-one birds and mammals were sent away in exchange to other
zoological gardens during the year. Among these were two elk, an
Indian buffalo, two American bison, six red deer, four Japanese deer,
and a llama.

Nine animals and birds on deposit were returned to their owners.

The average mortality among the animals remains low, despite
numerous losses during the year, chiefly among aged animals, long
on exhibition. These losses, however, have been very serious, as they
include a bull eland that had lived in the park since 1916, a Grant
zebra received in 1909, a Rocky Mountain sheep ram received in 1917,
Barbados sheep, reindeer, a wart hog, two lions, a male Axis deer,
an African leopard that had lived in the park since 1909, and an
African rhinoceros that had been in the collection only 18 months.
Most of these animals were the only representatives of their species
in the collection, and their loss creates gaps that can be filled only
by purchases involving expenditures of far more money than is
available.

Losses among reptiles are so heavy unless adequate arrangements
are made for their care, that it is useless to attempt to maintain a col-
lection in this group, except of a few hardy types, until proper quar-
ters are provided for them.

Post-mortem examinations of animals that died were made, when
desired, by the pathological division of the Bureau of Animal In-
dustry.

The following list shows the results of autopsies, the causes being
arranged in groups:

Compared with the previous year, a decrease in number of indi-
viduals is shown and compared with 1923, when there were 1,768
animals in the collection, a still greater decrease is noted. This is
due to continued losses in the aging stock, especially among the
larger forms. The number of forms represented exceeds that of
last year, an increase due to judicious selection and purchase of
small species offered at moderate prices.

Additional funds are urgently needed for purchase of animals to
fill the steadily increasing gaps in the groups of larger mammals.

VISITORS

The attendance record as determined by count and estimate ex-
ceeded that of the previous year by 75,385. The greatest attendance
for one month was 372,950, in April. The increase is highly grati-
fying as it indicates the keen interest of the general public in the
collections.

The attendance by months was as follows:

Schools, classes, and similar organizations, recorded among the
visitors, number 266, with a total of 20,890 individuals.
The highest attendance for a year recorded previously was
2,444,880 in 1924.
IMPROVEMENTS

The animal warehouse, 24 by 90 feet, with a small ell for a feed
room, the construction of which had been begun during the previous
year, was completed and put into service before the end of 1925.
This building is very useful, both as quarters for animals tempor-
arily not on exhibition, and as a reception house for animals just
arriving where they may rest before being placed on exhibition. It
will also be useful during the winter in storing birds which are ex-
hibited during the summer in the big flight cage and elsewhere, and
for which there is no room in the bird house.

A double bear cage of steel, each half 12 by 16 feet, with con-
crete shelter, has been erected to take the place of a large wooden
cage that was decayed beyond safety or justifiable repair.

The log dam of loose bowlders across Rock Creek at the head of
the American water-fowl pond to maintain a flow of water into the
pond, which had been repeatedly washed out by floods, was replaced
by a log dam faced with bowlders. The logs used were obtained
from chestnut trees in the park that had died from bark disease.

A concrete chimney was built on the restaurant. This building
still needs various improvements, especially the addition of a kitchen,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 99

as well as an inclosed room where visitors may lunch comfortably
in cold weather.

The bird house required repairs, as usual. Some of the cages
were in such bad condition that they had to be entirely replaced.
A new floor was laid in the feed room, and various minor repairs
made. The roof leaked badly and will require treatment during
the coming year.

The eland house, the zebra house, the fences about these, rub-
bish containers, outdoor benches, various inclosure fences, and other
ironwork were painted during the year.

WATER MAIN

One thousand five hundred and eighty feet of six-inch water main
was laid, and two fire hydrants installed, through a special ap-
propriation of $3,250, supplemented by funds taken from the general
appropriation.

NEEDS OF THE PARK

The need of the park for exhibition buildings is even more acute
than in previous years, as there has been tremendous growth in the
number of visitors and there is need for better conditions for exhibi-
tion. The most important and customary buildings required by a
zoological park are: Carnivore, pachyderm, primate, antelope, small
mammal, bird, and reptile houses. Of permanent structures, the
National Zoological Park has a primate house, a house to contain
one elephant, and one end of a carnivore house. All other build-
ings are old, without exception originally built as temporary make-
shifts and kept together only by continual and often expensive
repairs.

The building that shelters most of the birds, built 28 years ago,
was then intended to house the collections for three or four years,
until a suitable bird house could be constructed. This structure is
dark, with walls so decayed that they will no longer hold pebble-
dash, and provides entirely inadequate space for either the collection
of birds or the great numbers of visitors; it is not only unfit for its
present use but actually unsafe for its inmates.

There is no house for reptiles, always popular with visitors, and
none for small mammals. Such reptiles and small mammals as
are shown at the park are scattered about in places where it is in-
convenient to care for them, and where in some instances they
actually close the passages needed for visitors.

During a period of 35 years a collection of animals has been
assembled in the National Zoological Park which ranks among the
most notable in this country. Adequate buildings to replace the
100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

present obsolete quarters should be provided to house properly the
living animals, to maintain them in health, and to exhibit them
to the more than two million visitors who come annually to view
them.

FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF ANIMALS

The collection at the National Zoological Park is augmented each
year by various gifts, and through unusual success in the breeding
and rearing of animals, the park has been able to exchange speci-
mens with other zoological parks so that it has maintained a rea-
sonably well-balanced collection of the living animals of the world,
always lacking, however, representatives of certain important and
interesting species. For instance, there has never been a giraffe
at the park. There is no rhinoceros, no pigmy hippopotamus, and
no Indian elephant. Such animals as these, when offered to the
park can not be considered owing to the entirely inadequate fund
for the purchase of animals, and opportunities are frequently lost
to fill definite gaps in the collection, as well as to replace species
lost through death, by the purchase of most desirable animals that
are offered for sale.

An increased appropriation to cover cost and transportation of
animals has been requested, but it seems advisable also to repeat the
suggestion made in previous reports that an animal purchase fund
be inaugurated and deposited with the Smithsonian Institution.

REVENUES OF THE PARK

A zoological park itself is not expected to finance the refresh-
ment of visitors. There are in the National Zoological Park, how-
ever, as in other parks, a refreshment stand and a restaurant which
are rented to private parties. The money from these concessions,
under present regulations, goes to the United States Treasury and
can not be used for the park, although repairs and other costs in
connection with the restaurant must be borne by the park. It is
earnestly recommended that the revenues from the restaurant con-
cession, which serves only to benefit the public, be turned into the
animal fund of the park instead of into the general fund of the
Treasury. Such is the established practice in other parks, munici-
pal and otherwise, which often derive considerable funds for the
purchase of animals from such concessions.

Respectfully submitted. .

W. M. Mann, Superintendent.

Dr. Cuaries D. Waucort,

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the
following passage of the independent offices appropriation act ap-
proved June 7, 1924:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assistants,
purchase of necessary books and periodicals, appuratus, making necessary ob-
servations in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, and miscel-
laneous expenses, $21,580.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within
an inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian ad-
ministration building at Washington, a cement observing station and
frame cottage for observers on a plot of 10,000 square feet leased
from the Carnegie Solar Observatory on Mount Wilson, Calif., and
also a solar observing station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., erected
in 1920 at the expense of private funds contributed by Mr. John A.
Roebling, of Bernardsville, N. J.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory owned by the Government is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace
the outfit for the purposes of the investigation.

WORK OF THE YEAR

Solar variation and forecasting—The chief object of the work
at present is to secure the most exact measurements of the variation
of the sun in order to provide proper data for studying the influ-
ence of solar changes on weather conditions of the United States
and the whole world. Accordingly, the efforts of the staff were de-
voted mainly to this purpose. The Government appropriations
were sufficient only to maintain the work at Washington and Ari-
zona, and to pay salaries of two observers at the exceptionally favor-
able station at Montezuma, Chile. This station was established in
1918, and has been maintained ever since by private funds of the
Institution, supplemented by gifts of Mr. Roebling. Owing to fur-
ther support by Mr. Roebling, it has been possible to receive daily
telecrams reporting the solar radiation observations in Chile and
in Arizona. These arrive at Washington within 24 hours of the
observations in the field.

76041—26—_8 101
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

The experimental forecasts by Mr. H. H. Clayton for the city of
New York, mentioned in last year’s report, were continued. For
this purpose daily telegrams of the condition of the sun were sent
from Washington to Mr. Clayton at Canton, Mass. These usually
reached him before noon on the day after the observations were
made in Chile and Arizona. Making up his New York forecasts
for three, four, and five days ahead, Mr. Clayton informed the
Smithsonian by letter on the same afternoon. On Friday of each
week he forecast the temperature departures for the ensuing week
beginning Sunday, and about the end of each month he forecast
the temperature departures for the ensuing month. These weekly
and monthly forecasts were elso mailed in advance to the Smith-
sonian Institution.

We have compared Clayton’s forecasts with the events, using
mathematical processes of verification which are not susceptible of
personal bias. A moderate degree of foreknowledge is certainly in-
dicated, both for the specific forecasts of three, four, and five days
-in advance, and for the more general average forecasts of weeks
and months.

On May 2, 1925, a symposium on this subject was held at the
United States Weather Bureau before the American Meteorological
Society. At that time, Messrs. C. G. Abbot and H. H. Clayton ex-
plained the status of the measurements of solar variation, and their
applications for forecasting. Later, these papers of Abbot and
Clayton, and also a paper by Mr. G. Hoxmark, on the results
reached since 1922 in the application of solar variation for official
forecasts in Argentina, were published as Nos. 5, 6, and 7, of Volume
77, Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

The costs of telegraphic advices and of Mr. Clayton’s computing
bureau have been borne by Mr. Roebling’s gifts for these purposes,
as also the cost of publication of the papers just mentioned.

No public forecasts have been made or will be made under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. Our entire purpose in
the matter is, and has always been, to make such experiments as
might indicate what value, if any, would attach to the introduction
of a new variable, namely, the variation of the sun, in weather fore-
casting. Our forecasts are made privately and only as tests of the
experimental conclusions.

Unfortunately, space writers in the public prints have not under-
stood this and have attributed to the Smithsonian Institution fore-
casts of weather conditions far into the future. These, in reality,
have been made by several private individuals entirely unconnected
with the Institution. We take no responsibility for these prognos-
tications, as we know as yet of no sound method by which they may

A compilation of all results on the solar constant of radiation,
from 1918 to November, 1924, was published as No. 3 of Volume 77,
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

The investigations hitherto made having indicated that a higher
degree of accuracy in our solar measurements is needed to supply
proper data for forecasting purposes, a very great deal of attention
has been given to the elimination of small sources of error in the
observations and reductions of solar radiation, Already the average
deviation of individual days’ results between Chile and Arizona is
but one-half per cent. It follows that in order to attain higher ac-
curacy we shall be obliged to regard sources of error which formerly
we supposed would always be negligible.

This has led to the designing and construction of new apparatus
for use in pyrheliometry, which eliminates the employment of the
observer’s watch altogether. It has also required the investigation
of the infra-red and ultra-violet portions of the solar spectrum, be-
yond the usual limits of our daily spectrum observations. Still
more important, it has led to a complete revision of the methods
of measuring and reducing solar energy spectra. With these new
modifications in mind, a complete re-reduction of all solar radiation
work since the beginning of the year 1922 has been undertaken, and
occupies the whole force at Washington.

Removal of Mount Harqua Hala station—The station at Mount
Harqua Hala, Ariz., first occupied in 1920, proves to be too far to
the east, so that the summer months there are unsuitable for ob-
serving, because of the atmospheric conditions which go to bring
about the severe thunderstorms of Arizona. Very few days of June,
July, and August have been suitable for our exacting work, and even
some of the spring months have been marred by long-continued
haziness. Had weather conditions there been first-rate, the ob-
servers would gladly have suffered the excessive isolation of the
place, which is almost wholly cut off from relaxations, but to make
such a sacrifice fruitlessly is indeed very depressing,

Accordingly, investigations have been made which have fixed on a
better site, both as regards weather conditions and comfort. ‘This is
chosen on Table Mountain, within the bounds of the Los Angeles
County Park, about 30 miles northeast of Mount Wilson. Lying on
the edge of the Mojave Desert, at 7,500 feet elevation, the weather
observations indicate very decided improvement over Harqua Hala
for our purpose. Add to this the conyenience of access and pleas-
ant surroundings and we have combined there great. advantages.

Mr. John A. Roebling has added to his already great gifts sufli-
cient means to enable necessary buildings to be erected on Table
Mountain, and to remove the observing outfit thence from Harqua
104 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

Hala. The supervisors of the Los Angeles County Park have cor-
dially assisted in the transfer, giving rights of occupancy, and ex-
tending the auto road quite to the doors of the proposed observatory,
without expense to the Smithsonian Institution. It is expected to
occupy Table Mountain beginning about October 1, 1925. Mr.
Moore’s energetic efforts in the preliminary arrangements and the
preparation of buildings deserve high praise.

An expedition under Doctor Abbot occupied Mount Wilson in the
summer and autumn of 1924. The solar cooker was rebuilt, as far
as concerned its oven, its circulatory system for hot oil, and its in-
sulation against heat losses. The new oil system was perfectly suc-
cessful in avoiding all leaks, such as always hitherto have marred
the operations. Also, the introduction of a larger reservoir, and
especially of “Silocel,” or diatomaceous bricks, for heat insulation
proved highly satisfactory. The experiment was tried of intro-
ducing forced oil circulation by means of a little steam engine
operated by the heat of the reservoir. This worked well mechani-
cally, but proved unnecessary, as no higher temperatures of the
oven were reached when forced circulation was in operation.

It was intended to use a vacuum jacket about the heater tube, but
the apparatus was not received in season. Without this crowning
improvement the solar cooker worked fully as well as in 1920, when
its reputation was first made, despite the fact that somewhat thicker
insulation of the reservoir is needed, as the cooling curve shows.
When this, and also the vacuum jacket, are applied, the machine
should be highly satisfactory.

As noted in last year’s report, the Fabry type of apparatus has
been installed on Mount Wilson to measure the quantity of atmos-
pherie ozone. This feeble constituent of the very high air is, we
believe, very important in the economy of the earth’s heat, as well
as a fatal bar to observation of the most interesting part of the
spectra of the sun and the hotter stars.

Having fully developed and tested the ozone outfit, photographic
solar spectra of the ozone-absorption region of the ultra-violet were
obtained in August, September, and October, 1925. Unfortunately
the great forest fire east of Mount Wilson cut off a good many other-
wise favorable days. By the generosity of Mr. Roebling a copy of
the Moll spectrophotometer for measuring the plates has been pro-
cured from A. Hilger. The reductions are not yet made. Mr.
Roebling’s interest in this ozone research is so great that he has
made a grant to enable Doctor Fabry himself to continue daily
ozone measurements in France during a part of the year 1925.

The importance of studies of the variation of the sun’s output of
ultra-violet rays grows upon our attention. Not only the attack
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 105

on the ozone problem in that spectral region, but also the extraordi-
nary relations of the ultra-violet rays to human, animal, and plant
physiology are coming increasingly to the fore. Our own studies
indicate that the solar variations are far greater for those rays than
they are for the solar rays as a whole. ‘Thus the accompanying fig-
ure indicates that when the solar constant of radiation changes by
1 per cent it means almost imperceptible change for the infra-red
rays, but as much as 10 per cent or more for some rays of the ultra-
violet.

In addition to the work at Mount Wilson on the solar cooker and
the ozone of the higher atmosphere, much attention was paid to

Solar variation localized in the violet and ultra-violet

attempts to improve the radiometer and the stellar-spectrum appa-
ratus, in the hope of going much further in studying the energy
spectra of the stars. Much knowledge was gained which will be
useful later on, and star-spectrum observations were made on sev-
eral nights, but no actually completed advance in stellar spectra
was attained. The way, however, is very clear now for future

advance.
PERSONNEL

Mr. H. B. Freeman accepted service on the private Smithsonian
roll as assistant at Harqua Hala in September, 1924, and succeeded
Mr. L. B. Aldrich in charge at Montezuma on March 1, 1925. Mr.
Aldrich returned to Washington.
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

Mr. E. E. Smith was employed on the private roll as assistant at
Harqua Hala from February 9, 1925.

Mr. A. J. Ahearn assisted Doctor Abbot on Mount Wilson aii
the expedition of 1924.

SUMMARY

Much progress in the study of the variation of the sun and its ap-
plication to weather forecasting has been made, as reported in pub-
lications Nos. 5, 6, and 7 of Volume 77, Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections. Improvements in apparatus and methods de-
signed to add to the accuracy of solar radiation measurements, and
to make possible a valuable revision of existing values, are on foot.
The station at Harqua Hala, having proved somewhat disappointing,
is being removed to Table Mountain, in California, about 2,000 feet
higher, but much more accessible. The solar cooker has been greatly
improved. Measurements of atmospheric ozone are in progress.
‘New devices were tried in stellar energy spectrum measurements and
the way seems clear for great advances in that line.

APPENDIX 8

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the op-
erations of the United States Regional Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1925:

As has been stated in previous annual reports, actual publication
of the catalogue was suspended in 1921 upon completion of the
fourteenth annual issue. In conformity with an agreement reached
at the International Convention held in Brussels in 1922, the work
of this regional bureau, in common with others of the organization,
has been continued but is confined to the collection of the data neces-
sary to index the current scientific literature of the United States
for the several years intervening between the cessation of publica-
tion and the present time. This procedure not only enables the
organization to be kept intact but, when publication is resumed and
the classification schedules are revised, data will be available to
complete the catalogue.

It seems advisable to again outline the aim, scope, and need of
the catalogue in view of the fact that the many new projects which
have sprung up in minor fields, lacking harmony of purpose and co-
operation of effort, have, even when taken collectively, entirely failed
to supply the need of an International Catalogue of Scientific
Literature.

The catalogue was started in 1901 with the aim and purpose of
meeting the long-felt need of scientific investigators and librarians
for an annual authors’ and subject catalogue and index to the scien-
tific literature of the world, a need felt even more to-day than in 1901.
To this end, systematic classification schedules were prepared cover-
ing all recognized branches of science and each paper was not only
catalogued and indexed, but also classified by means of these sched-
ules, the result being equivalent to an analytical digest of each
paper.

Financial support to enable the organization to properly function
is urgent. The amount required is not great, measured in present-
day terms, but is none the less essential. Between 1901 and the
beginning of the war, necessary funds for publication were supplied
by subscribers in the countries taking part in the enterprise. Only
the actual cost of printing and publishing had to be met from these

107
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

funds as maintenance of the several regional bureaus was then, as
now, provided for, in most cases, by direct governmental grants.
However, the additional funds needed to meet the increased cost of
printing and publishing, under war conditions, had to be met by
the subscribers and these increases when expressed in the depreciated
currency of many countries, resulted in impossible figures; conse-
quently, publication had to be suspended.

When operations began in 1901, the price to subscribers of a
complete set of the 17 annual volumes of the catalogue, com-
prising about 10,000 pages, was £17, the pound sterling being then
at par. The American subscription price was, after adding ship-
ping costs, $85. The income derived from subscriptions and the
expenditures of the London Central Bureau, in charge of printing
and publishing, approximately balanced in 1914, when war began.
Since that time publishing costs, in England, have doubled and
the value of the French france has sunk to less than one-fourth,
and the Italian lira to less than one-fifth of their respective par
values. Without tabulation, it is obvious that a cost easily borne
in these countries in 1901 has become impossible in 1925. It was
never the intention for the International Catalogue to be a com-
mercial enterprise, but rather the means of furnishing, at cost, to
investigators and students data needed to keep them informed of the
scientific progress of the world. Experience proves that inter-
national cooperation is the only means whereby the necessary data
can be collected and prepared for such an index, but it is now
apparent that some new source of revenue must be provided to print
this data before publication can be resumed.

Could a sufficient endowment be obtained, the organization would
again become self-supporting, as there is now a greater demand
for the catalogue than ever before and a central bureau provided
with its own publishing plant, or capital sufficient to make advan-
tageous long-term contracts with properly equipped publishing
houses, would be enabled to offset the increased cost of publication
by the saving of the interest and other charges, which were neces-
sary in 1901 to an organization doing business without capital. If
it were possible to secure such an endowment in the United States,
now the only country not unduly oppressed by the results of war,
American students and investigators would be much benefited for,
notwithstanding impoverished conditions, much advanced and valu-
able scientific work is being done abroad with which it is difficult
to keep in touch without the annual volumes of the International
Catalogue.

Assistant in Charge.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1925.

CHANGES IN STAFF

During the year there were several changes in the library staff.
Mr. Paul Brockett, who had been connected with the Smithsonian
Institution for 38 years and had served since 1902 as its assistant
librarian, resigned to devote full time to his duties as assistant sec-
retary of the National Academy of Sciences. Mr. Brockett’s suc-
cessor, Mr. William L. Corbin, formerly professor of English in
Boston University, assumed the position of librarian on Septem-
ber 15.

Mr. Newton P. Scudder, assistant librarian of the United States
National Museum, retired from active service March 9, on account
of age and disability, and died May 19. Mr. Scudder became con-
nected with the Smithsonian Institution in 1882, where he remained
for more than 40 years, the last 38 of which he was assistant libra-
rian of the National Museum. Perhaps never again will the
Museum library have as its reference chief a person so fully ac-
quainted with its collections as he was, or so willing to give of his
knowledge and time to those who came with questions.

Mr. Lester D. Condit, assistant in the library since 1918, was
granted a furlough in October to resume his university course. He
has since withdrawn from the library staff and the position was
filled by the appointment of Miss Sara L. Young, a graduate of
Elmira College and of Drexel Institute Library School. Miss
Young has worked with scientific publications for many years,
especially as cataloguer for the American Philosophical Society and
the Library of Congress.

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

The increase of the Smithsonian Library is due chiefly to the
exchange of publications between the Smithsonian Institution and
other learned institutions and societies of the world. Many of

109
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

these publications come to the library direct, others through the
International Exchange Service, with which the library is in close
cooperation. During the past year the library received 30,496 pack-
ages by mail and 2,408 through the exchanges. Especially large
sendings were received from Barcelona, Budapest, and Warsaw. As
usual, after these packages had been opened, the items were stamped,
entered, and sent to the appropriate branches of the library. The
large number received was due partly to the special effort made by
the periodical and correspondence divisions in noting wants and
writing follow-up letters. In fact, most of the 1,181 letters sent
out by the library had to do with these wants. The result was that
of the 2,478 missing volumes and parts requested, 2,009 were ob-
tained, a gain of nearly 30 per cent over last year. Exchange rela-
tions were also opened with a number of new societies.

MAIN LIBRARY

Many of the items mentioned above were, of course, forwarded
day by day to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress,
where they were made available to the public. The number of these
was 7,287, of which there were 5,184 complete volumes, 1,421 parts
of volumes, 390 pamphlets, and 292 charts. Documents of foreign
governments, more or less statistical in character, to the number of
7,408, were also sent, without being stamped or entered, to the
document division of the Library of Congress.

Dissertations were received from various universities at home and
abroad, such as Basel, Berlin, Bern, Breslau, Copenhagen, Cornell,
Dresden, Erlangen, Frankfurt a. M., Freiburg, Ghent, Giessen,
Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Helsingfors, Leipzig, Leyden, Lund,
Marburg, Paris, Pennsylvania, Strasbourg, Tiibingen, Uppsala,
Utrecht, and Ziirich; and from technical schools at Berlin, Delft,
Karlsruhe, and Ziirich.

OFFICE LIBRARY

The office library, which includes the publications of several
learned societies, the aeronautical collection, the art-room collection,
the employees’ library, and various books, chiefly of a reference
nature, in the administrative offices, was increased during the year
by 312 volumes, 5 parts of volumes, and 4 pamphlets. Of these, 34
were added to the aeronautical collection.

One of the most important additions to this library was a de luxe
copy of the Warner Library of the World’s Best Literature, the gift
of Secretary Walcott; another was Seven Log-Books Concerning the
Arctic Voyages of Capt. William Scoresby, sr., of Whitby, Eng-
land, presented by the Explorers Club of New York.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Ft

The circulation of the library was 2,359, of which 1,956 were
magazines borrowed from the reading room. Many more volumes
and periodicals were consulted in the reference room. ‘The books
most in demand were the transactions of the learned societies, the
aeronautical collection, and several important individual works, such
as Combarelles aux Ezyies, by Abbé Breuil and others, a book finally
assigned to the Smithsonian deposit.

The work done during the year on the general catalogue of the
Smithsonian library, which is kept in the office reading room, may
be summarized as follows:

MUSEUM LIBRARY

The library of the United States National Museum contains 65,148
volumes and 102,951 pamphlets, a total of 168,099. Of these, 1,457
volumes and 1,894 pamphlets were added during the year.

While most of these accessions were obtained by exchange of
publications, or by purchase, many came by gift. Among the donors
were Mr. W. I. Adams, Miss M. D. Ashton, Dr. Marcus Benjamin,
Mr. A. H. Clark, Mr. F. W. Clarke, Dr. W. H. Dall, Mr. J. A. Gal-
lagher, Mr. L. C. Gunnell, Dr. O. P. Hay, Dr. W. H. Holmes, Dr. A.
Hrdlitka, Dr. W. R. Maxon, Dr. G. S. Miller, jr., Mr. W. de C.
Ravenel, Dr. C. W. Richmond, Mr. S. A. Rohwer, Mr. E. V. Shan-
non, Mr. R. C. Smith, Mr. B. H. Swales, and Dr. C. D. Walcott. The
gifts of Secretary Walcott to the division of geology and paleontol-
ogy and of Doctor Dall to that of mollusks were generous, as usual,
the latter numbering 97 titles. The gifts of Doctor Richmond to
the division of birds were also large. But the outstanding gift of
the year was the entomological library, numbering about 4,500
volumes and pamphlets, chiefly on Coleoptera, left to the Museum by
the late Col. Thomas L. Casey, and increased by the generosity
of Mrs. Casey. This is one of the best collections on its subject in
the United States, and contains many rare items. It will be made
available to the curators as soon as possible and will be deposited in
the section of insects.

In the course of the year several thousand cards of the Concilium
Bibliographicum were filed, 14,329 parts of periodicals were en-
tered, 2,623 volumes and pamphlets were catalogued, and 9,000 cards
were added. Books borrowed from the Library of Congress num-
bered 1,628 and from other libraries 112, chiefily for the use of the
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

curators, and about the same number were returned. The loans
totaled 8,148, of which 5,861 were made to the sectional libraries, and
more than ever before to universities, such as Chicago, Illinois, Michi-
gan, and Minnesota, and to other institutions, both in Washington
und elsewhere. Many publications were consulted in the reference
room, not only by members of the Museum staff but also by others,
especially Government employees and scholars connected with various.
universities and museums, American and foreign. Two hundred
and fifty-six volumes were bound.

The number of sectional libraries in the Museum is now 38. These,
while under the immediate care of the administrative and scientific |
staffs, are at the same time very real and important parts of the
general library and are administered as such. Their resources are
its resources, and their needs are its needs. And these needs are
often most urgent—the very ones to which the librarian feels he
should give his best thought and help. The past year he has devoted
much time to the study of these resources and needs, and to the
solution of the problems they have disclosed. The sectional libraries
are as follows:

Administration. Mechanical technology.
Administrative assistant’s office. Medicine.

American archeology. Mineral technology.
Anthropology. Minerals.

Biology. Mollusks.

Birds. National Gallery of Art.
Botany. Old World archeology.
Echinoderms. Organic chemistry.
Eiditor’s office. Paleobotany.

Ethnology. Photography.

Fishes. Physical anthropology.
Foods. Property clerk’s office.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphic arts. Superintendent's office.
History. Taxidermy.

Insects. Textiles.

Invertebrate paleontology. Vertebrate paleontology.
Mammals. War library.

Marine invertebrates. Wood technology.

TECHNOLOGICAL LIBRARY

The technological library, the division of the Museum Library
which contains the collections of especial interest to the curators of
arts and industries, is located in the Old Museum Building. Dur-
ing the year the reorganization of its material was continued. Its
accessions numbered 152 volumes and 353 pamphlets, and its loans
150.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY | agli

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

Additions to the library of the Astrophysical Observatory num-
bered 114 volumes, 32 parts of volumes, and 89 pamphlets. The
number of volumes bound was 81. Exact records of loans can not
be given, as they are included with those of the office library.

This is one of the most important of the smaller branches of the
Smithsonian library and is much in use. Thanks to the generosity of
a friend, its collections will be enlarged and made more available in
the immediate future.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The activities of the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology
are described in the report of the chief of that bureau, by whom
the library is administered.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

As the National Gallery of Art is housed in the Natural History
Building, its library is at present administered as a sectional library
of the National Museum. This library, although possessing only 961
titles, of which 426 are volumes and 5385 pamphlets, has been most
carefully selected, and should grow rapidly when given room in the
National Gallery Building now in prospect. Its accessions during
the year were 118 volumes, 478 parts of volumes, and 52 pamphlets.

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art is solely a reference
library, restricted to the interests represented in the collections of art
objects—that is to say, to the arts and cultures of the Far East, of
India and Persia, and the nearer east; to the life and works of
James McNeill Whistler and of certain other American painters
whose pictures are owned by the gallery; and further, to a very
limited degree, to that field of study represented by the Biblical
manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries, which, as the posses-
sions of the Freer Gallery, are known as the Washington manu-
scripts. AJl books and library facilities are at the service of the
public. During the year 200 persons availed themselves of these
privileges. Most of the more serious students came from a distance
for the especial purpose of studying various parts of the collections
and the books relating to them.

The library comprises about 2,200 books in English, French, Ger-
man, and Dutch and almost 300 in Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan,
with necessary dictionaries. In addition, there are a good many
volumes on loan from the Library of Congress. During the year
90 volumes and 127 pamphlets were added to the library.
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

Early in the year the cataloguing of the library of the National
Zoological Park was completed, and its duplicates and other super-
fluous material were removed. Its accessions, including the old items
which had been in the library for some time but which had never
been entered, were 475 volumes, 1 part, and 2 pamphlets.

SUMMARY OF ACCESSIONS

The accessions for the year, with the exception of those to the
library of the Bureau of American Ethnology, may be summarized
as follows:

An estimate of the number of volumes, pamphlets, and-charts in
the Smithsonian library (including the Smithsonian deposit in the

This number does not include the many thousands of parts of
volumes now in the library awaiting completion of the volumes.

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

Besides carrying on the usual work of the year, the library staff
gave as much time as possible to special problems, such as sorting
accumulations of miscellaneous material in different parts of the
library; bringing together superfluous duplicates and separates to
be disposed of later by gift or by piece for piece exchange; inven-
torying the sectional libraries; making shelf lists for the two divi-
sions of the Museum library; advancing the cataloguing of several
of the special collections, particularly the Iddings, Gill, and Knab;
furthering the cause of science by making part of the Lacoe collec-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY tig

tion available for semipermanent deposit with colleges, universities,
and museums; and responding to many requests involving reference
work for various Government departments and for institutions and
individuals the country over.

Furthermore, the librarian made an extensive survey of the con-
dition of the library and submitted a detailed report of its needs to
the secretary. This survey revealed many problems pressing for
solution, problems that can be solved only by a liberal increase,
over a term of years, of the funds appropriated for library purposes.
These increased funds should be at hand at the earliest possible
moment, to the end that more than 8,000 volumes may be bound;
that more than 30,000 books and pamphlets, including several almost
priceless collections, may be accessioned and catalogued; that a dic-
tionary catalogue of the entire hbrary (including the sectional
libraries), except, of course, the Smithsonian deposit, may be made;
and that other urgent pieces of work connected with the reorgani-
zation and development of the library may be done—in a word, that
the rich collections of the library may, by a more complete applica-
tion of modern methods, be made available without undue delay to
scientific workers, both in Washington and elsewhere. Then and
then only will the library be ready to do its full part toward the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.

APPENDIX 10
REPORT ON THE PUBLICATIONS

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the publi-
cations of the Smithsonian Institution and its branches during the
year ending June 30, 1925:

The Institution proper published during the year 12 papers in the
series of Miscellaneous Collections, 2 annual reports and pamphlet
copies of 48 articles in the general appendixes to these reports, and
6 special publications. The Bureau of American Ethnology pub-
lished 1 bulletin and 2 annual reports. The United States National
Museum issued 1 annual report, 2 volumes of proceedings, 2 com-
plete bulletins, 1 part of a bulletin, 3 parts of 2 volumes in the
series of Contributions from the United States National Herbarium,
and 66 separates from the proceedings. The National Gallery of
Art issued four catalogues of special exhibitions.

Of these publications there were distributed during the year
171,865 copies, which inclnded 262 volumes and separates of the
Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, 24,008 volumes and sepa-
rates of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 26,825 volumes
and separates of the Smithsonian annual reports, 6,102 Smithsonian
special publications, 104,596 volumes and separates of the various
series of National Museum publications, 7,354 publications of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, 114 publications of the National
Gallery of Art, 68 volumes of the Annals of the Astrophysical Ob-
servatory, 44 reports on the Harriman Alaska expedition, 1,057 re-
ports of the American Historical Association, and 1,485 publications
presented to but not issued directly by the Smithsonian Institution
or its branches.

SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS

Of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, volume 69, 1 paper

All payments are made by check, signed by the Secretary of the
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account. In some instances
deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collection and later
are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven satisfactory. During the year the interest derived from
this source, together with other similar items, has resulted in a total
of $1,610.15.

The following appropriations for the Government bureaus under
the administrative charge of the Smithsonian Institution were made

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE
30, 1925

ANNUAL MEETING DECEMBER 11, 1924

Present: The Hon. William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United
States, chancellor; Senator Reed Smoot; Senator George Wharton
Pepper; Representative Albert Johnson; Representative R. Walton
Moore; the Hon. George Gray; the Hon. Henry White; Mr. Charles
F. Choate, jr.; Mr. Robert S. Brookings; Mr. Frederic A. Delano;
and the secretary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.

DEATH OF SENATOR LODGE

The secretary announced the death, on November 9, 1924, of
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, who was first appointed a Regent on
January 6, 1890, as a Member of the House of Representatives, serv-
ing until January 25, 1893; and again as a Member of the Senate,
on December 7, 1905, serving continuously until his death, aggregat-
ing a total of 22 years as a member of the board.

The following resolutions were then adopted:

Whereas, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, having
learned with profound sorrow of the death, on November 9, 1924, of Henry
Cabot Lodge, United States Senator from Massachusetts and a Regent of
the Institution for 22 years: Be it

Resolved, That the board desire to record here their sense of the irrepar-
able loss sustained by the Institution in the passing away of their distin-
guished colleague, whose keen, constructive interest in the affairs of the
Institution led him to place his broad knowledge and large experience at
its service at all times. Senator Lodge’s fame as a scholar, citizen, and
statesman is too well known to require mention here. He was an outstanding
figure in the Nation, and his death is deeply deplored.

Resolved, That these resolutions be spread upon the records of the board
and that a copy thereof be transmitted to our late associate’s family.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS

The secretary announced that under date of December 2, the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate had appointed Senator Reed Smoot
as a Regent to succeed Senator Lodge, deceased.

Also that he had received the resignation of Senator McCormick
as a Regent, which he had transmitted to the President pro tempore
of the Senate who had appointed Senator George Wharton Pepper
to fill the vacancy on December 8.

130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

The board adopted a resolution providing for the expenditure in
the usual manner of the income of the Institution during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1926.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRY

The secretary brought before the board a petition from the Na-
tional Museum of Engineering and Industry, urging the setting
aside of a specified plot of ground south of the Smithsonian Build-
ing on which to erect a museum building; adding that the matter
had received the attention of the executive committee.

A full discussion upon the various phases of the proposed project
ensued, after which the board adopted resolutions expressing its
sympathy with the proposal and its willingness to take definite
steps when sufficient funds to cover the initial cost involved had
been deposited with the Smithsonian Institution by the National
Museum of Engineering and Industry.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The secretary submitted in printed form the annual report of the
executive committee, showing the financial condition of the Institu-
tion at the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1924.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE

Solar radiation researches.—This work has been conducted for several
years by Assistant Secretary Abbot at stations on Montezuma Mountain, Chile,
and on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz. The operations are financed by an annual
grant of $5,000 from the Hodgkins fund of the Smithsonian Institution and
through the generosity of a public-spirited citizen, Mr. John A. Roebling.

Freer sinking fund.—The permanent committee’s last report mentions the
establishment of a sinking fund for the purpose of safeguarding the principal
and income of the Freer Foundation for Oriental Art. Under it the income
of the Freer bequest in excess of 6 per cent on the value of the foundation at
the time of Mr. Freer’s death is to be reinvested in high-class securities and
real-estate mortgages until an amount equal to the original foundation is
reached. The amount thus invested to date is $153,463.75.

Consolidated fund.—Under the organic act the sum authorized to be depos-
ited in the United States Treasury at 6 per cent interest as the “ Smithson
fund” is limited to $1,000,000. This limit was reached in 1917, and bequests,
gifts, and interest earnings in excess of this amount have been constituted a
consolidated fund, which is invested in securities approved by your permanent
committee. This fund now totals $213,386.50.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The fourth annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Commission was
held December 9, 1924.

The annual report of the secretary of the commission for 1924 calls attention
to the installation during the year of a collection of World War portraits in
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 131

the Natural History Building. A list recently made of the portraits in oil and
pastel now in possession of the Institution and in part available for assem-
blage in the portrait gallery, numbers upward of 400,

The desirability of improving the standard of the portraits of personages of
national distinction, which in time might be included in the National Portrait
Gallery, was considered, but no definite action was taken.

The preliminary plans for the proposed National Gallery Building as pre-
pared by Mr. Platt, the architect, were considered.

The very important problem of the inclusion in the building of collections
both of art and history received attention, and the view prevailed that it would
be advantageous, at least for a time, to have the two in the same building
but distinctly separated.

The chairman submitted the resignation of Mr. Edwin H. Blashfield, and it
was voted to recommend Mr. E. ©. Tarbell to the Board of Regents as his
successor.

The secretary of the commission announced the expiration of the three-year
terms of the following members of the commission: Messrs. John H. Lodge,
James Parmelee, and E. W. Redfield, and their election for four years was
recommended by the commission.

Then followed the reelection of the present officers of the commission and
also of the members of the executive and advisory committees for the ensuing
year.

On motion, the board accepted the report and adopted the following
resolution :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
accepts with regret the resignation of Mr. E. H. Blashfield as a member of the
National Gallery of Art Commission: elects Mr. Edmund ©. Tarbell for the
remainder of Mr. Blashfield’s term, namely, to December 14, 1927; reelects
Messrs. John E. Lodge, James Parmelee, BH. W. Redfield, and Mr. Daniel Chester
French as members for the full term of four years.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

In submitting his annual report of the operations of the Institu-
tion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1924, the secretary said that
since the last annual meeting of the Rezents on December 13, 1923, a
total of 110 publications have been issued by the Institution and the
Government branches in its administrative charge. Of this num-
ber 40 were issued by the Institution, 67 by the ‘National Museum,
and 3 by the Bureau of American Ethnology. It is by means of
these various series of publications, together with exhibits, lectures,
radio talks, and correspondence, that the Institution carries out one
of its primary objects, the “diffusion of knowledge among men.”
The publications are distributed free to libraries, scientific and edu-
cational institutions, and ‘interested individuals throughout the
world.

The Smithsonian Annual Report continues to attract widespread
popular interest. These reports have been issued two years late
since the World War, but Congress has provided an additional
amount to enable the Institution to bring out two in one year, and at
the present time the report for 1923 is SA for paging and all the
galleys of the report for 1924 have been received from the printer.
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

ADJOURNED MEETING, JANUARY 5, 1925

Present: The Hon. William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United
States, chancellor; Senator Reed Smoot; Senator A. Owsley Stanley ;
Representative Albert Johnson; Representative R. Walton Moore;
Representative Walter H. Newton; Mr. Robert S. Brookings; Mr.
Frederic A. Delano; and the secretary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The secretary read a letter from Mr. John E. Lodge expressing the
grateful acknowledgment of his family for the resolutions adopted
by the Board of Regents on December 11, 1924, on the death of his
father, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a Regent of the Institution.

INCREASE OF ENDOWMENT

The executive committee reported that it had carefully considered
a plan submitted by a New York firm for increasing the endowment
of the Institution, and had received the opinion of the Attorney Gen-
eral that there was no legal impediment in the way of engaging the

firm for this purpose.
The board adopted a resolution giving the permanent committee

power to act in the matter.

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON PLANS FOR NEW BUILDING FOR NA-
TIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Mr. Delano read the following report:

To the Board of Regents.

GENTLEMEN: Your committee appointed by the board on February 14, 1924,
for the purpose of collaborating with the architect in the preparation of plans
for the proposed National Gallery of Art Building, met at the Smithsonian
Institution on October 28, 1924.

Mr. Charles A. Platt, the architect, who had recently returned from a tour
of the art galleries abroad, submitted preliminary sketch plans for the build-
ing. These comprised plans of the three floors with sections, and a detailed
drawing of the south front. Plans of a number of European galleries, drawn
to the same scale, were presented for comparison, and details of lighting
adaptation to spaces and various other requirements of the structure were
considered. Mr. Platt explained that it was expected that granite would
be employed in the construction, and that the building, which will be 320 by
570 feet, would contain possibly 10,000,000 cubie feet. He said also that if
required the plans could be ready for the beginning of the work within six
months.

The provisional plans as presented were approved by the committee as a
basis for future study.

Respectfully submitted.

REMISSION OF FREER INCOME TAX

The secretary called attention to the passage by the Senate of
H. R. No. 8100 for the relief of Mr. Freer’s estate, by which taxes
to the amount of $74,889.56 have been remitted by the Government,

OPENING OF MUSEUM BUILDINGS ON SUNDAYS

The secretary brought up the question of the opening of all of
the Museum buildings on Sundays, stating that it was now impos-
sible to do so owing to the few watchmen allowed by the appropria-
tions. The Natural History (or new) Building was open from 1.30
to 4.30, but the other buildings were closed. He thought that if
five more watchmen were provided all the buildings could be open
on Sunday, at least for the afternoon.

In this connection he also spoke of the few visitors on Christmas
and New Year’s Days, and proposed the closing of the buildings on
those days, so as to give the watchmen an opportunity for rest
which was now denied them.

After discussion, resolutions were adopted covering these matters.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1925

135
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genrrat Avrenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geol-
ogy, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology,
and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not alto-
gether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them orig-
inal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1925.

SPIRAL NEBULA AND THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE?

By C. Wirtz

University Observatory, Kiel

1. The inquiry into the structure of space lies within the province
of astronomy. For this purpose observation will give us the position
of numerous physical points which must serve as the skeleton upon
which we model our conception. Observation gives us knowledge of
the motions of the heavenly bodies. The orbits derived from these
motions should serve as the basis for some conclusions as to the
character of the space in which these bodies are imbedded. Several
decades ago the distances measured by astronomy out into the world
of the stars were too small to be expected to show any divergencies of
structure from ordinary Euclidean conceptions. Within the rela-
tively small solar system all motions take place so accurately in
accordance with the laws of Newton and Euclidean geometry that
no modifications are necessary.

This is remarkable and comforting. In the solar system the ap-
parent movements are rapid and great with reference to the lapse
of time during which we may make measures. Accordingly, the
numerous complexities of the motions have been recognized and
explained. On the other hand with the stars the changes of position
are so slow that observations for 2,000 years show no divergences of
their paths from straight, uniform motion. The stars of the heavens
behave to us as would, our planetary system to an observer living
only a few seconds; that is, for such an observer the planets would
show no deviation from a uniform rectilinear motion. Yet we must
not push the analogy further for he could from such observations
correctly construct the plan of the solar system.

In every way we become convinced that the dimensions of our
solar system with its known structure and rapid motions are too
restricted to help us in our problem of the structure of space. In-

stinctively we turn to those objects to which we ascribe the greatest
distances from us. We hope that in the light coming to us from
these distant objects we may find something serving as testimony
of the long path it has traversed through this space. Speaking
metaphorically, from the dust of the journey we would infer some-
thing of the nature and direction of the path as well as the region
through which the journey lay.

2. Which, then, are the most distant bodies? Through a process of
elimination we are quickly left with only two possible kinds of bodies
which mostly or wholly le without that part of space which is filled
with stars in varying number. Our sun is somewhat near the
center of this universe of stars. The boundary of it we may prac-
tically place where the star density is one one-hundreth that close
to our sun. To realize the vanishingly small density in which the
matter, collected in the form of stars exists, we may think of them
as grains of sand so scattered that each grain is distant about 100
kilometers (62 miles) from its nearest neighbor. This shows to
scale the relative emptiness of space. The limit of our universe of
stars as above defined lies so far away (30,000 light-years) that it
takes 30,000 years for light to come from the boundary to us. Be-
yond, outside the bounds of our stellar system (galaxy) lie numerous
elobular star clusters and spiral nebule—not all the clusters but all
of the nebule. 4

How may we obtain an idea or measure of these immensely great
distances? Direct trigonometric triangulation naturally can give
us no information since we have to do with annual parallaxes giving
angles as small as 0.000005 angular seconds, and indeed less. The
motions of the spiral nebulz give us the answer and a riddle at the
same time. For 15 years we have known that the lines in the spectra
of the spiral nebule show shifts which have been interpreted as Dop-
pler displacements, a physical interpretation which is taken to indi-
cate and measure radial velocities of the nebule. These velocities are
much greater than those generally found for the fixed stars. They
may be of the order of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) per second.
At present radial velocities have been determined for some 50 spiral
nebule. These have already been analyzed to discover interesting
systematic characteristics in the nebular movements.

All apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are made up of two
components: Their own or “ peculiar motion” and a mirroring in
them of the motion of the observer.? The latter varies for different
directions relative to our movement and with the distance of the

2Norpn BY THE TRANSLATOR.—An analogous motion may be observed from the window
of a rapidly moving train. ‘The trees of the middle distance seem to recede, while the
more distant ones move along with the train.

SPIRAL NEBULE—WIRTZ 139

body from the observer. It is possible by combination in a mathe-
matical discussion of all the motions of the various bodies to find
the motion of the observer relative to the “centroid” (center of
mean positions) of the moving bodies. When we seek this datum
from the motions of the spiral nebulz we reach an unexpected result.
The “ apex,” or goal of the motion of the sun, has no apparent rela-
tionship with that found from a similar discussion of the motions
of the stars. This apex, determined from the nebular motions, lies
not far from the pole of the earth’s orbit. There is a further and
not less unexpected result. The velocity of the sun relative to the
centroid of the spiral nebule is no longer the commonly found value
from various discussions of stellar motions, 20 kilometers (12 miles)
per second, but about 700 kilometers (435 miles) per second. It can
not be the sun alone which is thus moving relatively to the spiral
nebule. For such a great velocity would have its image in the sur-
rounding stars (parallactic motion) ; such is not present.

3. We are therefore forced to the conclusion that our whole galaxy
of stars, the milky way family as a body, is moving with this great
velocity relative to the centroid of the spiral nebule. A further
conclusion results: The milky way system and the spiral nebule
must be considered as related systems—that is, the spiral nebule are
distant galaxies and our galaxy or milky-way system, viewed from
the spiral nebulz, would have the appearance of a cosmical nebula.

There is another surprise. If we eliminate the known motion
of the sun from the observed motion of the spiral nebule we would
expect to find, according to the underlying assumptions of the pro-
cedure, that in the mean they would be zero. But that is not at
all the case. We find that the system of spiral nebule tends to
scatter outwards into space. Literally stated, the spirals are moving
outwards from the present position of the observer with a velocity
of about 800 kilometers (497 miles) per second.

We can obtain another measure of the distance of these nebule,
although of small accuracy. The goal of the solar motion may be
found not only from a discussion of the movements of the nebulee
in a radial direction but also from their movements at right angles
to this, their angular displacements. The natural lack of sharpness
in the outlines of these hazy objects militates against the accuracy of
position determinations, so that the proper motions of any individual
nebula can not be indicated with any accuracy. But that does not
exclude the determination of a statistical mean indicating the part
of movement of all of them, which is produced by the motion of the
observer himself. If we combine this uncertain but at any rate too
great value of the angular motion with the surer value of the
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

radial motion, there can be obtained a lower limit for the distance
of the spiral nebule. There results a value of 80,000 light-years.
If we are convinced that the spirals are distant milky-way systems,
there is available yet another method which allows us to push yet
further the lower limit of their distance. New stars (nove) appear
from time to time in certain spiral nebule. We can compare these
with those which appear in our own milky way. Let us assume
that their greatest brightness is the same no matter in which system
they occur. This leads to an estimate of 600,000 light-years for
the nearest spiral nebulae. This further signifies that their linear
dimensions are of the same order as those of our own galaxy.

4. Now, convinced that the light from the spirals must travel this
immensely long journey through space to reach us, let us recall
our earlier query: Does this light bring us in its aspects any trace
of the structure of this space which does not correspond to the
structure of infinite Euclidean space?

Perhaps. First let us consider the apparent dispersion outwards,
relative to our position of observation, of the matter concentrated
in these nebule. In this in itself remarkable phenomenon we will
find something further to strike us. We will probably not be greatly
wrong if, as a first approximation, we ascribe the same linear dimen-
sions to all of the spiral nebule. Then in their apparent angular
extent we have a measure of their individual distances. Using this
assumption as the basis of our inquiry we reach a startling result:
With increasing distance of the nebule the observed outwardly
directed velocity increases, and it increases at a rapid rate, such that
when the distance increases tenfold the radial velocity increases
about 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per second. This must mean
that the farther away the object is in the depths of Euclidean
space the more rapid is the dispersion of its matter into that space.

Is this interpretation of the observed facts, which assumes infinite
space, necessary? Naturally not. There are no absolutely necessary
descriptions of observed facts. We should try to formulate that
description which is the most satisfying in the sense that it explains
a greater number of isolated phenomena than the older conception.

5. There is a structure of space in which the phenomena which we
have observed in the spiral nebulw will be accurately reproduced.
This structure occurs in the cosmology of the Dutch astronomer,
W. de Sitter. The world of de Sitter is a four-dimensional con-
tinuum of space and time, forming the surface of a sphere in five
dimensional coordinates. This sounds richly complex, indeed incom-
prehensible. It is not possible to represent it graphically. But
representation is a product of our imagination, knowledge of our
SPIRAL NEBULE—WIRTZ 141

reason. The understanding can well conceive what our imagina-
tion can not picture. That is the case here. Man, bodily con-
structed in three dimensions, can not picture things in four or more
dimensions. Nevertheless, the following conceit may help us better
to understand the space of de Sitter.

If we eliminate two dimensions of a four-dimensional space, the
latter reduces to a surface. But what is the character of this surface?

We can take in at a glance the phenomena which could be under-
stood by a being of two dimensions living on the surface of a sphere.
From these phenomena he could infer the mathematical characteris-
tics of his cosmical space. This being would recognize the extended
but not infinite character of his sphere of existence. Further, he
would recognize something which is really the radius of the three-
dimensional sphere upon whose surface he is constrained to exist
and which might become an object for research. It is the radius
of curvature of his world space. He can talk of it, he can determine
a linear measure of it. A spatial representation in three dimen-
sions will never be possible to him who can know only two dimen-
sions. ‘The two-dimensional observer, carrying out certain direct
measures upon this surface-of-a-sphere limited universe, will find
that the value of his determinations of the number z will not be
constant. It will be found that it is dependent upon the greatness of
the circle, that it is always less than 3.14159, and that the value of x
which he finally decides upon will be the maximum limit toward
which all his values tend to approach.

The strange cosmos of de Sitter, reduced to two dimensions,
does not become such a simple surface-of-a-sphere world but one
lying on a hyperbola of revolution. Our physicist, confined upon
the surface of this hyperboloid, can make certain observations com-
parable to those of our real world. For instance, he will find that
the number of Archimedes is always less than our value of x. It may
be mentioned as remarkable that all the phenomena of probability
from which we may determine a value of will lead to a value which
is greater than the value found from Euclidean geometry. Taken by
itself this is possibly only a curiosity and might signify little.
Nevertheless certain modern astronomical phenomena can be given
an interpretation which points the same way.

This phenomenon occurs in de Sitter’s world, although its exist-
ence was not known at the time he constructed his cosmology (1917).
With increasing distance from the center of his coordinate system,
natural phenomena occur slower and slower, and of course all natural
clocks go likewise slower and slower. Especially is this true with
atomic vibrations. This decrease in vibration time can be measured
for it will be impressed upon the light coming to us. It means that
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

spectrum lines from distant sources must be shifted toward the red
even though the source is at rest. A particle once present in empty
space will be driven outward with an acceleration which increases
with the distance. In de Sitter’s world there are, therefore, two
causes for a shift of the spectrum lines toward the red—the general
dispersion of matter outwards toward the limits of space and the
slowing up of natural time apparent in all distant objects, even
though they are at rest, relative to the origin of coordinates.

Because of the symmetry of the formula expressing de Sitter’s
world, any desired point may be chosen for the zero point of co-
ordinates. ‘That means that there exists no difference in the
observed run of phenomena no matter what the point of observation,
even though at the boundary of de Sitter’s space.

Is it possible to obtain a measure of this slowing up of natural
processes at great distance? Yes, and it follows from de Sitter’s
theory that there is not only the shifting of the spectrum lines to
the red but also, as already noted, the increase of this shift with
the increasing distance of the object. These facts should occur in
the spiral nebule as follows: The radial movements outward (Dop-
pler displacement in spectrum) of the spiral nebulae must tend to
greater and greater positive values as the diameters of the nebulz
decrease.

A discussion of the observations gave a verification of the above
prediction. The cosmos of de Sitter allows yet other predictions,
but we will not discuss them all now. Suflice it to state that we
can determine the radius of curvature of the time-space cosmos of
de Sitter from phenomena which appear in the spiral nebule. The
curvature is small, its radius is of the order of 100 millions of light-
years. In his continual flow of time an object will never return
to the zero point of coordinates. Time is single valued and history
will not repeat itself. The cosmology of de Sitter furnishes a suffi-
cient description of the universe.

6. Our preceding discussion is based upon the observation of some
50 nebule which are bright enough for the measurement of the line
shifts in their spectra. Now there are about 20,000 definitely cata-
loged nebule, and the optical means of our present day should
render visible about 8,000,000. What new information may we
expect from all of these objects? Just as with the fixed stars, sta-
tistical discussions of their distribution, color, photometric measures,
etc., will lead to many valuable results.

We will now speak of only one interesting chapter—that relating
to the absorption of light in space. It is evidently very important,
for in a last analysis this absorption will play a very important
SPIRAL NEBULE—WIRTZ 143

and active part in our world picture. To be more definite, let
us suppose this absorption to be of the magnitude produced by that
of a thick meteorological fog. Then light coming from beyond a
certain distance will be completely extinguished. We could receive
no information from more distant bodies. Our universe would have
the following appearance: Matter would appear gathered in a spher-
ical star system; our point of outlook would be at its center. It is
perhaps disquieting when we remember that already humanity has
had to look at the universe in a new way. That was when it threw
away the geocentric conception which was a quasi realization of such
an absorption cosmos.

Some remarkable results have emerged from measures on the
absorption of light in space in which the stars are imbedded. In
numerous regions of the sky we see visually and on photographic
plates what may be called cosmic clouds. In other places stellar
counts reveal the existence of compact impenetrable masses of dust
situated at great distances and covering large tracts of the sky.
In the color of the stars a selective absorption is apparent, for the
more distant stars are redder. This property of absorption shows in
a remarkable way—stars in the richer regions are on the whole bluer
than where the stars are few. We conclude, ceteris paribus, that the
regions poor in stars are poor because the more distant stars are
hidden behind cloudy veils of small particles which we know selee-
tively transmit red light.

Likewise we encounter in all parts of the milky way traces of
both general and selective absorption. However, when we turn to
those parts of the sky where we suppose we see great distances out
into world space, all traces of both general and selective absorption
disappear. This is indicated by the globular star clusters which are
placed at some 10,000 to 300,000 light-years away.

7. Can we obtain any evidence of absorption from the spiral nebu-
le, the farthest of which may be situated millions of light-years dis-
tant? Apparently we can. In them we have surface pictures of great
diameter. The surface brightness of these objects can be determined
photometrically. This is a very important datum, for the surface
brightness should be independent of the distance if space is free of
absorption—that is, optically empty. If, instead of taking as our
measure of their individually unknown linear distances, we take
their apparent diameter, the surface brightness determined for a
great number of these bodies should show in a statistical mean no
relation to their apparent diameter. We have at our disposal the
surface brightness of more than 500 spirals. We find, in submitting
all these measures to the precise methods of statistical mathematics,
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

that there is a slight dependence of the surface brightness upon the
apparent diameters in the sense that the surface brightness slightly
decreases as the nebula is more distant. For the explanation of this
it is natural to have recourse to a general absorption in the space
traversed. It may be due to the weakening of the light in passing
through an extremely tenuous medium. ‘The selective absorption
necessarily bound with the phenomenon has not been demonstrated.
If we evaluate the amount of absorption, it is approximately such
that when the light passes through a space 3,000 light-years thick
the light is weakened 0.00001 magnitude, an amount too small to
be effective within our own galaxy.

Bizarre as it may seem, the limit of the system of spiral nebulz
is apparently accessible to our researches, which now extend about to
the confines of our stellar galaxy. We may consider that we are
approaching this limit if the number of new nebule discovered by
more and more powerful telescopes grows smaller and smaller, or at
any rate does not augment as the optical powers of our instruments
increase. We may add that the cumulation of nebular matter toward
the north pole of the milky way diminishes as we push farther out
into space toward the fainter and fainter nebule. Statistics relative
to the apparent distribution of the nebule lead to this result. Com-
parison with the relative distribution of the stars, determined by
similar means, leads to the conclusion that we should not look to the
spiral nebule as the birthplace of our stars.

There is a fact which fits with difficulty into the theory which
considers the spiral nebule as distant milky ways. That is the
complete independence of their surface brightness upon their ori-
entation. For, seen from the depths of space, our milky way would
appear five times as luminous seen edgewise as broadside on. Fur-
ther, the surface brightness of the milky way as a whole would be
small compared with that of the spiral nebule. The milky way sys-
tem is therefore exceptional, and its brightness places it at the lower
rank of its class and as an extreme in any scheme of the evolution
of spiral nebule. It is not in our power to say whether to place it
at the beginning or end of the evolution.

We see that what has been stated relative to several problems
which are connected with the spiral nebula, or in a more general way
with cosmical nebulee, leads us, literally and metaphorically, to the
limits of our knowledge and the confines of space, where reality
and fiction, where the physical world and the shadows of our
thought confound. Meanwhile neither this world nor science stop
there. There is the possibility of finding a response to ques-
SPIRAL NEBULE—WIRTZ 145

tions which agitate human thought and of formulating a sufficient
description of the genesis of the universe. It is yet too soon for our
perceptions, and their interpretations still contain contradictions.
But we may be sure that as long as contradictions exist our intelli-
gences and our imaginations will work for their solution. The con-
tradictions in our conceptions of the universe are the best guarantees
for the life of science and the future progress of knowledge.

Only error is life.

IMMENSITIES OF TIME AND SPACE?

By A. Visert Douctas, M. B. E., M. Sc.

Within the last twelve months three workers in the realms of
mathematical astronomy and cosmogony have brought their re-
searches to conclusions of tremendous importance and widespread
interest. So closely are their problems interwoven that it may prove
stimulating to consider in some detail the aim of each investigation,
the line of argument, and the outstanding results thus far achieved.

STAR’S MASS AND LUMINOSITY

Last year there was given to the Royal Astronomical Society by
Prof. A. S. Eddington, F. R. S., a paper which has aroused great in-
terest among astronomers
the world over. For many
years Professor Eddington

has been investigating the 8 ok
radiative properties of a % 2
giant star—that is, a star & 4

as the “ perfect gas” laws. Logarithm of Mass
These investigations led
him to the conclusion that
the total luminosity of such a star depended chiefly upon its
mass and temperature, being almost uninfluenced by other fac-
tors. To test the validity of this formula relating luminosity
to mass, he first evaluated the constants involved in it from the
known values of mass and luminosity of the bright star Capella.
He then plotted his relation as shown in the accompanying graph
by the curved line. Next he collected all the available data from
every possible source, giving both the masses and luminosities of
stars and these he plotted individually on his graph. Their close

148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

proximity to the theoretical curve is very striking, and forms a
strong confirmation of the validity of the theoretical work.

Curiosity, we suppose, led him to wonder where the points would
lie representing similar data for the dwarf stars. Now the dwarf
stars were so named by Prof. Henry Norris Russell because they
are so dense, due to gradual contraction, that it was thought impos-
sible that the gas laws could hold true in their case. Hence a rela-
tion between mass and luminosity explicitly based upon strict adher-
ence to the gas laws would not be expected to hold good for a star
of the dwarf type. But, mzrabile visu, the plotted points for data
taken from dwarf stars conform as well to the theoretical curve
as in the case of the giants.

This was an astounding fact suggesting as it did that the dwarf
star, no matter what its density, was in the state of atomic agitation
of a perfect gas. The explanation given by Eddington seems plau-
sible, though it has not been accepted unanimously—namely, that
where matter is subject to such high temperatures as exist in the
stars, temperatures to be measured in millions of degrees, each atom
is reduced in effective volume a hundred thousand times since its
revolving electrons, whose outermost orbits determine its normal
effective volume, are all stripped off or ionized by the intensity of
heat. Each electron is thus so endowed with energy that it moves
about as an independent unit unrestricted to any atomic orbit. Thus
a free gaseous state can exist in spite of much closer packing than
would suffice at ordinary temperatures to reduce the matter to the
state of liquid or solid.

DENSE STARS

This conception, if it be true, throws light on a long-standing
astronomical mystery. There are known to be a few stars, like the
white dwarf companion of Sirius, so small yet so massive that their
density worked out to be of the order of fifty thousand times that of
water—an absurdity it was thought, an impossible result, something
radically wrong somewhere in the observations or calculations. But
instead of finding something wrong with the calculations, Edding-
ton’s work suggests that the trouble lay in our thinking the result
absurd, in our failure to realize the tremendous difference between
the state of matter at terrestrial temperatures and at stellar tem-

peratures.
GIANTS AND DWARFS

If, then, all the stars are in a true gaseous condition, it is necessary
to modify all ideas and calculations based on the old point of view
that the dwarf stars were not obeying the same laws of pressure,
TIME AND SPACE—DOUGLAS 149

volume, and temperature as the giant stars. Prof. H. N. Russell’s
famous Giant and Dwarf theory of Stellar Evolution suggested
that a star begins its career as a very large mass of gas, highly
inflated and much less dense than air, This would slowly contract
by gravitational influence, growing hotter and hotter and brighter
and brighter. This period would embrace its life as a giant star.

When contraction had reached such a point that, upon the old view,
the gas laws could no longer be considered as even approximately
representing the state of the star, then at this critical point of balance
between mass, density, and temperature, further gravitational con-
traction would of necessity be accompanied by decrease of tempera-
ture and of luminosity. This period constituted the dwarf stage
of a star’s career. Now this theory is thrown into a new light by
Eddington’s results. If the mass of a star be constant throughout

Fic. 2.—Diagram of stellar evolution

its life, Eddington’s formula shows that there can be very little
alteration in luminosity in spite of contraction, and hence the evolu-
tion of a single star as outlined above is an impossibility. If as an
alternative interpretation the mass of a star is gradually diminish-
ing, being actually consumed away to maintain the supply of energy
which a star is continuously radiating, then Russell’s theory of
evolution may be retained as indicating the probable sequence of
stellar change, but with this difference that, though the effective or
surface temperature may decrease during the latter stages, the
internal temperature will continue to rise.

LOSS OF MASS

A great deal thus turns on whether the mass of a radiating star
can actually be considered to be diminishing. There are, further-
more, two ways of looking at this question.

76041—26——11
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

One suggestion is that by collision of a very infrequent type be-
tween an electron and a proton (the ultimate particles of matter
known to the physicist, carrying the unit electrical charges, negative
and positive) their impact results in complete annihilation of their
mass—that is, of the matter which they form—a definite amount of
radiant energy being the equivalent result. This is highly specula-
tive, there being no observed phenomenon in nature to prove
definitely that such a transformation can take place; but it is
theoretically possible, for matter and energy are essentially the same
thing. Matter is one of many forms of energy and in the usual
units of measurement of energy, the energy equivalent of a mass m
grams of matter is m c* ergs where ¢ is the velocity of light, 310°
em. per second. In other words, one gram of matter represents a
potential concentration of energy equivalent to nine hundred million
million million ergs, or as more conveniently expressed, 9>< 107°
ergs; or one pound of matter embodies 1X (186,0005,280)? foot-
pounds of energy—that is, 10'S foot-pounds.

The theory of relativity has shown mathematically, and it has
been confirmed experimentally for fast moving alpha and _ beta
particles, that what we term mass is really a property of matter that
depends upon its velocity. Mass increases with increase of velocity,
but this increase only becomes apparent when the velocity is so great
that it becomes comparable to the velocity of light. The full expres-
sion for mass energy in the relativity theory is

MC? = MC? + Yamor? + 34 mov'/c? + ———

Here the first term is the whole intermolecular energy of the mass
at rest; the second term is its kinetic energy, or the energy possessed
by it in virtue of its motion; the third and subsequent terms will be
quite negligible for small values of the velocity v of the mass, but
become appreciable one by one as the velocity v approaches the
velocity of light. From this it follows that in order for the mass of
a star to diminish as a result (or perhaps we should say as the
cause) of its radiation, it is not necessary to postulate the annihila-
tion of matter, but simply the loss in mass resulting from loss in
velocity. From the above equation it can be seen that this might
well be a tremendous reservoir of available energy.

The idea that continued stellar radiation might imply gradual loss
in stellar mass was not new. It had been suggested some years ago
by Dr. J. H. Jeans, but the facts above explained brought this idea
forward with a new significance. Doctor Jeans saw that if this idea
be really true, many astronomical problems are seen in a new light,
and many investigations require reconsideration. This he has done
and only recently has he published his results.
TIME AND SPACE—DOUGLAS 151
AGE OF SUN

One of the questions which has provoked controversy between
geologist, physicist, and astronomer for many years is the probable
age of the earth, an estimate of the age of the sun being, of course,
an upper limit to the age of the solar system. Jeans attacks the
problem from the new point of view, and his argument is as follows:
The sun is radiating away its mass at the rate of about 4,200,000 tons
per second and, if it were once as massive a star as Sirius now is.
then it has been radiating for 710"? years. This means an age of
at least a million million years, and is several thousand times greater
than any previous estimate—a figure so great that it baffles compre-
hension, and staggers even the imagination.

GALAXY EXPANDING

There is an interesting consequence of loss of mass by radiation
which has an important bearing upon our system and upon the
galaxy of stars about us. If our sun be gradually diminishing in
mass, the law of conservation of momentum requires that the planets
move gradually off in ever expanding orbits. Similarly, if the mass
of our galaxy as a whole be gradually diminishing, the stars must
be opening out, spreading farther apart from the common center of
gravity and therefore from one another. Jeans estimates that 10%
years ago this galaxy was packed sixty-four times more closely than
it is at the present time.

BINARY STARS

This modifies various problems of cosmogony in a remarkable
manner. The orbits of binary stars have long been a mystery, because
no mutual force between two such stars was known which could
account for their being in such eccentric and large orbits about their
common center of gravity. Jeans points out that it is no longer
necessary to look for such a force, that with the enlarged time scale
for the galaxy (greater than 101° years) outside influences become
not only possible but very highly probable—that is to say, the normal
orbits of a binary system may be perturbed by the gravitational pull
of a passing star approaching more closely than is usual. The
chance of such an influence being brought to bear upon a binary is
greatly increased by the closer packing of the system in bygone ages.
Basing his calculations upon the observed percentage of decidedly
modified binary orbits and the probability of outside influence,
Jeans obtains an estimate of the age of the galaxy which confirms
his previous result of 10’? years.
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925
MASS AND VELOCITY

A statistical study of the masses and the velocities of stars revealed
a striking correlation, which though incomplete pointed toward
equipartition of energy. No satisfactory explanation of this was
offered until Jeans dispelled the clouds of mystery by showing that
it is essentially the same problem as that just discussed. The mutual
influences of the stars, originally sixty-four times as closely packed
as now, have resulted in the course of 10'* years in bringing some
measure of order out of primeval disorder. It is analogous to the
behavior of a mixture of gases—if undisturbed by external influences
the tendency would be for those molecules most massive to move most
slowly while the lighter molecules moved with the greater speed, the
kinetic energy or product of mass by velocity squared, tending to be
the same for all the molecules. This also formed a basis, though
of a truth a somewhat shaky basis, for again confirming the age of
the galaxy as 10" years.

SOLAR SYSTEMS

The nebular hypothesis of Laplace and the planetesimal hypothesis
of Chamberlin have gone into the history of science as great and
lasting monuments to their originators, both of whom were powerful
and constructive thinkers. As a direct development from Chamber-
lin’s hypothesis, Jeans some years ago worked out upon a rigorous
mathematical basis his tidal theory of the origin of the solar system.
In view of the contrast between his conclusions in 1919 and his
present conclusions in the light of the researches under review, it is
worth while to consider the tidal theory in some detail.

An analysis of the equilibrium forms of rotating fluids under
various conditions amenable to mathematical treatment, revealed the
fact that within a rotating gaseous mass there are no forces which
could combine to produce a series of planets such as encircle our sun.
Hence, following the lead of Chamberlin, Jeans called in the aid of
a passing star to supply the force necessary to disrupt the parent
sun. It is obvious that a close approach of one star to another would
draw out tides, one on each side of the star considered, the tidal arm
on the side nearest to the tide-producing star being slightly the
greater, and therefore more readily drawn out to a distance produc-
ing its instability. The matter in this arm would then break away
from the parent sun and follow orbits about the sun in directions
governed by the direction of travel of the passing star. Condensa-
tion would gradually take place about any points in the tidal arm
where there happened to be a local concentration of gas. Each of
these nuclei would become one of the planets, and its orbit and other
individual characteristics would be determined, in part at least, by
TIME AND SPACE—DOUGLAS 153

the influence of the “resisting medium” through which it moved,

this medium being composed of the vast millions of gaseous particles
scattered hither and thither into space about the sun by the cataclys-
mic disruption of the tidal arm.

The formation of satellites by the planets i is again an evidence of
tidal action, but in this case the sun itself was the tide-producing
agency which caused the disruption of the planets when each passed
its perihelion for the first time. That some satellites so formed
eventually became detached from their parent planets to be captured
by other planets is one of the interesting results of the action of the
resisting medium.

Dr. Harold Jeffreys has recently proposed several modifications
of the above tidal theory. The outstanding point of difference is
that Jeffreys limits the size of the ancestral sun to 40 million kilo-
meters in diameter, whereas Jeans had presupposed a much less
dense sun of diameter 8,000 million kilometers; the former figure
is approximately the diameter of Mercury’s orbit, the latter figure
is greater than the diameter of the orbit of Neptune. The evidence
in favor of the smaller figure seems to be fairly strong.

UNKNOWN PLANETS

The point of interest in both these forms of the tidal theory
is that they led to the belief that our solar system was possibly
unique in the galaxy of stars, because the chance of two stars ap-
proaching closely enough to produce tidal disruption—namely 10"
kilometers—was only once in 10'° years, which was the whole age of
the galaxy then considered possible. With the much greater time
scale now proposed by Jeans, and considering also the much closer
packing in those early millions of years, the probability of the close
approach of two stars becomes decidedly great. Hence the conclu-
sion now reached by Jeans is that of the myriad stars we see about
us—not the majority—but a considerable number are probably suns
to a family of planets. Like our own solar system in many respects,
these numerous other systems may be, yet differing probably from it
and from one another in all the details. Whether upon some fav-
ored planets in some of these many systems there have been devel-
oped physical conditions as on this earth, rendering them fit cradles
for the advent of life we know not, and it is beyond the scope of
the mathematical physicist and astronomer to speculate further.

STABILITY OF GALAXY

An investigation of very great interest has been carried out dur-
ing the last year by Dr. Ludvik Silberstein on the question of the
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

permanence of star clusters, in particular, the great star cluster
or galaxy near the center of which our solar system finds itself.
Silberstein bases his calculations upon the four-dimensional space-
time relations of de Sitter, and from this starting point he last year
deduced a relation which could be evaluated in terms of observed
astronomical data in such a way as to give a numerical value for
an invariant characteristic of spacetime called by the mathemati-
cian the radius of curvature. This quantity, symbolized by R, has
the finite value of 10’? astronomical units, that is 10’? times the dis-
tance from earth to sun. This theory, with the consequent value of
FP, has not been universally accepted, but this does not detract from
the interest of the subsequent reasoning by which Silberstein deduces
a criterion of stability in terms of the total mass of a system of
material bodies (molecules or stars) and the radius of the system.
Associated with any given mass there is a critical distance. If a
star be at a greater distance than this critical value from the center
of gravity, its orbit will of necessity be a hyperbola. This means
that sooner or later it will desert the system forever. On the other
hand, if its distance from the mass center be less than the critical
value it will describe an elliptic orbit, thus remaining indefinitely
within the system.

This criterion has been applied to those globular clusters far out
in space beyond our own galaxy, for which the astronomer has been
able to form estimates of their size and mass. They are found to be
considerably less massive than our galaxy and very much more
closely packed, so closely packed that the calculated critical radius
is much greater than the dimensions of the clusters, which may,
therefore, from the point of view of this theory, be considered as
stable aggregates of stars.

The reverse is the case of our own galaxy. Much too widely scat-
tered for its mass, its radius exceeds the critical value for stability,
and therefore this theory predicts that it will suffer from what
Doctor Silberstein terms “ hyperbolic desertion ” until its ranks be
reduced and its volume diminished to such an extent that the cri-
terion might perchance be satisfied. In its present form it is, like
the Roman Empire, far too inflated to be enduring.

Densities can be treated in a similar manner. Silberstein evalu-
ates the critical density of matter in space in terms of his finite
curvature invariant 2, the gravitational constant and the velocity
of light—three fundamental quantities in this complex universe.
Any aggregation of matter of less than this critical density will be
unstable and tend to dissipate, whereas any aggregation of density
exceeding this value will be in a state of stability. The galaxy of
stars in which our system finds itself is estimated to have a density
fifty-two times too small to satisfy the conditions for permanence.
TIME AND SPACE—DOUGLAS 155)

Having surveyed the future, let us, in the hght of this same
theory, glance backward in an endeavor to trace the origin of a
stellar cluster. Silberstein considers the possibility of a gaseous
mass or nebula giving rise to millions of individual concentrations
of matter, and thus forming the.individual stars of a cluster. This
was essentially the primary postulate of Laplace, though he was
considering the relatively minute case of a nebula giving rise to a
solar system—an impossible hypothesis in the light of modern
knowledge. But as an explanation of the evolution of a small
galaxy of stars, like many of the star clusters revealed by the tele-
scope, it is by no means to be discarded—it may well be the true
solution of the problem, as was pointed out by Jeans some years ago.
When, however, an attempt is made to explain the origin of our
galaxy in this manner, it is found to be incapable of satisfying all
the conditions. Our galaxy, to quote yet another analogy taken by
Doctor Silberstein from the history of mankind, must have devel-
oped, like the far-flung British Empire, by the aggregation into one
conglomerate whole of many remnants of previous systems, systems
long since scattered to the four winds.

Guided by some of the great thinkers of to-day, our thoughts have
traversed xons of time, contemplating some of the changes taking
place with majestic deliberation throughout the vastnesses of space.
“Time rolls*his ceaseless course.” A million million years suffice
for the birth of a star and its early development; a few hundred
thousand years will tell the tale of the life of mankind. upon this
planet; and as for man, an individual man, the years of his life
are three score years and ten, and yet such is the power of a great
mind that, despite the brevity of its allotted span, it can wrestle with
the problems of nature and learn something at least of the immensi-
ties of space and time.

CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HIGH-PRESSURE RESEARCH +?

By Prof. P. W. BripgMan, Ph. D.

Harvard University

As some of you know, I have been occupied for a number of years
in determining the effects of high hydrostatic pressure on a number
of physical properties. To-day, I propose to stop for a minute for
a general stock taking, to outline briefly some of the results obtained
and to suggest partially their possible significance. I am impelled
to do this because the variety of subjects touched by this high-
pressure research is so great, and the character of the information
obtained in many cases so special, that the whole effort is likely to
appear without general scheme or significance. But I believe that
different limited aspects of the subject will be of interest to different
individuals; by presenting to you the general outline, I hope to
make it possible for any individual to become aware of those aspects
of the work which may be of special significance to him.

My general attitude in my investigation has been that high pres-
sures are a tool which may be significantly apphed to the discussion
of many different problems. It is not usual, however, for an experi-
menter to devote himself to exploiting a single tool of research. I
am somewhat in the position of a small boy with a new jackknife
who rushes about trying it on every conceivable object. Doubtless
the more mature method is to maintain a tool box from which one
might take the jackknife when one has to sharpen a pencil, or an
augur when one has to bore a hole. I may suggest, in partial extenu-
ation of my attitude, that there seem to be very few jackknives in
the world, or at least very few people who seem willing to use them,
and there really does seem to be a certain amount of whittling that
needs to be done.

The kind of problem which can be attacked most successfully by
the use of high pressures is not that which is now most interesting
to most physicists, nor which appears to be most fundamental.
This tool is not particularly adapted to probing questions of the
constitution of the atom and particularly of the nucleus, but is better

adapted to the larger scale atomic and molecular phenomena. There
are, of course, occasions when the behavior of matter under high
pressures intimately involves the inner structure of the atom, but in
general the pressures with which I am concerned are too small to
produce large changes in the atoms themselves. We are concerned
here with pressures from 10,000 to 20,000 atmospheres. These are
capable of producing comparatively large and significant changes
in the properties of many substances, but they can not, of course,
be compared with the pressures of perhaps billions of atmospheres
which occur in the interior of the stars, and which are supposed to
be a factor in atomic evolution.

The significance of high pressure as a tool of atomic research
lies in the extreme simplicity of the change it produces in the ex-
ternal conditions, merely pushing the atoms closer together so that
they are compelled to give a somewhat more intimate account of
their own inmost selves. The changes produced by pressure are
obviously much simpler than those produced by a change of tem-
perature. No one regards our understanding of a phenomenon as
satisfactory unless we are able to give some account of the changes
produced by temperature; still less should we be satisfied if we can
not account for the changes produced by pressure. Further, by com-
bining the effects of temperature and pressure, we extend enormously
the field in which we may look for phenomena suggestive for our
theories, for the field is now two instead of one dimensional.

Tt is not necessary to apologize for activity in atomic phenomena,
even if they are not on the extreme end of the exploring line, be-
cause they are the phenomena which are perhaps of most immediate
concern to us in daily life, and we have as yet hardly begun to
understand them. The extent of our ignorance may be emphasized
by the fact that none of our theories is able to predict accurately
any of the high-pressure phenomena which I shall summarize, in
spite of their extreme simplicity.

Perhaps the most fundamental of the changes produced by pres-
sure are those of volume itself. I have measurements of the com-
pressibility of 5 gases, 15 liquids—most of them simple organic
liquids, but including water -and mercury—and some 45 different
solids, 35 of them metallic elements, several minerals, and several
varieties of glass. I may mention here also the compressibility of
11 of the alkali halides determined by Dr. J. C. Slater, in the Jeffer-
son Laboratory. All of these compressibilities have been determined
at several temperatures, so that we know the effects of pressure on
thermal expansion. ‘The melting curves of 37 substances, including
metallic elements and organic compounds have been determined.
These melting measurements include a determination of the change
of melting temperature when pressure is raised, the change of volume
HIGH-PRESSURE RESEARCH—BRIDGMAN 159

on melting, the latent heat of melting, and in many cases the differ-
ence of compressibility between liquid and solid. The effect of pres-
sure on the polymorphic transitions of some 30 substances has been
investigated, including organic and inorganic compounds and the very
interesting case of water. This investigation has involved the study
of 69 transition lines and 21 triple points. On these transition lines
the change of transition temperature with pressure has been deter-
mined, and also the change of volume, the latent heat, the difference
of compressibility (which gives information about the difference
of thermal expansion and specific heats), and the effect of pressure
on velocity. In addition to these 30 substances, about 100 others
have been examined and no new polymorphic forms have been found.
The effect of pressure on electrical resistance over a range of tem-
perature has been determined for 45 metallic elements in the solid
state, 8 in the liquid state, and for 7 alloys. The effect of pressure
on thermal e. m. f. has been measured for 18 metallic elements and 2
alloys. The effect of pressure on the thermal conductivity of 11
solid metallic elements, 6 minerals, and 15 liquids (all organic except
water) has been measured. Finally, a few observations have been
made on the phenomena of rupture under high pressure.

What now is the general nature of the facts found, and some
of their implications? First, consider the facts with regard to
changes of volume. At high pressures there is no essential differ-
ence between a gas and a liquid. Under 12,000 kg. the changes of
volume of ordinary nonmetallic liquids range from something like
20 per cent for water and 33 per cent for ether up to those of
hydrogen and helium, which are the most compressible substances
investigated, and which, under 12,000 kg. at ordinary temperatures
have a volume less than half that which they have when frozen
solid at atmospheric pressure by temperatures close to 0° Abs.
Under these pressures there is a very great change in properties.
The thermal expansion drops to less than one-fourth of what it is
ordinarily, and the compressibility drops to one-fifteenth; both
of these changes are very much greater than the changes of volume.
The fact that compressibility and thermal expansion drop off so
greatly for comparatively small changes of volume suggests that
these must be intimately connected in some way with the empty
spaces between the atoms. All of the organic liquids behave roughly
alike, so that an average of them furnishes us with a sort of ideal
liquid, analogous to the familiar “ perfect ” gas. This ideal liquid
has one curious property; above a certain pressure the ordinary
behavior of thermal expansion reverses itself, and the liquid is more
expansible at the low rather than at the high temperatures. In
addition to the broad features, which are alike for all liquids, each
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

individual shows small and perfectly characteristic divergences from
the mean, which do not become conspicuous until the highest pres-
sures are reached. These suggest differences between the different
kinds of atoms or molecules, roughly corresponding to differences
of shape. If an atom has a “knob” on it (local inequality in its
force field), it will interfere with its neighbors and produce per-
ceptible differences of behavior when the atoms are pushed close
together by high pressure. On the other hand, it is interesting
that water, which under ordinary conditions is a highly abnormal
liquid, under high pressures loses its abnormalities and returns to
normality.

The kinetic theory of gases, extended to include the behavior of
liquids up to a few hundred atmospheres around the critical point,
has engaged almost exclusive attention up to the present time. There
is, so far as I know, no theory of liquids that, with any approach
to success, attempts to picture how the molecules in a liquid behave
when pushed into such close contact that there is considerable mutual
interference.

The changes of volume of the solid elements (metals mostly) are
in general much less than those of liquids, but they are nevertheless
sieanifieuritly large, as in most cases it is possible to reduce the volume
by pressure to considerably less than it would be if the metal were
deprived of all heat motion by being cooled to absolute zero at
atmospheric pressure.

Some of the metals are highly compressible, and cesium, in partic-
ular, loses more in volume at high pressures than ether. There is a
characteristic difference between liquids and solids in that solids do
not lose their compressibility nearly as rapidly at high pressures.
We would expect a difference of this sort; in solids, the atoms must
retain their regular crystalline arrangement at high pressures, so
that the free spaces around the edges and corners of the molecules
are never occupied and hence play a relatively small part in the phe-
nomena of compression. In a number of solids it seems that the per-
sistence of compressibility at high pressure can be explained only by
a compressibility of the atoms themselves. ‘There is here an import-
ant problem for quantum theory: To formulate the quantum con-
ditions when the electronic orbits interfere with each other as much
as they must in a strongly compressed solid.

There is no adequate theory to explain the properties of metals.
In fact, the general nature of their structure is less well known than
is that of the structure of certain salts, compounds of two elements.
The data on compressibility now give us the means of finding the
first three derivatives of the forces between the atoms of a metal.
HIGH-PRESSURE RESEARCH—BRIDGMAN 161

As a physicist, I am sanguine that the mathematician can go far
toward reconstructing the function if he knows its first three deriva-
tives, and we may hope at any rate that these data will make possible,
a more adequate description of the force field about an atom, even
if they do not completely determine the mechanism.

It has been stated that compressibility becomes less at high pres-
sures. This is what we should expect, because, as the atoms are
squeezed closer together, it seems natural that they should resist
more strongly attempts at closer propinquity. I have found, how-
ever, a significant exception in quartz glass and several varieties of
ordinar glass in which SiO, is a prominent constituent. These
become more compressible at high pressures. This can not but be
significant; our theories must explain why it is that, under some
conditions, the atoms resist compression less strongly the closer they
are pushed together. It is natural to seek to establish a connection
with the fact that these abnormal substances are amorphous instead
of crystalline, and that they would doubtless crystallize with a
decrease of volume.

The probable effect of pressure on melting temperature was for a
long time a matter of controversy. Early views were strongly influ-
enced by the striking critical phenomena between liquid and vapor,
and it was supposed by many that there would be found a critical
point between liquid and solid such that above this point liquid and
solid might be made to change from one into the other without dis-
continuity. A later rival theory, strongly defended, was that of
Tammann, who supposed that there was a maximum melting tem-
perature above which a liquid could not be forced to freeze by any
pressure no matter how high, and below which the liquid might be
frozen and the solid melted again by a sufficiently high pressure.
The experimental difficulty in settling this question was that the
available pressure range was not sufficient. But with the data now
at hand, we may, I believe, regard this question as settled. It appears
from the evidence of 37 substances that there is no experimental rea-
son to think that the melting curve does not rise indefinitely, at a
continuously decreasing rate, but nevertheless so that at any tem-
perature a pressure can be found high enough to freeze the liquid
to the solid. There is no connection whatever between the melting
phenomena and the ordinary critical phenomena of liquid and vapor;
the amorphous phase may be frozen by sufficient pressure either
above or below the critical temperature. This is, after all, the nat-
ural result. It would seem as if one ought, by pushing the atoms
close enough together, to be able eventually to undo the disorienting
effect of an increase in the energy of temperature agitation. A con-
tinuous passage from a liquid to a solid was most difficult to visualize
with our concept of a liquid as a haphazard ageregate of molecules,
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

and of the solid as consisting of the same molecules regularly
arranged.

. The discovery of the true character of the melting curve is of evi-
dent importance for geophysics.

In addition to an indefinitely rising melting point, the measure-
ments showed that solid and liquid become more and more alike in
volume at high pressures, but that the latent heat absorbed on passing
from solid to liquid is little changed. It is furthermore universally
true that the liquid is more compressible than the solid.

This is natural enough for normal liquids, but is not so obvious
in the case of ice, which has a volume larger than that of liquid
water, but is less compressible. All these facts must be explained
by the future theories, but nothing essentially new is involved here;
when we have an adequate theory of the solid and the liquid state
separately, the correct explanation of the melting phenomena will
automatically follow.

Another interesting fact brought out by the measurements on
water and some other substances which crystallize in two or more
modifications is that in the liquid there may be nuclear structures
of considerable complexity capable of persisting for days. The
liquid is not the simple thing that it may appear to a casual glance,
but, at least under some conditions, it may carry concealed within
it traces of its past history imperceptible to ordinary means. The
existence of these structures in the liquid is now being demon-
strated by X rays, but the extraordinary persistence of the indi-
vidual structure can not be shown by such means.

One minor way in which the pressure tool may be of value is
in determining latent heats of melting. A calorimetric measure-
ment is admittedly difficult. By measuring the melting pressures
corresponding to two melting temperatures near the normal melt-
ing point and determining the changes of volume, one has an
indirect measurement of latent heat which is often far preferable
to a direct measurement. The pressures involved are not high—
only a few hundred atmospheres—and the apparatus is so simple
that it may be readily constructed.

Contrasted with the phenomena of melting are those of poly-
morphic transitions in the solid state. These are of all degrees
of complexity and are governed by a few simple rules. No cases
have been found of a critical point between two solid modifications ;
this doubtless corresponds to some essential physical necessity, for
it is hard to see how one kind of space lattice which is characteristic
of one crystalline modification can change, without discontinuity,
into some other space lattice characteristic of another crystalline
modification. Except for this, we may apparently have nearly every
kind of behavior, Under varying conditions of pressure and tem-
HIGH-PRESSURE RESEARCH—BRIDGMAN 163

perature, transitions may take place with no volume change, and
others with no latent heat. As pressure rises, the slope of the transi-
tion line may either rise or fall, while the slope of the melting curve
always falls. There is a surprisingly large number of cases analo-
gous to that of water and ice, in which the modification stable at the
higher temperature has the smaller volume. We might be inclined
to think of this as an abnormal state of affairs, and might expect
that high pressure would tend to wipe it out, but such is not the
case, and these ice-type transitions persist at least to pressures
beyond our present reach. Another surprising fact is that in the
majority of cases the modification with the smaller volume is the
more compressible. This is the same behavior as that shown by
water and ice, and can not help being of significance for atomic
structure. It means that the atom has outlying parts which have
centers of force of strength sufficient, in conjunction with the out-
lying parts of other atoms, to build up an open-work structure,
and that these outlying parts have more than usual stiffness, so
that the resultant open-work structure has a lower compressibility
than the more dense structure which the atoms are forced to assume
by a pressure sufficiently high to push the outlying centers of
force out of register. From some points of view, the thought of
atoms as having “ knobs” is certainly suggestive, although so crude
a picture is repulsive to some persons.

One feature of the behavior of polymorphic forms, which is
of great significance, may be studied to advantage with the high-
pressure tool. This is the speed with which one modification trans-
forms itself to another. A particular advantage of this tool is
the nicety and rapidity of control which it offers. Changing the
‘pressure on a two-phase system is equivalent to changing the tem-
perature, but, whereas the actual temperature can be changed
only slowly and nonuniformly throughout the interior of the
apparatus, and considerable time is required for attainment of
equilibrium, the effective temperature may be changed instantly
and uniformly by any desired amount by a stroke of the pressure
pump. By changing the conditions in this way in the immediate
neighborhood of a transition point, I have studied a considerable
number of solid transitions under pressure. There is an essential
difference between a change from one solid to another and that
from a solid or a vapor to a liquid. If a vapor and liquid or
solid and liquid coexist, then at any definite temperature a single
definite pressure of equilibrium will be automatically established.
The ordinary kinetic mechanism makes this understandable.

Equilibrium between vapor and liquid, for example, is main-
tained by the action of two streams of matter, one continually con-
densing on the liquid from the vapor, the other continually evapo-
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

rating from the liquid into the vapor. When the velocity of the
two processes is the same we have equilibrium, and if equilibrium is
disturbed the two processes restore it. But with two solids the
behavior may be (although not necessarily) quite different, in that
two solids may coexist indefinitely in contact at a definite temperature
anywhere within a range of pressure. This is different from the
familiar persistence of a modification in a region of thermodynamic
instability which involves viscosity. In such a system it is usually
supposed that equilibrium will be automatically produced if the tem-
perature is raised to the point of thermodynamic equilibrium and
the two phases are in contact. The mechanism by which a definite
equilibrium is automatically set up does not exist in the solid. In
the solid it is probably near the truth to imagine the atoms as tied +
to certain mean positions of equilibrium and as vibrating about these
positions, but never departing from them by more than a definite
amount. In the liquid or vapor, on the other hand, we have some-
thing like Maxwell’s distribution of velocities, and it is possible to
find a few atoms with any velocity that we please, no matter how
high above the mean. Suppose now two modifications of the solid
to be in contact. If an atom is going to change from one modifi-
sation to the other it will have to free itself from its first position
before it can settle down into the second. If the act of freeing itself
from the first position involves too much of a departure from the
mean, the atom will not be able to make the change, even if the new
position, when once attained, is a position of greater stability. But
by a sufficiently large change of external conditions the atom may
be helped to free itself from the first position, and so attain the sec-
ond. I have studied in some detail the way in which the width of
the “ domain of indifference ” varies with pressure and temperature,
and also the variation of the velocity of transition outside the do-
main. Both show large and very different sorts of variation for
different substances.

At present we have absolutely no theory of polymorphism; we
are acquiring by X-ray analysis a descriptive knowledge of the dif-
ferent atomic arrangements of polymorphs in some cases, but we
have no explanation to offer of why, under some conditions the atoms
build themselves into one kind of structure and sometimes into an-
other. For instance, who has any adequate explanation of why
diamonds are so rare and graphite so common? ‘There is here a
curious example of the indirect progress that physics sometimes
makes. It would seem to be a much simpler problem to explain
the ways in which an atom may combine with others of its own kind
than with those of a different kind, whereas in fact we have at least
the beginnings of an understanding of a great many chemical com-
pounds, but can not claim anything of the kind for polymorphs. I
can not help feeling that an understanding of the great multiplicity
HIGH-PRESSURE RESEARCH——BRIDGMAN 165

of the phenomena of polymorphism under high pressures will be of
assistance in understanding this fundamental matter, if only once
somebody can find the loose end of the skein, and I even hope that
it may be helpful in finding the loose end.

One particular transition produced by pressure is so interesting
that I shall mention it in detail. Under proper conditions of pressure
and temperature, ordinary yellow phosphorus is transformed into a
black variety much like graphite in its properties, and of a density
nearly 50 per cent greater than that of the parent yellow phosphorus.
The change is irreversible and permanent, and is the only example
of such a permanent change produced by high pressure that I have
found. The mechanism of the change is not at all understood,
although a number of attempts have been made at explanation.
The great difference of density points is something unusual. I wish
to direct special attention to the conditions initiating the change
from yellow to black. For a time varying from 10 to 30 minutes
before the change occurs, some preliminary change takes place
throughout the entire interior of the mass of phosphorus, which is
accompanied by a slight loss of volume, and which proceeds at an
accelerated rate until the entire structure becomes unstable and col-
lapses into the new modification. This preliminary change can not
be produced in the usual ways by external agents. For instance,
we can not inoculate a mass of yellow phosphorus with black and
thereby either hasten or delay the transformation. There is nothing
else that I know of like this behavior. Certainly the ordinary
formation of a new phase out of one that has become unstable by
the formation of nuclei and the growth of these nuclei at a definite
rate has nothing in common with this.

The electrical resistance of metallic elements in general decreases
under pressure, the rate of decrease itself decreasing by a sort of
law of diminishing returns as the pressure rises. The magnitude
of the decrease under 12,000 kg. varies from 1 per cent or less for
metals like cobalt and tungsten to more than 70 per cent for potas-
sium and rubidium. ‘There is no simple connection with the change
of volume, as the change of resistance is of the order of tenfold
greater. The resistance of a few metals increases under pressure,
and it is true of all of these that the rate of increase itself increases
with the pressure. I have now, in addition, two unique metals:
Cesium, whose resistance at first decreases but later passes through
a minimum and then increases; and antimony, whose resistance, at
right angles to the trigonal axis, at first increases, but later passes
through a maximum and then decreases. The effects of pressure are
thus much more complicated than those of temperature (which are
nearly the same for all metals), but they may, I believe, be even

76041—26—_12
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1925

more suggestive in formulating a theory of resistance. Some im-
portant relations are brought out by the pressure tool that might
not otherwise be known. Thus, the fact that pressure increases the
resistance of solid bismuth, which is abnormal, but decreases that of
the liquid, which is normal, strongly suggests that the abnormal
behavior of solid bismuth is connected in some way with a pecu-
liarity of the crystal structure. But, on the other hand, the fact
that pressure increases the resistance of both solid and liquid lithium
shows that the abnormality is in some way more deep-seated for
this metal and is doubtless connected with some characteristic of
the’atom as a whole. The pressure effects bring out the fact that the
conduction mechanism is not as simple as we might have supposed
from the fact that the temperature coefficient of all metals is nearly
the same.

There is, of course, no adequate theory of metallic conduction;
the classical free electron theory has had to be given up, and there
is no satisfactory substitute. I have myself made an attempt at
finding the significance of the various pressure effects, and have
been led by them to a very general conception of conduction which
I believe must be incorporated into the finally accepted theory.
This conception is that the atoms play an essentially positive part
in conduction and, in some way which we do not at present under-
stand, make it possible for electrons to pass from one part of a
metal to another. According to the classical conception, the role of
the atoms was entirely secondary and negative; the atoms were
the source of the free electrons, but, having once provided the elec-
trons, their rdle was merely that of trouble makers, getting in the
way of the electrons and preventing them from moving about as
they wished. But it now appears that the electrons can not drift
about without the intervention of the atoms. It is as if the atoms
hand on the electrons from one to another when they are lined
up in certain ways, or as if there were tracks between the intricate
maze of quantum orbits within the atom, along which the conduc-
_ tion electrons may travel, so that there is an opportunity for long
flights by the electrons when the tracks are properly aligned. All
of the normal and abnormal effects of pressure are understandable
in terms of a picture like this if we only suppose that the atom
itself, when brought into close proximity to its fellows, behaves
in the unsimple way that the facts of compressibility and poly-
morphic transition compel us to suppose. It is natural to suppose
that these definite tracks are in some way connected with quantum
conditions, and perhaps with high quantum numbers, but the de-
tails are too complicated for our working out at present.

The effects of pressure on thermal e. m. f. I have not attempted
to incorporate into any definite theory, but they do suggest one
HIGH-PRESSURE RESEARCH—BRIDGMAN 167

important point of view. The pressure effects are complicated,
there being maxima, minima, and complicated temperature effects.
We do not in general expect that so simple a thing as a hydro-
static pressure will produce complicated effects, unless these effects
involve a complicated mechanism. I have therefore drawn the
conclusion that the thermal e. m. f. mechanism must be compara-
tively complicated, and not the simple thing supposed by the classi-
cal theory; this I have considered sufficient justification for not
attempting to explain thermal e. m. f. in a first simple theory of
the electrical properties of metals.

We pass now from the electrical properties to the thermal prop-
erties of metals. It is well known that there is a close relation
between electrical and thermal conductivity, which is expressed in
the law of Wiedemann-Franz. The behavior of thermal conduc-
tivity under pressure shows that, although the relation may be close,
there are other factors which have been insufficiently considered.

The thermal conductivity of most metals increases under pressure,
but that of some decreases, and for the most of them the change of
electrical conductivity is greater than that of thermal. The reason
for the difference is doubtless to be found in the contribution made
to thermal conductivity by the atoms as distinguished from the
electrons; but a consideration of numerical values suggests that the
atomic part may be greater than has been supposed.

The thermal conductivity of minerals has been measured under
pressure, a matter of importance to geophysicists. It has been found
that in general the thermal conductivity of minerals increases under
pressure, but the increases are not large enough to demand serious
modification in our ordinary geological arguments, except possibly
at great depths.

The effect of pressure on the thermal conductivity of liquids is
interesting because it is so large; 12,000 kg. increases the conductivity
by from two- to threefold. In speculating as to the reasons for this,
it appears that there is a very intimate connection with the velocity
of sound. Entirely apart from the pressure effects, a reexamination
of the old facts with the new bias given by the pressure measurements
has shown that the main mechanism of thermal conduction in a
liquid is of surprising simplicity, being a sort of combination of
the kinetic mechanism of a gas and the elastic wave mechanism of
a crystalline solid. If we conceive of each molecule of the liquid as
possessing the kinetic energy of temperature agitation demanded by
kinetic theory, and handing this energy on to its neighbors with the
velocity of an elastic wave of small dimensions—that is, with the
velocity of sound—we shall account almost entirely for the thermal
conductivity of ordinary liquids.

Apart from the various effects which have been measured ac-
curately, results obtained under high pressures suggest other new
points of view. Thus in the preliminary work, before I had found
out how to make tight joints, or had learned what the capabilities
of steel cylinders were in withstanding pressure, I observed a number
of different types of rupture under unusual conditions, which are of
some interest to the engineer. By selecting results under different
conditions, it was possible to show that none of the ordinarily
accepted criteria of rupture are valid except under restricted circum-
stances. The general, and therefore the significant, conditions of
rupture are yet to be formulated.

Finally, we may glance at what remains to be done. Although
the most readily obtainable results have been secured, the subject has
not been more than begun. It becomes more and more impressed
upon me that significant results are to be found in little frequented
places, as, for instance, by working on materials that have extreme
properties or in going to extreme temperatures. Thus, quite recently,
this has led me to determine the properties of ceesium, the most com-
pressible of the metals, with the extremely suggestive discovery of
minimum resistance. The same sort of thing is to be done with
many other materials of unusual properties. The extension of these
high-pressure results to temperatures near the absolute zero, where
phenomena assume an unwonted simplicity because of the absence
of temperature agitation, will doubtless be of extreme importance.
Results just as important lie also at high temperatures, a most
difficult field, which the Geophysical Laboratory is skilfully
attacking. Interesting special results may be found; the will-o’-the-
wisp of manufactured diamonds is always before us. Without
doubt, important practical developments lie in a field as yet
practically untouched, that of organic, colloidal, and biological
chemistry. It was shown a long while ago, at the West Virginia
Agricultural Experiment Station, that high pressures will sterilize
milk. I have found that high pressures in the cold will also coagu-
late egg white, or the proteids of meat. Here is an enormous field
untouched. We ought to know the effect of pressure on every sub-
stance of biological significance, just as we now know the effect of
an elevation of temperature, and we may anticipate that important
changes or combinations may be produced by pressure, just as they
are now produced by temperature.

On the purely physical side, the field is immense. [Entirely apart
from new experimental knowledge, we can not be satisfied with any
theory which does not adequately explain the effects of high pressure
already known, and conversely I venture to hope that these phe-
nomena of high pressure may play an increasing part in formulat-
ing more adequate theories of the structure of matter.

For a number of years the author has been actively engaged in
research in various high-voltage phenomena. ‘This work has been
done from the standpoint of pure research to determine fundamental
principles and from the standpoint of practice to better the insula-
tion of apparatus, to extend transmission voltages, and to determine
means of protecting transmission lines and buildings from lightning.
By combining pure and applied research a much broader view is
obtained, and there is no better test of theory than to attempt to
apply it to practice in a simple way. It will often be found that
essential factors have been overlooked.

In the following discussion the practical as well as the theoret-
ical viewpoint will be kept in mind.

Il. HieuH-Voirace PHENOMENA

High electric pressure or voltages are necessary for economical long
distance transmission, but when such voltages are used without
proper precautions in design the energy may leak away from the
lines with a hissing noise in the corona. The corona is a beautiful
crown of light surrounding the conductors and is a manifestation
of the ions and electrons moving in the electric field.

The sparking distance is also of theoretical and practical import-
ance.

Laws of corona, sparking curves, etc., were established at the com-
paratively low voltages of the order of 250,000. These were suc-
cessfully applied to 220,000-volt transmission lines.

III. Researcn at Hien 60-Cycie Voiraces

Within the last few years the work has been extended to voltages
of 1,000,000 volts above ground, 1,500,000 single-phase and over

1,000,000 3-phase 60-cycle root mean square values.* It was of inter-
est to find if the laws and curves established at the lower voltages
still applied at the very high voltages. The results of some of the
very high 60-cycle tests will now be described.

CORONA :

When voltage is applied between certain types of conductors, as,
for instance, parallel wires a considerable distance apart compared
to their diameters, and is gradually increased, a crown of light sud-
denly bursts out around the conductors at a very definite critical
voltage. The light is accompanied by a hissing noise. ‘This is called
corona. As the voltage is increased, the corona extends farther and
farther out until finally a spark extends from metal to metal. The
air is said to be ionized in the corona brush. The sudden outburst
occurs when the voltage gradient at the conductor surface, where
it is greatest, is sufficient to bring the ions and electrons up to sufli-
cient velocity in their mean free path to produce others by collision
with atoms. Certain chemical changes take place in the air in the for-
mation of ozone and nitrous oxides. Corona and brush discharges are
the same phenomena. In fact, corona and spark-over are also the
same. The brush or corona are sparks to space. On relatively large
electrodes placed close together, the intermediate corona can not form
and the first evidence of over stress is a spark between conductors,
The reason for this is known. With certain conductor configurations
any increase in the conductor diameter tends to reduce the stress.
The corona extends out and stops when the diameter is such that the
stress is below the breakdown stress. With other types of electrodes,
an increase in diameter tends to increase the stress. A brush once
started must, therefore, extend directly between electrodes. The
first type is changed into the second type with increasing voltage
and the resulting extension of corona.

Corona starts at a very definite voltage. Several years ago a
law was established for calculating this critical starting voltage
for parallel wires based upon tests up to 250,000 volts. The factors
determining the critical voltage are diameter, spacing, roughness
of surface, and temy, rature and barometric pressure. The diameter
of the conductor is the most important factor. A law was also
established to predetermine the loss caused by corona. There is
no appreciable loss until the critical voltage is reached. The loss
then increases as the square of the excess voltage above the critical
voltage.

* The single-phase tests have just recently (Oct. 8, 1925) been carried to approximately
2,200,000 root mean square or over 3,000,000 crest.
LIGHTNING—PEEK rt

The mechanism of the corona is of extreme theoretical interest.
There is also a practical interest because the laws of corona are
very important in the design of high-voltage transmission lines.
It is important to select the conductors so that a large percentage
of the energy is not lost in the corona. A physical idea of what
this means may be of interest. A 220,000-volt transmission line
requires a conductor about 1 inch in diameter to prevent corona
loss, while a million-volt line would require a conductor about 6.5
inches in diameter.

High voltages are economical when there is considerable power
to transmit a considerable distance; 220,000 volts is economical
when power of the order of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts is available
to transmit distances of the order of 200 miles. With a million
volts it would be possible to transmit 3,000,000 kilowatts 1,000 miles
with about 12 per cent loss, using copper section equivalent to
the 1 inch, 220-Kyv. cable. The copper would of necessity be put
in the form of a hollow tube to obtain the 6.5 inches diameter re-
quired by corona loss. There is, at present, no apparent economic
need for 1,000,000-volt transmission.

The laws of corona established at the lower voltages were found
to hold at the higher voltages.

Figure 1 shows the corona discharge from one of two parallel
wires, while Table 1 shows good agreement between measured and
calculated corona starting voltages for different electrodes.

SPARK-OVER

The sparking distance between electrodes has been used for meas-
uring high voltages.

A study of sparking distance is also of considerable theoretical
interest and of practical interest in electrical design. It is neces-
sary to know the sparking distances in order to supply sufficient
clearances. The actual length of the spark for a given voltage de-
pends upon the electrodes used and the temperature and barometric
pressures.

A given voltage will spark the greatest distance between needle
points and the minimum distance between planes and large spheres.

This follows because the electrical stress is very unevenly distributed
on the dielectric for needles and quite evenly distributed for spheres.
For needles, the stress is greatest at the points where a corona
brush always occurs at voltages much lower than the sparking
voltages.

Tests at the very high voltages show that the laws and curves
established at the lower voltages still hold. This is best illustrated
in the curves that follow.

NEEDLE GAP

The needle gap spark-over curve is given in Figure 2 up to
1,500,000 volts effective. It will be noted that the curve is continu-
ous from the low to high voltages. There is considerable variation in
LIGHTNING—PEEK 173

this curve with atmospheric conditions. Figure 3 shows a single-
phase spark-over at 1,500,000 volts.

SPHERES

The spark-over voltage curve for spheres is given in Figure 4.
The values follow the equation established at the lower voltage.

INSULATOR SPARK-OVER

Figure 5 gives the spark-over values for standard 10-inch disk-
suspension insulators. The curves are continuous from the lowest
voltage to the highest voltage.

THREE-PHASEHE ARCS

Power is usually transmitted three-phase. Investigations were
made of three-phase arcs. The standard arrangement was to place
the three electrodes in the corners of an equilateral triangle.

The pecularities of the three-phase are and corona are that the
voltages are usually lower than for single-phase; the spark forms
in a Y if there is no dissymetry; the spark does not take place at
the instant of maximum voltage between conductors but at the
maximum voltage to neutral. A three-phase arc is shown in Fig-
ure 6.

The 60-cycle alternating-current arc passes through zero and
maximum current 120 times a second. When the arc forms it rises
due to the heat. This motion, together with the alternating current,
causes the beautiful lace-lhke appearance of the arcs. The bright
lines occur at maximum current.

PRACTICAL VALUE OF HIGH VOLTAGES

In addition to its purely theoretical and scientific value just dis-
cussed the production of a million volts also has a practical value.
The immediate practical value is its use in testing 220-kv. apparatus
with the required factors of safety. With the future in mind it is
important to learn how to build transformers best suited for oper-
ating at voltages higher than those used at present. Even the so-
called theoretical investigations of the present become the practical
applications of the future.

PREDATORY VOLTAGES

The discussion so far has been limited to the useful type of volt-
age used in transmitting energy. The practical value of the re-
search was to learn how to use these voltages without loss of energy
