PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 18, 1847.]

LN ELROD UC LLON.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a eon
of Organization.

1. WILL oF SmiITHSON. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, “to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.”

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The Government of
the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the
testator. :

3. The institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently
supposed, but the establishinent of an individual, and is to bear and
perpetuate his name.

4, The objects of the Institution are, 1st, to increase, and 2d, to dif-
fuse knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition
of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus increased,
among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge ; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

de ian aniedee can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should be
such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of in-
creasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either at
all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provis-
ionally ; can be easily reduced to practice; receive modifications, or be
abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to compensate in some measure for the loss of time occa-
sioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution, a
considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be added
to the principal.
8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated, the
funds are small. Economy should, therefore, be consulted in the con-
struction of the building ; and not only the first cost of the edifice should
be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in repair,
and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected with it..
There should also be but few individuals permanently supported by the
Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of the organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be bene-
fited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure
on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of the
act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library, a
museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to con-
tain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offering
suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and,

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular re-
searches, under the direction of suitable persons.

TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge; and,

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE’ KNOWLEDGE.
I. By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all
branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of volumes,
in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for pub-
lication which does not furnish a positive addition to human knowledge,
resting on original research; and all unverified speculations to be re-
jected.

4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for ex-
amination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in the
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

braneh to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for publica-
tion only in case the report of this commission is favorable.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution, and
the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a favor-
able decision is made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transactions
of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all the col-
leges and principal libraries in this country. One part of the remain-
ing copies may be offered for sale, and the other carefully preserved, to
form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand from néw insti-
tutions.

7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to
Congress.

Il. By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects of
research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects and the amount appropriated, to be recommended by
counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects; so that in
course of time each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,
with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge. :

4. Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the
problem of ‘American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological, mag-
netical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the formation
of a physical atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determination
of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of light;
chemical analyses of soils and plants; collection and publication of
scientific facts accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches, and accurate surveys of places celebrated in
American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the differ-
ent races of men in North America; also, explorations and. accurate
surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of our
country.
10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE. '

I. By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year in all
branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interest-
ing, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the
reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals, as the
income of the Institution or the changes.in the branches of knowledge
may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the dif-
ferent branches of knowledge.

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publica-
tions, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his report;
to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on the title-
page of the report.

4, The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons inter-
ested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it without
purchasing the whole.

do. These reports may be presented to Congress, for partial distribu-
tion, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific institu-
tions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in the
reports :*

3 I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physies, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry, and
meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zodlogy geology, &e.

3. Agriculture.

4, Application of science to arts.

Il. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

9. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &e.

6. Statistics and political economy.
(. Mental and moral philosophy.
5. A survey of the political events of the world; penal reform, &c.

Il. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.
10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.
12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

*This part of the plan has been but partially carried out.
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. et
Il. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the
direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission of
competent judges, previous to their publication.

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of the
present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in the
table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of the
Board of Regents providing for the two modes of increasing and diffusing
knowledge.

1. The acteof Congress establishing the Institution contemplated the
formation of a library and a museum; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the income* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge by
means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme before
given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of a library
and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required,
consisting, 1st, of a complete collection of the transactions and proceed-
ings of all the learned societies in the world ; 2d, of the more important
current periodical publications, and other works necessary in preparing
the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of ob-
jects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of ex-
perimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those men-
tioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United
States should be procured, in order that the valuable books first pur-
chased may be such as are not to be found in the United States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for rendering the Institution a center of bibliograph-
ical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any work which
he may require.

#2 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary to
purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts
of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of expense,
for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other similar
societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of an-
tiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, Xe.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, besides
the Secretary no permanent assistant will be required, except one, to
act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to the
Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property, keep a
record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and keeper of
the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents, employ assist-
ants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art. Distinguished individuals should also be invited to
give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has become
the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change is that
expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15, 1855, viz:

Resolved, That the 7th resolution passed by the Board of Regents, on
the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the income
between the active operations and the museum and library, when the
buildings are completed, be, and it is hereby, repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents, be
necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic importance and
a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT

Or

PROFESSOR JOSEPH HENRY,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

Berg, IS 7/ Oe

To the Board of Regents :

GENTLEMEN: The year 1870 may be considered almost an epoch in
the history of the Smithsonian Institution, since in this year Congress
commenced to recognize the propriety of making something like an ade-
quate appropriation to relieve the Smithson fund from at least a portion
of the burden to which it has from the first been subjected in the main-
tenance and care of the National Museum. During the last session of
Congress an appropriation of $10,000 was granted for the preservation
and exhibition of the national collection, and also $10,000 toward the
preparation of the second story of the building for the better care and
display of the specimens, and an equal sum for each of these objects has
been asked at the present session for the year 1871, and we are assured
by influential members of Congress that the request will be granted. It
cannot be otherwise than gratifying to the friends of science that Gov-
ernment has at length awakened to the importance of making provision
for the independent support of a National Museum, which we trust will
be worthy of the capital of the United States. The connection which
has heretofore existed between the National Museum and the Smithson-
ian Institution has been alike prejudicial to both, although more than
one-half of the income of the Smithson fund has been expended in main-
tenance of the museum; and notwithstanding that the Institution, in
the prosecution of its legitimate objects, has collected many thousands
of specimens illustrating the productions of the North American conti-
nent, the public museum hasnot yet, owing to the inadequacy of means,
been such as might be expected from the reputation of the Insti-
tution or the character of our Government.

The National Museum was established previous to the acceptance by
the Government of the care of the Smithson bequest, and consisted at
first of the specimens of natural history and ethnology collected by the
United States exploring expedition under Admiral Wilkes. Unfortu-
nately, from a misconception of the terms of the will of Smithson, as now
generally recognized, Congress directed the appropriation of the income
of the fund principally to a museum, a library, a gallery of art, and
other local objects, which, though important in themselves, did not
comport with the liberal spirit of the bequest, nor with the income of
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the endowment, which was scarcely more than sufficient to properly
support any one of these objects. Had it not been for this misconcep-
tion, it is not improbable that before this time Congress would have
made a more liberal provision for the suppert of the National Museum,
and the scientific operations of the Institution which have made it favor-
ably known throughout the world would have been much more extended.
From the first the organic law of Congress has, therefore, stood in the
way of the full development of the plan of active operations of the Insti-—
tution; and it has only been by the gradual enlightenment of the publie
mind as to the true character of the will of Smithson and the importance
of the plan of active operations, that, step by step, and after upward of
twenty years of continued effort, the latter has now a fair prospect of
producing all the results which have been claimed for it.

As stated in previous reports, the library of the Institution has been
incorporated, under certain conditions, with that of Congress. The land
around the building presented to the Institution by the Government,
and upon which at first about $10,000 of the income of the fund was
expended, has been incorporated with the public reservation set aside
for a park, and the cost of its keeping defrayed from the general appro-
priation for the maintenance of the public grounds. The establishment
of a gallery of art by the liberal endowment of Mr. Corcoran obviates
the necessity of anything further being done in this direction by the
Institution.

Still the emancipation of the fund from local objects is not as thorough
as could be wished. It would be better, in my opinion, that the public
museum should be entirely separated from the Institution. The
appropriations of Congress are frequently fitful, and the distinction
between appropriations for the museum and for the Institution is not
as manifest as is desirable. It is the wiser policy of the Institution to
ask no appropriations from Congress for its own legitimate objects, in
order that it may be kept entirely free from political influence. We
must, however, be content, in the attainment of an object depending
upon legislative enactment, with securing a part of what we wish, if we
cannot obtain the whole.

Finances.—The following isa general statement of the condition of
the Smithson fund at the end of the year 1870, or rather at the begin;
ning of the year 1871:

Smithson, of England, deposited in the Treasury of the

The income from the fund during the year 1870, including the pre-
miuin on gold, was $43,363 12. This amount is $6,152 08 less than
that for 1869, due to the difference in the premium on coin.

No interest has been received from the State of Virginia for 1869 and
1870. Up to 1870 the usual appropriation from Government for the
care of the National Museum was $4,000, but for the fiscal year com-
mencing July 1, 1870, this amount was increased, as we have before
stated to $10,000. Of this sum $5,024 have been placed to the credit
of the museum; the whole expense, however, of keeping the museum,
irrespective of the interest on the building, amounted to at least $15,000.

The remainder of the income (excepting $508 16) was expended in
publications, exchanges, researches, salaries, &c., and nearly $5,000 for
repairs on the building.

Congress also granted, as previously stated, an appropriation of
$10,000 toward fitting up the large hall for the better preservation and
display of the collections; but of this nothing has been drawn during
the year, the plans and other preparations for the improvement of the
building not having been completed. From the foregoing statement it
will be evident that the Smithson funds are in a prosperous condition,
and that should Congress continue annually to make an adequate sup-
port for the museum, they would be sufficient on the part of the insti-
tution to extend its usefulness far beyond what it has yet accom-
plished.

As a part of the history of the Institution, and in justice to the gen-
erosity of one of its earliest friends, I may mention under the head of
finance, that for many years during the controversy which existed
between the regents and the contractors in regard to the building,
James M. Carlisle, esq., of this city, acted as counsel for the Institu-
tion, and has subsequently given advice on points of law which have
arisen in conducting the various operations of the establishment.
These services, the usual charges for which would amount to compara-
tively a large sum, have been gratuitously rendered to the Institution;
for which liberality I would recommend a special resolution of thanks
by the Board.

Publications.—The publications of the Institution are of three classes—
the Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and the
Annual Reports. The first consist of memoirs containing positive
additions to science resting on original research, and which are gener-
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ally the result of investigations to which the Institution has in some
way rendered assistance. The Miscellaneous Collections are chiefly
composed of works intended to facilitate the study of certain branches of
natural history or of meteorology, and are designed especially to induce
individuals to engage in studies as specialties, to which in leisure
moments their thoughts may recur, and by observations and collections
in relation to which they may not only contribute to their own pleasure
but, also, advance the cause of science. The Annual Reports are pub-
lished at the expense of the Government, with the exception of the
illustrations, which are furnished by the Institution.

During the past year the sixteenth volume of the Smithsonian Con-
tributions to Knowledge has been published and distributed. It
contains 494 pages, and is illustrated with 73 wood-cuts and 19
plates. The several articles contained in this volume, which were also
published and distributed separately, are as follows:

The Gray Substance of the Medulla Oblongata and Trapezium, by
John Dean, M. D. 4to, pp. 80. Sixteen plates, five wood-cuts.

Results of Meteorological Observations made at Brunswick, Maine,
between 1801 and 1859, by Parker Cleaveland, LL.D. Reduced and
discussed at the expense of the Smithsonian Institution, by Charles A.
Schott. 4to, pp. 60. Eight wood-cuts.

Results of Meteorological Observations made at Marietta, Ohio, be-
tween 1826 and 1859, inclusive, by S. P. Hildreth, M. D.; to which are
added Results of Observations taken at Marietta, by Mr. Joseph Wood,
between 1817 and 1823. Reduced and discussed by the Smithsonian
Institution, by Charles A. Schott. 4to, pp. 52. Fourteen wood-cuts.

On the Gliddon Mummy Case in the Museum of the Smithsonian
Institution, by Charles Pickering. 4to, p. 6. One plate.

The Orbit and Phenomena of a Meteoric Vire-Ball, seen July 20,
1860, by Professor James H. Coffin, LL. D. 4to, p. 56. Two plates,
two wood-cuts.

On the Transatlantic Longitude, by Benjamin Apthorp Gould. 4to,
pp. 110.

The Indians of Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Strait of Fuca,
Washington Territory, by James G. Swan. 4to, pp. 118. Forty-four
wood-cuts.

The Seventeenth volume of Smithsonian Contributions, that for the
year 1871, has also been printed, is in the hands of the binder, and will
soon be ready for distribution. It consists of a single memoir of 602
quarto pages, presenting the result of an elaborate original investigation
by Lewis H. Morgan, esq., of Rochester, New York, on the “Systems of
Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family.”

This memoir, of which an account has been given in a previous report,
was first referred to a commission consisting of Professor J. H. Mellvaine
and Professor William Henry Green, of Princeton, New Jersey, who re-
commended its publication, but advised certain changes in the method of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. By

presenting the subject. After these modifications had been made, it
was submitted to the American Oriental Society, and was by it referred
to a special committee, consisting of Messrs. Hadley, Trumbull, and
Whitney, who, having critically examined the memoir, reported that it
contained a series of highly interesting facts, which, they believed, the
students of philology and ethnology, though they might not accept all
the conclusions of the author, would welcome as valuable contributions
to science.

The investigations of Professor Newcomb, relative to a new orbit of
the planet Uranus, in continuation of those relative to the planet Nep-
tune, an account of which was given in previous reports, have been tem-
porarily interrupted by the visit of the author to Kurope to observe the
total eclipse of last December. and to collect ancient observations for
correcting the mean motion of the moon. These investigations were
commenced as far back as 1860, but Professor Newcomb had so little
time to spare from official duties, and had to depend so much upon him-
self on account of the methods to be employed, that four years elapsed
before even the first formule for the perturbations were computed. The
best accepted elements of the planets were first used, viz, those of
Bouvard for Jupiter and Saturn, and those of Pierce and Kowalski for
Neptune. The caleulated places of Uranus and Neptune were found
from these data to differ so widely from the true ones given by observa-
tion as to show that the elements of these planets which had been
adopted were not to be relied on. A re-investigation of their orbits:
therefore became necessary. That of Neptune was made exhaustive.
The magnitude of the corrections required in the old elements is shown by
the fact that the longitude of the perihelion-of Neptune was changed:
by about four degrees. This investigation was published by the Insti-
tution in 1865, and the tables for predicting the position of the planet
were immediately adopted by the nautical almanacs of England, Ger-
many, and this country, and afterward by that of France, so that the:
computations of Neptune’s motion are now generally made from them.

The elements of Uranus were next so far corrected by a preliminary
investigation, that, with the perturbations already computed, the motion
of the planet from the time of its discovery in 1781 until 1862 was repre-
sented within a very few seconds of are. On collecting the perturba-
tions of Saturn there appeared to be considerable discrepancy between
the old ones employed in Bouvard’s tables and those since computed’
by Hansen. As there could be little doubt of the correctness of the
latter, Professor Newcomb accepted them as the basis of a preliminary
investigation of the orbit of Saturn, and obtained elements which repre-
sented its motion near enough for the purpose desired. The elements
of Jupiter were found to be sufficiently near the truth. The old com-
putations of the “first-order” of perturbations were then corrected, and to
guard against the possibility of an error the perturbations were then

recomputed by an entirely different method. After long study and laber
28
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the author was enabled to devise amethod more simple than any before
employed, of which the quantities previously calculated furnished the
basis, and which has the great advantage of being easily applicable to
the perturbations of the second order. The results of the two computa-
tions have been found to agree very closely. The more important terms
of the second order have been once computed, but will be gone over
again to insure correctness. The most difficult part of the work is now
completed. An appropriation has been made by the Institution for defray-
ing the expense of the clerical labor which is required in preparing the
tables and performing the other laborious arithmetical calculations
necessary in reducing the abstract mathematical results to practical use.

Among the papers accepted for publication are three by Major
General J. G. Barnard, United States Army. ‘The first of these relates
to the “Precession of the Equinoxes and Nutation as identified with the
phenomena of the Gyroscope.” All writers who explain the “Preces-
sion” in amanner intended to be more or less adapted to popular com-
prehension, assume or demonstrate certain elementary facts which are
common to the general phenomena of the ‘Precession,” and the move-
ments of the philosophic toy, the “Gyroscope.” The intention of this
paper is to identify the phenomena, and to show that a common analysis
leads, when properly adapted to the different circumstances, to their
solution. As a matter of course, the introduction of the proper expres-
sions for the external forces into the general equations of rotating bodies
will give the particular equations for the special cases. In the
Mécanique Céleste, are thus derived the expressions for precession and
nutation ; but the analytical process is difficult, and the point of identi-
fication of the phenomena with those of the gyroscope is, in this point
of view, too remote to be interesting, In this paper, solutions primarily
obtained for the gyroscope are subsequently made use of to develop all
the facts of precession and nutation. By the methods employed it is in-
cidentally shown that the phenomena of ‘“‘deviation” in rifled projectiles
may be explained. .

The second paper by General Barnard is on the motions of a “freely
suspended penduluin,” and differs from other well known discussions of
this problem in giving, as a preliminary, a simple explanation of the
origin of the forces which, on the surface of the rotating earth, cause a
progressive azimuthal motion of the plane of vibration ; and furnishing
the analytical expressions for these identical with those of Poisson
obtained by other processes. These same expressions exhibit forces
which more or less sensibly affect all motions of material bodies on
or near the earth’s surface, as e. g. the tidal currents, the winds,
the trajectories of projectiles, &c. The expressions obtained for the
pendulum are developed with much greater detail than has been done
in previous works. The differential expressions for the vibrations
of the so-called “spherical pendulum” are integrated by development
into series, and expressions approximately accurate, obtained for the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

azimuthal motion of the apsides of the quasi-elliptical orbit. Inasmuch
as in all actual experiments with the freely suspended pendulum the vi-
brations soon assume the “spherical” character, these latter expressions
are really important as corrections to the azimuthal motion properly due
to the earth’s rotation, and may explain the small variations from the
latter which the experiments generally exhibit. It is believed that these
corrections have never before been applied, or indeed actually put into
simple analytical shape. It is further shown that if a freely suspended
pendulum is made to swing through a great cirele with very high velocity,
the plane of its orbit remains invariable in direction, in space, and that
in this phase the phenomenon is identical with that shown by a gyro-
scopic disk, as it was arranged by Foucault to exhibit the rotation of
the earth.

A third paper by the same author is “on the Phenomena of Preces-
sion and Nutation as affected by the internal structure of the earth,”
and isan attempt to corroborate the dictum of Sir William Thompson,
that the phenomena of the precession and nutation do authorize some con-
elusions—very limited, indeed—concerning the internal structure of the
earth, inasmuch as it is proved that the very commonly received geo-
logic hypothesis of a thin crust enveloping a molten fluid is inconsist-
ent with the actual phenomena as observed.

As the basis of the argument, the theorem is analytically demonstrated
that an entirely fluid earth (7. e., entirely destitute of solid crust and
without internal viscidity) would exhibit neither precession nor nuta-
tion. In other words, that the tilting effects of the solar and lunar
attractions would be exactly neutralized by the centrifugal forces due
‘to the tidal protuberances they develop. Pari ratione, if the figure of
the earth yields at all to the attractions, the precession and nutation
will be neutralized in exact proportion to the extent (as compared with
a perfect fluid globe) to which that yielding obtains.

Sir W. Thompson has proved that even an earth entirely solid must
yield, unless its rigidity to the depth of two or three thousand miles
greatly exceeds that of steel; a thin crust, say thirty or forty miles
thick, such as geological hypothesis attributes to the earth, if envelop-
ing a fluid nucleus, would yield nearly as much as if the earth were
entirely fluid. But the observed rates of precession and nutation con-
form almost exactly to the hypothesis of perfect rigidity. Hence, the
hypothesis of a thin crust is untenable. Incidentally the fallacy of the
experiment (with rotating spherical glass shells, containing water) and
argument of M. Delaunay to invalidate the conclusions of Professor
Hopkins and Professor Thompson is exhibited, and the opinions of
Poisson concerning the internal structure of the earth are, according to
the author, shown to coincide better with observed facts than those of
any other physicist.

Another paper has been examined and accepted for publication
entitled “The Secular Variations of the Orbits of the Planets,” by John
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

N. Stockwell. If but one planet revolved around the sun its path in space
would be a true ellipse, which would always be the same in form and
position ; but if several planets revolve at the same time around the
central body, their mutual attraction will disturb the regularity of the
elliptical motion. The mutual action of the planets on each other pro-
duces two classes of disturbance, one of which consists in a change of the
motion of each planet in its elliptical orbit, in some parts of its path
moving faster and in others slower than it would if undisturbed; the
other consists of a change in the form and relative position of the
elliptical orbit. The first is called the periodic inequalities, and the
second the secular variations. They are, however, both periodical,
though the first runs through its changes in a short time, while the lat-
ter requires centuries to complete its cycle. The object of the investi-
gations of Mr. Stockwell is to determine the numerical value of the
secular changes of the elements of the orbits of the planets of our sys-
tem. Several partial solutions of this problem have been obtained by
previous authors, but they have been approximations based upon data
less perfect than that which is at present afforded in the discovery of
the new planet Neptune, and the better determination of the masses of
the other bodies composing our system.

The expense of the publication of this paper is defrayed by the lib-
eral donation of $1,200 from a friend of science, who declines to allow
his name to be mentioned. We cannot, however, permit the fact to pass
unnoticed of this example of the high appreciation of the value of |
abstract science since it does honor to the intelligence and liberality of one
of our citizens engaged in active business hfe, and may serve as an
example to stimulate other donations of a similar character.

In several of the previous reports mention has been made of a gram-
mar and dictionary of the Choctaw language, in process of preparation
for the Institution by Dr. Byington, for many years a missionary among
the Choctaw Indians. This work was finally submitted to the Institu-
tion for publication, but having been found on examination to require
corrections it was returned to the author in order that these might be
made. Before, however, this work was completed, Dr. Byington died,
and his MS. was given for revision to Dr. Brinton, of Philadelphia.
It was again submitted to the Institution and referred to a commission
for critical examination. Dr. Brinton, however, not satisfied with the
report of this commission, withdrew the memoir, and presented it to the
American Philosophical Society, in whose transactions it has since been
printed. No objection was made on the part of the Institution to this
transfer, since it has been from the first a part of its policy never to
expend any portion of its funds in doing that which can be done by
other means.

It will be remembered that in 1867, at the suggestion and expense of
the Institution, a geological exploration of a portion of the Louisiana
coast was made by Professor E. W. Hilgard, of the University of Mis-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

sissippi, mainly with a view to ascertain the geological age and modeof
occurrence of the rock-salt deposit of Petite Anse. In the absence of
definite data concerning the general geology of Louisiana, his observa-
tions on the formations of the coast (an abstract of which was published
in the American Journal of Science, January, 1869) demonstrated, so
far as the salt deposit was concerned, only the fact that in point of age
it was anterior to the drift. The impulse thus given to geological re-
search in Louisiana, however, soon led to further explorations. By sub-
scription, and a special appropriation obtained from the commissioners
of immigration of the State, the New Orleans Academy of Sciences
raised a fund for the purpose of enabling Professor Hilgard to make a
general geological reconnaissance of Louisiana, which was executed in
May and June, 1869. This enabled himto communicate tothe American
Association for the Advancement of Science, at its Salem meeting, a
general sketch of the geology of Louisiana. Almost simultaneously
with the organization of Professor Hilgard’s second exploration, steps
were taken.by the faculty of the University of Louisiana to secure legisla-
tive aid for a geological and physical survey of the State. The latteris
now in progress, and the second annual report on the work will soon be
published.

As regards the rock-salt deposit, Professor Hilgard’s observations in
Northern Louisiana point to the conelusion that it is but one of a series
of cretaceous outliers, traversing the State in a northwest and south-
‘east direction, and indicating the existence of an ancient ridge which
must have exerted an important influence upon the physical conforma-
tion of the Lower Mississippi Valley. The remarkable gypsum and
sulphur deposits of Caleasieu are likewise, in his opinion, referable to
the same age. Professor Hilgard has nearly completed a final memoir
on the geology of the Petite Anse region for publication by the Insti-
tution; the results of his simultaneous exploration of the Lower Mis-
sissippi and delta having been communicated to the American Associ-
tion at the Troy meeting, and subsequently presented to the American
Journal of Science.

Dr. Horatio C. Wood, of Philadelphia, having completed an elaborate
work on the fresh-water alge, principally of microscopic forms, pre-
sented it to the American Philosophical Society and also to the Academy
of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, but the expense of publication pre-
vented either of these societies from undertaking it. It was therefore
offered to this Institution, and after a critical examination has been
accepted for publication. As a systematic description of the fresh-
water alge of North America it will form a complement to the great
works on the marine alg, by Dr. Harvey, published some years ago
by the Smithsonian Institution. It will be copiously illustrated by
drawings, made principally under the microscope and will serve to illus-
trate an obscure department of botany, as well as to furnish the means
by which investigators of minute microscopic organisms may make the

ing much attention in Europe and America.

In accordance with the plan adopted by the Institution of furnishing
facilities and means of identifying specimens of natural history in its
different departments, an arrangement was made with Professor De
Saussure, of Geneva, Switzerland, the highest authority on the class of
insects known as hymenoptera, (of which the principal forms are wasps,
bees, &c.,) to prepare a monograph of this part of entomology. Large
collections have been sent to him for the work, to which he has devoted
several years of gratuitous labor. The first part of the manuscript was
completed in the French language in 1863, and for translation was placed
in the hands of a competent entomologist, Mr. Edward Norton, of
Farmington, Connecticut, who volunteered his services from a desire of
advancing science. This part of the memoir was prepared for the press
in 1564, but as Mr. Norton was obliged to be absent from the country
several years, the printing was delayed until his return, in order that
the proof-sheets might be properly corrected. By this time, however,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

so much new material had been collected it was thought advisable to
refer the work anew to Professor De Saussure, from whom it has again
been received, and after having been a second time revised by Mr.
Norton will soon be sent to the press.

The Institution in carrying out its original plan of the preparation of
manuals of natural history, has thus made provision for publications
on the coleoptera, lepidoptera, neuroptera, diptera, orthoptera, and
hymenoptera. Of the few remaining orders, a similar monograph of
the hemiptera, by P. R. Uhler, esq., has been prepared, and will be pub-
lished when the funds will permit.

For many years the Institution has intended, in consequence of the
scattered nature of the accounts of the botany of the region west of the
Mississippi, and the absence of any text-book in which correct descrip-
tions could be found, to publish a complete list of the plants, with all the
synonyms and species. For a working botanist, engaged in the study of
our western plants, the search for what has been written takes more time
and labor than all the rest of his work, besides which there is always
the probability of overlooking some writings of importance. The design
has not heretofore been carried out, on account of the pressure of other
operations, but recently the great need of this aid to botanical research
having been urged on the Institution by some of the principal botanists
of the country, arrangements have been made with Mr. Sereno Watson,
of New Haven, to prepare the work in question. The expense of prepar-
ation will be borne by private subscription, the Smithsonian Institution
paying for the clerical labor and for the publication. Mr. Watson is
esteemed highly competent for the duty intrusted to him, and is favor-
ably known from his labors as botanist of the exploration of the fortieth
parallelaunder Clarence King, esq. Good progress has been made in
the work, and during the year we expect the manuscript to be com-
pleted.

In still further pursuance of the plan initiated by the Institution of
furnishing aids for the arrangement of collections, as illustrated by its
series of check-lists of specimens, an article by Professor Theodore Gill
is in process of publication, entitled “ An Arrangement of the Families
of Mollusks.” His system has been adopted provisionally as that by
which the extensive collections of the Smithsonian shells are to bearranged
and has been approved by some of the principal zodlogists of the country.
To extend its benefits, and furnish a similar guide to other museums,
the list embraces families, recent and fossil, accepted by the best natu-
ralists of the day, although embodying results of special investigations
made by Professor Gill and Mr. Dall at the Institution.

The Annual Report for the year 1869 was printed as heretofore, by
order of Congress, but there was a reduction of one thousand in the
number of extra copies usually furnished to the Institution. This re-
duction must have been the result of inadvertence, as we have long
urged upon Congress the great demand fer the document as a reason
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

for the increase of the edition, and have been assured by many Senators
and Representatives that this would be made. The applications for the
report have become so numerous that it is impossible to supply all who
are entitled to receive it. In this connection the propriety should be
urged upon Congress of ordering new editions of such of the reports as
have been stereotyped. The printing of these could be done at very
little expense, and would enable the Institution to furnish volumes, for
which there is daily application from members of Congress in behalf of
libraries and public institutions, to complete sets of the series.

In addition to the report of the Secretary, giving an account of the
operations, expenditures, and condition of the Institution for the year
1869, and the proceedings of the Board of Regents, it contains the fol-
lowing articles: Memoirs of Kepler, Thomas Young, Auguste Bravais,
©. T. P. Von Martius, and Stefano Marianini; an original paper on the
chemistry of the earth, by T. Sterry Hunt; articles on the electrical
currents of the earth; phenomena of flight in the animal kingdom; the
northern seas ; report on the transactions of the Society of Physics and
Natural History of Geneva; an original article relative to Coronado’s
march in search of the seven cities of Cibola, and a discussion of their
probable location ; social and religious condition of the lower races of
man; principles and methods of paleontology; remarks on the Cara
Gigantesca of Yucatan; forests and their climatic influence; meteor-
ites; remarkable forms of hail-stones in Georgia; eruption of the
voleano of Colima. It is proper to remark that the article on the flight
of birds was translated from the French by Mr. W. H. Dall, whose
name was accidentally omitted at the head of the article.

For the purpose of forming a general map of the North American
Continent, exhibiting the plains, mountains, valleys, &c., the Smith-
sonian Institution has collected a large amount of material relative to
altitudes, which has been placed in the hands of W. L. Nicholson, esq.,
topographer of the United States Post Office Department, to be dis-
cussed and elaborated.

There must, however, still remain in the hands of individuals and
corporations records of an important character, which would be of
great value in properly carrying out the enterprise. The correspondents
of the Institution are requested to send to it printed copies or original
manuscripts of records, especially of plotted profiles or maps, pertaining
to this subject.

In stating the heights, as furnished by surveys for railroads, whether
actually constructed or only projected, it is desirable that the levelings
be referred to some known point on connecting or intersecting roads,
or to the water-surface (high water, low water, or mean tide) of the ocean
or of one of the great lakes, or to the level of a noted stage of water
(high or low) of some river. The crossings of the water-courses, ridges,
and summits are particularly desired, as well as all considerable and
characteristic changes of level, giving, where much difference exists,

both grade-line and original surface; the levels of all intersections with
other roads are important as means of comparison, and for checking
results. Due credit will be given to all contributors to this work.

Exchanges.—The system of international exchanges, established by
the Institution, has been continued with unabated zeal during the past
year. The number of foreign establishments to which the Smithsonian
and other publications are distributed, and from. which returns are
received now amounts to over seventeen hundred. Itincludes not only
all the first-class libraries and societies which have established a repu-
tation, but also a large proportion of the minor institutions of the Old
World. The following table exhibits the number of foreign institutions
in each country with which the Smithsonian Institution is at present in
correspondence:

During the year 1870, 1,805 packages, containing many thousand dif-
ferent articles, were transmitted to foreign countries. These packages
were contained in 121 boxes, having a cubical content of 1,189 feet, and
weighing 31,383 pounds. The parcels received at the Institution for
parties in this country numbered 3,705. The separate volumes con-
tained in these parcels would largely increase the number, the Institu-
tion having received 5,182 articles for itsown library. The war between
France and Germany, which commenced in July, affected, in some
degree, the number ef packages received from these countries, and it is
probable that the result of this unfortunate conflict will be still more
marked in the diminution of the number of scientific publications which
mey be received from Europe in the year 1871. The Smithsonian pack-
ages are passed through all the custom-houses of the world free of duty.
The only exception which existed at the date of the last report was
that of Italy, and through the intervention of the American minister,
Hon. Mr. Marsh, the Italian government has since granted the same
privilege.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

As in previous years, the Institution has received great benefit from
the privileges of free freight for its packages, accorded by a large number
of steamboat and railroad lines of transportation. In this report, as in
former ones, reference should be made to the liberality of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company; of the Panama Railroad Company ; of the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company; of the New York and Mexican Steamship
Line; of the New York and Brazilian Line; of the North German Lloyds ;
of the Hamburg American Packet Company ; of the French Transatlan-
tic Company ; of the Inman Line; and of the Cunard Line. I am happy
to announce that to the foregoing list is to be added the Anchor Line of
steamers between New York and Glasgow, of which Messrs. Henderson
& Brother are the New York agents; and I would recommend that an
official acknowledgment be made, on the part of the board, to these gen-
tlemen for their courtesy in offering to the Institution the same privileges
accorded by the other New York lines. The Union Pacific Railroad
Company has granted free transportation, although thus far we have not
been able to avail ourselves of the privilege. The Adams Express Com-
pany also continues its liberal policy in regard to our freight. It would
be quite impossible for the Institution, without the aid thus liberally
afforded, to carry out, in its full efficiency, its system of international
exchanges, which, by facilitating the intercourse of scientific institutions
and of students throughout the world, constitutes one of sts most impor-
tant features.

It is also my duty, as well as a great personal gratification, to inform
you of the liberality of several of these companies, extended to myself
on the oceasion of the visit to Europe which I made during the past
summer, in obedience to your authority ; the agents of the North Ger-
man Lloyds, Messrs. Schumaker & Co., of Baltimore, and Messrs. Oel-
richs & Co., of New York, as well as Mr. C. G. Francklyn, the agent of
the Cunard steamers, having offered me a free passage across the ocean.

Iibrary.—As in previous years, large accessions have been made to
the library of the Institution, principally through the system of interna-
tional exchanges. The following is a statement of the number of books,
maps, and charts received during 1870, most of which have been depos-
ited in the National Library in accordance with the arrangement en-
tered into several years ago, and fully explained in preceding reports:

societies, the number of sets and volumes of which are constantly
increasing through the Smithsonian exchanges, is an important feature
of the National Library, while the use of the books on special subjects
belonging to the Government greatly enlarges the facilities for investi-
gation of the collaborators of the Institution. From the first a har-
monious co-operation has existed between the two establishments, and
on all oceasions we have found Mr. Spofford, the accomplished librarian
of Congress, ready to consult the interests of the Institution, and insert
on his list of purchases any work which we might indicate as desirable
for scientific research. Professor Gill, formerly in charge of the Smith-
sonian library, and now one of the principal assistants in the Library of
Congress, still continues his connection with the Institution, and in
spending, as he does, most of the hours unemployed in official duty in
scientific research at the Smithsonian building, affords the means of
constant communication.

The National Library is rapidly increasing in value, both in regard
to the number and the character of the books which are annually added to
its collections. The sources of increase are, first, the books purchased
by the liberal appropriation of Congress; second, the Smithsonian ex-
changes; and, third, the deposit of books in accordance with the copy-
right law. From this last source it has lately received a very large
addition of all the American works secured by copy-right since the first
enactment of the copy-right law, and previously in charge of the Secre-
tary of the Interior. These books exhibit the phases of thought and
the progress of the mental activity of this country for nearly half a
century, and have, therefore, a special value independent of their literary
or scientific character.

At the time of the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, Con-
gress directed that in order to secure the right of authorship of a book
three copies of it should be deposited as evidence of title, one in the
library of the Institution, another in that of Congress, and a third in
the office of the United States district court. In the case of a costly
work, perhaps in several volumes, this was a tax on the author or pub-
lisher for the protection of his property which was not improperly con-
sidered oppressive. From considerations of justice, therefore, as well as
of a prudent regard to the cost of the care of these books, the Smithso-
nian Institution was the first to petition Congress that the law might be
so modified that only two copies should be required to be deposited as
evidence of title, and these in the Library of Congress. The proposi-
tion suggested in this petition was adopted, and I believe the law en-
acted in accordance with it now meets with general approbation. It
is of Some importance that this fact should be mentioned, because copies
of books are still occasionally sent to the Institution from a want of a
knowledge of the existing law.

Besides the general library of the Government in the Capitol each of
the separate Departments, as well as several of the bureaus, has a spe-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

cial library. When we add to these the Washington Library and that
of the Young Men’s Christian Association, the aggregate of the books
in the city of Washington must be greater than that in any other city
in the country in proportion to the population. Unfortunately, how-
ever, these collections are not at present as readily accessible to the
public as could be desired. The rapid increase, however, of the Na-
tional Library will soon render the erection of a separate building abso-
lutely necessary, and in the new arrangement which will result from
this, the different libraries can, perhaps, be brought into harmonious
relation, and while provision is afforded for the accommodation of a
nuch larger number of readers, the number of hours during which the
books are accessible may be increased.

Explorations and collections—The Institution has continued, during
the past year, as heretofore, to prosecute researches and explorations
in ethnology and natural history, both by detailing special agents for
particular work, and by co-operating with private individuals and
Government expeditions, in securing the desired result.

Among the more important of the first-mentioned class was an inves-
tigatior among the mounds of Tennessee, under Mr. J. P. Stelle. This
gentleman spent a number of months in examining carefully several
groups of ancient mounds, and has furnished an interesting account of
his researches, accompanied by topographical drawings of the localities,
and large numbers of specimens, obtained in the course of his explora-
tions. The report of Mr. Stelle will be printed in the appendix to the
annual report of the Institution.

Professor Baird, during his visit to Wood’s Hole, in Vineyard Sound,
continued his investigations of previous years among the shell-heaps
of the coast, and added largely to the collection in archeology. He
also devoted much attention to the study of the habits of the marine
fishes of that part of the coast. Under the special direction of Profes-
sor H. E. Webster, a system of dredging was carried on in the same
locality, from which an interesting series of mollusca and other marine
animals was procured.

Captain Dow, of the Panama Railroad service, has furnished
important collections from Central America, among them the skulls
of what will probably prove to be a new species of tapir. Mr. Durkee,
of Wyoming Territory, has supplied a large number of specimens of
nests and eggs, with fossils and other objects from his locality,
embracing several species not before in the collection.

The largest collections, however, received during the year, are those
made by Professor Hayden, as United States geologist for the Territo-
ries. ‘These, in accordance with the law of Congress making the Insti-
tution the depository of all objects of nature and art, natural history,
etc., belonging to the United States, have been sent from time to time
to the Institution, forming an aggregate of about sixty boxes, and em-
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bracing large numbers of new species of fossil mammals, reptiles, and
fishes, with other interesting objects. —

Mr. R. McFarlane, Mr. James Lockhart, and Mr. Strachan Jones, who
have been extremely liberal to the Institution iu previous years, have
again made important additions to its store of specimens, illustrative
of the natural history of the region of the far northwest.

In accordanee with the understanding between the Institution and
the Medical Department of the Government, the specimens of human
crania obtained by us have been transferred to the Army Medical Mu-
seum, which has, in turn, sent to the Institution all other articles it
had received in ethnology -and archeology. By this means a very
extensive and valuable series of specimens has been obtained by the
Institution during the past year. A full list of the additions thus made,
will be found in the appendix to the present report.

Another collection worthy of special mention was presented to the Insti-
tution by the Colonial Museum, at Wellington, New Zealand. This
consisted of bones of the Dinornis, the skins and skeleton of the
Apteryx, skins of other birds, shells, and ethnological specimens of
the country, and was partly in return for a valuable series of books
presented by the Institution to the colonial government.

The labors of Dr. Edw. Palmer, already well known in connection with
the ethnological museum of the Institution, have been continued during
the present year, and large numbers of articles of Indian manufacture,
both ancient and modern, attest his zeal and success as a collector. A
more detailed report will be made upon these when the entire collection
is received. Lieutenant Ring, of the Army, has continued his valuable
donations from Alaska, embracing specimens of animals as well as
Indian relics of great antiquity. From Captain C. M. Scammon, of
the United States revenue marine, we have received a number of speci-
mens and several important communications in reference to the seals and
whales of the Pacific coast. A memoir submitted by this gentleman
to the Institution has been published by the Philadelphia Academy of
Natural Sciences, and is considered an important contribution to the
knowledge of the subject already existing. Dr. G. M. Sternberg and
his brother, Mr. C. H. Sternberg, have transmitted extensive and val-
uabie collections of the tertiary fossil plants of Kansas, and other objects
of interest. The former have been found, on examination by Mr. Meek,
to contain a number of new species, which will shortly be described.

It will be remembered that an exploration of the Isthmus of Te-
huantepec, by Professor Sumichrast, has been in progress for some
years past, under the direction of the Institution, the expense of which
was defrayed in part by the Kentucky University at Lexington, by the
Boston Society of Natural History, and by the Academy of Natural
Sciences of Philadelphia. The labors of Professor Sumichrast were
brought to a close during the past summer, and several of the collabo-
rators of the Institution are now at work in investigating particular
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

branches of the collection with a view to prepare reports on them.
The birds of the collection are in charge of George N. Lawrence; the
insects, of Mr. Scudder; the shells, of Mr. Bland; and the reptiles and
fish, of Mr. Cope. The series is very complete, and is believed to express
essentially the zodlogical character of an interesting portion of Mexico,
As specially noteworthy in this connection, is the donation by the
Imperial Zodlogical Museum of Vienna, of the skin and skeleton of the
European aurocks. This animal, according to Professor Baird, is a
species of bison, and very closely related to the American buffalo, if,
indeed, it be not, as some naturalists assert, the same. It was
formerly found in abundance in Europe, and is mentioned by Cesar,
Tacitus, and other classical writers. It has been almost entirely exter-
minated, existing at the present time only to the number of a few head
in Lithuania and in the Caucasus. The Kuropean specimens are pre-
served with jealous care by the Russian authorities, and severe penal-
ties are imposed for killing or even injuring them.

The number of donations to the collection of the Institution received
during the past year is so large that we find it impossible at this time to
give to each that special mention which it deserves. <A list of them, how-
ever, with the names of the donors, will be found in the appendix to the
present report; and I embrace this opportunity to express the thanks
of the Institution to all who have thus aided in furthering its objects,
and to invite their kind co-operation for the future.

The usual statistics in regard to the number of specimens catalogued
during the year, and the extent to which the distribution of duplicates
has been made, will be found in the accompanying tables. It will be
seen that the average of the past years has been fully maintained, and that
as far as the material and force at the command of the Institution would
permit, the work has been faithfully carried on.

The museum—Congress having made an appropriation for the better
display of the specimens belonging to the Government, it becomes a
matter of importance to carefully consider the character which is to be
given to the national museum. There is scarcely any subject connected
with science and education to which more attention is given at the pres-
ent day than that of collections of objects of nature and art, known under
the general denomination of museums. This arises from their growing
importance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction. As they
are intended to subserve different ends they are of different characters.
There are, on the one hand, large central museums supported by Gov-
ernment appropriations, and on the other, local museums which are
established and sustained by societies and voluntary individual aid.
The latter are established in almost all parts of'the Old World, and
are becoming somewhat numerous in this country. The special aim
of the directors of these should be to make full collections of all the
objects of natural history in their vicinity, not only for the instruction of
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

the members of the society, and to diffuse a taste for the refined, intellect-
ual pleasure, which is derived from the minute observation of the natural
world, but also to furnish lists of local floras and faunas, and of mineral-
ogical and geological localities which may serve to establish the area
of distribution of special objects of nature, and thus contribute to the
extension as well as the diffusion of knowledge. The directors of muse-
uns of this character ought to be careful not to attempt to form general
collections, other, perhaps, than a limited number of specimens for com-
parison, since it will soon be found that the cost and labor of the proper
care and exhibition of the local collections will equal the means which
can be commanded for this purpose.

Large museums or collections supported by Government appropria-
tions are of different characters, in accordance with the objects they are
designed to subserve. They may be intended exclusively for scientific
research, and for this purpose consist of large numbers of specimens and
duplicates, as it were, of the raw materials of science, which have never
been investigated, but which may serve for the study, of the produc-
tions of entirely unexplored regions. If has been the policy of this
Institution to make collections of this kind, to submit them to experts
for critical examination, and to publish such descriptions as would
render them subservient to the progress of scientific generalization. If
these descriptions were exhaustive, the original specimens would no
longer be required for further scientific investigation; but, unfortunately,
the characteristics and peculiarities of the specimens are only partially
recognized and represented at any one period, and hence it becomes
necessary from time to time to go over the same ground in order to
verify or disprove new and ingenious suggestions as to peculiarities and
relations not hitherto recognized ; the specimens must therefore be pre-
served, especially if they are of such a character as cannot readily be
replaced. In making such collections the Smithsonian Institution has
done, perhaps, more than any other establishment during the twenty-four
years of its existence. It might, however, have effected much more good
and extended its influence more widely if all the duplicate specimens
had been made up into sets and distributed soon after they were col-
lected. But this was impossible with the limited means at the command
of the Institution and the assistance it could obtain from voluntary
unpaid collaborators. Besides this, some advantages have resulted to
science from the retention in the Institution of a large number of every
variety of a elass of specimens. This has enabled the naturalist to make
comparisons which would have been otherwise impossible, to mark pecu-
liarities connected with age, sex, food, climate, etc., and to observe the
diversities of form and structure due to the varying conditions of life.
As an illustration of this remark we may refer to the results which Pro-
fessor Baird has been enabled to arrive at from the unrivalled opportu-
nity which he has had in the extensive collection of the Institution, of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

studying the relations of nearly sixty thousand specimens of the birds
of North America.

The object of the collection we have just described is exclusively the
advanee of science. The specimens require comparatively but little
space for use and preservation. Not being intended for public exhibition
they need not be mounted, but may be kept in drawers, or packed away
in labeled boxes or casks until wanted for a special investigation.

Another class of large museums are of a mixed character, combin-
ing in their object scientific investigation with special systematic and
collegiate instruction. Of this class is the great museum at Cambridge,
supported principally by the State of Massachusetts, and ‘under the
direction of Professor Agassiz. This museum, which may be consid-
ered a model of its class, embraces—first, an immense number of origi-
nal specimens, in the study and description of which a number of
accomplished naturalists are continuously employed ; second, a series
of specimens which have been scientifically described, and so arranged
in accordance with their affinities as to enable the student in any
branch of natural history to obtain, with the least expenditure of labor,
a definite knowledge of what is known of the objects to which he is
devoting his attention; third, a series of specimens of genera so
arranged as to serve as illustrations of the courses of lectures to
the students of the university on such general principles of naturat
history as form an essential part of a liberal education. This museum,
therefore, affords ample means for the advancement of science by origi-
nal investigation; for the special training of students who desire to
devote themselves to natural history, and for collegiate instruction,
while the facilities which itis calculated to afford in these lines are only
limited by the funds which it can command.

Another class of museums supported at the public expense are those
intended almost exclusively for popular instruction and amusement.
Museums of this class have been established in several of the principal
cities of Great Britain, and I doubt not that the beneficial effects they
are producing will induce other cities to follow their example. The
most important of these is the one at Liverpool, in which series of
generic specimens are admirably mounted and so arranged as to clearly
exhibit their relations and affinities. They are, moreover, all distinctly
labeled, so that the visitor, almost without an effort, receives definite
impressions, valuable in themselves, and which, by association of ideas,
become more important as centers around which other ideas, derived
from future reading and observation, may be clustered. The impres-
sions made through the eye are not only the most definite, but also the
most indelible. Museums of this kind ought to be established at the
public expense in every city or community which can afford the means
for their support. So popular are collections of objects of natural his-
tory and ethnology, that large establishments of mere heterogeneous
materials are frequently sources of profit te those to whom they belong.

38
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In some eases, in a better class of museums, a small admission fee is
demanded, and the whole proceeds of this expended in sustaining and
enlarging the collections. As an example of this I may mention the
public museum established by Mr. Woodward in San Francisco, which
is not only a source of continued amusement to the inhabitants of that
‘ity, but also a means of adult education, since the specimens are gener-
ally well classified and properly labeled. Advantage should be taken
through museums, of a feature of the human mind essential to pro-
eress, the desire for novelty, to lead the public to the employment of
the intellectual pleasure derived from the study and contemplation of
nature. It is truly surprising how tastes may be formed, how objects
before disregarded may, when viewed as a part of a natural family, be
invested with attractions which shall ever after render them sources of
refined pleasure and unalloyed enjoyment.

While the Smithsonian Institution should continue to devote a por-
tion of its own funds to assist in explorations which have for their
object the advance of science, the public musenm, with the care of
which it is intrusted by Congress, should, in my opinion, without detract-
ing from its scientific character, largely partake of the popular element.
It is to be supported by the Treasury of the United States, and should,
therefore, be an object of interest to the large number of visitors who
are annually drawn to Washington by curiosity or otherwise, and who
cherish a patriotic pride in whatever redounds to the reputation of the
national capital. °

Besides specimens properly labeled for study, especially of the con-
tinent of North America, it should contain those to fully illustrate in
part, at least, the more prominent divisions of the animal, vegetable,
and mineral kingdoms. These should be so arranged, regard being had
to artistic effect, as to exhibit the principles of classification, the relation
of organs to one another and to those of their allies, the phases of their
organization, and other peculiarities relating to their habits and places
in the economy of nature. To assist in this, models and pictorial illus-
trations of magnified smaller parts and of minute structures should be
supplied. In every instance the objects should be accompanied with
copious legible descriptions, and in no case should a group contain a
single specimen more than is absolutely necessary for the general purpose.
Economy of space in a public museum should never be consulted at the
expense of clearness of illustration. The national museum should
contain skeletons in the original, or casts in plaster, of all the larger
fossil animals—sections and scenic representations on a large scale of
geological periods, and modeled figures of the different races of men
and species of animals.

The space which is at present available in the Smithsonian building
for a general public museum consists of the following apartments:

1. On the first floor a room 200 feet long and 50 feet wide. 2. Another
large room, in the west wing, 654 feet long by 35 feet wide, witha
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

semi-circular projection atoneend. 3. A connecting range of 60 feet long
by 37 wide. 4. In the second story a single large room of 200 feet long
and 50 feet wide. The large room on the first floor is not well adapted to
the display of specimens, since it is occupied through its whole length
with two rows of colossal columns. ‘The upper room, however, as well
as that in the west wing of the building, is entirely free from all hin-
drance to an arrangement with a view to the best exhibition of the
collections. I have said that the rooms above mentioned constitute the
present available space for the accommodation of the museum. When,
however, more space is required, the eastern wing, now in part occupied
as a.residence by the Secretary, can be employed for the purpose. The
floor and partitions which separate the several apartments of this por-
tion of the building are of a temporary character and can be readily
removed. The lower part of this wing and its basement are now used
for containing the exchanges and as store-rooms for duplicate specimens
of geology and mineralogy. In accordance with the views which have
been presented, it is intended to devote the whole of the large room in
the second story of the main building to archeological objects with
skeletons, life-size drawings, and restorations of the larger mammals
contemporary with primitive man, especially on the continent of America.
Second, to appropriate the wall-surface and a part of the floor-space of
the western wing of the building to mineralogy and geology. The por-
tions of the extensive walls of this room can be covered on the east
side, which presents an unbroken surface above the top of the cases of
65 feet by 10 feet, with a geological section across the continent, and the
opposite wall with drawings of the characteristic fossils of the strata
which are exhibited on the eastern wall. The side and mineral cases for
containing the specimens, besides exhibiting a characteristic series of
specimens, to represent general geology, mineralogy, and paleontology,
will be occupied with full sets of specimens to illustrate the geological
formation of North America, and especially the mineralogical resources
of this country.

The collection of objects to illustrate anthropology now in possession
of the Institution is almost unsurpassed, especially in those which
relate to the present Indians and the more ancient inhabitants of the
American continent. An artistic and scientific exhibition of these in
the large room we have mentioned, could not fail to be highly inter-
esting to the general public, the student of ethnology, and especially to
the many intelligent foreigners who visit the capital of the United
States. There are also in the collection of specimens in charge of the
Institution full sets of all the rocks and minerals collected by the
several exploring expeditions which have been sent out by the General
Government, besides those which have been presented as free gifts or
in exchange to the Institution from all parts of our continent. We can,
therefore, with scarcely any additional material, or only with such as
can be readily obtained, render the national museum much more
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

creditable to the Government and the Institution than it has ever yet
been. Such a collection will tend to draw to itself numerous isolated
collections, especially of anthropology, which, though they may be of
much interest to the individuals possessing them, are of comparatively
little value in the way of advancing a knowledge of the subject to
which they pertain, and, in ease of the death of the owners, are gener-
erally dissipated and frequently lost to the world. The only way in
which they can become of real importance is by making them part of a
general collection, carefully preserved in some public institution, where
they can be studied and compared with other specimens, and where, in
the course of the increasing light of science, they may be «made to
reveal truths beyond present anticipation.

Herbarium.—Aun account of the transfer of the extensive collection
of plants of the Institution to the care of the Department of Agriculture
has been given in previous reports, but it is thought important to place
on record a more detailed history of this collection than has yet been
published, and I therefore present the following account of it from notes
furnished by Dr. Torrey.

The Institution having accumulated a large number of botanical
specimens collected in various parts of the world, most of them brought
home by the Government exploring expeditions, others presented by
authors of botanical works, travelers or special collectors, the offer
was made by Professor John Torrey to arrange, without compensation,
all these separate collections into one general herbarium. This offer was
gladly accepted on the part of the Institution, and all the specimens
on hand, and all that were subsequently received up to 1869, were
transferred to him. When he commenced the task, the specimens,
especially those collected by the Institution, were still in bundles as
they were received, and all required to be poisoned to prevent their
destruction by insects, which had already commenced their ravages.
The plan adopted by Dr. Torrey for the arrangement of the plants was
of the most approved character. Each species, often represented by sev-
eral specimens, and all the marked varieties, are fastened to a half sheet
of strong white paper and labeled. All the species of a genus are laid
on one or more whole sheets of thicker tinted paper, on the lower left-
hand corner of which the generic name is written. The genera are
arranged according to the natural system, following for the most part
the order of De Candolle. <A very large proportion of the specimens
are authentically named by the authors who have described them; and
as they are the type-specimens or originals of several important works
are invaluable for reference. Some of the more valuable portions
of the Smithsonian herbarium are the following :

1. The plants collected by the exploring expedition under the command
of Admiral Wilkes, during the years 1838 to 1842. Many countries were
visited in this voyage round the world, and an extensive herbarium
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ou

brought home. The botanists of the expedition were Mr. William Rich,
Dr. Charles Pickering, and Mr. W. I. D. Brackenridge. To the last-
named gentleman was assigned the description of the ferns, his report
on which was printed by order of Congress in a handsome quarto volume,
with a folio atlas, containing beautifully engraved figures of the new or
little-known species. After a very few copies of this work were dis-
tributed, the remainder of the edition was destroyed by fire while in the
hands of the binder. The copper-plates, however, are still in the custody
of the Library Committee of Congress, and it would cost but little to
print a new edition of a work so much desired by a large number of
botanists. The flowering plants, with the exception of those collected
in California and Oregon, were referred to Dr. Torrey; others were
partially studied by Mr. Rich, and then committed to Professor Asa
Gray for a more thorough investigation. Of this portion of the collee-
tion only one quarto volume of text, and a large folio volume of illustra-
tions, have thus far been published by Congress. For a number of years
the publication of the works relating to the exploring expedition was in
charge of the Joint Library Committee of Congress and Admiral Wilkes,
but it was impossible to procure appropriations to defray the large
expense of the undertaking. At length all the materials were trans-
ferred to the Smithsonian Institution, provided it would publish for
distribution an edition of the whole. The limited income of the Smith-
sonian fund did not permit the Institution to embark in so formidable
an undertaking, and plates, manuscripts, and printed matter are still in
possession of the Committee on the Library of Congress.

Professor Gray is ready to go on with his work as soon as provision
is made for its publication. Dr. Torrey’s report has been long since
completed, and the illustrations drawn, engraved, and even printed.
At this late day, however, the report would require revision; indeed, so
many hew and rare species described in it have since been found and
described by other botanists, that it may be sufficient to publish a very
brief report, accompanied by the plates alluded to above. The Jfosses
were described and beautifully illustrated by W.S. Sullivant, esq., of
Columbus, Ohio. The text in quarto of his valuable report is also
printed, but not published. He has, however, at his own expense,
printed for private distribution a beautiful edition of it in folio. The Alge
were committed to Professor J. W. Bailey, of West Point, and Professor
W. H. Harvey, of Trinity College, Dublin, whose report on these plants,
with elaborate illustrations, is printed, and has been, for years, stored
away in sheets awaiting to be bound up and published with Dr. Torrey’s
report. The same may be said of Professor Tuckerman’s account of the
Tichens, and of the reports by Rev. M. A. Curtis, of North Carolina, and
Rey. Dr. Berkely, of England, on the Fungi.

2. The next most extensive and valuable portion of the herbarium is
the collection of plants made during the North Pacific exploring expedi-
tion, under command of Commanders Ringgold and Rodgers, from 1853
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to 1856, by Mr. Charles Wright, an accomplished botanist, who accom-
panied the Mexican boundary commissioners in their surveys, and who
has also made extensive botanical explorations in Cuba. There has
been no full report of the collections made on the North Pacific expedi-
tion, though many of the new species have been published by Dr. Gray.

3. The naturalists who accompanied most of the surveying parties
which made explorations for the route of a Pacific Railroad collected
large numbers of plants, many of which were new to the botanist, and
have been described in the published reports of these éxplorations.

4, Collections made in the Mexican boundary survey by Dr. C. C.
Parry, Dr. J. M. Bigelow, Mr. C. Wright, Professor George Thurber,
and Mr. Arthur Schott, are among the most extensive and valuable
portions of the herbarium. <A full account of them, by Drs. Gray, Engel-
mann, and Torrey, is contained in General Emory’s report. The Cac-
tacez, and one or two smaller orders, were described by Dr. Engelmann;
the Compositz, Scrophulariaceze, and one or two other orders, by Dr.
Gray; and the ferns, with their allies, by Professor D. C. Eaton. The
remaining Cryptogamia are not included in the report, but most of the
new or rare ones have been published elsewhere. The grasses were to be
described in a separate memoir by Professor Thurber.

5. Large additions have been made to the North American portion of
the herbarium, chiefly from within the limits of the United States and
Territories, by contributions from the following places: New England,
by Mr. Oakes, Dr. Gray, Professor Tuckerman, 8. T. Olney, esq., Pro-
fessor D. C. Haton, and others; New Jersey, by Mr. C. I’. Austin, Pro-
fessor Eaton, Dr. Torrey, and Dr. Knieskern ; New York, Messrs. Austin,
LeRoy, Clinton, Torrey, and many others; Pennsylvania, by Dr. Dar-
lington, and Professor Thos. C. Porter; North Carolina, by Rey. Dr.
Curtis; Florida, by Dr. Chapman, (type-specimens of his flora of the
Southern States;) Alabama, by Professor Winchell; Kentucky, Dr. Short,
and Mr. Sullivant; Texas and New Mexico, Messrs. Fendler, Ervend-
berg, and others, besides what the botanists collected in the Mexican
boundary survey; Rocky Mountains, Dr. Parry, Captain Macomb,
and Dr. Newberry; Oregon, Mr. Geo. Gibbs, and others; Nebraska,
Dr. Hayden; Nevada, Mr. Stretch; California, Dr. H. M. Bolander,
General I'rémont, Miss Davies, Th. Bridges, Mr. BE. Samuels, Dr. Torrey,
and many others; Colorado, Dr. Anderson, Frémont, and others. Besides
these principal sources of United States plants, very many specimens
have been received from other places and persons, which we have not
space to enumerate. From British America, especially the sub-aretic
portions, Dr. Kennicott, and officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company have
furnished specimens. Of foreign plants, besides those collected in the two
United States exploring expeditions already noticed, the herbarium con-
tains valuable and large contributions from Japan, Mantchuria, China,
eic., from Professors Reigel and Maximovitch, of the Imperial Academy
of Science of St. Petersburg, and the Imperial Botanic Garden: <A

Mr. Horace Mann, lately deceased: A collection of plants from Mirador,
Mexico, by Dr. Sartorius: Many specimens, with fleshy fruits in alco-
hol, collected on the Panama Railroad, by the late Dr. Sutton Hayes;
others from the same regicn by, Fendler, in 1850: Plants from Jamaica,
especially ferns from Mr. Wilson; from Cuba, collected by Mr. Chas.
Wright; Venezuela, many beautifully dried ferns by Fendler; from
Texas and Northern Mexico, by Berlandier; Lower California, by Mr.
Xantus; Brazil and Paraguay, by unknown collector. From Europe,
there is an extensive collection of Hungarian plants from Mr. Arthur
Schott, and of Illyrian plants from Professor Thomasini, besides many
smaller collections from various parts of the continent. Dr. Torrey has
contributed a large number of specimens from his own herbarium.

As to the disposition made of the duplicates of the collections, they
have been sent in the name of the Smithsonian Institution to learned
societies, botanic gardens, and individuals, whenever they could be dis-
posed of for the advance of science. Full sets of duplicates were pre-
sented to the Royal Garden at Kew, near London, the botanic gardens
of Paris and St. Petersburg, besides smaller portions to individuals,
lyceums of natural history, and colleges.

This collection of plants has been transferred to the Agricultural De-
partment, on the conditions set forth in the following documents, of
which the originals are in the archives of the Institution and of the
Agricultural Department:

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 1, 1868.

In order to the harmonious co-operation of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the Department of Agriculture in their respective provinces of
advancing science, they enter into the following agreement relative to
the disposition of specimens:

First. All the botanical specimens in possession of the Smithsonian
Institution, about twenty thousand, and all that may hereafter be col-
lected by it, shall be transferred to the Agricultural Department on the
following terms:

1. That a competent botanist, approved by the Institution, shall be
appointed to have charge of the collection.

2. That the collection shall, at all times, be accessible to the public
for educational purposes, and to the Institution for scientific investiga-
tion, or for supplying any information in regard to plants that its cor-
respondents may ask for.

3. That due credit be given to the Institution in the report of the
Agricultural Department for the original deposit, and for such addi-
tions as may be made to it, from time to time, by the Institution.

Second. That the Agricultural Department shall transfer to the Smith-
sonian Institution any specimens it may now have, or may hereafter ob-
tain, that are not necessary to illustrate agricultural economy; such as
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

those of ethnology and of various branches of natural history. Similar
credit to be given in this case as is required in the former.
HORACE CAPRON,
Commissioner of Agriculture.
: JOSEPH HENRY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Yhe following is an account of the more important additions which
have been made to the collection in the Agricultural Department by the
Institution since the transfer of the general herbarium in 1868:

1. A set of European plants, numbering about four hundred species,
presented by Professor Paul Reintz, of Germany, in exchange, at his
request, for specimens of American plants.

2. A second very extensive collection of plants from the Imperial
Academy of St. Petersburg, in return for donations from the Institution.
This present, like all of those we have received from the Imperial Academy,
is of a most valuable character. It consists of eleven hundred species
from Russia, Siberia, Western Europe, and Japan.

3. Another large collection is from the widow of the late Mr. James
MeMinn, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, principally of plants from the
mountainous regions of Pennsylvania, but also comprising specimens
from other parts of this country and different localities in Kurope. Mr.
McMinn was a civil engineer, and in the practice of his profession in
surveying lines for railways and canals became interested in the variety
of plants which were presented to his notice, and as a means of recre-
ation, as well as of intellectual improvement, commenced the study of
botany. It would appear from the examination of his herbarium, that he
had entered into extensive correspondence with some of the principal
botanists of this country and Europe, and had enriched his coilection
by exchanges. His herbarium contained about five thousand species,
among which is aninteresting series of plants from the Alps. The special
thanks of the Institution are due to Mrs. McMinn for the judicious dis-
position she hes made of the results of the labors of her lamented hus-
band, which we trust will be preserved among the collections of the
Government, as a permanent memorial of his devotion to science and
of her enlightened liberality.

Besides the foregoing there have been added several hundred bottles
of samples of agricultural materials and products, humerous specimens
of seeds, roots, fibers, fungi, sections of wood, &e.

Work done in connection with the collections.—Professor Baird, during
the past year, in addition to his services in regard to the exchanges,
natural history, and assistance in correspondence, has completed the
systematic description of the land birds of the Pacific States, forming
the first volume of ornithology published, in connection with its geo-
logical survey, by the State of California. The materials for this work
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

were from the manuscript notes of Dr. J. G. Cooper, of San Francisco,
while the descriptions are principally from specimens in the Smithsonian
collections. This yolume, in regard to its typography, illustrations, and
the character of its contents, does honor to the liberality of the State at
whose expense it was published, as well as to the science of the country.
Professor Baird has also continued his labors with Dr. Brewer, of Bos-
ton, on a work relative to the general ornithology of North America; in
this he has been assisted by Mr. Robert Ridgeway, the zodélogist
of the exploration of the fortieth parallel under Clarence King. To the
latter, free access has also been given, in the preparation of his report
on the birds of Mr. King’s survey, to all the ornithological specimens in
the Smithsonian collections.

Mr. Meek, the paleontologist, has made a preliminary report on the
fossils collected by Dr. Hayden in his survey of Wyoming and contig-
uous Territories, and prepared lists of the same, with descriptions of
the new species. He has described and prepared drawings of a collec-
tion of cretaceous fossils, sent by Professor Mudge to the Institution,
from Kansas. He has made, besides several preliminary examinations,
a final report on the fossils collected by Mr. King in the survey of the
fortieth parallel, with full descriptions and illustrations of all the new
species. He has also investigated the invertebrate fossils collected by
the geological survey of Ohio, and prepared descriptions of the new

species for publication; made a preliminary report, with descrip-

tions of Some new species, on a collection of carboniferous fossils sent
by Professor Stevenson from West Virginia; continued his work.on the
illustrations of the monograph of the paleontology of the Upper
Missouri. He has also identified collections of fossils, received from
time to time at the Smithsonian Institution from collectors in various
parts of the country.

Mr. Dall has been engaged in collating the extensive collection of
manuscript notes of the Hudson’s Bay and other Arctic American col-
laborators with whom the institution has been in correspondence for
more than fifteen years. The part of these notes which he has finished
relates to ornithology, and comprises many thousand items descriptive
of the habits, distribution, and numbers of the birds of the regions
above referred to. These will be used by Professor Baird and Dr. Brewer
in their work on the birds of North America. The manuscripts also con-
tain notes relative to the mammals and other animals, as well as to the
ethnology of the same regions. When all. these are collated and pub-
lished they will form an interesting contribution to existing knowledge of
the natural productions and ethnology of the North American continent.

Mr. Dall has also devoted considerable time to original investigations
relative to the minute anatomy of the mollusca from specimens in the
collections of the Institution. His principal labor, however, has been in
the rearrangement of the very large series of shells from the west coast
of America and of the North Pacific, including many types of the new
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

species of Gould, Carpenter, Cooper, Stearns, Pease, H. and A. Adams,
&e. These have mostly passed through the hands of Dr. P. P. Car-
penter, of Montreal, but still required to be placed, in suitable trays,
and ‘provided with new labels and specially arranged for cabinet pur-
poses. He has also had charge throughout most of the year of the
record of additions to the museum, and the labeling of collections, espe-
cially those of ethnology and osteology.

Meteorology.—The system of meteorology of the Institution has been
kept up as usual during the past year. The number of observers report-
ing to the Institution during this period is 515, and to the Medical
Department of the United States Army, to the records of which we have
free access, 140. The value of these observations increases with the
number of observers and the time for which the several series are con-
tinued. But observations, however long-continued and extensive, are
comparatively of little value unless they are reduced and discussed ; and
these operations can only be performed at the expense of great labor,
since thousands of figures have to be tabulated and subjected to various
arithmetical processes in order to deduce the general results which con-
stitute approximate scientific principles. As we have stated in previous
reports, the discussion of the rain and temperature has been for some
years in charge of Mr. Charles A. Schott. The results in regard to the
rain have been printed, and will form a part of the Smithsonian Con-
tributions for the year 1871. A general account of these results was:
given in the last report, but in this it may be further stated that the
principal deductions are made from an original series of tables giving the
monthly rain-fall from the earliest periods from all sources in the United
States and adjacent countries down to 1867, From these general tables
a series of consolidated tables of means for seasons and years, for the
whole time, is deduced. It was thought advisable, on account of the
great expense, to publish for the present the consolidated tables, and
to retain the others for reference or to answer special inquiries in
regard to the rain-fall of particular stations. The former have been kept
up to date, all the new materials having been incorporated; and to extend
the system a large number of rain-gauges have been distributed to dif-
ferent parts of the country, and especially to the western States.

The temperature records are still under investigation by Mr. Schott.
The work was in part temporarily, suspended during his absence in
Europe as a member of the expedition for observing the total eclipse of
last December. The following is a statement of the present condition
of the discussion.

The collection of material has for the most part been completed down
to the present time, and tables of hourly, bi-hourly, and semi-hourly
observations of temperature have been prepared. From these have
heen deduced tables to be used for the correction of daily variations of
temperature. The daily fluctuation of the atmospheric temperature
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3)

has been discussed, and tables giving the times of sunrise and sunset
for stations between latitudes 23° and 60°, to be used for corrections of
daily variation, have been computed. The annual fluctuations of tem-
perature have been in part discussed, and the tables of maxima and
minima are in an advanced state toward completion.

All the observations relative to the winds, made under the direction
of the Institution, and under the Medical Department of the Army, and
all those which have been collected from other sources, have been
placed in charge of Professor J. H. Coffin, of Lafayette College, for
reduction and discussion. It was first intended to limit the investiga-
tion to the winds of North America, but it has since been considered
advisable to incorporate the whole in a memoir on the general direction
of the winds of the globe. To defray the cost of the extra labor, other
than that of Professor Coffin, in this investigation, an appropriation has
been made from the income of the Institution. During the year, Pro-
fessor Coffin has been pressing on this work, with a number of assistants,
as rapidly as the means at his command and his time would allow.

The Smithsonian meteorological system was commenced in 1849, and
has continued in operation until the present time. Its efforts have been
directed in the line of supplementing and harmonizing other systems,
of a more limited character, with that of the more general one of the
Army of the United States, and in some measure with the system estab-
lished in Canada. It has done good service to the cause of meteorology,
1, in inaugurating the system which has been in operation upward of
twenty years; 2, in the introduction of improved instruments after
discussion and experiments; 3, in preparing and .publishing at its ex-
pense an extensive series of meteorological tables; 4, in reducing and
discussing the meteorologicai material which could be obtained from
all the records from the first settlement of the country till within a few
years; 5, in being the first to show the practicability of telegraphic
weather signals; 6, in publishing records and discussions made at its
own expense, of the Arctic expeditions of Kane, Hayes, and McClin-
tock; 7, in discussing and publishing a number of series of special
records embracing periods of from twenty to fifty years in different see-
tions of the United States, of great interest in determining secular
changes of the climate; 8, in the publication of a series of memoirs on
various meteorological phenomena, embracing observations and discus-
Sions of storms, tornadoes, meteors, auroras, &e.; 9, in a diffusion of a
knowledge of meteorology through its extensive unpublished corre-
spondence and its printed circulars. It has done all in this line which
its limited means would permit, and has urged upon Congress the estab-
lishment, with adequate appropriation of funds, of a meteorological
department under one comprehensive plan, in which the records should
be sent to a central depot for reduction, discussion, and final publica-
tion.

An important step has been made toward this desirable object in the
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

————__ a

establishment, during the last year, by Congress, of a system of practical
weather reports under the direction of the War Department, with ample
means for the purchase standard instruments, the pay of assistants, and
telegraphic dispatches. The results of this system in the way of pre-
diction have been eminently successful, and have everywhere met with
popular favor. The organization and administration of the system by
General Myer, the director, has evinced great executive ability, and
his wisdom has been shown in selecting Professor Abbe as his scientifie
assistant. It should be recollected, however, that the principles em-
ployed in foretelling the weather are practical results previously arrived
at by the investigations of men of abstract science founded on simulta-
neous records without the aid of telegraphic communication. For the
discovery of the general laws of meteorological phenomena, simultaneous
observations should be made over large portions of the earth, and the
records of these collected at stated periods, say at the end of every
month, at some central office, and submitted first to preliminary reduc-
tion, and finally to the critical study of men like Espy, Redfield, and
others, fitted by education, experience, and mental peculiarities to
deduce from them the required generalizations. I would therefore sug-
gest that a still larger appropriation be made by Congress to the War
Department for establishing, besides the reports for weather signals, a
series of intermediate stations, also furnished with compared instru-
ments, to record daily observations to be transmitted to Washington
weekly or monthly, and also that provision be made for the support of
a number of competent persons'‘to carry on the reductions and prepare
the results for publication.

It has been the policy of this Institution from the first to do nothing
which can be done as well or better by other means, and in accordance
with this policy the Institution would willingly relinquish the field of
meteorology, which it has so long endeavored, though imperfectly, to
cultivate, turning over to the Signal Office all the material which it has
accumulated up to a given epoch. We would advise also a similar
course to be pursued on the part of the Medical Department of the
Army. All the deductions from the combined materials which have
been collected up to the present time should be obtained and published,
although since, they may be in many respects defective, they contain
the essential element of long periods of meteorological changes and
a new era commence with more precise instruments and improved
methods of observation. From such a system, however perfect it may
be, immediate results are not to be expected. New and important de-
ductions can scarcely be obtained until after a continuance of the sys-
tem for several years, as, for example, the accurate determination of
the periodicity which probably exists in regard to the droughts of the
western coast.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

Before closing this report it is proper that I should refer to a resolu-
tion adopted by your honorable board at its last session, granting me
leave of absence to visit Europé to confer with savans and societies
relative to the Institution, and making provision for the payment of my
expenses. The presentation of this proposition was entirely without
my knowledge, but I need scarcely say that its unanimous adoption was
highly gratifying to my feelings, and that I availed myself of the privi-
lege it offered with a grateful appreciation of the kindness intended.

I sailed from New York on the 1st of June, returning, after an absence
of four and a half months, much improved in health and with impres-
sious, as to science and education in the Old World, which may be of
value in directing the affairs of the Institution. Although limited as to
time, and my plans interfered with somewhat by the war, I visited
England, Ireland, Scotland, Belgium, parts of Germany and France.
But deferring, for the present, an account of my travels and the observa-
tions connected with them, I will merely state that, as your representa-
tive, I was everywhere kindly received, and highly gratified with the
commendations bestowed on the character and operations of the
Institution intrusted to your care.

Respectfully submitted.

tions during the year 1870.

Professor Henry stated that the resolution of the board adopted at
the meeting of February 3, 1870, authorizing him to visit Europe, had
been entirely unexpected to him, as he had received no intimation pre-
vious to its being offered that it was in contemplation ; that he had con-
cluded to avail himself of the resolution, and that he was making prepa-
rations for his departure on the Ist of June; that he intended to make
arrangements for the operations of the Institution which were to be
carried on during his absence; that he intended to settle ali the accounts
which would be due at the time of his departure; to deposit checks for
the salaries accruing during his absence, to be paid on the indorsement
of Professor Baird; and also to deposit to the credit of that officer $2,000,
to pay transportation and incidental expenses; that he had been much
gratified with the expressions of kind feeling which had been called
forth by the announcement of his intended visit to Europe, and the
offers which he had received from the Cunard and Bremen lines of
steamers of a free passage across the ocean.

The board then adjourned.

WASHINGTON, January 18, 1871.
In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smith
sonian Institution, fixing the time of the beginning of their annual meet-
86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

ing on the third Wednesday in January of each year, the Board met this
day in the Regents’ room.

No quorum being present, the Board adjourned to meet on Thursday,
January 26,

WASHINGTON, January 26, 1871.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held at 7p. m. in the Regents’
room. Present: Hon. H. Hamlin, Hon. L. P. Poland, Hon. J. A. Gar-
field, Hon. M. G. Emery, Hon. P. Parker, Rev. Dr. J. Maclean, and the
Secretary, Professor Henry.

In the absence of the Chancellor, Mr. Hamlin was called to the chair.

The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.

The Secretary mentioned his visit to Europe, and stated the fact that
it had been highly satisfactory in regard to the foreign correspondents
of the institution and the estimation in which the establishment is held
in the Old World.

Whereupon, on motion of General Garfield, he was requested at some
future meeting to give a detailed account of his tour, particularly in its
relation to the operations of the Institution.

The Secretary gave an account of the operations of the Institution
since the last meeting of the Board. He stated that in accordance with
the resolution of the Board adopted at the meeting of February 3, 1579,
he had effected an insurance of $10,000 on the east wing and range of
the building, at 662 per cent.; that Congress has appropriated $10,000
for the care of the Government collections for the year ending June 30,
1871, of which $5,024 has already been drawn; that Congress has also
appropriated $10,000 toward the completion of the upper hall, which
sum is to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of the Inte-
rior, who has directed the Architect of the Capitol (Mr. E. Clark) to
oversee the work.

The Secretary read a letter from the agents of the Anchor Line of
steamers, offering to carry the Italian exchanges of the Smithsonian
Institution by their vessels free of charge.

On motion of General Garfield, the Secretary was directed to présent
the thanks of the Board to the agents of that line, and also to the agents
of the lines that had offered him a free passage to Europe.

Dr. Maclean stated that the majority of the executive committee had
decided to alter their report for 1869 to conform to the mode previously
adopted.

The Secretary stated that the business of the Institution had of late
years so much increased that it was no longer possible to conduct it
without further assistance. That this was the case would be evident
from the following statement:
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 87

The Institution has now upwards of 1,800 foreign correspondents con-
nected with the exchanges. It has 400 regular meteorological observery.
It is in communication with almost all the colleges, libraries, literars,
and scientific societies in America, besides being continually called
upon by individuals in every part of the country for information on
scientific subjects. It publishes annually upward of a_ thousand
printed pages, requiring much labor in correcting copy, reading proof.
and attending to the details of printing, binding, &c. Its system of
international exchanges, exclusive of the correspondence, involves a large
amount of time and labor in doing up and directing the separate pack-
ages sent away, and in receiving and distributing those from abroad.
Several thousand volumes are annually received from foreign and
domestic exchanges, which are all recorded at the Institution previous
to being deposited in the Library of Congress. The arrangement of the
material constantly received from the meteorological observers, supply-
ing them with blanks and instructions, occasions another draught on
the labors of the working corps of the Institution.

The continual repairs and care of the building are another item requir-
ing supervision, besides the reconstruction of the parts of the edifice
destroyed by the fire. But above all, the entering and care of the thou-
sands of specimens which are constantly received, their assortment, and
distribution of duplicates, is sufficient to occupy the entire time of a sep-
arate corps of assistants. It may be said with truth that in no institu-
tion has more work been done with a smaller number of persons than
at the Smithsonian.

The difficulty in carrying on the operations of the Institution had been
increased since the last meeting of the Board by the resignation of Mr.
Rhees, who had held the position of chief clerk for seventeen years.
He had, however, lately learned that Mr. Rhees might be induced to re-
turn to his former position, to which the Secretary desired to recall him.

On motion of General Garfield, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary be allowed to appoint a permanent as-
sistant as chief clerk, at a salary not to exceed $175 per month.

General Garfield presented a letter from General Delafield, tendering
his resignation as a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution.

Mr. Poland offered the following resolution, which was adopted unan-
imously :

Resolved by the Board of Regents, That they entertain the highest
appreciation of the services of General Richard Delafield as a member
of the Board, and especially as a member of the executive committee,
and greatly regret the loss caused by his resignation, and desire to ex-
press to him, upon his retirement, their strong personal regard.

Dr. Parker presented the report of the executive committee for 1870,
which was read and aecepted.

The board then adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.
88 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

WASHINGTON, March 9, 1871.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held this evening at 7 o’clock.
Present: Hon. H. Hamlin, Hon. L. P. Poland, Hon. 8.8. Cox, Hon. P.
Parker, General W. T. Sherman, and the Secretary, Professor Henry.

Judge Poland was called to the chair.

The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.

The Secretary stated that by joint resolution of Congress, Genera
William T. Sherman had been elected a Regent for the term of six
years, vice Richard Delafield, resigned.

On motion of Mr. Hamlin, the vacancy existing in the executive com-
mittee was filled by the election of General Sherman.

The Secretary called attention to the fact that the mayor of the city
of Washington was ev officio a Regent, but that under the new territo-
rial government the office of mayor ceased, and suggested the propriety
of action by Congress to substitute the governor of the Territory as
the ex officio member of the board.

Messrs. Hamlin and Poland expressed their intention to bring the sub-
ject before Congress immediately, and anticipated no objection to the
passage of an act providing for the change contemplated.

The Seeretary gave an account of the improvements now being made
in the building under the appropriation by Congress. The new hall
would soon be finished, and it was proposed to devote it mainly to eth-
nology. Mr. B. Waterhouse Hawkins had been employed to prepare
illustrations of extinct animals, &c., to decorate the walls.

The Secretary called attention to the books belonging to James Smith-
son, the founder of the Institution, and requested some action in rela-
tion to the best manner of their preservation. It was thought proper
to preserve them in a metallic case with plate-glass front, open to the
view of the public, but not to be taken out by any one.

The Secretary presented his annual report for 1870, which was read
and accepted.

The board then adjourned sine die.

EULOGY ON PROF. ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE,
LATE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

By Pror. Jospepm HENRY.

Prepared at the request of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and also of
the National Academy of Sciences.

ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE, whose life and character form the sub-
ject of the following eulogy, was the son of Richard Bache, one of eight
children of Sarah, the only daughter of Dr. Benjamin Franklin. His
mother was Sophia Burret Dallas, daughter of Alexander J. Dallas, and
sister of George M. Dallas, whose names are well known in the history
of this country, the former as Secretary of the Treasury, and the latter
as Vice-President of the United States, and subsequently as minister to
the Court of St. James.

The subject of our sketch was born in Philadelphia, on the 19th of
July, 1806. At an early age he became a pupil of a classical school,
and was distinguished by an unusual aptitude in the acquisition of
learning. Shortly before arriving at the age of fifteen he was ap-
pointed a cadet at the National Military Academy at West Point.
Here, though the youngest pupil, he soon attained a high grade of
scholarship, which he maintained during the whole of his course, and
was finally graduated in 1825, at the head of his class. His merit
was in this case the more conspicuous, inasmuch as the class is
shown to have been one of unusual ability, by having numbered no
less than four successful candidates for the honor of adoption into
the Corps of Engineers. It has been mentioned as a solitary in-
stance in the history of the Academy, noted for its rigid discipline, -
that young Bache passed through the entire course of four years with-
out having received a mark of actual demerit, and, what is perhaps not
less uncommon, without having called forth the least manifestation of
envy on the part of his fellow-pupils. On the contrary, his superiority
in scholarship was freely acknowledged by every member of his class,
while his unassuming manner, friendly demeanor, and fidelity to duty
secured him the affection as well as the respect of not only his fellow-
pupils, but also of the officers of the institution. It is also remembered
that his classmates, with instinctive deference to his scrupulous sense
of propriety, forbore to solicit his participation in any amusement which
in the slightest degree conflicted with the rules of the Academy. So
far from this, they commended his course, and took pride to themselves,
92 EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.

as members of his class, in his reputation for high standing and exem-
plary conduct. His room-mate, older by several years than he was, and
byno means noted for regularity or studious habits, constituted himself,
as it were, his guardian, and sedulously excluded ali visitors or other
interruptions to study during the prescribed hours. For this self-
imposed service, gravely rendered as essential to the honor.of the class,
he was accustomed jocularly to claim immunity for his own delin-
quencies or shortcomings. But whatever protection others might
require on account of youth and inexperience, young Bache needed no
guardian to keep him in the line of duty. Impressed beyond his years
with a sense of the responsibility which would devolve upon him as the
eldest of his mother’s family, entertaining a grave appreciation of the
obligations involved in his education at the National Academy, he
resolved from the first to exert his energies to the utmost in qualifying
himself for the duties which he might be called upon to discharge,
whether in professional or private life. Nor was he uninfluenced in this
determination by a consciousness that as a descendant of Franklin he
was, in a certain degree, an object of popular interest, and that on this
account something more than an ordinary responsibility rested upon
him. Ona mind constituted like his an influence of this kind could
not but exert a happy effect.

The character which he established for gentleness of manner and
evenness of temper was not entirely the result of native amiability, for
when a child he is said to have been quick-tempered, and at later
perzods of his life, when suddenly provoked beyond his habitual power
of endurance, he sometimes gave way to manifestations of temper which
might have surprised those who only knew him in his usual state of
calin deportment. These ebullitions were, however, of rare occurrence,
and always of short duration. His marked characteristic was the con-
trol which he had acquired over his passions and feelings, and it was
this which enabled him to suppress all tendency to self-indulgence, to
pursue with unremitting perseverance the course he had marked out, to
observe an undeviating regard for truth and justice, and to cherish
habitually all that would tend to exemplify the kindlier affections of the
heart.

Although young Bache was perhaps predisposed, from hereditary
influence, to form correct habits and adopt high moral principles, yet
these dispositions might have remained dormant had it not been for the
early training and the watchful care of his noble mother. From his
earliest days she checked with gentle reproof every indication of child-
ish revolt against wholesome restraint, and steadily carried out her sys-
tem of discipline so gently and yet so effectually that it met with
scarcely any opposition, and left the conviction that she was always in
the right. Her maternal solicitude did not end with his being placed
under military rule, but was continued through his whole course by
means of aready pen. In the language of one who was permitted to

read her letters to her son while at West Point, ‘“ nothing could be more
admirable than the way in which, amid pleasant gossip and family
news, she would inspire her son with high sentiments and encourage him
to persevering industry.”

As an illustration of his persistency of purpose, it is related that, when
a recitation of more than common length or difficulty was to be prepared
for the morrow, it was no unusual practice of his to place himself on a
seat of unstable equilibrium, which by giving way when volition was
about to lose its power recalled his flagging attention to the allotted
task.

After graduating he was selected, on account of his scholarship, to
remain at the Academy as an assistant professor. In this position,
which gave him an opportunity to review his studies and extend his
reading, he continued one year; when, at his own request, he was
assigned to engineering duty under the late General, then Colonel, Tot-
ten, at Newport, Rhode Island. Here he remained two years, engaged
in constructing fortifications, devoting his extra hours to te study of
physics and chemistry, and, as a recreation, collecting and labeling the
shells of that region. But the most important event of this period of
his life, and that which, doubtless, contributed in a large degree to his
future success, was his becoming acquainted with and subsequent
betrothal to Miss Nancy Clarke Fowler, the daughter of an old and
highly-respected citizen of Newport. With the stinted pay of a lien-
tenant of engineers, out of which his mother and her younger offspring
were to be iow ided for, marriage was not to be thought of, excepting as
an event in the remote distance. Fortunately as anepee aie how-
ever, a change now took place in bis circumstances which enabled him
to gratify the earnest wish of his heart and to secure to himself a com-
panion and helpmate who lavished upon him all her affections, and
through his life ardently devoted all her thoughts and energies to sus-
tain, assist, and encourage him. The change alluded to, and which
opened to him an uninterrupted career of usefulness during the whole
of his active life, was the result of an invitation to the chair of natural
philosophy and chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, at Phila-
delphia. He accepted the position with that unaffected diffidence which
is the usual concomitant of true but untried merit, though, as might
have been anticipated, his eventual success was commensurate with the
industry and ability which had marked his previous progress. Hav-

ng already had some experience as a teacher, he the more readily gained
the entire confidence of the authorities of the university and the affee-
tion of his pupils. He did not, however, rest satisfied with the oceu-
pation of teacher, or with merely imparting knowledge obtained by
the labors of others, but sought to enlarge the bounds of science by
discoveries of his own. As auxiliary to this, he became a member of
the Franklin Institute, a society then newly established for the promo-
tion of the mechanical arts. This society, which still maintains a vig-
94 EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE,

crous existence, was well caleulated to exhibit his talents and develop
his character. It brought him into intimate association with the prin-
cipal manufacturers, engineers, and artisans of the city, and into
relations of friendship with a large number of young men destined, in
more advanced life, to exert an extended influence on public affairs.
He was appointed chairman of one of the most important of its com-
mittees, and was chosen as the expounder of the principles of the insti-
tute at its public exhibitions. Facilities were thus afforded him for the
prosecution of science, which he could not have well commanded in any
other position. Workshops were thrown open to him, and skillful hands
yielded him ready assistance in realizing the conceptions of his suggest-
ive mind. His descent from the illustrious statesman and philosopher
whose name the institute bears, and who is almost regarded as the tute-
lar saint of Philadelphia, no doubt contributed to a prepossession in his
favor, but the influence which he acquired and maintained was due to
his own learning, industry, ability, and courtesy. To these he owed the
favor and distinction of having conferred upon him the principal direct-
orship of the scientific investigations of the institute, and the opportu-
nity which it afforded him of so greatly contributing to the usetulness
of the society and to the advancement of his own reputation.

For a full account of the labors in which he was engaged in his con-
nection with the Franklin Institute we must here be content with refer-
ring to the volumes of its journal from 1828 to 1835 inclusive. We may
pause a moment, however, to notice the investigations relating to the
bursting of steam-boilers, of which he was the principal director. The
public mind had, at that epoch, been so frequently and painfully called
to this subject that the institute was induced to organize a series of
systematic researches in regard to it, the importance of which was soon
recognized by the General Government in the form of an appropriation
for defraying the attendant expenses. In the prosecution of these
inquiries a large amount of information relative to explosions, and sug-
gestions as to their causes, was first collected by correspondence, and on
this was based a series of well-devised experiments, which were exe-
cuted with signal address, and the results interpreted with logical dis-
crimination. The conclusions arrived at were embodied in a series of
propositions, which, after a lapse of more than thirty years, have not
been superseded by any others of more practical value. The most fre-
quent cause of explosion was found to be the gradual heating of the
boiler beyond its power of resistance; and next to this, the sudden gen-
eration of steam by allowing the water to become too low, and its sub-
Sequent contact with the overheated metal of the sides and other
portions of the boiler. The generation of gas from the decomposition
of water as a cause of explosion was disproved, as was also the disper-
sion of water in the form of spray through superheated steam. These
experiments were not unattended with danger, and required, in their
execution, no small amount of personal courage. Accidents were immi-

Se ee
EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE. 95

nent at almost every stage of the investigation; and in some instances
explosions were produced which alarmed the neighborhood. So true
is it that in the pursuit of science dangers are oftentimes voluntarily
encountered, exacting no less courage or firmness of nerve than that which
animates the warrior in the more conspicuous but scarcely more import-
ant conflicts of the battle-field.

The attention of Mr. Bache at this period was not exclusively devoted
to his labors in connection with the Franklin Institute. He was also a
member of the American Philosophical Society, and, as such, in associ-
ation with Hare, Espy, and others interested in the pursuit of various
branches of physics and chemistry. He erected an observatory in the
yard of his dwelling, in which, with the aid of his wife and of his for-
mer pupil, John F. Fraser, he determined with accuracy, for the first
time in this country, the periods of the daily variations of the magnetic
needle, and by another series of observations the connection of the fit-
ful variations of the direction of the magnetie force with the appear-
ance of the aurora borealis.

Again, in connection with his friend, Mr. Espy, he made a minute
survey of a portion of the track of a tornado, which visited New Bruns-
wick, in New Jersey, on the 19th of June, 1835, and from the change of
place and relative position of the trees and other objects, as left by the
wind, he succeeded in establishing the fact,in accordance with the
hypotheses of Mr. Espy, that the effects of the storm were due to an
ascending and progressive column of air, by which all objects within
the influence of the disturbance, on either side the track, were drawn
inward, and not due, as had been supposed, to a horizontal rotation at
the surface, which would tend to throw them outward by centrifugal
projection. In coéperation with Professor Courtenay, he also made a
series of determinations of the magnetic dip at various places in the
United States. Indeed, terrestrial magnetism was with him a favorite
subject, to which he continued to make valuable contributions at inter-
vals during his whole life. The phenomena of heat likewise engaged
much of his attention, and he was the first to show, contrary to gener-
ally-received opinion, that the radiation and consequent absorption of
dark heat is not affected by color. His investigations in this line were
suddenly brought to a close by an accident, which we may be allowed
to mention as furnishing an illustration of his self-control and consid-
erate regard for the feelings of others. After an expenditure of money
which he could ill afford, and of time withdrawn from the hours due to
repose, he had procured and arranged on a stand a series of delicate
instruments intended for a long-meditated experiment on radiant heat.
During his temporary absence his mother, in hurriedly passing through
the apartment, accidentally caught in her dress the support of the
apparatus and brought the whole to the floor, a mass of mingled frag-
ments. The author of this disaster was so painfully affected by the
destruction, of which she had been the unintentional cause, as to be
96 EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.

obliged to leave to his wife the task of breaking the unwelcome tidings
toher son. On receiving the information, he stood for a moment, per-
fectly silent, then hurried out inte the open air to conceal his emotion
and tranquilize his feelings. After a short interval he returned, calm,
affectionate, and apparently cheerful, and neither by word nor look gave
any indication of the pain and disappointment he had so severely expe-
rienced.

Tt should not be forgotten that the labors to which we have alluded
were performed in hours not devoted to his regular duties as a professor
in the university. To these he was obliged to give three hours a day,
besides other time to the preparation of illustrations for his lectures,
while several evenings of the week were claimed by committees of the
Franklin Institute and the Philosophical Society. He was enabled to
execute these inultifarious labors by a division of his time into separate
periods, to each of which was allotted its special occupation. By a
rigid adherence to this system he was always prompt in his engage-
ments, was never hurried, and found time, moreover, to attend to the
claims of friendship and society. He was a zealous and successful
teacher, to whom the imparting of knowledge was a source of unalloyed
and inexhaustible pleasure. His pupils could not fail to be favorably
impressed by his enthusiasm and influenced by his kindness. He
always manifested an interest not only in their proficiency in study, but
also in their general welfare. They regarded him with affection as
well as respect, and while in other class-rooms of the university disor-
der and insubordination occasionally annoyed the teachers, nothing was
to be witnessed in his, but earnest attention and gentlemanly deport-
ment.

His success as an instructor affords a striking confutation of the fal-
lacy which has not unfrequently been advocated in certain quarters, that
men devoted to original research and imbued with habits of mind
which it generates are not well qualified for the office of instructors.
So far is the proposition from having any foundation in fact, that it is
precisely among the most celebrated explorers of science of the present
century that the most successful and noted teachers have been found.
In proof of this the illustrious names of Priestley, De Candolle, Dalton,
Davy, Oersted, Faraday, and a host of others, immediately occur. At
the same time it cannot be denied that itis questionable economy to
devote to the drudgery of drilling youth in the elements of knowledge,
a mind well qualified by nature and training to enlarge tbe boundaries
of thought and increase the stores of knowledge. But it is equally
clear that the practice of teaching is, to a certain extent, not incompati-
ble with the leisure and concentration of mind requisite for original
research; that the latter must, in fact, act beneficially alike on the
instructor and instructed; the former gaining in clearness of concep-
tion in the appreciation of the new truths he is unfolding by imparting
a knowledge of their character to others, while the latter catch, by sym-

pathy, a portion of the enthusiasm of the master, and are stimulated to
exertions of which they would otherwise be incapable.

In 1836, when Professor Bache had just attained the thirtieth year of
his age, his attention and energies received a new direction, constitut-
ing, as it were, a new epoch in his life. This change was caused by a
movement on the part of the trustees of the Girard College for Orphans,
an institution munificently endowed by a benevolent citizen of Phila-
delphia. Preparatory to organizing this institution it was thought
desirable to select a suitable person as president, and to send him abroad
to study the systems of education and methods of instruction and disci-
plineadopted in Europe. The eyes of the entire community were with one
accord directed to our professor as the proper man for this office. He
had, however, become enamored with the pursuit of science, and it was
with difficulty that he could bring himself to regard with favor a prop-
osition which might tend to separate him from this favorite object.
The consideration of a more extended field of usefulness at length pre-
vailed, and he accepted, though not without some lingering regret, the
proffered position. No American ever visited Europe under more favora-
ble circumstances for becoming intimately acquainted with its scientific
and literary institutions. His published researches had given him a
European reputation, and afforded him that ready access to the intelli-
gent and influential classes of society which is denied the traveler
whose only recommendation is the possession of wealth. It cannot be
doubted that he was also favored in this respect by the admiration
which in Hurope still attaches to the name of his renowned ancestor.*
He was everywhere received with marked attention, and from his moral
‘and intellectual qualities did not fail to sustain the prepossessions in his
favor and to secure the friendship and esteem of the most distin-
guished savants of the Old World.

He remained in Europe two years, and on his return embodied the
results of his researches on education in his report to the trustees of
Girard College. This report forms a large octavo volume, and is an
almost exhaustive exposition of the scholastic systems and methods of
instruction in use at the time in England, France, Prussia, Austria,
Switzerland, and Italy. It has done more, perhaps, to improve the
theory and art of education in this country than any other work ever
published; and it has effected this not alone by the statement of facts
derived frors observation, but also by the inferences and suggestions

“The force of this sentiment was quaintly but strongly marked by a slight incident
which occurred when he was in Germany. An elderly savant, on being introduced,
clasped him in his arms, saluted him with a kiss on either cheek, and greeted him with
the exclamation, “Mein Gott, now let me die, since I have lived tosee with mine own
eyes an emanation of the great Franklin!” This compliment was perhaps more flat-
tering than agreeable, since the old professor in question was wont, after the fashion
of his day, to stimulate his lagging faculties by frequent and profuse extractions

with which it abounds. The accounts which are given of the different
schools of Europe are founded on personal inspection ; the results being
noted down at the time with the writer’s habitual regard to accuracy.

After completing his report he was prepared to commence the organ-
ization of the Girard College, but the trustees, partly on account of the
unfinished condition of the building, and partly from a delay in the ad-
justment of the funds of the endowment, were not disposed to put the
institution into immediate operation. In the mean time Professer
Bache, desirous of rendering the information he had acquired of
immediate practical use, offered his services gratuitously to the muni-
cipal authorities of Philadelphia, to organize, on an improved basis, a
system of public education for that city. This offer was gladly accepted,
and he commenced the work with his usual energy and with the cordial
support of the directors and teachers of the common schools. At the
end of the year, finding that the trustees of the college were still unpre-
pared to open the institution, he relinquished the salary, but retained
the office of president, and devoted his time mainly to the organization
of the schools. He was now, however, induced to accept from the city,
as the sole and necessary means of his support, a salary much less than
the one he had relinquished. The result of his labors in regard to the
schools was the establishment of the best system of combined free educa-
tion which had, at that time, been adopted in this country. It has since
generally been regarded as a model, and has been introduced as such
in different cities of the Union.

In 1842, having completed the organization of the schools, and Girard
College still remaining in a stationary condition, he resigned all con-
nection with it, and, yielding to the solicitations of the trustees of the
university, returned to his former chair of natural philosophy and chem-
istry, in order that he might resume the cultivation of science. Not that
it is to be inferred that in his devotion to the advancement of education
he had relinquished or deferred the scientific pursuits to which the habit
of his mind and the bent of his genius continually impelled him, for
during his travelsin Europe he had been careful to provide himself with
a set of portable instruments of physical research, and, as a relief from
the labors imposed by the special object of his mission, he instituted a
connected series of observations at prominent points on the Continent
and in Great Britain, relative to the dip and intensity of terrestrial mag-
netism. These observations were made with the view of ascertaining
the relative direction and strength of the magnetic force in Europe and
America, by the comparison of parallel series of observations in the two
countries with the same instruments. They also served, in most in-
stances, to settle with greater precision than had previously been
attained the relative magnetic condition of the points at which they
were made.

Though the organization of the schools of such a city as Philadelphia
might seem sufficient to absorb all his energy and self devotion, yet

a

ee
EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE. 99

even in the midst of this labor we find our late colleague actively coép-
erating in the great enterprise of the British Association to determine
by contemporaneous observations, at widely separated points, the fluctu-
ations of the magnetic and meteorological elements of the globe. This
coéperation, in which no doubta feeling of national pride mingled itself
with his ardor for the advancement of science, consisted primarily in the
establishment of an observatory, to which the trustees of Girard Col-
lege contributed a full series of instruments, combining all the latest
improvements, and which was supported by the American Philosoph-
ical Society, and a number of liberal and intelligent individuals. The
observations which were here continued at short intervals, both by day
and night, for five years, form a rich mine of statistics, from which,
until within the last few years of his life, the professor drew a highly
interesting series of results, without exhausting the material. In addi-
tion to these observations, he made during his summer vacations a
magnetic survey of Pennylvania.

He was not destined to remain long in his old position in the uni-
versity. Before he had become fairly settled in it and had renewed
his familiarity with its duties, he was called in November, 1843, on
the occasion of the death of Mr. Hassler, Superintendent of the United
States Coast Survey, to fill the important sphere of public duty thus
rendered vacant. His appointment to this position was first suggested
by the members of the American Philosophical Society, and the nomi-
nation fully concurred in by the principal scientific and literary institu-
tions of the country. In this movement he himself took no part, and
indeed regarded the position as one not to be coveted; for while it
opened a wide field for the exercise of talent and the acquisition of an
enviable reputation, it involved responsibilities and presented diffi-
culties of the gravest character. Professor Bache was not one of those
who, abounding in self-confidence, imagine themselves equal to every
exigency, or who seek the distinctions and emoluments of office without
any regard to the services to be rendered or the duties to be discharged.
On the contrary, though early and continued success must have tended
to increase his self-esteem, each new position to which he was called
was entered upon with feelings of solicitude rather than of exultation.
He rightly judged that the proper moment for self-congratulation is not
at the beginning of an arduous and precarious enterprise, but at the
time of its full and successful accomplishment. Nor can it be necessary
to add that this characteristic contributed largely to his success. In
civil service as in the camp, the leader to whom all look with confidence
is not he who, with blind and arrogant self-reliance, disdains caution as
unworthy of courage, but he who, sensitively alive to the dangers to
be encountered, exerts every faculty in calling to his aid every resource
which may tend to secure victory or facilitate retreat.

With whatever misgivings Professor Bache may have undertaken
the task to which he was assigned, it may be truly said that no living
100 BULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE,

man was so well qualified as himself to secure the results which the
nation and its commercial interests demanded. .His education and
training at West Point, his skill in original investigations, his thorough
familiarity with the principles of applied science, his knowledge of the
world, and his gentlemanly deportment, were all in a greater or less de-
eree essential elements in the successful prosecution of the survey. It
would appear as if the training and acquisition of every period of his
life, and the development of every trait of his character, had been
especially ordained to fit him in every respect to overcome the diffienl-
ties of this position. Besides the qualifications we have enumerated,
he possessed rare executive ability, which enabled him to govern and
euide the diverse elements of the vast undertaking with consummate
tact and skill. Quick to perceive and acknowledge merit in others,
he rapidly gathered around him a corps of men eminently well quali-
fied for the execution of the tasks to which he severally assigned them.

The Coast Survey had been recommended to Congress by President
Jefferson as early-as 1807, but it was not until ten vears afterward that
the work was actually commenced, under the superintendence of Pro-
fessor Hassler, an eminent Swiss engineer, whose planus had been pre-
viously sanctioned by the American Philosophical Society. Though the
fundamental features of the survey had been established on the most
approved scientific principles yet so frequent were the changes in the
policy of the Government, and so limited were the appropriations, that, —
even up tothetime of Professor Bache’s appointment, in 1843, little more
than a beginning had been made. The survey, so far as accomplished,
extended only from New York Harbor to Point Judith, on the east coast,
and southward to Cape Henlopen. The new Superintendent saw the
necessity of greatly enlarging the plan,so as to embrace a much broader
field of simultaneous labor than it had previously included. He divided
the whole coast line into sections, and organized, under separate parties,
the essential operations of the survey simultaneously in each. Hecom-
menced the exploration of the Gulf Stream, and at the same time pro-
jected a series of observations on the tides, on the magnetism of the earth,
and the direction of the winds at different seasons of the year. He
also instituted a succession of researches in regard to the bottom of the
ocean within soundings, and the forms of animal life which are found
there, thus offering new and unexpected indications to the navigator.
He pressed into service, for the determination of the longitude, the elec-
tric telegraph; for the ready reproduction of charts, photography; and
for multiplying copper-plate engravings, the new art of electrotyping.
In planning and directing the execution of these varied improvements,
which exacted so much comprehensiveness in design and minuteness in
detail, Protessor Bache was entirely successful. He was equally for-
tunate, principally through the moral influence of bis character, in
impressing upon the Government, and especially upon Congress, a more
just estimate of what such a survey required for its maintenance and

EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE. 101

ereditable prosecution. Not only was a largely-increased appropriation
needed to carry out this more comprehensive plan, but also to meet the
expenses consequent upon the extension of the shore-line itself. Our
sea-coast, when the survey commenced, already exceeded in length that
of any other civilized nation, but, in 1845, it was still more extended by
the annexation of Texas, and again, in 1848, by our acquisitions on the
Pacific. Professor Bache was in the habit of answering the question
often propounded to him by members of Congress, “* When will this
survey be completed ?” by asking, ‘* When will you cease annexing new
territory ?” a reply not less significant at the present day than when it
was first given, and which may continue long to be applicable under
the expansive tendencies of our national policy.

When Professor Bache took charge of the survey, it was still almost
in its incipient stage, subjected to misapprehension, assailed by unjust
prejudice, and liable, during any session of Congress, to be suspended
or abolished. When he died, it had conquered prejudice, silenced oppo-
sition, and become established on a firm foundation as one of the perma-
nent bureaus of the executive Government. The importance of the
work, which was always highly appreciated by the mariner, became
strikingly obvious to the general public through the service which it
rendered during the late war, in furnishing accurate charts and sailing
directions for the guidance of our squadrons along the southern coast.
Nor was this alone ; an active participation was also borne by the officers
of the survey in the attack of the United States Navy on Sumter, Port
Royal, Fort Fisher, Mobile, New Urleans, and other strongholds, while
constant aid was rendered by them in the navigation of the inlets and
channels. and in the avoidance of hidden rocks or shoals with which
none could be more minutely acquainted. Though the value of the sur-
vey was signally conspicuous on these occasions, it needs but little
reflection to be convinced of its essential connection with the general
prosperity of the country. Whatever diminishes the danger of depart-
ure from or an approach to our shores facilitates commerce, and thus
renders more valuable the products of our industry, even in portions
of our land most remote from the sea-board. But the survey should not
be viewed alone in its economical relations, since, as an enlightened and
liberal people, we owe it to the great community of nations and the
cause of humanity to supply the world with accurate charts of our pre-
carious coast, as well as to furnish it with all the other aids to safer
navigation which the science and experience of the age may devise.

Professor Bache, with his enlightened appreciation of the value of
abstract science, kept constantly in view the various problems relative
to the physics of the globe, which are directly or even incidentally con-
nected with the survey of the coast, and ever cherished the hope of
being permitted to complete his labors by their solution. Among these
was anew determination of the magnitude and form of the earth, and
the variations in the intensity of terrestrial gravity at various points on
102 EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.

the continent of North America; the discussion of the general theory
of the tides; the magnetic condition of the continent; and the improve-
ment of the general map of the United States, by determining its rela-
tion to the coast line, and the precise geographical positions of the most
important points in the interior. Though his hopes in regard to these
problems were not destined to be realized by himself, fortunately for
the cause of science they havé been left in charge of a successor in the
person of his ardent friend and collaborator. Professor Peirce, to whose
genius and industry we may confidently look for that full exposition of
the work which, while it entitles him to the highest approbation of
the scientific world, will render ample justice to the labors and sagacity
of his lamented predecessor.

Besides having- charge of the Coast Survey, Professor Bache was
Superintendent of Weights and Measures, and in the exercise of this
function directed a series of investigations relative to the collection
of excise duties on distilled spirits, and likewise superintended the
construction of a large number of sets of standard weights and meas-
ures for distribution among the several States of the Union. He
was also appointed one of a commission to examine into the condi-

tion of the light-house system of this country, and to report upon any |

improvements calculated to render it more efiicient. In the investiga-
tions pertaining to this subject, involving, as they do, a knowledge of a
wide range of applied science, he took a lively interest, and rendered
important service in the organization of the admirable system which was
adopted and still remains in operation. This commission of investiga-
tion was afterward merged in the present Light-House Board, of which
he continued a member until the time of his death.

In 1846 he had been named in the act of incorporation as one of the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and by successive reélection
was continued by Congress in this office until his death, a period of
nearly twenty years. To say that he assisted in shaping the policy of
the establishment would not be enough. It was almost exclusively
through his predominating influence that the policy which has given
the institution its present celebrity was, after much opposition, finally
adopted. ‘The object of the donation, it will be remembered, had been
expressed in terms so concise that its import could scarcely be at once
appreciated by the general public, though to the cultivators of science,
to which class Smithson himself belonged, the language employed failed
not to convey clear and precise ideas. Out of this state of things it is
not surprising that difference of opinion should arise respecting the
proper means to be adopted to realize the intentions of the founder of
the institution. Professor Bache with persistent firmness, tempered by
his usual moderation, advocated the appropriation of the proceeds of
the funds principally to the plan set forth in the first report of the See-
retary, namely, of encouraging and supporting original research in the

different branches of science. Unfortunately this policy could only be -
7

EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE. 103

partially adopted, on account of the restrictions of the enactment of Con-
gress, by which provision was to be made for certain specified objects.
He strenuously opposed the contemplated expenditure of a most dispro-
portionate sum in the erection and maintenance of a costly edifice; but
failing to prevent this; he imtroduced the resolution adopted by the
board as a compromise, whereby the mischief which he could not wholly
avert might at least be lessened. This resolution provided that the
time of the erection of the building should be extended over several years,
while the fund appropriated for the purpose, being in the mean time
invested in a safe and productive manner, would serve in some degree
to counterbalance the effect of the great and unnecessary outlay which
had been resolved on. It would be difficult for the secretary, however
unwilling to intrude anything personal on this occasion, to forbear men-.
tioning that it was entirely due to the persuasive influence of the pro-
fessor that he was induced, almost against his own better judgment, to
leave the quiet pursuit of science and the congenial employment of
college instruction to assume the laborious and responsible duties of the
ofiice to which, through the partiality of friendship, he had been called.
Nor would it be possible for him to abstain from acknowledging with
heart-felt emotion that he was from first to last supported and sus-
tained in his difficult position by the fraternal sympathy, the pru-
dent counsel, and the unwavering friendship of the lamented deceased.

His demeanor in the board was quiet and unobtrusive, and his opinions
sought no support in elaborated or premeditated argument; but when a
topic likely to lead to difficulty in discussion was introduced, he seldom
failed, with that admirable tact for which he was always noted, to dis-
pose of it by some suggestion so judicious and appropriate as to secure
ready acquiescence and harmonious action. The loss of such a man in
the councils of the Institution, when we consider the characteristics
which it has been our aim to portray, must, indeed, be regarded as little
less than irreparable.

As a vice-president of the United States Sanitary Commission his
influence was felt in selecting proper agents, and suggesting efficient
means for collecting and distributing the liberal contributions offered
for ameliorating the condition of our soldiers during the war. But the
services which he rendered the Government during the recent struggle
were not confined to this agency, or to the immediate operations of the
Coast Survey. He was called into consultations to discuss plans of
attack on the part of the Navy, and for its codperation with the Army.
He acted also as a member of a commission to which various projects,
professing to improve the art of war, were referred, and in this capacity
it is not too much to say that his judicious counsel contributed to save
the Government millions of dollars by preventing the adoption of plausi-
ble though impracticable propositions from which nothing but failure
and loss could have resulted.

One of the last acts of his life was an exemplification of the devoted
sal

104 EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.

affection which he had always borne to his native city, whither it was his
cherished intention to return when he should be at last released from offi-
cial duty. At the request of the governor of Pennsylvania, although over-
whelmed with other public labors, he pianned lines of defenses for Philadel-
phia, and to a certain extent personally superintended their construction.
Unaccustomed for many years to direct exposure to the sun, this work
proved too much for his physical strength and brought on the first indica-
tions of that malady which terminated his life. Though apparently of
a vigorous constitution, and capable, under the exciterhent of official
life, of bearing an unusual amount of bodily fatigue, yet he was subject
at intervals to “sick headaches,” a disease which seems to have been
hereditary, and which perhaps conspired with other causes in termi-
nating his useful and distinguished career. Previous to the war he had
spent the warmer part of each summer in a tent, at some point of the
primary triangulation of the survey, whence he directed the various
parties in the field by correspondence; and as the point was usually at
the top of a mountain, or at some elevated position, from which other
stations of the survey could be seen, he did not want for invigorating

2

air. With this, and the exercise of measuring angles he laid in a store of

health sufficient to enable him to carry on without interruption the
arduous duties of the remaining portion of the year. But after the com-
mencement of the war his presence was continually required in Wash-
ington to give advice and information as to military and naval opera-
tions, and to attend the meetings of the scientific commission to which
we have previously referred. He was, therefore, no longer able to avail
himself of the recuperating influence of mountain air, and in view of this
his valuable life may be said to have been one of the sacrifices offered
for the preservation of the Union. The first indications of the insidious
Gisease which gradually sapped the citadel of life were numbness in the
fingers of his right hand, and, on one occasion, for a short time only,
loss of memory. Though these symptoms gave him some uneasiness,
they did not diminish his exertions in the line of his duty. Other symp-
toms, however, exhibited themselves, which, though awaking anxiety,
did not much alarm his friends, until he was suddenly deprived, in a con-
siderable degree, of the power of locomotion and of the expression of
ideas ; the result, it was supposed, of a softening of the brain. But though
the power of expression was paralyzed, his memory appeared to retain all
the impressions of the past, and he evidently took much pleasure in hay-
ing recalled to him scenes and events of years gone by. For several months
he was very anxious as to the business of the Coast Survey, and it was
with difficulty he could be restrained from resuming in full the duties of
his office; but as the malady increased his perception of external objects
diminished. He took less and less interest in passing events, and finally
seemed to withdraw his attention from the exterior world, with which
he almost ceased thenceforth to hold any active communieation. It was
hoped that a voyage to Europe, through the excitements of shipboard

4
q
EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE. 105

and the revival of old associations, would be of service to him; but, not-
withstanding an occasional manifestation of his wonted spirit of social
and intellectual enjoyment at the encounter of a friend of former times
or distinguished associate in the walks of science, he returned from a
sojourn abroad of eighteen months without having experienced any per-
manent abatement in the progress of his malady. He lingered for a short
time longer, and finally resigned his breath at Newport, Rhode Island,
on the 17th of February, 1867, in the sixty-first year of his age.

It would be impossible to name an American distinguished on purely
scientific grounds to whom the enlightened sentiment of his own country-
men and of foreign nations has awarded more emphatic marks of ad-
miration and esteem. The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on
him by the principal universities of this country, and few of our leading
societies were willing to forego the honor of numbering him among their

associates. He was elected in succession president of the American
Philosophical Society, of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, and, of the National Academy of Sciences established
by Congress. Nor were foreigners less forward in acknowledging
his merit. He was a member of the Royal Society of London,
of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, of the Insti-
tute of France, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Roy al and Impe-
rial Gsoorphical Society of Vienna, the Royal Academy of Turin, the
Mathematical Society of Hamburg, the Academy of Sciences in the
Institute of Bologna, the Royal Astronomical Society of London, and
of the Royal Irish Academy of Dublin. In addition to these testimonies
of appreciation, several medals were awarded to him by foreign govern-
ments for his distinguished services in the Coast Survey and in the
cause of science generally.

The life we have here sketched is eminently suggestive, both from a
philosophical and a practical point of view. It presents an unbroken
series of successful efforts, with no interruptioms in its sustained and
constantly ascending course; all parts follow each other in harmonious
continuity; and not only is each stage of its progress in advance of the
one which preceded it, but it furnishes the means of education for that
which succeeded. It is not merely curiosity, landable as that might be,
but a sense of the importance of the inquiry, which prompts us to ask,
What were the mental and moral characteristics of the mind which pro-
dueed such results? And we say intentionally, the mind which produced
these results, for although it be true that accident has in many cases a
determining influence on the fortunes of an individual, it will be clear
from what precedes, or we shall have greatly failed in the task which
we proposed to ourselves, that the element of casualty had but little to do
with the success which crowned the life to which the question at present
relates. ;

From long acquaintance with him and critical study of the events of
106 EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.

his life, and the distinctive manifestations of his moral and intellectual
nature, we venture, though not without hesitation, to present the fol-
lowing analysis of the character of one who has performed so conspicu-
ous a part, and in whose memory so many are deeply interested.

Alexander Dallas Bache possessed, or we may perhaps say originally
inherited, a mind of strong general powers, with no faculty in excess or
in deficiency, but, as a whole, capable of unusual expansion or develop-
ment in any direction which early training or the education of life might
determine. He also possessed strong passions, which, instead of exert-
ing an unfavorable effect on his character by their indulgence, became,
under the restraining influence to which they were in due season sub-
jected, areserved energy, asit were, ready to manifest itself spontaneously
and at any time in the vindication of truth and justice. He was like-
wise endowed with a power of will which, controlling all his faculties
and propensities, rendered them subservient to those fixed purposes
which had once received the sanction of his deliberate judgment. Em-
inent also among his characteristics, and perhaps most conspicuous of
all, was the social element of refined humanity, a regard for his fellow-
man, which craved as an essential want of his nature fraternal sympa-
thy, not only with those within the wide circle of his daily associations,
but with those from whom he could expect no reciprocation of the sen-
timent, the entire brotherhood of mankind. These characteristics, with
a nice perception of right and a conscience always ready to enforce its
mandates, are, we think, sufficient to explain the remarkable career we
have described.

They were perhaps indicated by himself, though with an admission
not to be accepted without some reserve, ina conversation with the writer
of this sketch in reference to his entrance at West Point. “I knew,” he
said, “that | had nothing like genius, but I thought I was capable by
hard study of accomplishing something, and I resolved to do my best,
and if possible to gain the approbation of the teachers, and, above all,
to make myself loved and respected by my classmates.”

To illustrate the progressive development of the individual traits of
his character, we may be allowed to dwell for a moment on a few analyt-
jeal details. The early period of his life, including that which pre-
ceded his first call to Philadelphia, was almost wholly devoted to the
improvement of the mechanical, or the “doing” faculties of his mind,
and but httle attention was given to invention, or the exercise of ori-
ginal thought. His final examination at the Academy, perfect as it was
in its kind, only exhibited his capacity for the acquisition of knowledge
not the power to originate or apply it. When his efforts were first
turned in the latter direction, he evinced, as I well remember, no espe-
cial aptitude for it that would indicate future success; but in a short
time, and under the stimulus of the associations into which he was
thrown in Philadelphia, the faculties of investigation and of generaliza-
tion were rapidly developed, and had he not been partially turned aside

;
EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE. 107

from such pursuits, I doubt not but that he would have still more highly
distinguished himself in the line of experimental research. Again, the
change in the circumstances and relations of his life produced by his
election to the presidency of Girard College introduced him to a famil-
iarity with an entirely new class of ideas, which served to exercise and
expand another faculty of his mind, that, namely, which observes and
appreciates moral truths, though without impairing his aptitude for
physical research. In like manner, his foreign mission with reference
to popular education, by bringing him into intimate and friendly associa-
tion with minds of the first order in the principal cities of Europe, afforded
him an opportunity for enlarging the sphere of his sympathies, as well
as of studying men under a great variety of social and mental peculiar-
ities.

Again, his long residence and high social position at the seat of Goy-
ernment, his intimate acquaintance and friendly intercourse with states-
men and politicians, imbued him with a thorough knowledge of the work-
ing of the Government, such as few have ever possessed, while his ex-
ertions to sustain the Coast Survey and improve its condition served to
call into active operation his power to appreciate character, to discern
motives, and, therefore, to convince, persuade, and control men. His
ability in this latter respect was remarkable; a personal interview with
an opponent of the survey scarcely ever failed to convert perhaps an
active enemy into an influential friend. His success in this respect
often astonished those who frequently harassed Congress with propositions
covertly designed to promote their own interest at the expense of public
utility; hence the exclamation was not unfrequently heard, “‘ Bache is
certainly a wonderful manager.” If that which is unusual constitutes,
an element of wonder, then the exclamation was not without truth,
though not in the sense of those by whom it was uttered, for he never
advocated any measure that was not just, expedient, and proper, either
as concerned the interests of the country or the welfare of his species.

On the whole, if we would seek the real secret of his influence over
his fellow-men, it would be found, no doubt, to have consisted in the
singular abnegation of self which pervaded his whole conduct; his
great practical wisdom, his honesty of purpose, and his genial though quiet
and unobtrusive manner. In the exercise of these characteristics, he
was so far from the least appearance of dissimulation, that no one ever
approached him without feeling that it was equally impossible to doubt
the purity of his intentions as it was to elude the penetration of his
quiet but thorough scrutiny. His ealmness served as a shield from
within and without; and as a guard against himself as well as a pro-
tection against others. It enabled him to weigh the motives and observe
the character of those who consulted him with the view of securing his
influence or gaining his patronage. His genial nature enabled him to
descend gracefully from the heights of science and to enter fully and
frankly into the feelings of any company with which he might be
108 EULOGY ON PROFESSOR ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE.

thrown. In this he was aided by a playfulness of fancy and a quiet
humor which banished any reserve that might have been produced by
a knowledge of his superior talents and attainments. He was, though
by no means gifted with those attractions of person which influence at
first sight, a favorite with all ages, and particularly with the sex
whose discrimination of character is said to be least fallible. It seems
almost superfluous to say of such a man that his friendship was open
and unwavering, that his confidence once bestowed could be shaken by
no mere difference of opinion or conflict of personal interests. Severe
to himself under the responsibility of duty, and in the punctual observ-
ance of his engagements, his indulgence was reserved for the weak and
the erring. Though his outer life was free from disappointments or
reverses, and though he walked as it were in perpetual sunshine, all was
not so within. Besides the anxiety and solicitude incident to the respon-
sible duties of his position, occasions of trial and profound sorrow were
not spared him. He was called to mourn the untimely loss of a beloved
brother, who fell a victim to his zeal for the professor’s service in the
survey of the Gulf Stream; of another brother, the youngest and last,
also an officer of the Navy, and a general favorite, who was drowned
on the coast of California; and lastly of a sister, whom he had adopted
and cherished asa child. In these seasons of affliction he found conso-
lation in the steadfast convictions of religious faith. Nurtured in the
forms and principles of the Episcopal church, he was a devout wor-
shiper in the sanctuary, though not bigoted in his attachment to the
peculiar ordinances of that communion. He fully recognized the union
of science and religion, and held with unwavering constancy the belief
that revelation, properly interpreted, and science, rightly understood,
inust ultimately join in perfect accord in reference to the great truths
essential to the well-being of man.

As an evidence of his high appreciation of abstract science derived
from original investigation, he left his property in trust to the National
Academy of Sciences, the income to be devoted to the prosecution of
researches in physical and natural science by assisting experimentalists
and observers, and the publication of the results of their investigations.

I here close this imperfect sketch, in which I am conscious of having
passed in silence many admirable traits of character and conduct, and of
having very inadequately portrayed others, with the remark that, though
our companion and brother has departed, his works and his influence
still remain to us; that, sorrow as we must for his loss, we ean still
recall with pride and satisfaction the example he has left us of all that,
in heart, in spirit, and in life, the true man of science ought to be.

The following is a list of the published scientific papers of Alexander
Dallas Bache, copied from the appendix to an address by Dr. Benjamin

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.
By ALEXANDER DaLuas BACHE.

[The following lecture on Switzerland, from the manuscript of Professor Bache, is
here published for the first time to illustrate in connection with the foregoing eulogy
his habit of observation and his facility of description. It presents, however, a lively
sketch of one of the most interesting portions of the earth, whether considered from a
historical or physical point of view, and we doubt not will be read with pleasure,
especially by all who have been favored with a visit to the delightful region which it
describes. The original notes from which the lecture was prepared were taken during
the Professor’s visit to Switzerland in 1837~38. The foot-notes, exhibiting the present
condition of the country, have been kindly furnished to us by the Hon. Mr. Hitz, Swiss
consul general in this city.—J. H.]

Travelers relate that in certain conditions of the atmosphere a spec-
tator standing upon the shore at Reggio, and looking upon the smooth
waters of the Straits of Messina, sees suddenly rise before him, as if by
magic, the walls, towers, palaces, domes, and streets of a city, in which
mimic life goes on, men and animals moving noiselessly to and fro. The
illusion is as complete as if the waters of the bay were a foundation
upon which the genii of the lamp or of the ring had suddenly erected
their magic structures. This is an extreme case of the ordinary illusion
presented to those who, in a calm clear day, look at distant objects
across a wide expanse of bay or river. Familiar forms are strangely
distorted; level shores appear precipitous; the puny sloop swells into
the size of a frigate; the fisherman’s boat becomes a dismasted sloop,
and its occupant a giant. Just soit is when in mental vision we attempt
to look through an atmosphere disturbed by the habits and prejudices
to which we are accustomed. Unreal towers and walls appear, and
objects so lose their shapes that the most familiar forms escape recog-
nition. Every country has its prejudices resulting from education, from
all the influences, political, moral, social, and physical which surround
and act upon its citizens. By these, in general, the observer of men
and things is biased, and he who through the mists of his national or
personal prejudices seeks to realize their just forms and proportions,
may mistake the pigmy for a giant, the shallop for a frigate.

In estimating the institutions of the Old World we are prone to forget
that the materials for our judgment are generally furnished by the opin-
ions of those who are brought up under a totally different state of things
from that which exists around us. The conclusions which we thus form
may be the very opposite of those to which we would have come our-
selves, had our own prepossessions furnished the inferences from the
facts. In neither case, perhaps, would truth be arrived at, but in the
118 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

former the result may be deeply injurious, because leading to modes
and habits of thought and action not in harmony with the peculiarities
of our country.

Impressed with the importance to Americans of judging independ-
ently of the institutions of Europe, I formerly took occasion in another
place to present a cursory view of the capital of Austria, as illustrating
the effects of institutions the very opposite of our own. I design on
this occasion to occupy your attention, without further exceeding the
limits of a lecture than is absolutely necessary, by a notice of men and
things in the only federated republic of Europe, Switzerland. I cannot
pretend to set before you a panoramic view, but merely a few detached
pictures in outline, so selected as to convey a tolerably fair idea of
republican Switzerland as it appeared to an American. By contem-
plating it we shall have an example of the practical working of repub-
licanism in the Old World, under various modifications, and with the
disadvantages of being hemmed in on all sides by monarchies. We shall
thus see the power of this system to civilize and to enlighten.

In the course of these sketches we shall find much bearing both
directly and indirectly upon the objects which this Institute was estab-
lished to promote. Upon the map of Europe Switzerland is so well
defined by its boundaries that there is no danger of its escaping the
sight on account of its small size. The Rhine constitutes nearly two
sides of this boundary, from the point where the various streams from
the glaciers of the Grisons have met to form a river into the lake of
Constance, and from its exit thence to where the Jura Mountains turn
its course to the Northern Ocean. The Jura separates Switzerland from
France, and with merely an outlet for the Rhone, the Alps take up the
line, dividing rugged Switzerland from the plains of Northern Italy.

The picturesque features of this country have furnished themes for the
poet, the painter, and tourist. Under the influence of its snow-capped
mountains, its shady and sequestered valleys, its rough glaciers, and its
placid lakes, common-place men have warmed into something approach-
ing to poetic fervor, and men of genius have poured forth their inspira-
tions in verse or lofty prose. It is impossible to call up even in memory
those scenes with all their attendant circumstances of romance—both
nature and life so different from that to which we are accustomed—
without feeling the heart and the imagination moved beyond their
wont. .

“Who first beholds those everlasting clouds—
Those mighty hills, so shadowy, so sublime,
As rather to belong to heaven than earth,
But instantly receives into his soul
A sense, a feeling, that he loses not;
A something, that informs him ’tis an hour
Whence he may date henceforward and forever.”

But who shall dare to speak in plain prose of scenes of which the muse
of Byron hassung? The rugged nature of the country within this bound-

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND. 119

ary has had its effect in determining the character of institutions as
well as of individuals. Small tracts of country are as completely sepa-
rated by mountains of difficult passage, as by distance, differ in the
modes and facilities of life, have different interests, and consequently
separate organizations. The character of the topography has divided
the country into many small states, and has produced striking differ-
ences in language and manners, in religions, social and political organ-
ization, in a country of not more than one-third the extent of Pennsyl-
vania, and with about the same population of that entire State.

The present Swiss confederation consists of twenty-two sovereign
states called cantons, the division of which, according to geographical
position, includes also that of language.* Thus the north and middle of
Switzerland contains the sixteen cantons where a dialect of the German
is spoken, Zurich being the principal canton on the north, and Berne
in the middle. To the west and south’ of the middle are the mixed
German and French cantons of Neuchatel, Friberg, and Valais; to the
southeast the mixed German Romanic and Italian canton of the Grisons,
or gray league, subdivided into its little sovereign states. On the south-
west are the French cantons of Vaud and Geneva, and on the south of
the middle the Italian canton of Tessin. While the language spoken
by these people is determined by their proximity to those who speak it
in its purity, their social, religious, and political institutions may almost
be said to be uninfluenced by this circumstance. These are the results
of other causes, many of which may be found in their history.

A Florentine scholar relating to me unpublished anecdotes of the
horrors enacted by members of the far-famed family of the Medici, with
Italian fervor broke out into this apostrophe: ‘‘ Happy your great coun-
try, which has not the chains of a dark history to bind it to the institu-
tions and manners of a by-gone age. Beware how you men of the pre-
sent day sully the pure page which records the actions of your forefathers,
of vour Adams, your Franklin, your Washington.”

The condition of a country at a past day must assuredly influence its
present state as the summer’s sun upon the snow-covered mountains of
the Alps increases the autumnal flow of the river whose sources lie
among them, or as the accumulation of the winter’s snow upon the
mountain’s peak produces the summer’s avalanche.

The history of the Swiss republics shows the circumstances which
prepared and the impulses which gave existence to each, and a glorious
history it is upon which to found progress in virtue and liberty.

Nearly in the center of Switzerland is a mountainous district which
the Romans never reached, into which the bands of Attila never pene-
trated, and where no ruins of feudal castles exist to show that in the

120 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

Middle Ages the inhabitants had amaster. Divided, generally, by rocky
barriers into separate communities, the people are in a degree united by
the beautiful lake of the Forest cantons. These people, from the ear-
liest records, have been, and are now, poor and pastoral. They form the
democratic cantons of Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden, the nucleus of
Swiss confederation. As early as the twelfth century they had a repre-
sentative at the court of the Emperor of Germany, then the titular sov-
ereign of Switzerland. Rudolph of Habsburg, whose castle was near
the confluence of the Reuss and the Aar, the father of the founder of
the house of Austria, was elected the representative of these peasants,
and subsequently the family claimed the dignitary to be hereditary.
This claim was never admitted, and to its impolitic enforcement by
Albert of Habsburg, accompanied by circumstances of peculiar indignity
on his own part, and of great cruelty and oppression on the part of his
bailiff Gessler, was owing the revolution headed by Tell and his com-
panions.

In pursuit of these same hereditary rights, Frederick of Austria, with
his armies, entered the Forest cantons by their mountain passes, deter-
mined to overrun and crush them. He was successfully resisted at the
pass of Morgarten by one thousand three hundred men, and nine thou-
sand of his troops perished in this defeat. Thus was developed that
fierce military spirit which has led the Swiss of every age to acts of the
most devoted heroism.

From their wars with the dukes of Austria, the Swiss came out in
1412 with eight cantons recognized as independent. The appetite for
war had been whetted by this successful resistance to oppression, and
was carried to its height by the defeat of Charles the Bold of Burgundy,
and of his magnificent troops, at Grandson and at Morat. The spoils
of these great armies suddenly enriched the people. Labor was neg-
lected and fell into contempt, and the profession of arms alone consid-
ered worthy occupation for a Swiss. The nation was for atime debased
by a mercenary military spirit, and it required two centuries of blood-
shed to impress the lessons necessary to their regeneration. The wars
of the Reformation gave the last of this series of unhappy lessons, and
at their close left the several cantons confirmed in their attachment to
the same churches in behalf of which they had expended to no purpose
their blood and treasure. In i712 the confederation had attained nearly
its present limits, but some of the present cantons were held as trib-
utary provinces by the others. The Swiss spirit of former days burst
forth when republican France began to proselyte by force of arms, and
the constitution of the new Helvetic republic was presented at the point
of the sword, and enforced by its edge. While the cantons of the plain
were held by the French armies, pleasantly occupied in appropriating
the savings of the aristocrats, and in giving liberty to the people by
depriving them of their independence, the Forest cantons dared to
declare that they had been free since the days of Tell, and Melchthal,

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND. 12t

and Winkelried; that they required no lessons in self-government, and
would resist invasion of their civil and religious rights to the death.
Aloys Reding, a descendant of Rudolph, who had defeated Frederick of
Austria at the pass of Morgarten five hundred years before, occupied
again that Thermopyle of his country. The mode of warfare had
changed; personal strength has little advantage in contests with fire-
arms; rocks and stones, though launched from mountain heights, are
imperfect substitutes for cannon balls; numbers can no longer be coun-
terbalanced by valor. Four thousand men, aided by their women and
children, held this pass two days against forty thousand, but at last
were forced to yield, and the Forest cantons received the constitution
which they could no longer resist.

The days of the Jacobins passed ; those of the First Consul and Empe-
ror dawned, waxed, and waned, and Switzerland was the battle-ground
on which the French, Austrians, and Russians contended, everywhere
desolating the country with fire and sword. The pacification of Europe
put an end to the horrible scenes then enacted, and the republics of
Switzerland were left to reorganize themselves, affording in their rapid
recovery from their desolate condition a strong evidence of the energy
of the people. The organization then adopted, with some changes, exists
at present. Forty years of exemption from war have obliterated the
external marks of the misery of the country, but in the institutions of
the different States the influence of their past history is still entirely
visible.

The rough sketches which I must pass rapidly before you, to give
some idea of the present condition of the country, will be taken from
the French and German cantons—those which exercise the most influ-
ence upon Switzerland as it is, and as it will be.

Geneva, the oldest city of the confederation, is the frontier town upon
the southwest. Its foundation dates before that of Rome itself. The
inhabitants were among those Helvetians whom the fortune of war at
last put at the mercy of the Romans who occupied the city with their
legions. The Middle Ages found it a place of importance under the sov-
ereignty of the Duke of Savoy; the see of a bishop, nominated by the
duke, who was the temporal as well as the ecclesiastical ruler. History
represents its moral and intellectual condition to have been low, its
commerce moderate. Under the preaching of Farel in 1535 the citizens
declared for the Reformation, and drove the bishop from their walls.
In 1536, Calvin, a native of Picardy, came among them, and by his pow-
erful preaching brought about a second reformation which changed
entirely not only the face of society, but the habits and modes of thought
and action of the people.

At a little distance from the water the shores of Lake Leman, or the
Lake of Geneva, rise abruptly, and on this irregular ground, just where
the Rhone issues from the lake, the city is built. The nature of the site
thus divides Geneva into an upper and lower town. Below, and on the
132 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

steep streets occupying the slope, are the houses and shops of the trades-
men, and on the hill are those of the more wealthy citizens, once the
Genevese aristocracy. The suburb on the opposite bank of the Rhone is
joined by bridges to the old town, and rivals the hill-top, by its fine
houses. The town is surrounded by ramparts, once of use to resist ene-
mies and now affording pleasant promenades. These ramparts often
protected the town in times gone by, but did not prevent its occupation by
the French in 1798, and must necessarily yield to any enemy which has
the means of bombarding the city. The conviction of their inutility has
led the liberal governments of Berne and Zurich to raze these ramparts
to the ground.*

The anniversary of an unsuccessful attempt, by the Savoyards, in 1602,
to surprise the city, is stillcelebrated. Under cover of a dark night, and
by the use of scaling ladders painted black the better to conceal them,
a party of the enemy’s pioneers had mounted the walls and penetrated
into the town, when they were discovered by the careless watch. The
citizens were surprised but not daunted, and issuing from their houses
with such arms as they could seize, fellupon the invaders. The first gun
fired from the ramparts carried away several of the scaling ladders, and
prevented succor. Inthe morning the people assembled in the venerable
church ef St. Peter, when the pastor opened public worship by giving
out the 124th Psalm; and since, on every 12th of December, the same
sounds arise trom the voices of many worshipers:

“ Tf it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say :

“ Tf it had not been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us.”

The University of Geneva was founded by Calvin, in 1564, and has
always enjoyed a high reputation. In order to connect it advantage-
ously with the grammar schools which prepare its pupils, the auditories
have been provided, in which the character of the studies, the modes of
teaching, and the discipline are intermediate between those of the school
and of the university. Public instruction is under the control of the
council of state, but while the impress of the best minds in this intel-
lectual city is upon its higher institutions, the common schools are not,
nor can they soon be made, what they ought to be. Like most of their
fellow-republicans of the United States, the Genevese began their educa-
tional edifice at the top. They have yet to learn that parsimony in
education under a popular government is waste; that unless instruction
be really public it is better left entirely in the hands of individuals;
that it is in vain to move the waters and then to pretend to say to the
raised wave, thus far shalt thou go and no farther. The Genevese youth
of families in easy circumstances find means of the best education: do
they on this account effectively control those to whom the so-called re-
public gives less light? Witness the frequent revolutions in this city,
and these not always without bloodshed. The government is founded

* The ramparts here referred to have all been removed, and Geneva at the present
dute (1871) presents no evidences of ever having been a fortified city.

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND. 123

on a popular revolution, and all attempts to impede the progress of pop-
ular institutions must in the end prove futile. If the light of education
be denied to the people by their rulers, the revolutions will be bloody;
and in no case can there be happiness or safety without the full exercise
of popular rights, by a thoroughly educated people.*

Calvin, as head of the consistory, whose members then formed one-
third of the council of state, governed Geneva, and impressed his own
austere character upon the laws and manners. Public amusements
were prohibited and private regulated. The number of guests to be
invited to weddings of the first, second, and third class, was made the
subject of municipal regulation. All dancing was interdicted, and
when it was found that if the violin were played people would dance,
the use of the instrument was prohibited. The absence of light amuse-
ments, together with religious feeling, naturally led to a greater use of
those relaxations deemed lawful, and to the more active pursuit of science
and literature by the better educated. Though times have changed in
Geneva, in regard to religious creed as well as to amusements, the im-
press of former days is still strong upon it, and those who term it “a
little Paris” do not look beneath the surface.

There is a curious mixture of the traits, manners, and modes of life
of both France and England in this city, with a basis which is entirely
Genevese. No less than ten thousand strangers, including, however,
Swiss of other cantons, reside permanently in a town of thirty thousand
inhabitants, and the number passing through it in a year is reckoned to
be as great as the population itself. The influence of their manners is,
of course, considerable, notwithstanding the exclusiveness of Genevese
society. This exclusiveness is fostered among the ladies in the usual
way, and among the men by clubs, literary, scientific, for conversation
and mere amusement. It even begins among the children, who associ-
ate in little knots called Sunday: societies, the members of which keep
up with each other the intercourse of cousins. Many Genevese enter
into commercial life abroad, and after accumulating wealth return to
their home, few (except those who have migrated to the United States)
becoming identified with foreign countries.

The most prominent business in Geneva is the manufacture of jewelry,
and of watches. Hach part of the watch is the special occupation of
one class of workmen. Different portions of the works are made by
peasants, but the finishing and putting together of the whole, as
well as the manufacture of the cases, employ the artisans of Geneva.
Nearly three thousand persons within the town, about one-fifth of
the men, are occupied in the jewelers’ and watch-makers’ business,
and twenty thousand watches are made annually.+ The restrictive

* The school system of Geneva has undergone a material change, and public schools
of all grades are liberally provided for.

tThe census of 1870 show seven thousand persons engaged in watch-making, and
upward of 200,000 watches made per annum.
124 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

duties laid upon these manufactures by neighboring countries, and
especially by France, have led to a regularly organized system of smug-
gling, from which the government agents appear to derive a private
revenue, and which is, therefore, very difficult to break up. It is said
that a prefect of police of Paris, having bought at Geneva jewelry
and watches to a considerable amount, the tradesman offered to deliver
them in Paris for an additional sum much below the cost of carriage
and the duties. The prefect made the agreement, and gave notice at the
frontier custom-houses, describing the articles, and requiring even more
than usual vigilance. The articles were, nevertheless, delivered to him
according to contract, and on investigation he found that they had
passed the frontier in his own baggage. This is one of the devious
ways of trade which is, I fear, not peculiar to any nation, and which
the better moral tone to be cultivated by associations like that which I
now address may and should correct. To elevate the watchmakers’
art, a society has been formed for the preliminary education of appren-
tices, and prizes for attainments in mathematics, drawing, and kindred
subjects, are awarded to successful competitors.

The political changes in Geneva have been of an instructive kind.
The people declared for the Reformation, and threw off the authority of
the Duke of Savoy. Thus the popular will was the basis of the exist-
ence of the present government. The necessity for constant resistance
to enemies without produced an easy concentration of power in the
hands of a few, and by limiting the number of families from among the
members of which the rulers were chosen, the government was rendered
practically an aristocracy, not of rank, for the patricians of Geneva
have always refused even this title, but of wealth and iutelligence. The
warfare of practice against principle has caused many revolutions, all
leading to an extension of popular privileges, and though likened by
the Emperor Paul, of Russia, to storms in a tumbler, their influences,
direct and indirect, have spread widely. Between the year 1535, when
the Bishop of Geneva was violently expelled from the city, and the year
1837, there had been five revolutions, and including two unsuccessful
but violent popular commotions, and seven attempts to alter the gov-
ernment. And thus it must be until the end of the chapter, until privi-
leges and rights are in harmony—until, in other words, Geneva is a true
republic.

The chief points of dispute still are (unless recent events have settled
some of them) that the sovereignty of the people is not formally
acknowledged ; that the representative council has no right to originate
laws, but only to discuss those offered to them by the Council of State ;
that the right of petition is not recognized, and that the privilege of
voting is possessed only by those who pay a certain amount of taxes;
the amount being fixed so high as to exclude about two-thirds of the
citizens who are over age from the polls.*

* All this has been changed by the constitution adopted May 24, 1847, the provisions
whereof are essentially democratic.

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND 125

Take the agitation of this canton in connection with the fact that in
the eight cantons having a popular form of government, there were no
revolutions in 1830, the last marked period in the progress of these
governments, and the lesson becomes even more instructive.

How much do we not owe to our forefathers, who in establishing our
republican system threw off thetrammels of the Old World, and removed
all such obstacles to our progress! How clear their view of republican.
institutions when compared with those of the men of Europe, even in
the present day!

One of the most important engines in the improvement of Switzer-
land is the ‘+ Helvetic Society for public utility.”* Its branches are scat-
tered over the whole country, meeting frequently and maintaining a
correspondence with the parent society through the medium of com-
mnittees. Delegates from the local associations meet in different parts
of the country in turn, and discuss questions connected with education,
political economy, and the general welfare of thecountry. The reports
made at these meetings and the information laid before them are
printed and disseminated through the confederation by the branch soci-
eties. Independently of the influence thus exerted upon and through
the reading community, the intercourse of enlightened men of different
cantons is beneficial to the country, and the congregation of great and
patriotic spirits has a good effect inthe place of meeting. In the sum-
._mer of 1837 this society met at Geneva, and then for the first time some
of the statesmen of the German cantons met their fellow-citizens of the
French frontier. The first meeting in the illuminated botanic garden,
the mornings in the representative hall devoted to discussions, the gen-
eral meetings for meals, the soirées and suppers, each served in their
place, (for the Swiss, like the English, Germans, and Americans, love
good cheer,) to promote the objects of the meeting. The subjects dis-
cussed in the council hall, show exactly the point to which the country
has advanced. They were the importance of agricultural schools, and
of schools for teachers, of saving-banks or funds, and the question
whether those who in time of plenty (like the Pharaohs of old) hoard
up grain to sell it at an advance in seasons of scarcity should not rather
be considered benefactors of the public than objects of mob violence.
The influence of high character was beautifully illustrated in one of
these morning meetings. A warm debate had arisen upon the report
of a committee proposing to establish schools under the direction of the
society. The more the subject was discussed the further men’s opin-
ions appeared asunder. The keen politician of Geneva, with French
vivacity, had made his declamation and ended with a phrase; the enthu-
siastic clergyman of Vaud, with somewhat of the old Calvin fire, had
replied; the veteran philanthropist of St. Gall had laid down the doc-
trine by which he intended sturdily to abide. Union seemed impossible
and discord probable, when there rose, near the president’s chair, aman

heavy in countenance and in person, with an embarrassed air and awk-
ward address, the words of his first few sentences of miserably pro-
nounced French coming forth slowly, and almost by stammering. The
natural reflection of a stranger would have been, why does that stupid
man rise; what light can he expect to throw upon the question? Not
so, thought his countrymen. They knew the mind that occupied this
unpromising exterior, and all listened with entire attention to Hess, the
burgomaster of Zurich, while by hisown moderation he stifled the flame
which had been burning so fiercely, and by his good sense united all the
friends of education on a common ground of conciliation and compro-
mise. The denial of self shown by thus using a language which was
not familiar to him produced, also, doubtless a favorable impression.
Those who afterward heard the same speaker in his vernacular rousing
an assemblage by his eloquence, or moving them to laughter by his wit,
must have found it difficult to recognize in the accomplished orator the
embarassed speaker of the representative chamber.

The canton of Geneva contains fifty-six thousand inhabitants, thirty
thousand of whom live in the town. The adjoining canton of Vaud
presents a striking contrast in this as in other respects, out of one hun-
dred and eighty thousand people, only fourteen thousand being inhab-
itants of Lausanne, the capital, and only considerable town in the
canton.* The people of Vaud pride themselves upon their ultra-repub-
licanism, their orthodoxy in religion, their present moral and social
condition, and the broad basis laid in their institutions for further
improvement; the carrying out of the cantonal motto of “ liberty and
country.” Their constitution declares the sovereignty of the people and
the equality of all citizens in the eye of the law, guarantees individual
liberty, the right of property, the inviolability of domicile, the freedom
of the press, and the right of petition. It provides for the separation
of the legislative, executive, and judicial authorities, a feature so
universal in our constitutions that we are surprised to find it gen-
erally overlooked by the framers of the Swiss. All citizens have a
right to vote at twenty-three years of age. The church is, as in
all these countries, connected with the state, and is styled in the
constitution the National Evangelical Reformed Church. Worship
according to the forms of the Roman Catholic Church is guaranteed
to some of the communes, and there this church is also connected
with the state. The voluntary charch system as it exists with us is
almost unknown, and it would be difiicult to imagine the first effects of
severing church and state among a people where the connection has
always existed; yet some of the clergy of Vaud look to the separation
as conferring a desirable freedom upon their church. As evidences of
the moral condition of Vaud may be mentioned that in 1836 there was

* The census of 1870 gives to the canton of Geneva a population of 89,416, whereof
about one-half live in the city proper. According to the same authority, the canton of
Vaud has a population of 229,596, and Lausanne 25,000.

but one criminal for every one thousand seven hundred and eighty
inhabitants; while in Massachusetts, also an agricultural community,
there was last year one criminal in one hundred and fifty; and counting
only natives of the State, one in seven hundred and fifty. These people
have laid broad and deep the foundations of improvement in an
admirable system of public instruction, combining, as all are of one mode
of faith, religious and intellectual culture. The law declares that the
happiness of a people is to be found in good morals and good instruction,
and that in a free country every citizen should have put within his reach
an education fitting him for his rights and duties. It has not stopped
at any point in public education, saying you of a certain class shall have
such schools, and you such others, but has divided the schools accord-
ing to the age and attainments of the children, and, for those on the
threshold of active life, according to the probable future pursuit of the
individual. Thus they have elementary schools, middle or industrial
schools, a college, a university, and schools for male and female teachers.
In a canton where suffrage is universal, the legislature has had the
boldness to require that all children from the age of seven to sixteen
shall be under instruction, unless capable of passing a certain examina-
tion. Parents who neglect or refuse to send their children to school
are cited before the authorities and fined; in case of a repetition of the
offense may be imprisoned, and thus deprived for a time of the rights
of citizenship. Whether this provision can be fully executed or not yet
remains to be seen; at present it is a salutary stimulus to the negli-
gent. The ground of its adoption is, that universal suffrage requires
universal education, and that as the law guarantees to citizens the one,
it has a right to demand of them the other. The middle or industrial
schools are colleges for business men preparing for the pursuits of com-
merce and the mechanic arts, and bearing the same relation to these
pursuits that the colleges do to the professions of medicine, law, and
theology. The canton has a school for the deaf and dumb, and one for
the blind at Yverdon.

The prison discipline, like our own, puts in action the benevolent idea
of reforming the delinquents; but the horror of solitary confinement
which appears to exist in the mind of every one allied, even remotely,
to the French has marred the system both in Lausanne and at Geneva.
Happily the care which is taken in collecting the statistics of the prisons
must gradually lead toachange. Finding that there are as many cases of
recommitment now as under the old arrangement, they will see that
with the gregarious system, even with work, there can be no reform.

This canton was the last scene of the labors of the great reformer in
education, Pestalozzi. At Yverdon, on the shores of Lake Neufchatel,
in a castle erected for war, but turned to purposes of peace, he termi-
nated his active, beneficent, but stormy life. He was the Bacon of
education. Adhering rigidly to the laws of induction, he changed the
very basis of the sciences. He combined those extraordinary qualities
128 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

of the German character, simplicity, enthusiasm, rationalism, and its
opposite, mysticism. As a practical teacher he has been surpassed by
many of his followers, but he was undoubtedly the founder of a new
school in education. Restless, and always dissatisfied with the results
of his efforts, he began many times afresh, and to the last, with
renewed hope of entire success. Unqualified to manage pecuniary
matters, his mind was always oppressed with the details of the economy
of his schools as soon as they became large. Prussia owes the present
improved condition of her burgher or citizen schools—for her “ schools
for the poor”—are poor indeed to the precepts and examples of those
who drew both from Pestalozzi. A school nominally conducted upon
his principles is still kept up in the old castle, but resembles much
the deformed copies from the same model which we have seen in this
country.

Before leaving the southern part of Switzerland, let us pass for a few
minutes into the canton of the Valais and among the Alps, not to ad-
mire scenery but to observe Swiss enterprise. Railroads are out of the
question in such a country, and places for canals are rarely to be found,
but improvements peculiar to the country take their places, and require
both skill and originality.

In one of the narrow valleys of the Valais, a tributary to the Dranse
(itself a branch of the Rhone) takes its rise in the melting snows of
the glacier of Getroz. This mass of snow and ice is formed by the
accumulation of snow upon two mountain flanks, which, descending and
uniting in the gorge, are slowly pushed forward into the valley, melting
as they advance, and feeding with innumerable rills the turbid Dranse.
In the spring of 1818 the waters of the stream were very low, and as
this circumstance had preceded a dreadful inundation of the valley of
Bagnes in 1595, the peasants taking alarm moved up the valley to
ascertain the present cause. They found that the fall of large blocks of
ice from the glacier of Getroz, and of avalanches from the mountain
sides, had completely dammed up the waters of the Dranse. The icy
barrier is described to have been four hundred feet high, six hundred
feet wide at the top, and three thousand feet at its base; the lake
behind it was a mile and a quarter long, and at the barrier some fifty
fathoms deep. The waters in this basin rose at the rate of two feet per
day, and it was almost certain that finally, rising to a height capable of
bursting the wall of ice which held them in, they would in their mighty
rush sweep the valley to the very banks of the Rhone. The engineer
of the canton, M. Venetz, made a bold attempt to prevent this disaster,
which, if it did not entirely succeed, greatly diminished the dreaded
devastation. A tunnel through the ice was commenced at a sufficient
height above the swelling waters to prevent their reaching the laborers
before its completion. Two sets of workmen labored day and night for
nearly a month in its formation. When first finished it was not of suf-
ficient size to preveut the rise of the lake, but widening and deepening

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND. 129

from the flow of water through it, in thirty-two hours it had drained
off ten feet in depth of the lake, and in twenty-four hours more, twenty
feet. More than one-third of the water had thus escaped when the
action of the issuing cataract upon the base of the mound had so far
weakened it by detaching large masses of ice, that the barrier was sud-
denly burst asunder. With a dreadful noise the liberated waters took
their way down the valley in one mountain wave, carrying before them
enormous rocks, the forest and hill-side, fields, fruit-trees and fences,
bridges and ciate and furrowing or covering the low grounds with
the débris of the mountains. The destruction is represented to have
been terrible, in all but that of life approaching that of the previous
catastrophe. The energies of this simple people were but for a time
paralyzed by this dire misfortune, and means were almost immediately
taken to repair its effects and prevent its recurrence.

Captain Hall, who visited the scene just after the disaster, and again
after an aval of fifteen years, thus speaks of the first appearance
and of the change which industry had wrought during the interval:
** We said to ourselves, that no time could ever restore their town (Mar-
tigny) to prosperity, or reclothe their fields with verdure. Yet, only
fifteen years afterward, when I again visited this scene of utter, and,
as it seemed, hopeless desolation, I could scarcely by any effort of the
imagination recall the spot to my mind, or be persuaded that it really
was the same ground I had seen laid waste. = i *
The fields were all again thickly matted with verdure; the hedges and
dividing walls appeared never to have been disturbed; flower-gardens
and kitchen-gardens and grass-plots smiled on every side of this happy
valley; apple-trees, laden with fruit, and rows of tall poplars marked
out many lines of new and better roads than before, leading from new
bridges which formerly had no existence.” The date of the first disas-
ter was found inscribed upon a beam in one of the chalets, accompanied
by a set of letters; the whole may be thus paraphrased: M. O. E. |
1595. | W. B. W. D. B. | T. G.O.G. The puzzle has been thus deci-
phered by a Swiss Monkbarns: Maurice Olliet erected, 1595, when
Bagnes was destroyed by the glacier of Getroz.

Friburg lies between Vaud on the south and Berne on the north.
It was the ninth canton admitted intd the confederation. From having
been the most aristocratic of all—some sixteen families governing
seventy thousand people—it is now almost as liberal as Vaud. Suffrage
is universal and the press is free. The religion of the state is Roman
Catholic, the bishop still retaining the title of Bishop of Lausanne and
Geneva. Party spirit, probably, run higher in this canton than in any
other. The old aristocracy has its friends, though in the minority. The
republicans, who triumphed in the revolution of 1830, excluded the clergy
from the councils, but their influence still maintains a party there, and
the church itself is divided between the rival influences of the Cordeliers
and of the Jesuits. There are nine convents in the canton, a lycevm

98
130 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

or college and a boarding-school, in the capital. The clergy have not
abandoned the claim, though deprived of the power to direct the secular
instruction of the people, to license and displace their teachers. The
struggles of these parties and influences keep up a constant political
excitement. .

It is difficult for a stranger who approaches the town of Friburg
from the French cantons, on a day when the weekly fair is heid, to be-
lieve that a scene of real life mY before him. The old battlemented walls,
with their towers, earry us back to the days of arquebusses and culverins,
or even to those of cross: bows an catapults. The collection of peasants
in the square, clad in the varied and picturesque costumes of the adjoin-
ing districts, keeps up the illusion. It is easy to realize that such look-
ing people should sing and dance, but that they should buy and sell in
earnest is not so easily credited. There is some poetry left yet in the
exterior of life, at least in these countries. This thought was again
awakened on finding myself in the cell of a monk in the convent of the
Cordeliers. The vaulted ceiling, grated door, bare walls, the pallet bed
and rade table, with missal and ecruei ifix, the occupant clothed in coarse
black serge, the cord of his order passing around his waist, produced a
most singular effect. There was nothing in the manners and conversa-
tion of the venerable Father Girard ne dispel any illusion created by
the circumstances around hin, unless the faintest possible tinge of the
world, such as he may have got while superintending the schools of his
eanton just after the revolution of 1814. Hoping to dull the edge of:
party spirit which he supposed attacked the schools because a Cordelier

was at the head of them, he retired into voluntary exile for ten years,
and returned, at the age of seventy-two, to die, as he said, at home,
when his years would be an apology for not mingling in publie affairs.
He had returned to find his eae in incompetent hands, almost in
decay, and his normal school, from a similar cause, on the point of |
being abolished. Imbued with the spirit of Pestalozzi, Father Girard ~
gives to the languages as instruments for intellectual ern g the part
which the great master assigned to the se 1eNCES ; for economy’s sake he
adopted the monitorial system, but hoped to see the time when it might
give place toa better. In his retirement his influence with the intelligent
men of Switzerland wasvery great, and was exercised to forward the intel-
lectual progress of his country. ‘I love all men with Christian hearts,
though they may not be orthodox in formulary ; such is my profession of
faith,” was the catholic sentiment of this truly good man, reminding
me of the beautiful lines of Wordsworth, written at Friburg:

“Doom’d as we are our native dust
To wet with many a bitter shower,
It ill befits us to disdain
The altar, to deride the fane
Where patient sufferers bend, in trust,
To win a happier hour.

“ Where’er we roam, along the brink
Cf Rhine, or by the sweeping Po,
Through Alpine vale, or champaign wide—
Whate’er we lock upon—at our side
Be charity—to bid as think,
And fecl—if we would know.”

The situation of Friburg has afforded opportunity for two pieces of
characteristic enterprise. The channel of the river Sarine forms al-
most a loop at the town, inclosing it on three sides, and flowing in a
deep sandstone valley. The town occupies the top and sides of the
promontory thus formed, and on the steep slope the tops of the houses
below are on a level with the pavement of the streets above. Into this
valley the road to Berne formerly descended, and mounted a precipitous
hill on the other side of the stream, occupying, with its windings and
the slow pace by which it was necessarily traversed, an hour, and to pass
from one side of the valley to the other, a distance in a straight line ef
some three hundred yards. A beautiful suspension bridge now connects
the upper plateau of the town with a point equally high on the oppo-
site bank, the suspending cables of wire being firmly fastened in thé
massive rock on either side, and passing over two neat piers of Jura
limestone. This bridge was planned by an engineer of Lyons, but exe-
cuted by Swiss workmen, and entirely with Swiss materials. The road-
way is eight hundred and ninety-six feet in length between the piers,
or two and a half times as long as the elegant structure of the same
kind now erected over the Schuylkill at Philadelphia, and once and a
half as long as the celebrated chain bridge over the Menai Strait in
Wales. The road-way is suspended at the height of one hundred and
seventy-four feet above the Saarine, and looking up from the valley the
eurved wire ropes which support the whole resemble mere cords pro-
jected against the sky, while the upright wires by which the platform
hangs appear like cobwebs. The trials to which this structure was sub-
jected by the authorities before receiving it were many and severe, the
hardest that of marching across it two thousand people keeping step to
music, the measured cadence producing a continually increasing vibra-
tion, and trying the strength to the utmost. The successful completion
of this work and its durability have led to the erection of a second of
the same kind at another point of the valley; so that this little town of
nine thousand inhabitants may now boast of two of the most beautiful
bridges in the world.

Berne, the capital of the largest and most populous canton of the
Swiss confederacy, is, in appearance, thoroughly a Swiss town of the
old school. Its site is a bold promontory, like that of Friburg, nearly
surrounded by the Aar, a tributary of the Rhine. The appearance of
Berne is very quaint. Entering it from the south, three gateways are
passed in succession, at intervals from each other, beneath towers which
mark so many epochs in the extension of the walled town. Before the
132 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

use of artillery Berne was a place of great strength, thesite having been
selected in the twelfth century for its military properties, by Berthold,
of Ziihringen, the founder of the city. The fronts of the houses in the
principal streets, as in the Italian towns of the Middle Ages, rest upon
arcades, which form covered walks for passengers. The heavy piers of
the areades render the shops dark, but this inconvenience is more than
counterbalanced by the protection from the winter’s snow in a town
almost among the Alps, and at an elevation of sixteen hundred feet
above the sea. The streets are provided at intervals with fountains of
curious devices and rude execution, in Which, besides the figure of the
bear in various *“‘ armor and attitude,” are warriors and goddesses, and
remarkable above all, the terror of children, the great Kinder-fresser, or
ogre, who, with the head and shoulders of one poor innocent in his gap-
ing mouth, in the very act of swallowing, has a bag fullof similar choice
mouthfuls about his neck, apparently struggling to escape the fate of
their comrade. In one of the towers is the famous clock of kindred
taste with the ogre. Before each houra cock flaps his wings and crows
a warning. A figure representing Father Time reverses his hour glass,
’and opens his mouth as if to ery aloud to the careless. At noon is the
grand procession of the bears, who, marshaled by knights and soldiers,
issue to the sound of musie and pass before the figure of Time first on
all fours, then half erect, and finally rampant, figuring thus the differ-
ent conditions of the town of which they are the patrons. The figure
now raises a wand and strikes the hour upon a mimic bell, keeping time
with the striking of the clock ; the cock again flaps his wings, and for
twenty-four hours the bears have rest. The regard for bruin in Berne
has been the growth of ages. Theaccidental killing of a bear by the Duke
of Ziihringen on the day of founding the city placed the effigy upon the
coat of arms, and perbaps gave name to the infant city, for Berne sig-
nifies bear in the Swabian dialect. ‘The effigy of the bear was connected
with the conquests of the warlike burghers, and the living animal kept
to amuse the people by his antics. A whimsical old lady left a hand-
some estate to the town to maintain a family of bears, forever, and in
1798 the animal becaine associated with the misfortunes of the canton
as it had been with its rise and prosperity. Thesavings from the estate
of the bears shared the fate of those of the canton, when the French
armies appropriated the thirty millions of specie in the vaults of the
treasury. The bears themselves were removed from their diteh and
transported to Paris, the huge cage containing the father of the family
having upon it the insulting inscription, not yet forgotten by the people,
of Avoyer (President) of Berne. One only lived to return to his home
at the general restoration of the spoils of Europe, but the bears of the
present generation appear to have forgiven or forgotten the sorrows of
their parents, and, all unconscious of their own present dependent state,
are as diligent in climbing poles, and as active in begging and quarrel-
ing for nuts and gingerbread as if the present bear-ditch had always

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND. 133

been the abode of both parents and cubs. How difficult it must ve for
the men of Berne among the scenes of the Middle Ages, and with his-
tory and tradition both fettering them, to keep up with the progress of
the times; and yet they have done so in a very great degree, as a glance
at the institutions of the republic will show.

In 1785 there were but two hundred and thirty-six families, the
members of which were eligible to the grand council, the governing
body of a canton of three hundred thousand inhabitants, and of its
tributaries, Vaud inclusive. These were the descendants of the original
burghers of Berne, and of those whom they had admitted from time to
time into their fraternity. Many of them were members of one of the
five guilds, the bakers, butchers, tanners, smiths, and carriers, originally
an aristocracy of working men. Of the two hundred and thirty-six
families only seventy-six were eligible to the executive or lesser council,
and twenty of these, by the preponderance of numbers, governed the
State. In 1796 there were twenty-two persons of the name and family
of Steiger in the grand council, fifteen of Watwyl, and so on. It was
certainly no easy task to undo the Gordian knot of such institutions,
but the French invasion sundered it, and the complete separation of
social and political ties which followed prevented a firm reunion of the
parts. A feeble aristocratic government was réstablished under the
protection of Austria, after. the French occupation ceased, and was
continued until 1530. At this time the revolution of the three days in
Paris gave a new impulse to popular institutions by the support which
it promised to hold out to their friends. The people of the country
parts of Berne met in their arrondissements and petitioned the govern-
ment tor an extension of popular rights. They were answered by pro-
hibittug their assembling. They continued to meet, and the govern-
ment ordered out the militia to suppress these meetings, and collecting
their most trustworthy troops in the town, closed the gates and pre-
pared the cannon upon the ramparts for action against the peasantry.
The militia refused to turn out; the troops in the town declared their
unwillingness to act against their countrymen. No attack was made,
but the government wisely determined on abdication, declaring that on
a certain day they would cease their functions if such was the will of
the people. This was all that was desired. An assembly was called to
frame a constitution, and without any violent shock, in October, 1831, the
old aristocratic government gave place to the new republican, in which
although there is some leaven of the former aristocracy, it is not suffi-
cient to leaven the lump. This is a true history of a Swiss republican
revolution. The new constitution declares the sovereignty of the people,
the liberty of the press, the right of the representative council to origin-
ate measures, toleration of religion with an established national church.
Livery citizen is an elector of the first grade; and every hundred of
them chooses an elector of the second grade, who votes for the repre-
sentative council. As in the other cantons, with few exceptions, the
134 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

powers of government are mingled, and what strikes an American as
even more strange, while the representative council is elected for six
years, the judges chosen by them are elected but for five.

One of the first steps of the new government was to reorganize and
renovate public instruction. A visit to the normal school established
by them must inspire bright anticipations of future improvement for
the country. Patriotism, religious and moral feeling, and intelligence,
are developed by precept and example in those who are hereafter to
have the training of the Bernese youth. The industrious life of these
future teachers, eleven hours being spent in the school-room, in receiv-
ing or imparting instruction, their frugal fare, meat of any kind: being
placed before them but twice in each week, and their coarse clothing, are all
shared with them by the director of the institution. Severe exercise in
the open air, through the gymnastics so popular in Germany and Switzer-
land, counteracts, in a degree, the effect of this sedentary life upon their
health. In addition to the branches usually cultivated in our schools,
music is made a part of the teacher’s education, that he may, in turn,
give instruction in it to all his pupils. The effect produced by the deep
toned and well tuned voices of the young teachers in this normal school,
engaged in singing, con amore, some of the patriotic songs of their
country, was one of the most moving that I ever experienced. Whata
fine material for republicans ! was the remark of the counselior of state
who accompanied me, the echo of the very feeling which was thrilling
through me. Close by this school is Hofwy!], the celebrated institution
of Emmanuel Fellenberg. But to venture within its precincts would
occupy you far longer than I am privileged to do. The system of this
establishment, for itis not one school, but is composed of several schools
of different grades, has served, in a degree, as a model for that of the
canton, and has exerted a greater influence in and out of Switzerland
than any other single institution in the world.

The new government has reorganized and improved many of the pub-
lic establishments of the canton, and created new ones. Thus the two
orphan houses of the city have already felt its favorable influence; a
school for the deaf and dumb, and one for the blind, has been estab-
lished under its patronage, and a new penitentiary has been erected for
the introduction of the modern improvements in prison-discipline. In
1819 women condemned for crimes swept the streets of Berne, and now
the government is nearly prepared to adopt the Pennsylvania system of —
prison discipline. .Surely the progress of this people has been worthy |
of, if not above, ali praise.

On the eastern side of the town the bank of the Aar is quite precip-
itous, and from the parapet which crowns it a glimpse is had into that
fairy-land, the Oberland of Berne. The peaks of its snow-clad hills, with
their bold outline, cut sharply against the sky, presenting, in the course
of a clear day, a beautiful variety of aspect, from the dark shadows cast
by the rising sun, and the brilliancy of mid-day, to the delicate hues at

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND. 135

sunset, and the ashy and almost ghastly paleness of the evening. One
of the few things which cannot disappoint isa visit to the Bernese Alps.
Nature presents itself not only upon a grand scale, but in unusual and
varied forms. Lofty and precipitous mountains, rugged with rocks,
and ice, and snow; glaciers pushing their way from the steep mountaix
sides into the valleys; avalanches tumbling headlong from the heights,
and with a roar like distant thunder burying their ice and snow in the
deep gorges; cascades pouring from precipices so lofty that the water
is dispersed in dust-like spray, in mid-air, or tumbling from rock to
rock in foaming sheets; pine-clad hills, aud valleys green with grass;
all these, in turn, rejoice the sight, while the unaccustomed modes
of Alpine traveling invigorate the frame, and the spirits rise until
hey ereate a world of enjoyment of their own. The works of man
lend themselves to nature, to add to the picturesque character of these
regions; for the Swiss cottage, with its roof weighted with stones, its
projecting eaves and out-door galleries, is unlike a farm-house elsewhere,
and the chalet, with its stable, dwelling, and dairy, all under one roof,
yet separated with scrupulous regard to neatness, is as unlike a peas-
ant’s hut. The costume of the people, too, puts them to the eye of a
stranger in constant masquerade, and the vocal music, with its curious
falsetto tones, and the instrumental upon the wooden tube, or Alpine
horn, are unlike what is to be heard in other countries.
The valley of Grindelwald is itself more than three thousand feet
above the level of the sea, and from it the Fauihorn rises three thou-
sand more. The ascent of this mountain is by winding paths, along
the base or on the brink of high rocks, by the side of ponds formed by
the melting snow, through the snows themselves, to the very apex.
Then the whole district of thelakes of Brientz and Thun is stretched out
before and far below you, the lake of Lucerne and its mountains, the
valleys of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, the Alpine heights of the
Higer, the Monk, the Jungfrau, and others of this chain, far across to the
mountains where the Rhine and the Rhone both have their sources.
Above the region where the white hill-clouds of summer are formed and
rest, when they occur spreading a deep shade over the valleys below, the
top of the Faulhorn is in the full blaze of the sun, and the eye ranges from
it upon the expanse of the tops of the white clouds, as over a vast plain
of snow thrown into ridges by the wind, a mimic ocean of snow with the
forms of waves without their motion. Lifeinachalet upon such a moun-
tain is very little like that in an inn down inthe valley. The whole moun-
tain-top will hardly give elbow-room to the twenty or thirty people who
come up on a fine summer’s day, much less will the chalet give room for
exclusiveness in eating, drinking, or sleeping. Then, further, to break
down reserve, the sunset is to be seen by all, and then the moon, at rising
“or setting, puts the whole sleeping household in motion, and again all are
out to see the sun rise over the distant Alps. §
There are some traits by which one may infallibly recognize our coun-

trymen, and in this chalet with us was an undoubted American. He
talked to every one who could speak his vernacular, and spoke to every
one who would give his broken French an answer. His meals were
bolted down in haste. He fidgeted lest he should lose anything of the
moon or sun rise, and actually turned out to witness the former in regu-
lar Kickapoo style, wrapped in a blanket. He was restless to an excess,
and talked all the time that others were absorbed in sentiment; for-
getting his unpresentable condition, he even addressed some young
Iinglish ladies, who had certainly offered no special encouragement to the
approach of any fellow-traveller, even in full costume. He was off
among the first in the morning, and after the day’s journey we met him
in the evening at Meyringen, still talkative as ever, and his tones certi-
fying that he came from the east of the Hudson; so far, the very beau-
ideal of the American figured by tourists. Here, however, he piqued my
curiosity by the very un-American act of abusing the supper, as well as
by some peculiarity of expression; and, entering into further conversa-
tion with him, I found that this wedoubted American was last from Thread
and Needle street, had been born and bred in the old country, and had
not even trodden our republican soil. So much for national character-
istics, which, like family peculiarities, may sometimes lead us to mis-
take the father for the son.

On the way from the Oberland to Lucerne we pass a work of improve-
ment well worthy of notice. At the foot of the Brunig Mountain, on
the north side, is the small lake of Lungern, draining the slopes of a
basin of moderate extent, and having originally no outlet. It is sepa-
rated by a mountain ridge from the lake of Sarnen, which commu-
nicates with the lake of Lucerne. Lake Lungern is sume four hun-
dred feet higher than Lake Sarnen, so that by establishing a com-
munication between them tke former might be drained to any re-
quired amount, and arable land be thus gained upon the lake shore.
A tunnel to establish this connection was begun in 1788, and after many
delays was completed in 1836, at the cost of $25,000, and nineteen thou-
sand days’ work by the peasants. The winter season, when the lake is
lowest, was chosen for completing the tunnel by breaking through a
rocky barrier into Lake Lungern. The undertaking succeeded, and in
ten days the water fell to the level of the mouth of the tunnel. A new
and unforeseen danger now threatened the people of the village on the
lake shore. The bank, no longer supported by the water, and exposed
to the action of the frost, began to crack, and the earth separating from
the underlying rock, threatened to precipitate the church and part of
the village into the lake. In fact a slide did take place, but only to a
limited extent, and by cutting the shores in terraces the progress of the
evil has been stopped, and the gain of about five hundred acres of ara-
ble land may be considered as permanent.

The town of Lucerne, the capital of the canton of the same name, and
formerly in rotation with Berne and Zurich, the seat of the sessions of the

LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND. LT

Swiss Diet, is beautifully situated on the lake of the Forest cantons,
on a level piece of ground, at the point where the Reuss issues from the
lake to join the Limmat in its course to the Rhine. Lucerne, ona gala
day, presents an interesting sight to the stranger. When I saw it, the
people in holiday dress were collecting from all quarters to the lake
side; the long wooden bridges which join the different parts of the town,
and the stone-lined quays along the Reuss, were thronged with people
pressing toward the same point. The women from the country wearing
the hair plaited on the crown of the head, or black caps with mohair
lace wings, and long plaits of hair and black ribbons falling down the
back, accompanied by men in plain attire, all speaking the harsh patois
derived from the Southern German. Even the bridge from the Abbey
had its passengers, though now few indeed in numbers, and a few Cor-
deliers were seen mingling with the throng. The windows of the tall
houses near the wharf presented an array of the notables of Lucerne,
and even some members of the diet might be pointed out to the stranger.
The bells were ringing at intervals, and cannon pointed toward the
lake were prepared for a salute. The American smiles complacently
when told the cause of all this circumstance. The first steamboat navi-
gating the lake is expected on its first return trip from Altdorf, and
even now may be seen rounding a neighboring point. The excitement
inereases as the wonderful boat approaches, and we are carried in im-
agination back to the days of 1807, when New York poured out its popu-
lation to greet the return of the first adventure of the great Fulton.
No doubt now mingles, as then it did, with expectation, and amid the
hoarse noise of loud German exclamations and hurrahs, and the discharge
of artillery, the boat approaches. It is wonderful to see how at once
the art of managing the vessel has been acquired! How imitative a
creature manis! The captain is mounted upon the wheel-guard directing
the pilot and engineer with his hand. The headway is checked judi-
ciously, and now the boat nears the wharf. With what precision and
skill this maneuvre is executed for the first time! The thought is hardly
complete, when rising loud and clear above the hoarse gutturals of the
mob, comes to do away all mystery, to explain the whole, in good home-
spun English, the well-known ery of ‘Stop her!” The engine was
built in England, put up by Englishmen, and is now managed in its first
trial by them; and thus the mechanics and manufacturers of that great
nation lay not only Switzerland, but all the continent of Hurope, under
contribution, as a return for the money spent abroad by her travelers.
The Swiss Confederacy is, politically considered, even a weaker gov-
ernment than ours was under the old Articles of Confederation; at all
events weaker for every purpose not merely military. The act of con-
federation now in force dates from 1815, and all the attempts made
since its adoption to modify it so as to produce a stronger government,
by cementing the union more closely, have failed. The cantonal spirit
resists the least encroachments upon its independence. The act of con-
158 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

federation guarantees to each canton its liberty, its independence, its
safety from foreign aggression, and peace and tranquillity within. To
maintain this guarantee and to preserve the armed neutrality of Switzer-
land, a contingent of 35,000 men and $140,000 is required from the can-
tons in proportion to their population and other circumstances,
The modified constitution declared every Swiss to be a soldier, express-
ing only what is the fact, the military spirit being kept constantly
alive from the belief that it is essential to the independence of the coun-
try. In case of the invasion of a canton, or of violence against the
actual government, the confederation is bound, upon a summons, to
an armed intervention; and, in case of necessity, a neighboring canton
may lend its aid. This provision has been a fertile source of difficulty,
for on the one hand the cantons claim the right of revolution, and, on
the other, the diet that of intervention. The cantons have no right to
form leagues with each other. No privileged classes may be established
in any of them. The transit of articles of merchandise and manu-
factures, and of the necessaries of life, through the different cantons is
guaranteed. Such are the leading articles of the constitution.

The diet is the highest authority of the confederacy, and consists of
deputies from the twenty-two cantons, who vote, unless specially in-
vested with discretionary power, according to instructions derived from
the cantonal governments. Wach canton has one vote in the diet. The
regular meetings of this body are held yearly, and the senior deputy of
the canton where the meeting is held presides. Executive power during
the recess of the diet may be vested in the authorities of the canton
where the meeting of the year is to be held, or in a special executive
council. The diet declares war and makes treaties of peace and alliance;
such measures requiring a majority of three-fourths of the votes.*

In the summer of 1837 the diet met at Lucerne. The stormy session
of the year before at Berne, in which they had borne themselves so gal-
lantly in opposition to the demands of France, was still fresh in the
recollection; but with the adjustment of the difficulties the excitement
produced by them had subsided. On that occasion it was said that
Switzerland had spoken even in a boasting tone, or, in the language of
the French jonrnalists, as if she were a first-rate power instead of a
fourth. The national feeling which dictated this tone may be explained
and felt by the remark of Professor Monnard, of Vaud, by whom the

* The foregoing remarks apply to the political condition of the Swiss Confederation
previous to the 12th of September, 1848, when the revised federal constitution now in
force was adopted. This instrument is very similar to that of the United States, onlz
paying somewhat more deference to states rights, and vesting the executive power in
a cabinet (federal council) elected by congress in joint session, the chairman whereof
being denominated President of Switzerland. Tho legislative authority is vested in a
federal assembly, (congress,) composed of a national council (house of representatives)
and a staenderath or States council, (senate ;) the supreme court and executive au-
thority being both elected by the federal assembly or congress, in joint session, in which
is vested the supreme power of the land. Berne is the permanent capital.

threatening language was spoken, “we cannot recognize a first-rate and
a second-rate national honor.”

There is still something of the “ feudalism of democracy,” as a dis-
tinguished author has called it, in the ceremonies of the diet, walking
in procession to their hall where their deliberations take place, wearing
cloaks embroided with the arms of their cantons, and even of more than
one coler, received by double rows of guards, and deliberating with
swords by their sides. The antiquated costumes are destined to disap-
pear with many feudal forms, but the delegates from those cantons, the
democratic, where the least change has taken place in their institutions,
are wedded to their old garments as well as to the old constitution. In
the hall of meeting twenty-one seats are arranged about an oval table
for the senior representatives, the president having his seat at the one
extremity of the table, and the consulting deputies occupying small
tables in the rear. The members do not rise when addressing the chair,
which has an awkward effect, and must be embarrassing to the lively
delegates of the Italian and French cantons; but all minor embarrass-
ments yield to that of the use of three different languages, the French, Ger-
man, and Italian, by members from the different cantons, while a major-
ity of the deputies understand but one. <A glance at these representa-
tives will illustrate the difficulties of forming a Swiss union. What has
the man of Tessin really in common with him of Geneva? Theoneisa
Roman Catholic, the other a Calvinist; the one a republican of the most
democratic school, the other an aristocrat by principle, and perhaps by
birth; the one is from a rough pastoral or agricultural district, the other
from a city where the more refined mechanic arts flourish; the one from
a sinall community, all the members of which are nearly equal in the
means of life and in education, the other from a town where wealth and
education are very unequally distributed ; the one in speech an Italian,
the other a Frenchman. Again, what has the educated and polished
professcr of Lausanne, or the merchant and banker of Basle, in common
with the peasant of Appenzele or the shepherd of Uri? With all these
diversities they are brought together in part by a sentiment—the love
of liberty ; in part by a necessity—that of mutual defense. The progress
of the cantons in education and the arts of life will doubtless draw their
bonds gradually closer, and to have attempted a union in 1832 is to
have laid the basis for it at some other time. Meanwhile the confeder-
ation, if it does not directly aid the cantons in their career of improve-
ment, at least goes far to guarantee the continuation of that peace which
is essential to progress.

Let us turn our backs upon the mountains, to glance merely, for that
is all that can be attempted, at Zurich, one of the cantons of the plain,
if any part of Switzerland can be called a plain; one of the farthest
advanced of all in the mechanic arts, manufactures, education, and good
government. Here the republican change was brought about in 1830,
by a simple change of administration, the council not being required to
140 LECTURE ON SWITZERLAND.

abdicate as at Berne, and up to this time a struggle for power goes on
between the partisans of a former order of things and the clergy against
the new order, ‘and, from time to time, one or the other influence pre-
yails. The canton, meanwhile, steadily advances. Suffrage is univer-
sal; the right to vote beginning at twenty years of age.

The progress of the canton since the new order of things may be best
illustrated by a few facts. The press is free, the legislative, executive,
and judicial departments have been separated, public instruction has
been set forth as one of the first duties of the state, and invasion of
domicile has been declared unlawful. To these intellectual improve-
ments may be added physical or material ones; good roads have been
made throughout the canton and stage coaches put upon them, so that
instead of ten or twelve people leaving Zurich, or entering it, per day,
there are now one hundred and ten. The poor tax is at the rate of but
5 cents per annum for each citizen inhabiting the canton; the church
rate 18 cents; and the expense of the civil list 20 cents. Finally the
revenue in 1832 exceeded the expenditure by $100,000, ana this surplus
has been devoted to the cause of material and intellectual improvement.

From the hasty and imperfect glance which we have now taken to-
gether of republican Switzerland, what conclusion may we draw as to
the capacity of the principle which connects these people, to produce
their happiness, their moral, intellectual, and physical improvement?

In the distance which separates us from them the minuter shades of
character are lost. We do not discern the men of Geneva, of Vaud, of
Berne, and of Zurich, but the men of Switzerland. Standing out from the
picture, like the lofty summits of their own mountain chains, are the
prominent characteristics of the people. Frugality, perseverance, hardy
enterprise, high moral and religious feeling, lofty patriotism; these are
the characteristics of the Swiss nation.

Hiow far these noble qualities are the result of their political institu-
tions, or whether the institutions owe their origin to these very qualities
of the people, it is needless to inquire, since what greater praise can be
awarded than the truth, that the institutions of Switzerland are in har-
mony with the free spirit of the people, and the spirit of the people with
their noble republican institutions.

ON A PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

By Pror. JosrrH HENRY.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, December 29, 1870. -

My DEAR Sir: Yours of the 28th of November was duly received, but
I delayed answering it until the pressure of business which accumulated
during my absence should have somewhat subsided, and, also, that I
might receive the plans which you mention. I am now gratified in
being able to inform you that my visit to Europe was both pleasant
and profitable, and that I have returned much improved in health and
with enlarged views as to the present state of science in the Old World.

While abroad I gave special attention to physical observatories, of
which there are several in England and on the continent, although
there is no one which fully realizes my idea of what such an establish-
ment ought to be.

A physical observatory is one the primary object of which is to in-
vestigate the physical phenomena of the earth and the heavenly bodies
in contradistinction to an ordinary astronomical observatory, which is
principally devoted to the cbservation and discussion of the motions of
the planets, and the determination of the relative positions of the fixed
stars. Of the latter kind but one or two are needed in any country,
and as these require a numerous corps of observers and computers they
can only be supported by appropriations annually from a national gov-
ernment. The United States Observatory at Washington is of this
character, and, including all expenses, requires an annual appropriation
of at least $59,000. The labors of such an observatory are indispens-
able to the advancement of the science of theoretical astronomy, and its
application to geodesy and geography.

The establishment I would advise you to found is of the character of
the one first mentioned, namely, a physical observatory, the principal
object of which would be, as I have indicated, to investigate the nature
and changes of the constitution of the heavenly bodies; to study the

rarious emanations from these in comparison with the results of experi-
ments, and to record and investigate the different phenomena which are
included under the general term of terrestrial physics.

A wide field has been opened for the study ef the nature of the sun
and other heavenly bodies by the application of the spectroscope, dif-
ferent modifications of the telescope, and other lately invented appliances.
We now know that thesunis undergoing remarkable changes, the charac-
ter of which can only be ascertained by the results of accurate observa-
tions compared with those of experimental investigation. The observer
P42 ON A PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

should divide his attention between the phenomena revealed by a criti-
eal and continued examination of the sun and the production of similar
phenomena in the laboratory. In this way European investigators have
arrived at most interesting results.

Again, we know that the emanations from the sun, and probably
from the stars, differ essentially in character. There is, first, the ema
nation known as light, which of itself consists of various rays, which
generally indicate the incandescence of substances, which give the
sensation of different colors, and those which, in their ordinary condition,
are imperceptible to the eye, but which may be perceived by that organ
after they have passed through certain liquids; next, the heat emana-
tion, which is also of different kinds; then the chemical emanation, by
which photographic impressions are produced; and, lastly, the phospho-
rogenic emanation, which abounds also in the electric discharge, and
which produces the glow of the diamond and the luminosity of the com-
pounds of lime, barium, and other substances with sulphur. To study
these or other emanations as they may appear in the fixed stars, or are
reflected from the moon and planets, or as they may be found in the
aurora borealis, the zodiacal light, and in shcoting-stars or larger mete
ors, requires peculiar instruments, and such as are not found, at present,
in ordinary astronomical observatories. Tor example, the celestial phe
nomena which address themselves to the sense of sight are studied by
means of refracting telescopes, as are, also, those of the photographie
ray, although this requires a peculiar form of lens, while the heat-ray
of lower intensity and the phosphorogenic ray are not transmitted by
glass; the former is readily converged to a focus by a lens of rock-salt,
and the latter by one of quartz. They may all, however, as in the case
of light, be concentrated into foci by metallic reflectors.

In regard to terrestrial physics, the phenomena are also various, and
the forces by which they are produced are constantly changing both in
intensity and, in some cases, in direction. We now know that the
magnetism of the earth scarcely remains the same from one moment to
another, and that these changes are connected with the appearance of
the aurora borealis and electrical discharges in the atmosphere. They,
also, in all probability, may ultimately be referred to disturbances pro-
duced by external influences, such as those from the sun, moon, and
planets. JI*urthermore, we may now consider the whole earth as an
immense conductor charged with negative electricity, of which the
intensity is in a continued state of change, and of which a knowledge of
the laws, as well as those of the changes of magnetism, is highly desira-
ble. For the proper study of these, continuous self-recording instru-
ments are necessary.

There is also an important field of observation in regard to ordinary
meteorology, such as the changes of the pressure of the atmosphere,
and its connection with other phenomena; of the normal and abnormal
winds; isolated currents of the atmosphere, and especiaily those of a

ON A PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY. 143

vertical direction; the radiation of heat from clouds and different ter-
restrial surfaces; the variation of its intensity In ascending above and
penetrating below the surface of the earth, &c. In short, the field is
almost boundless, and every year reveals new facts in terrestrial and
celestial physics, which never fail to furnish new points for investigation
to those who are qualified by education and endowed by nature for
their proper appreciation.,

The conductor of an observatory, such as I have mentioned, to be
successful, must have peculiar characteristics. He must possess a
minute knowledge of all the latest discoveries in physics, a keen eye to
detect new appearances, imagination to suggest hypothetical causes,
logical power to deduce consequences from these to be tested by obser-
vation or experiment, and ingenuity to devise apparatus for verifying
or disproving his deductions. When such a man is found he should be
consecrated to science and fully furnished with all the implements
necessary for the prosecution of his researches, those of physics as well
as of astronomy, and himself and family placed beyond all anxiety as to
the supply of their necessary wants. It may not be amiss to combine
with his studies and duties, in the way of research, a small amount of
lecturing—just enough by sympathetic communieation with admiring
pupils to fan, as it were, his enthusiasm, and to impart a portion of it to
others. He should also have at his command a skillful workman, who,
under his direction, could construct the temporary apparatus which are
constantly required in original research. It is also important that he
be associated with the faculty of a well-endowed college or university,
to which he will become an important acquisition both in regard to the
reputation which he will give to the institution, and the effect he will
have on the other members of the faculty in the way of stimulating
them to higher efforts. In such an association he can call for the codp-
eration of the professors, and especially that of the physicist, the
chemist, and the mathematician.

One of the most important points, perhaps, to which I should call
your attention is that of the building to be erected, since, from the ten-
dency to error in this line, more injury has resulted to publie institn-
tions in this country than from any other cause. It should be recollected
that “money is power;” that every dollar possesses a definite amount of
potential energy, as it were, which can always command intellectual or
physical labor. But money asa power is unlike all other kinds of power,
in that it is, by judicious investment, capable of yielding a constant
supply of energy, in the way of interest, without diminishing the origi-
nal amount. lt is, therefore, in the highest degree injudicious in the
founding of an establishment to exhaust the source of its power by
architectural displays not absolutely required, and which may forever
involve a continual expense from the remaining funds to keep them in
repair. As a general rule, the buildings of educational or scientific in-
stitutions should be gradually evolved from the experience and wants
144 / ON A PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.
!

of the establishment, and not, as is too frequently the case, from a@ priori
misconceptions of those who have no adequate idea of the uses to which
the structure is to be applied. It should be impressed upon the public
that buildings do not constitute an institution, and that reputation and
usefulness in science do not flow from visible and tangible manifesta-
tions, but are the immaterial fruit produced by the spirit of an organiza-
tion. I trust’that millions of human beings yet unborn will be familiar
with the intellectual results of your observatory, although a single in-
quiry may never be made as to the style of the building in which these
results have been produced.

My advice, then, would be: first, if possible, that the right man be
procured for director; secondly, that the principal instruments be con-
structed under his supervision ; and, thirdly, that the operations be com-
menced in an inexpensive wooden building, which will be found better
in many respects for physical and astronomical observations than one
of stone and brick. The instruments could be insured, I should think,
at a small premium, and in that case, if destroyed by fire, might be re-
placed by others embracing the improvements which may have been
suggested in the mean time.

As an illustration of what I have just said in regard to the building,
I may mention that in a visit to Mr. Lockyer I found him carrying on a
series of observations which have challenged the admiration of the world
in a temporary structure made of rough boards, unplastered, and
searcely including a space of fifteen feet square.

As to the location of your observatory, you will infer from what I
have said that I think it important to connect it with some well-endowed
and well-established college or university.

THE HISTORY OF MY YOUTH: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

[To keep up the series of publications of eulogies of distinguished men, which has
been a special feature of the Appendix to the Smithsonian Reports, the following auto-
biography and the eulogies of Herschel and Vourier are copied from the volume, now
out of print, of the translations by the late Admiral Smyth, the late Rev. Baden
Powell, and Prof. Grant, from the works of Arago.—J. H]

Ihave not the foolish vanity to imagine that any one, even a short
time hence, will have the curiosity to find out how my first education
was given, and how my mind was developed; but some biographers,
writing off-hand and without authority, having given details on this
subject utterly incorrect, and of a nature to imply negligence on the part
of my parents, I consider myself bound to put them right.

I was born on the 26th of February, 1786, in the commune of Estagel,
an ancient province of Roussillon, (department of the Eastern Pyrenees.)
My father, a licentiate in law, had some little property in arable land, in
vineyards, and in plantations of olive trees, the income from which sup-,
ported his numerous family,

I was thus three years old in 1789, four years old in 1790, five years
in 1791, six years in 1792, and seven years old in 1793, &e.

The reader has now himself the means of judging whether, as has
been said, and even stated in print, I had a hand in the excesses of our
first revolution.

My parents sent me to the primary school in Estagel, where I learned
the rudiments of reading and writing. I received, besides, in my
father’s house, some private lessons in vocal music. I was not otherwise
either more or less advanced than other children of my age. I enter
into these details merely to show how much mistaken are those who
have printed that at the age of fourteen or fifteen years I had not yet
learned to read. |

Kstagel was a halting place for a portion of the troops who, coming
from the interior, either went on to Rerpignan, or repaired direct to the
army of the Pyrenees. My parents’ house was therefore constantly full
of officers and soldiers. This, joined to the lively excitement which the
Spanish invasion had preduced within me, inspired me with such de-
cided military tastes that my family was obliged to have me narrowly
watched to prevent my joining by stealth the soldiers who left Estagel.
It often happened that they caught me at a league’s distance from the
village, already on my way with the troops.

On one occasion these warlike tastes had nearly cost me dear. It was
the night of the battle of Peires-Tortes. The Spanish troops in their
retreat had partly mistaken their road. I was in the square of the vyil-

10s
146 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO,

lage before daybreak. I saw a brigadier and five troopers come up,
who, at the sight of the tree of liberty, called out, ‘‘ Somos perdidos !’'
J ran immediately to the house to arm myself with a lance which had
been left there by a soldier of the levée en masse, and placing myself in
ambush atthe corner of a street, I struck with a blow of this weapon
the brigadier placed at the head of the party. The wound was not dan-
gerous. A cut of the saber, however, was descending to punish my
hardihood, when some countrymen came to my aid, and, armed with
forks, overturned the five cavaliers from their saddles, and made them
prisoners. I was then seven years oid.*

My father having gone to reside at Perpignan, as treasurer of the
mint, all the family quitted Estagel to follow him there. I was then
placed as an outdoor pupil at the municipal college of the town, where
I occupied myself almost exclusively with my literary studies. Our
classic authors had become the objects of my favorite reading. But the
direction of my ideas became changed all at once by a singular circum-
stance which I will relate.

Walking one day on the ramparts of the town, I saw an officer of en-
gineers who was directing the execution of the repairs. This officer,
M. Cressac, was very young. I had the hardihood to approach him and
to ask him how he had succeeded in so soon wearing an epaulette. “I
come from the Polytechnic School,” he answered. ‘ What school is
that?” “It isa school which one enters by an examination.” ‘Is much
expected of the candidates?” ‘ You will see it in the programme which
the government sends every year to the departmental administration ;
you will find it moreover in the numbers of the journal of the school,
which are in the library of the central school.”

Iran at once to the library, and there, for the first time, I read the
programme of the knowledge required in the candidates.

From this moment I abandoned the classes of the central school, where
I was taught to admire Corneille, Racine, La Fontaine, Moliére, and
attended only the mathematical course. This course was intrusted to
a retired ecclesiastic, the Abbé Verdier, a very respectable man, but
whose knowledge went no farther than the elementary course of La
Caille. I saw at a glance that M. Verdier’s lessons would not be suffi-
cient to secure my admission to the Polytechnic School; I therefore
decided on studying by myself the newest works, which I sent for from
Paris. These were those of Legendre, Lacroix, and Garnier. In going
through these works I often met with difficulties which exceeded my
powers; happily, strange though it be, and perhaps without example in
all the rest of France, there was a proprietor at Estagel, M. Raynal, who
made the study of the higher mathematics his recreation. It was in his
kitchen, while giving orders to numerous domestics for the labors of

* With such precocious heroism it is by no means so clear that the author might not
have had a hand in the revolution, from which he endeavors above to exculpate him-
self.

the next day, that M. Raynal read with advantage the “ Hydraulic Archi.
tecture” of Prony, the “ Mécanique Analytique,” and the “ Mécanique
Céleste.”. This excellent man often gave me useful advice; but I must
say that I found my real master in the cover of M. Garnier’s “ Treatise
on Algebra.” This cover consisted of a printed leaf, on the outside of
which blue paper was pasted. The reading of the page not covered
made me desirous to know what the blue paper hid from me. I took off
this paper carefully, having first damped it, and was able to read under-
neath it the advice given by d’Alembert to a young man who communi-
cated to him the difficulties which he met with in his studies: “ Go on,
sir, go on, and conviction will come to you.”

This gave me a gleam of light; instead of persisting in attempts to
comprehend at first sight the propositions before me, I admitted their
truth provisionally. I went on farther, and was quite surprised, on the
morrow, that I comprehended perfectly what over-night appeared to m
to be encompassed with thick clouds.

I thus made myself master, in a year and a half, of all the subjects
contained in the programme for admission, and I went to Montpellier
to undergo the examination. Iwas then sixteen years of age. M.Monge,
jr., the examiner, was detained at Toulouse by indisposition, and wrote
to the candidates assembled at Montpellier that he would examine them
in Paris. I was myself too unwell to undertake so long a journey, and
I returned to Perpignan.

There I listened for a moment to the solicitations of my family, who
pressed me to renounce the prospects which the Polytechnic School
opened. But my taste for mathematical studies soon carried the day.
Tincreased my library with Euler’s “Introduction a Analyse Infinitési-
male,” with the “‘ Résolution des Equations Numériques,” with Lagrange’s
“Théorie des Fonctions Analytiques,” and “ Mécanique Analytique,” and
finally with Laplace’s ‘“ Mécanique Céleste.” I gave myself up with great
ardor to the study of these books. From the journal of the Polytechnic
School, containing such investigations as those of M. Poisson on Elimi-
nation, I imagined that all the pupils were as much advanced as this
geometer, and that it would be necessary to rise to this height to sue-
ceed.

From this moment I prepared myself for the artillery service, the
aim of my ambition; and as I had heard that an officer ought to under-
stand music, fencing, and dancing, I devoted the first hours of each day
to the cultivation of these accomplishments.

The rest of the time I was seen walking in the moats of the citadel of
Perpignan, seeking by more or less forced transitions to pass from one
question to another, so as to be sure of being able to show the examiner
how far my studies had been carried.*

*Méchain, member of the Academy of Sciences and of the Institute, was charged
in 1792 with the prolongation of the measure of the arc of the meridian in Spain, as far
as Barcelona.

During his operations in the Pyrenees, in 1794, he had known my father, who was

e
148 AUTOBICGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

At last the moment of examination arrived, and I went to Toulouse
in company with a candidate who had studied at the public college. It
was the first time that pupils from Perpignan had appeared at the com-
petition. My intimidated comrade was completely discomfited. When
i repaired after him to the board, a very singular conversation took
place between M. Monge, the examiner, and me.

“Tf you are going to answer like your comrade, it is useless for me
to question you.”

‘Sir, my comrade knows much more than he has shown; I hope I
shall be more fortunate than he; but what you have just said to me
might well intimidate me and deprive me of all my powers.”

““Timidity is always the excuse of the ignorant; it is to save you
from the shame of a defeat that I make you the proposal of not exam-
ining you.”

‘“T| know of no greater shame than that which you now inflict upon
me. Will you be so good as to question me? Itis your duty.”

‘‘ You carry yourself very high, sir; we shall see presently whether
this be a legitimate pride.”

‘‘ Proceed, sir; I wait for you.”

M. Monge then put to me a geometrical question, which I answered
in such a way as to diminish his prejudices. Irom this he passed on to
a question in algebra, to the resolution of a numerical equation. I had
the work of Lagrange at my fingers’ ends; I analyzed all the known
methods, pointing out their advantages and defects; Newton’s method,
the method of recurring series, the method of depression, the method
of continued fractions; all were passed in review; the answer had
lasted an entire hour. Monge, brought over now to feelings of great
kindness, said to me, “I could, from this moment, consider the exam-
ination at an end. I will, however, for my own pleasure, ask you two
more questions. What are the relations of a curved line to the straight
line which isa tangent toit?” Ilooked upon this question as a particular

one of the administrators of thedepartment of the Eastern Pyrenees. Later, in 1&03,
when the question was agitated as to the continuation of the measure of the meridian
line as far as the Balearic Islands, M. Méchain went again to Perpignan, and came to
pay my father a visit. As I was about setting off to undergo the examination for ad-
mission at the Polytechnic School, my father ventured to ask him whether he could
not recommend me to M. Monge. ‘“ Willingly,” answered he; “but, with the frank-
ness which is my characteristic, I ought not to leave you unaware that it appears to
me improbable that your son, left to himself, can have rendered himself completely
master of the subjects of which the programme consists. If, however, he be admitted
let him be destined for the artillery or for the engineers. The career of the sciences of
which you have talked to me is really too difficult to go through, and, unless he had
a special calling for it, your son would only find it deceptive.” Anticipating a little
the order of dates, let us compare this advice with what occurred. I went to Tou-
louse, underwent the examination, and was admitted. One year and a half afterward
I filled the situation of secretary at the Observatory, which had become vacant by the
resignation of M. Méchain’s son. One year and a half later, that is to say, four years
after the Perpignan “ horoscope,” associated with M. Biot, I filled the place, in Spain,
ot the celebrated academician who had died there, a victim to his labors.

ease of the theory of osculations which I had studied in Lagrange’s
“Fonctions Analytiques.” “Finally,” said the examiner to me, “how
do you determine the tension of the various cords of which a funicular
machine is composed?” I treated this problem according to the method
expounded in the “ Mécanique Analytique.” It was clear that Lagrange
had supplied all the resources of my examination.

I had been two hours and a quarter at the board. M. Monge, going
from one extreme to the other, got up, came and embraced me, and sol-
emnly declared that I should occupy the first place on his list. Shall [
confess it?. During the examination of my comrade I had heard the
Toulousian candidates uttering not very favorable sarcasms on the
pupils from Perpignan; and it was principally for the sake of reparation
to my native town that M. Monge’s behavior and declaration trans-
ported me with joy.

Having entered the Polytechnic School, at the end of 1803 I was
placed in the excessively boisterous brigade of the Gascons and Britons.
I should have much liked to study thoroughly physics and chemistry,
of which I did not even know the first rudiments; but the behavior of
my companions rarely left me any time for it. As for analysis, I had,
already, before entering the Polytechni¢ School, learned much more than
was required for leaving it.

I have just related the strange words which M. Monge, jr., addressed
to me at Toulouse in commencing my examination for admission.’
Something analogous occurred at the opening of my examination
in mathematics for passing from one division of the school to another.
The examiner, this time, was the illustrious geometer Legendre, of
whom, a few years after, I had the honor of becoming the colleague and
the friend.

T entered his study at the moment when M. T , who was to undergo
his examination before me, having fainted away, was being carried out
in the arms of two servants. I thought that this circumstance would
have moved and softened M. Legendre; but it had no such effect.
“What is your name,” he said to me sharply. “Arago,” I answered.
‘You are not French, then?” ‘If Iwas not French I should not be
before you; for I have never heard of any one being admitted into the
school unless his nationality had been proved.” “TI maintain that he is
not French whose name is Arago.” ‘I maintain, on my side, that Iam
French, and a very good Frenchman, too, however strange my name
may appear to you.” ‘ Very well; we will not discuss the point farther;
go to the board.”

I had seareely taken up the chalk, when M. Legendre, returning to
the first subject of his preoccupations, said to me: ‘ You were born in
one of the departments recently united to France?” ‘No, sir; I was
born in the department of the Eastern Pyrenees, at the foot of the
Pyrenees.” “Oh! why did you not tell ne that at once? Allis now
explained. You are of Spanish origin are you not?” ‘ Possibly; but

in my humble family there are no authentic documents preserved which
could enable me to trace back the civil position of my ancestors. Hach
one there is the child of his own deeds. I declare to you again that I
am French, and that ought to be sufficient for you.”

The vivacity of this last answer had not disposed M. Legendre in my
favor. I saw this very soon; for, having put a question to me which
required the use of double integrals, he stopped me, saying: ‘The
method which you are following was not given to you by the professor.
Whence did you get it?” ‘From one of your papers.” “ Why did
you choose it?) Was it to bribe me?” ‘No; nothing was farther from
my thoughts. I only adopted it because it appeared te me preferable.”
‘Tf you are unable to explain to me the reasons for your preference,
I declare to you that you shall receive a bad mark, at least as to
character.”

I then entered upon the details which established, as I thought, that
the method of double integrals was in all points more clear and more
rational than that which Lacroix bad expounded to us in the amphi-
theater. From this moment Legendre appeared to me to be satisfied,
and to relent.

Afterward, he asked me to determine the center of gravity of a spher-
ical sector. “The question is easy,” I said to him. ‘Very well; since
you find it easy, I will complicate it; instead of supposing the density
constant, I will suppose that it varies from the center to the surface
according to a determined function.” I got through this caleulation
very happily; and from this moment I had entirely gained the favor of
the examiner. Indeed, on my retiring, he addressed to me these words,
which, coming from him, appeared to my comrades as a very favorable
augury for my chance of promotion: 1 see that you have employed your
time well; go on in the same way the second year, and we shall part
very good friends.”

In the mode of examination adopted at the Polytechnic School in 1804,
which is always cited as being better than the present organization, room
was allowed for the exercise of some unjustifiable caprices. Would it
be believed, for example, that the old M. Barruel examined two pupils
at a time in physics, and gave them, it is said, the same mark, which
was the mean between the actual merits of the two? For my part, I
was associated with a comrade full of intelligence, but who had not
studied this branch of the course. We agreed that he should leave the
answering to me, and we found the arrangement advantageous to both.

As I have been led to speak of the school as it was in 1804, I will say
that its faults were less those of organization than those of personal
management; for many of the professors were much below their office,
a fact which gave rise to somewhat ridiculous scenes. The pupils, for
instance, having observed the insufficiency of M. Hassenfratz, made a
demonstration of the dimensions of the rainbow, full of errors of caleu-
lation, but in which the one compensated the other so that the final

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. T64

result was true. The professor, who had only this result whereby to
judge of the goodness of the answer, when he saw it appear on the board,
did not hesitate to call out, ‘* Good, goad, perfectly good!” which excited
shouts of laughter on all the benches of the amphitheater.

When a professor has lost consideration, without which it is impossible
for him to do well, they allow themselves to insult him to an incredible
extent. Of this I will cite a single specimen.

A pupil, M. Leboullenger, met one evening in company this same M
Hassenfratz, and had a discussion with him. When he reéntered the
school in the morning, he mentioned this circumstance to us. “Be on
your guard,” said one of our comrades to him; “you will be interrogated
this evening. Play with caution, for the professor has certainly pre-
pared some great difficulties so as to cause laughter at your expense.”

Our anticipations were not mistaken. Scarcely had the pupils arrived
in the amphitheater, when M. Hassenfratz called to M. Leboullenger,
who came to the board.

““M. Leboullenger,” said the professor to him, “you have seen the
moon?” “No, sir.” ‘How, sir! you say that you have never seen the
moon?” “Tecan only repeat my answer—no, sir.” Beside himself, and
seeing his prey escape him, by means of this unexpected answer, M.
Hassentratz addressed himself to the inspector charged with the obsery-
ance of order that day, and said to him, “ Sir, there is M. Leboullenger,
who pretends never to have seen the moon.” ‘What would you wish
me to do?” stoically replied M. Le Brun. Repulsed on this side, the pro-
fessor turned once more toward M. Leboullenger, who remained calm
and earnest in the midst of the unspeakable amusement of the whole
amphitheater, and eried out with undisguised anger, “You persist in
maintaining that you have never seen the moon?” ‘ Sir,” returned the
pupil, “I should deceive you if I told you that I had not heard it spoken
of, but I have never seen it.” “Sir, return to your place.”

After this scene, M. Hassenfratz was but a professor in name; his
teaching could not longer be of any use.

At the commencement of the second year I was appointed “chef de
brigade.” Hatchette had been professor of hydrography at Collioure ;
his friends from Roussillon recommended me to him. He received me
with great kindness, and even gave me a room in his lodgings. It was
there that I had the pleasure of making Poisson’s acquaintance, who
lived next tous. Every evening the great geometer entered my room,
and we passed entire hours in conversing on politics and mathematics,
which is certainly not quite the same thing.

In the course of 1804 the school was a prey to political passions, and
that through the fault of the government.

They wished forthwith to oblige the pupils to sign an address of con-
gratulation on the discovery of the conspiracy in which Moreau was
implicated. They refused to do so on the ground that it was not for
them to pronounce on a cause which had been in the hands «f justice.
152 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

It must, however, be remarked, that Moreau had not yet dishonored
himself by taking service in the Russian army, which had come to attack
the French under the walls of Dresden.

The pupils were invited to make a manifestation in favor of the insti-
tution of the Legion of Honor. This again they refused. They knew
well that the cross, given without inquiry and without control, would
be, in most cases, the recompense of charlatanism, and not of true
merit.

The transformation of the consular into the imperial government gave
rise to very animated discussions in the interior of the school.

Many pupils refused to add their felicitations to the mean adulations
of the constituted bodies.

General Lacuée, who was appointed governor of the school, reported
this opposition to the Emperor.

‘““M. Lacuée,” cried Napoleon, in the midst of a group of courtiers,
who applauded with speech and gesture, “you cannot retain at the
school those pupils who have shown such ardent republicanism; you
will send them away.” Then, collecting himself, he added, ‘I will first
know their names and their stages of promotion.” Seeing the list the
next day, he did not proceed further than the first name, which was the
first in the artillery. ‘I will not drive away the first men in advance-
ment,” said he. “Ah! if they had been at the bottom of the list! M.
Lacuée, leave them alone.”

Nothing was more curious than the séance to which General Lacuée
came to receive the oath of obedience from the pupils. In the vast
amphitheater which contained them, one could not discern a trace of
the gravity which such a ceremony should inspire.. The greater part,
instead of answering, at the call of their names, “I swear it,” cried out,
‘“¢ Present.”

All at once, the monotony of this scene was interrupted by a pupil,
son of the Conventionalist Brissot, who called out in a stentorian voice,
‘‘T will not take the oath of obedience to the Emperor.” Lacuée, pale,
and with little presence of mind, ordered a detachment of armed pupils
placed behind him to go and arrest the recusant. The detachment, of
which I was at the head, refused to obey. Brissot, addressing himself
to the General, with the greatest calmness said to him, “ Point out
the place to which you wish me to go; do not force the pupils to dis-
honor themselves by laying hands on a comrade who has no desire to
resist.”

The next morning Brissot was expelled.

About this time, M. Méchain, who had been sent to Spain to prolong
the meridional line as far as Formentera, died at Castellon de la Plana.
His son, secretary at the observatory, immediately gave in his resigna-
tion. Poisson offered me the situation. I declined his first proposal.
I did not wish to renounce the military career, the object of all my pre-
dilections, and in which, morever, I was assured of the protection of

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 153

Marshal Lannes, a friend of my father’s. Nevertheless I accepted, on
trial, the position offered me in the observatory, after a visit which I
made to M. de Laplace in company with M. Poisson, under the express
condition that I could reénter the artillery if that should suit me. It
was from this cause that my name remained inscribed on the list of the
pupils of the school. I was only detached to the observatory on a
special service.

I entered this establishment, then, on the nomination of Poisson, iny
friend, and through the intervention of Laplace. The latter’ loaded me
with civilities. I was happy and proud when I dined in the Rue de
Tournon with the great geometer. My mind and my heart were much
disposed to admire all, to respect all, that was connected with him who
had discovered the cause of the secular equation of the moon, had found
in the movement of this planet the means of calculating the ellipticity
of the earth, had traced to the laws of attraction the long inequalities
of Jupiter and of Saturn, &c., &c. But what was my disenchantment
when one day I heard Madame de Laplace, approaching her husband,
say to him, ‘¢ Will you intrust to me the key of the sugar.”

Some days afterward, a second incident affected me still more vividly.
M. de Laplace’s son was preparing for the examinations of the Poly-
technic School. He came sometimes to see me at the observatory. In
one of his visits I explained to him the method of continued fractions,
by help of which Lagrange obtains the roots of numerical equations.
The young man spoke of it to his father with admiration. I shail never
forget the rage which followed the words of Emile de Laplace, and the
severity of the reproaches which were addressed to me, for having pat-
ronized a mode of proceeding which may be very long in theory, but
which evidently can in no way be found fault with on the score of its
elegance and precision. Never had a jealous prejudice shown itself
more openly, or under a more bitter form. “Ah!” said [ to myself,
‘‘how true was the inspiration of the ancients when they atiributed
weaknesses to him who nevertheless made Olympus tremble by a frown.”

Here I should mention, in order of time, a circumstance which might
have produced the most fatal consequences for me. The fact was this:

I have described above, the scene which caused the expulsion of
| Brissot’s son from the Polytechnic School. I had entirely lost sight of
him for several months, when he came to pay me a visit at the obser
| vatory, and placed me in the mos delicate, the most terrible position-
that an honest man ever found himself in.

“T have not seen you,” he said to me, “because since leaving the
school I have practiced daily firing with a pistol; I have now acquired
a skill beyond the common, and I am about to employ it in ridding
France of the tyrant who has confiscated all her liberties. My measures
are taken; I have hired a small room on the Carrousel, close to the
place by which Napoleon, on coming out from the court, will pass to

154 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

review the cavalry; from the humble window of my apartment will the
ball be fired which will go through his head.”

I leave it to be imagined with what despair I received this confidence.
I made every imaginable effort to deter Brissot from his sinister project:
Lremarked how all those who had rushed on enterprises of this nature had
been branded in history by the odious title of assassin. Nothing sue-
ceeded in shaking his fatal resolution; I only obtained from him a
promise on his honor that the execution of it should be postponed for a
time, and I put myself in quest of means for rendering it abortive.

The idea of announcing Brissot’s project to the authorities did not
even enter my thoughts. It seemed a fatality which came to smite me,
and of which I must undergo the consequences, however serious they
might be.

I counted much on the solicitations of Brissot’s mother, already so
cruelly tried during the revolution. I went to her home, in the Rue de
Condé, and implored her earnestly to codperate with me in preventing
her son from carrying out his sanguinary resolution. ‘Ah, sir,” replied
this lady, who was naturally a model of gentleness, “if Silvain” (this
was the name of her son) ‘‘ believes that he is accomplishing a patriotic
duty, I have neither the intention nor the desire to turn him from his
project.”

It was from myself that I must henceforth draw all my resources. I
had remarked that Brissot was addicted to the composition of romances
and pieces of poetry. I encouraged this passion, and every Sunday,
above all, when I knew that there would be a review, I went to fetch
him, and drew him into the country, in the environs of Paris. I listened
then complacently to the reading of those chapters of his romance
which he had composed during the week.

The first excursions frightened me a little, for,armed with his pistols,
Brissot seized every occasion of showing his great skill; and I reflected
that this circumstance would lead to my being considered as his accom-
plice, if he ever carried out his project. At last, his pretensions to
literary fame, which I flattered to the utmost, the hopes (though I had
none myself) which I led him to conceive of the success of an attach-
ment of which he had confided the secret to me, made him receive with
attention the reflections which I constantly made to him on his enter-
prise. He determined on making a journey beyond the seas, and thus
relieved me from the most serious anxiety which I have experienced in
all my life.

Brissot died after having covered the walls of Paris with printed
handbills in favor of the Bourbon restoration.

I had scarcely entered the observatory, when I became the fellow-
laborer of Biot in researches on the refraction of gases, already com-
menced by Borda.

While engaged in this work the celebrated academician and I often
conversed on the interest there would be in resuming in Spain the
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 155

measurement interrupted by the death of Méchain. We submitted our
project to Laplace, who received it with ardor, procured the necessary
tunds, and the government confided to us two this important mission.

M. Biot, I, and the Spanish commissary Rodriguez departed from
Paris in the commencement of 1806. We visited, on our way, the
stations indicated by Méchain, we made some important modifications
in the projected triangulation, and at once commenced operations.

An inaccurate direction given to the reflectors established at Iviza,
on the mountain Campvey, rendered the observations made on the con-
tinent extremely difficult. The light of the signal of Campvey was
very rarely seen, and I was, during six months, in the Desierto de las
Palmas, without being able to see it, while at a later period the light
established at the Desierto, but well directed, was seen every evening from
Campvey. It will easily be imagined what must be the ennwi experienced
by a young and active astronomer, confined to an elevated peak, having
for his walk only a space of twenty square meters, and for diversion
only the conversation of two Carthusians, whose convent was situated
at the foot of the mountain, and who came in secret, infringing the rule
of their order.

At the time when I write these lines, old and infirm, my legs scarcely
able to sustain me, my thoughts revert involuntarily to that epoch of
my life when, young and vigorous, I bore the greatest fatigues, and
walked day and night, in the mountainous countries which separate the
kingdoms of Valencia and Catalonia from the kingdom of Aragon, in
order to reéstablish our geodesic signals which the storms had overset.

Iwas at Valencia toward the middle of October, 1806. One morning
early the French consul entered my room quite alarmed: “ Here is sad
news,” said M. Lanusse to me; ‘‘make preparations for your departure;
the whole town is in agitation; a declaration of war against France
has just been published; it appears that we have experienced a great
disaster in Prussia. The Queen, we are assured, has put herself at the
head of the cavalry and of the royal guard; a part of the French army
has been cut to pieces; the rest is completely routed. Our lives would
not be in safety if we remained here; the I'rench ambassador at Mad-
rid will inform me as soon as an American vessel now at anchor in the
‘Grao’ of Valencia can take us on board, and I will let you know as
soon as the moment is come.” This moment never came; for a few
days afterward the false news, which one must suppose had dictated
the proclamation of the Prince of the Peace, was replaced by the bul-
letin of the battle of Jéna. People who at first played the braggart
and threatened to root us out suddenly became disgracefully cast down;
we could walk in the town, holding up our heads, without fear hence-
forth of being insulted.

This proclamation, in which they spoke of the critical cireumstances
in which the Spanish nation was placed; of the difficulties which encom-
passed this people; of the safety of their native country; of laurels,
156 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

and of the god of victory; of enemies with whom they ought to fight—
did not contain the name of France. They availed themselves of this
omission (will it be believed?) to maintain that it was directed against
Portugal.

Napoleon pretended to believe in this absurd interpretation; but from
this moment it became evident that Spain would sooner or later be
obliged to render a strict account of the warlike intentions which she
had suddenly evinced in 1806; this, without justifying the events of
Bayonne, explains them in a very natural way.

I was expecting M. Biot at Valencia, he having undertaken to bring
some new instruments with which we were to measure the latitude of
Formentera. I shall take advantage of these short intervals of repose
to insert here some details of manners, which may, perhaps, be read
with interest.

I will recount, in the first instance, an adventure which nearly cost me
my life under somewhat singular circumstances :

One day, as a recreation, I thought I could go, with a fellow-country-
man, to the fair at Murviedro, the ancient Saguntum, which they told
me was very curious. I met in the town the daughter of a Frenchman
resident at Valencia, Mdlle. B . <All the hotels were crowded;
Mdlle. B invited us to take some refreshments at her grand-
mother’s; we accepted; but on leaving the house she informed us that
our visit had not been to the taste of her betrothed, and that we must
be prepared for some sort of attack on his part; we went directly to an
armorer’s, bought some pistols, and commenced our return to Valencia.

On our way I said to the calezero, (driver,) a man whom I had em-
ployed for a long time, and who was much devoted to me:

‘Isidro, I have some reason to believe that we shall be stopped; I
warn you of it, so that you may not be surprised at the shots which
will be fired from the caleza,” (vehicle.)

Isidro, seated on the shaft, according to the custom of the country,
answered:

‘Your pistols are completely useless, gentlemen; leave me to act;
one ery will be enough; my mule will rid us of two, three, or even four
men.”

Scarecely one minute had elapsed after the calezero had uttered these
words, when two men presented themselves before the mule and seized
her by the nostrils. At the same instant a formidable ery, which will
never be effaced from my remembrance—the ery of Capittana!—was
uttered by Isidro. The mule reared up almost vertically, raising up
one of the men, came down again, and set off at a rapid gallop. The
jolt which the carriage made led us to understand too well what had
just occurred. A long silence succeeded this incident; it was only
interrupted by these words of the calezero, ‘Do you not think, gentle-
men, that my mule is worth more than any pistols?”

The next day the Captain General, Don Domingo Izquierdo, related

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 157

to me that a man had been found crushed on the road to Murviedro.
I gave him an account of the prowess of Isidro’s mule, and no more
was said.

One anecdote, taken from among a thousand, will show what an
adventurous life was led by the delegate of the Bureau of Longitude.

During my stay on a mountain near Cullera, to the north of the
mouth of the river Xucar, and to the south of the Albuféra, I once con-
ceived the project of establishing a station on the high mountains
which are in front of it. I went to see them. Thealcaid of one of the
neighboring villages warned me of the danger to which I was about to
expose myself. ‘These mountains,” said he to me, “form the resort of
a band of highway robbers.” I asked for the national guard, as I had
the power to do so. My escort was supposed by the robbers to be an
expedition directed against them, and they dispersed themselves at
once over the rich plain which is watered by the Xucar. On my return
I found them engaged in combat with the authorities of Cullera.
Wounds had been given on both sides, and, if I recollect right, one
alguazil was left dead on the plain.

The next morning I regained my station. The following night was a
horrible one; the rain fell ina deluge. Toward night there was knock-
ing at my cabin door. To the question “‘ Who is there?” the answer

yas, “A custom-house guard, who asks of you a shelter for some hours.”
My servant having opened the door to him, I saw a magnificent man
enter, armed to the teeth. He laid himself down on the earth, and went
to sleep. In the morning, as I was chatting with him at the door of my
cabin, his eyes flashed on seeing two persons on the slope of the mountain,
the alcaid of Cullera and his principal alguazil, who were coming to pay
mea visit. Sir,” cried he, ‘‘nothing less than the gratitude which I
owe to you, on account of the service which you have rendered to me
this night, could prevent my seizing this occasion for ridding myself,
by one shot of this carabine, of my most cruel enemy. Adieu, sir!”
And he departed, springing from rock to rock as light as a gazelle.

On reaching the cabin, the aleaid and his alguazil recognized in the
fugitive the chief of all the brigands in the country.

Some days afterward, the weather having again become very bad,
I received a second visit from the pretended custom-house guard, who
went soundly to sleep in wy cabin. I saw that my servant, an old sol-
dier, who had heard the recital of the deeds and behavior of this man,
was preparing to kill him. I jumped down from my camp bed, and,
Seizing my servant by the throat, ‘“Are you mad?” said I to him; “are
we to discharge the duties of police in this country? Do you not see,
moreover, that this would expose us to the resentment of all those who
obey the orders of this redoubted chief? and we should thus render. it
impossible for us to terminate our operations.”

Next morning, when the sun rose, I had a conversation with my guest,
which I will try to reproduce faithfully.
158 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

“Your situation is perfectly known to me; I know that you are not
a custom-house guard; I have learned from certain information that you
are the chief of the robbers of the country. Tell me whether I have any-
thing to fear from your confederates.” ;

“The idea of robbing you did occur to us, but we concluded that all
your funds would be in the neighboring towns; that you would carry
no money to the summit of mountains, where you would not know what
to do with it, and that our expedition against you could have no fruitful
result. Moreover, we cannot pretend to be as strong as the King of
Spain. The King’s troops leave us quietly enough to exercise our in-
dustry, but on the day that we molested an envoy from the Emperor of
the Freneh, they would direct against us several regiments, and we
should soon have to succumb. Allow me to add, that the gratitude
which I owe to you is your surest guarantee.”

‘Very well, I will trust in your words; I shall regulate my conduct
by your answer. Tell me if I can travel at night; it is fatiguing to me
to move from one station to another in the day under the burning
influence of the sun.”

“You can do so, sir; I have already given my orders to this purpose;
they will not be infringed.”

Some days afterward I left for Denia; it was midnight, when some
horsemen rode up to me, and addressed these words to me:

“‘Stop there, senor; times are hard; those who have something must
aid those who have nothing. Give us the keys of your trunks; we will
only take your superfluities.”

I had already obeyed their orders, when it came into my head to call
out, But [I have been told that I could travel without risk.”

“What is your name, sir?”

“Don Francisco Arago.”

“« Hombre! vaya usted con Dios,” (God be with you.)

And our cavaliers, spurring away from us, rapidly lost themselves in a
field of “ algarrobas.”

When my friend the robber of Cullera assured me that I had nothing to
fear from his subordinates, he informed me at the same time that his
authority did not extend north of Valencia. The banditti of the north-
ern part of the kingdom obeyed other chiefs, one of whom, after having
been taken, was condemned and hung, and his body divided into four
quarters, which were fastened to posts on four royal roads, but not with-
out their having previously been boiled in oil, to make sure of their
longer preservation.

This barbarous custom produced no effect, for scarcely was one chief
destroyed before another presented himself to replace him.

Of all these brigands those had the worst reputation who carried on
their depredations in the environs of Oropeza. The proprietors of the
three mules on which M. Rodriguez, I, and my servant were riding one
evening in this neighborhood were recounting to us the “ grand deeds”
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 159

of these robbers, which, even in full daylight, would have made the hair
of one’s head stand on end, when, by the faint light of the moon, we
perceived a man hiding himself behind a tree. We were six, and yet
this sentry on horseback had the audacity to demand our purses or our
lives. My servant at once answered him, *‘ You must then believe us to
be very cowardly; take yourself off, or I will bring you down by one
shot of my carabine.” “TI will be off,” returned the worthless fellow,
‘but you will soon hear news of me.” Still full of fright at the remem-
brance of the stories which they had just been relating, the three “ arie-
ros” besought us to quit the high road and cast ourselves into a wood
which was on our left. We yielded to their proposal, but we lost our
way. ‘Dismount,” said they, “the mules have been obeying the bridle,
and you have directed them wrongly. Let us retrace our way as far as
the high road and leave the mules to themselves; they will well know
how to find their right way again.” Scarcely had we effected this ma-
neuver, which succeeded marvellously well, when we heard a lively dis-
cussion taking place at a short distance from us. Some were saying,
“We must follow the high road, and we shall meet with them.” Others
maintained that they must get into the wood on the left. The barking
of the dogs, by which these individuals were accompanied, added to the
tumult. During this time we pursued our way silently, more dead than
alive. It was two o’clock in the morning. All at once we saw a faint
light in a solitary house; it was like a light-house for the mariner in the
midst of the tempest, and the only means of safety which remained to
us. Arrived at the door of the farm, we knocked and asked for hospi-
tality. The inmates, very little reassured, feared that we were thieves,
and did not hurry themselves to open to us.

Impatient at the delay, I cried out, as I had received authority to do
so, ‘“‘In the name of the King, open to us.” They obeyed an order thus
given; we entered pell-mell, and in the greatest haste, men and mules
into the kitchen, which was on the ground floor; and we hurried to ex-
tinguish the lights, in order not to awaken the suspicions of the bandits
who were seeking for us. Indeed, we heard them, passing and repassing
near the house, vociferating with the whole force of their lungs against
their unlucky fate. We did not quit this solitary house until broad
day, and we continued our route for Tortosa, not without having given
a suitable recompense to our hosts. I wished to know by what provi-
dential circumstance they happened to have a lamp burning at that
unseasonable hour. ‘ We had killed a pig,” they told me, “in the course
of the day, and we were.busy preparing the black puddings.” Had the
pig lived one day more, or had there been no black puddings, I should
certainly have been no longer in this world, and I should not have the
opportunity to relate the story of the robbers of Oropeza.

Never could I better appreciate the intelligent measure by which the
constituent assembly abolished the ancient division of France into prov-
inces, and substituted its division into departments, than in traversing

for my triangulation the Spanish border kingdoms ef Catalonia, Valen-
cia, and Aragon. The inhabitants of these three provinces detested
each other cordially, and nothing less than the bond of a common hatred
was necessary to make them act simultaneously against France. Such
was their animosity in 1807 that I could scarcely make use at the same
time of Catalonians, Aragons, and Valencians, when I moved with my
instruments from one station to another. ‘The Valencians in particular
were treated by the Catalonians as a light, trifling, inconsistent people.
They were in the habit of saying to me, “ Ln el reino de Valencia la carne
es verdura, la verdura agua, los hombres mugeres, las mugeres nada,” which
may be translated thus: “In the kingdom of Valencia meat is a vege-
table, vegetables are water, men are women, and women nothing.”

On the other hand, the Valencians, speaking of the Aragons, used to
call them “ schuros.”

Having asked of a herdsman of this province who had brought some
goats near to one of my stations what was the origin of this denomina-
tion, at which his compatriots showed themselves so offended:

“TY do not know,” said he, smiling cunningly at me, “‘ whether I dare
answer you.” ‘Go on, go on,” I said to him, “I can hear anything
without being angry.” ‘ Well, the word schuros means that, to our great
shame, we have sometimes been governed by French kings. The sov-
ereign, before assuming power, was bound to promise under oath to
respect our freedom, and to articulate in a loud voice the solemn words
lo Jurvof! As he did not know how to pronounce the J, he said schuro.
Are you satisfied, sefior?” LTanswered him, “ Yes, yes; I see that vanity
and pride are not dead in this country.”

Since I have just spoken of a shepherd, I will say that in Spain the
class of individuals of both sexes destined to look after herds appeared
to me always less further removed than in France from the pictures
which the ancient poets have left us of the shepherds and shepherdesses
in their pastoral poetry. The songs by which they endeavor to while
away the tedium of their monotonous life are more remarkable in their
form and substance than in the other European nations to which I have
had access. J never recollect without surprise that, being on a mountain
situated at the junction-point of the kingdoms of Valencia, Aragon, and
Catalonia, I was all at once overtaken by a violent storm, which forced
ine to take refuge in my tent, and to remain there squatting on the
ground. When the storm was over and I came out from my retreat, I
heard, to my great astonishment, on an isolated peak which looked down
upon my station, a shepherdess, who was singing a song, of which I only
recollect these eight lines, which will give an idea of the rest:

Las gracias al me certe
Eran cuadro de flores

Te cantaban amorese
Por hacerte callar.

Oh! how much sap there is in this Spanish nation! What a pity
that they will not make it yield fruit ?

In 1807, the tribunal of the Inquisition existed still at Valencia, and
at times performed its functions. The reverend fathers, it is true, did
not burn people, but they pronounced sentences in which the ridiculous
contended with the odious. During my residence in this town, the
holy office had to busy itself about a pretended sorceress; it doomed
her to go through all quarters of the town astride on an ass, her face
turned toward the tail, and naked down to the waist. Merely to ob-
serve the commonest rules of decency, the poor woman had been plas-
tered with a sticky substance, partly honey, they told me, to which
adhered an enormous quantity of little feathers, so that, to say the
truth, the victim resembled a fowl with a human head. The proces-
sion, whether attended by a crowd I leave it to be imagined, sta-
tioned itself for some timein the cathedral square, where I lived. I was
told that the sorceress was struck on the back a certain number of blows
with a shovel; but I do not venture to affirm this, for I was absent at
the moment when this hideous procession passed before my windows.

We thus see, however, what sort of spectacles were given to the
people in the commencement of the nineteenth century, in one of the
principal towns of Spain, the seat of a celebrated university, and the
native country of numerous citizens distinguished by their knowledge,
their courage, and their virtues. Let not the friends of humanity and
of civilization disunite; let them form, on the contrary, an indissoluble
union, for superstition is always on the watch, and waits for the
moment again to seize its prey.

I have mentioned in the course of my narrative that two Carthusians
often left their convent in the Desierto dé las Palmas, and came though
prohibited, to see me at my station, situated about two hundred meters
higher. A few particulars will give an idea of what certain monks
were, in the Peninsula, in 1897.

One of them, Father Trivulce, was old; the other was very young.
The former, of French origin, had played a part at Marseilles, in the
counter-revolutionary events of which this town was the theater, at the
commencement of our first revolution. His part had been a very active
one; one might see the proof of this in the scars of saber cuts which
furrowed his breast. It was he who was the first to come. When he
saw his young comrade march up, he hid himself; but as soon as the
latter had fully entered into conversation with me, Father Trivulce
showed himself all at once. His appearance had the effect of Medusa’s
head. ‘Reassure yourself,” said he to his young compeer; “only les
us not denounce each other, for our prior is not a man to pardon us for

having come here and infringed our vow of silence, and we should both
receive @ punishment, the recollection of which would long remain.”
The treaty was at once concluded, and from that day forward the two
Jarthusians came very often to converse with me.

The youngest of our two visitors was an Aragonian; his family had
made him a monk against his will. He related to me one day, before M.
Biot, (then returned from Tarragon, where he had taken refuge to get
cured of his fever,) some particulars which, according to him, proved
that in Spain there was no longer more than the ghost of religion.
These details were mostly borrowed from the secrets of confession. M.
Biot manifested sharply the displeasure which this conversation caused
him; there were even in his language some words which led the monk
to suppose that M. Biot took him for a kind of spy. As soon as this
suspicion had entered his mind, he quitted us without saying a word,
and the next morning I saw him come up early, armed with a light gun.
The French monk had preceded him, and had whispered in my ear the
danger that threatened my companion. “Join with me,” he said, “ to
turn the young Aragonian monk from his murderous project.” I need
scarcely say that 1 employed myself with ardor in this negotiation, in
which I had the happiness to succeed. There were here, as must be
seen, the materials for a chief of guerilleros. I should be much aston-
ished if my young monk did not play his part in the war of indepen-
dence.

The anecdote which I am about to relate will amply prove that reli-
gion was, with the Carthusian monks of.the Desierto de las Palmas, not
the consequence of elevated sentiments, but a mere compound of super-
stitious practices.

The scene with the gun, always present to my mind, seemed to make it
clear to me that the Aragon monk, if actuated by his passions, would
be capable of the most criminal actions. Hence, I had a very disagree-
able impression when one Sunday, having come down to hear mass, I
met this monk, who, without saying a word, conducted me by a series
of dark corridors into a chapel where the daylight penetrated only by a
very small window. There I found Father Trivulce, who prepared him-
self to say mass for me alone. The young monk assisted. All at once,
an instant before the consecration, Father Trivulce, turning toward me,
said these exact words: ‘ We have permission to say mass with white
wine; we therefore make use of that which we gather from our own
vines; this wine is very good. Ask the prior to let you taste it, when
on leaving this you go to breakfast with him. For the rest, you can as-
sure yourself this instant of the truth of what I say to you.” And he
presented me the goblet to drink from. I resisted strongly, not only
because I considered it indecent to give this invitation in the middle
of the mass, but because, besides, I must own I conceived the thought
for a moment that the monks wished, by poisoning me, to reveng
themselves on me for M. Biot having insulted them. I found that I was
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 163

mistaken, that my suspicions had no foundation; for Father Trivulce
went on with the interrupted mass, drank, and drank largely, of the
white wine contained in one of the goblets. But when I had got out of
the hands of the two monks, and was able to breathe the pure air of the
country, I experienced a lively satisfaction.

The right of asylum accorded to some churches was one of the most

obnoxious privileges among those of which the revolution of 1798 rid
France. In 1807, this right still existed in Spain, and belonged, L be-
lieve, to allthe cathedrals. I learned, during my stay at Barcelona, that
there was, in a little cloister contiguous to the largest church of the
town, a brigand—a man guilty of several assassinations, who lived
quietly there, guaranteed against all pursuit by the sanctity of the place.
I wished to assure myself with my own eyes of the reality of the fact,
and I went with my friend Rodriguez into the little cloister in question.
The assassin was then eating a meal which a woman had just brought
him. He easily guessed the object of our visit, and made immediately
such demonstrations as convinced us that, if the asylum was safe for
the robber, it would not ke so long for us. We retired at once, deplor-
ing that in a country calling itself civilized there should still exist such
crying, such monstrous abuses.
In order to succeed in our geodesic operations, to obtain the codpera-
tion of the inhabitants of the villages near our stations, it was desirable
for us to be recommended to the priests. We went, therefore—M.
Lanusse, the French vice-consul, M. Biot, and I—to pay a visit to the
Archbishop of Valencia, to solicit his protection. This archbishop, a
man of very tall figure, was then chief of the Franciscans; his costume,
more than negligent, his grey robe, covered with tobacco, contrasted
with the magnificence of the archiepiscopal palace. He received us
with kindness, and promised us all the recommendations we desired ;
but, at the moment of taking leave of him, the whole affair seemed to
be spoiled. M. Lanusse and M. Biot went out of the reception-room
without kissing the hand of his grace, although he had presented it to
each of them very graciously. The archbishop indemnified himself on
my poor person. A movement, which was very near breaking my teeth,
a gesture which I might justly call a blow of the fist, proved to me that
the chief of the Iranciscans, notwithstanding his vow of humility, had
taken offense at the want of ceremony in my fellow-visitors. I was go-
ing to complain of the abrupt way in which he had treated me, but I
had the necessities of our trigonometrical operations before my eyes,
and I was silent.

Besides this, at the instant when the closed fist of the archbishop was
applied to my lips, I was still thinking of the beautiful optical experi-
ments which it would have been possible to make with the magnificent
stone which ornamented his pastoral ring. This idea, I must frankly
declare, had preoccupied me during the whole of the visit.

M. Biot having at last come to seek me again at Valencia, where I ex-
164 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

pected, as I have before said, some new instruments, we went on to
Formentera, the southern extremity of our are, of which place we deter-
mined the latitude. M. Biot quitted me afterward to return to Paris,
while I made the geodesical junction of the island of Majorca to Iviza,
and to Formentera, obtaining thus, by means of one single triangle, the
measure of an are of parallel of one degree and a half.

I then went to Majorca, to measure there the latitude and the azimuth,
At this epoch, the political fermentation, engendered by the entrance of
the French into Spain, began to invade the whole Peninsula and the
islands dependent on it. This ferment had as yet in Majorca only
reached to the ministers, the partisans, and the relations of the Prince
of Peace. Each evening I saw, drawn in triumph in the square of
Palma, the capital of the island of Majorca, on carriages, the effigies in
flames, sometimes of the minister Soller, another time those of the
bishop, and even those of private individuals supposed to be attached to
the fortunes of the favorite Godoi. I was far from suspecting then that
my turn would soon arrive.

My station at Majorca, the Clop de Galazo, a very high mountain,
was situated exactly over the port where Don Jayme el Conquisiator dis-
embarked when he went to deliver the Balearic Islands from the Moors.
The report spread itself through the population that I had established
myself there in order to favor the arrival of the French army, and that
every evening I made signals to it. But these reports had nothing
menacing until the moment of the arrival at Palma, the 27th of May,
1808, of an ordnance ofiicer from Napoleon. This officer was M. Ber-
thémie; he carried to the Spanish squadron, at Mahon, the order to go
in all haste to Toulon. A general rising, which placed the life of this
ofiicer in danger, followed the news of his mission. The Captain Gen-
eral Vivés only saved his lite by shutting him up in the strong castle
of Belver. They then bethought themselves of the Frenchman estab-
lished on the Clop de Galazo, and formed a popular expedition to go and
seize him.

M. Damian, the owner of a small kind of vessel called a mistic, which
the Spanish government had ‘placed at my disposal, was beforehand
with them, and brought me a costume by means of which I disguised
myself. In directing myself toward Palma, in company with this
brave seaman, we met with the rioters, who were going in search of me.
They did not recognize me, for I spoke Majorean perfectly. I strongly
encouraged the men of this detachment to continue their route, and I
pursued my way toward Palma. At night | went on board the mistie,
commanded by Don Manuel de Vacaro, whom the Spanish government
had placed under my orders. I asked this officer if he would conduct
me to Barcelona, occupied by the French, promising him that, if they
made any attempt to keep him there, I would at once return and sur-
render myself a prisoner.

Don Manuel, who up to this time had shown extreme obsequiousness
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 165

toward me, had now no words but those of rudeness and distrust.
There occurred on the pier where the mistic was moored a riotous
movement, which Vacaro assured me was directed against me. ‘Do
not be uneasy,” said he to me; ‘if they should penetrate into the ves-
sel, you can hide yourself in this trunk.” I made the attempt, but the
chest which he showed me was so small that my legs were entirely out-
side, and the cover could not be shut down. I understood perfectly
what that meant, and I asked M. Vacaro to let me also be shut up in
the castle of Belver. The order for incarceration having arrived from
the captain general, I got into the boat, where the sailors of the mistic
received me with emotion.

At the moment of their crossing the harbor, the populace perceived
me, commenced a pursuit, and it was not without much difficulty that
I reached Belver safe and sound. I had only, indeed, received on my
way one slight wound from a dagger in the thigh. Prisoners have
often been seen to run with all speed from their dungeon; I am the
first, perhaps, to whom it has happened to do the reverse. This took
place on the Ist or 2d of June, 1808,

The governor of Belver was a very extraordinary personage; if he is
still alive, he may demand of me a certificate as to his priority to the
modern hydropathists. The grenadier captain maintained that pure
water, suitably administered, was a means of treatment for all illnesses,
even for amputations; by listening very patiently to his theories, and
never interrupting him, I won his good opinion. It was at his request,
and from*interest in our safety, that a Swiss garrison replaced the
Spanish troop which, until then, had been employed as the guard of
Belver. It was also through him that I one day learned that a monk
had proposed to the soldiers who went to bring my food from the town,
to put some poison into one of the dishes.

All my old Majorean friends had abandoned me at the moment of my
detention. I had had a very sharp correspondence with Don Manuel
de Vacaro, in order to obtain the restitution of the passport of safety
which the English admiralty had granted tous. M. Rodriguez alone
ventured to visit me in full daylight, and bring me every consolation
in his power.

The excellent M. Rodriguez, to while away the monotony of my
incarceration, remitted to me, from time to time, the journals which
were then published at different parts of the Peninsula. He often sent
them to me without reading them. Once I saw in these journals the
recital of the horrible massacres of which the town of Valencia—I make
a mistake, the square of the bull-fights—had been the theater, and in
which nearly the whole of the French established in this town (more
than three hundred and fifty) had disappeared under the pike of the
bull-fighter. Another journal contained an article bearing this title,
“Relacion de la ahorcadura del Sefior Arago e del Sefior Berthémie”—
literally, “Account of the Execution of M. Arago and M. Berthémie.”
166 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

This account spoke of the two executed men in very different terms.
M. Berthémie was a Huguenot; he had been deaf to all exhortations;
he had spit in the face of the ecclesiastic who was present, and even on
the image of Christ. As for me, I had conducted myself with much
decency, and had allowed myself to be hung without giving rise to any
scandal. The writer also expressed his regret that a young astronomer
had been so weak as to associate himself with treason, coming under
the disguise of science to assist the entrance of the French army into
a friendly kingdom.

After reading this article, | immediately made my decision. ‘Since
they talk of my death,” said I to my friend Rodriguez, “the event will
not be loug in coming; I should prefer being drowned to being hung.
I will make my escape from this fortress; it is for you to furnish me
with the means.”

todriguez, knowing better than any one how well founded my appre-
hensions were, set himself at once to the work. He went to the captain
general, and made him feel what would be the danger of his position if
I should disappear in a popular riot, or even if he were forced to give
me up. His observations were so much the better comprehended, as
no one could then predict what might be the issue of the Spanish revo-
lution. “TI will undertake,” said the captain general Vivés to my col-
league Rodriguez, “to give an order to the commander of the fortress,
that when the right moment arrives, he shall allow M. Arago, and even
the two or three other Frenchmen who are with him in the castle of
Belver, to pass out; they will then have no need of the means of escape
which they have procured. But I will take no part in the preparations
which will become necessary to enable the fugitives to leave the island;
I leave all that to your responsibility.”

Rodriguez immediately conferred secretly with the brave commander
Damian. It was agreed between them that Damian should take the
command of a half-decked boat which the wind had driven ashore; that
he should equip it as if for a fishing expedition; that he should carry
us to Algiers, after which his reéntrance at Palmas, with or without
fish, would inspire no suspicion. All was executed according to agree-
ment, notwithstanding the inquisitorial surveillance which Don Manuel
de Vacaro exercised over the commander of his ‘ mistic.”

On the 28th July, 1808, we silently descended the hill on which Bel-
ver is built, at the same moment that the family of the minister Soller
entered the fortress to escape the fury of the populace. Arrived at the
shore, we found there Damian, his boat, and three sailors; we embarked
at once, and set sail. Damian had taken the precaution of bringing
with us in this frail vessel the instruments of value which he had car-
ried off from my station at the Clop de Galazo. The sea was unfavor-
able; Damian thought it prudent to stop at the little island of Cabrera,
destined to become, a short time afterward, so sadly celebrated by the
sufferings which the soldiers of the army of Dupont experienced after
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 167

the shameful capitulation of Baylen. There a singular incident was very
near compromising all: Cabrera, tolerably near to the southern extrem-
ity of Majorca, is often visited by fishermen coming from that part of
the island. M. Berthémie feared, justly enough, that, the rumor of our
escape having spread about, they might dispatch some boats to seize
us. He looked upon our going into harbor as inopportune; I main-
tained that we must yield to the prudence of the commander. During
this discussion, the three seamen whom Damian had engaged saw that
M. Berthémie, whom I had endeavored to pass off as my servant, main-
tained his opinion against me on a footing of equality. They then
addressed themselves in these terms to the commander:

“We only consented to take part in this expedition upon condition
that the Emperor’s aid-de-camp, shut up at Belver, should not be of the
number of those persons whom we should help off; we only wished to
aid the flight of the astronomer. Since it seems to be otherwise, you
must leave this officer here, unless you would prefer to throw him into
the sea.”

Damian at once informed me of the imperative wishes of his boat’s
crew. M. Berthémie agreed with me to suffer some abuse, such as
could only be tolerated by a servant threatened by his master: all the
suspicions disappeared.

Damian, who feared also for himself the arrival of Majorcan fisher-
men, hastened to set sail on the 29th of July, 1808, the first moment
that was favorable, and we arrived at Algiers on the 3d of August.

Our looks were anxiously directed toward the port, to guess what
reception might await us. We were reassured by the sight of the tri-
colored flag which was flying on two or three buildings; but we were
mistaken, these buildings were Dutch. Immediately upon our entrance,
a Spaniard, whom, from his tone of authority, we took for a high func-
tionary of the regency, came up to Damian, and asked him, ‘‘ What do
you bring?” ‘I bring,” answered the commander, “ four Frenchmen.”
“You will at once take them back again; I prohibit you from disem-
barking.” As we did not seem inclined to obey his order, our Span-
iard, who was the constructing engineer of the ships of the Dey, armed
himself with a pole, and commenced battering us with blows; but
immediately a Genoese seaman, mounted on a neighboring vessel,
armed himself with an oar, and struck our assailant both with edge
and point. During this animated combat, we managed to land without
any opposition. We had conceived a singular idea of the manner in
which the police act on the coast of Africa.

We pursued our way to the French consul’s, M. Dubois Thainville;
he was at his country house. Escorted by the janissary of the consul-
ate, we went off toward this country house, one of the ancient residences
of the Dey, situated not far from the gate of Bab-azoum. The consul
and his family received us with great amity, and offered us hospitality.

Suddenly transported to a new continent, I looked forward anxiously
168 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

to the rising of the sun to enjoy all that Africa might offer of interest
to a European, when all at once I believed myself to be engaged in a
serious adventure. By the faint light of the dawn, I saw an animal
moving at the foot of my bed. I gave a kick with my foot; all move-
ment ceased. After some time, I felt the same movement under my
legs. A sharp jerk made this cease quickly. I then heard the fits of
laughter of the janissary, who lay on a couch in the same room as I did;
and I soon saw that he had simply placed on my bed a large hedgehog
to amuse himself by my uneasiness.

The consul occupied himself the next day in procuring a passage for
us on board a vessel of the Regency which was going to Marseilles. M.
Ferrier, the chancellor of the French consulate, was at the same time
consul for Austria. He procured for us two false passports, which
transformed us—M. Berthémie and me—into two strolling merchants,
the one from Schwekat, in Hun gary, the other from Leoben.

The moment of departure had arrived; the 13th of August, 1808, we
were on board, but our ship’s company was not complete. The captain,
whose title was Rai Braham Ouled Mustapha Goja, having perceived that
the Dey was on his terrace, and fearing punishment if he should delay
to set sail, completed his crew at the expense of the idlers who were
looking on from the pier, and of whom the greater part were not sailors.
These poor people begged as a favor for permission to go and inform
their families of this precipitate departure, and to .get some clothes.
The captain remained deaf to their remonstrances. We weighed anchor.

The vessel belonged to the Emir of Seca, director of the mint. The
real commander was a Greek captain, named Spiro Calligero. The cargo
consisted of a great number of groups. Among the passengers there
were five members of the family which the Bakri had succeeded as
kings of the Jews; two ostrich-feather merchants, Moroccans; Captain
Krog, from Berghen in Norway, who had sold his ship at Alicant; two
lions sent by the Dey to the Emperor Napoleon, and a great number of
monkeys. Our voyage was prosperous. Off Sardinia we met with an
American ship coming out from Cagliari. A cannon-shot (we were
armed with forty pieces of small power) warned the captain to come to
be recognized. He brought on board a certain number of counterparts
of passports, one of which agreed perfectly with that which we carried.
The captain being thus all right, was not-a little astonished when I
ordered him, in the name of Captain Braham, to furnish us with tea,
coffee, and sugar. The American captain protested; he called us brig-
ands, pirates, robbers. Captain Braham admitted without difficulty all
these qualifications, and persisted none the less in the exaction of sugar,
coffee, and tea.

The American, then driven to the last stage of exasperation, addres-
sed himself to me, who acted as interpreter, and cried out, “ Oh! rogue
of a renegade! if ever I meet you on holy ground I will break your head.”
“Can you then suppose,” I answered him, “that I am here for my
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 169

pleasure, and that, nothwithstanding your menace, I would not rather
go with you, if I could?” These words calmed him; he brought the
sugar, the coffee, and the tea claimed by the Moorish chief and we again
set sail, though without having excharged the usual farewell.

We had already entered the Gulf cf Lyons, and were approaching
Marseilles, when on the 16th August, 1808, we met with a Spanish cor-
sair from Palamos, armed at the prow with two 24-pounders. We made
full sail; we hoped to escape it: but a cannon shot, a ball from which
went through our sails, taaght us that she was a much better sailer than
we were.

We obeyed an injunction thus expressed, and awaited the great boat
from the corsair. The captain declared that he made us prisoners,
although Spain was at peace with Barbary, under the pretext that we
were violating the blockade which had been lately raised on all the coasts
of France; he added that he intended to take us to Rosas, and that
there the authorities would decide on our fate.

I was in the cabin of the vessel; I had the curiosity to look furtively
atythe crew of the boat, and there I perceived, with a dissatisfaction
which may easily be imagined, one of the sailors of the ‘“‘mistic,” com-
manded by Don Manuel de Vacaro, of the name of Pablo Blanco, of Pala-
mos, who had often acted as my servant during my geodesec operations.
My false passport would beeccme from this moment useless, if Pablo
should recognize me. -I went to bed at once, covered my head witha
counterpane,and lay as still as a statue.

During the two days which elapsed between cur capture and our
entrance into the rcads of Rosas, Pablo, whose curiosity often brought
him into the room, used to exclaim, “There is one passenger whom I
have not yet managed to get a sight of.”

When we arrived at Rosas it was decided that we should be placed
in quarantine in a dismantled windmill, situated on the road leading to
Figueras. I was careful to disembark in a boat to which Pablo did not
belong. The corsair departed for a new cruise, and I was for a moment
freed from the harassing thoughts which my old servant had caused me.

Our ship was richly laden; the Spanish authorities were immediately
desirous to declare it a lawful prize. They pretended to believe that I
was the proprietor of it, and wished, in order to hasten things, to inter-
regate me, even without awaiting the completion of the quarantine.
They stretched two cords between the mill and the shore; and a judge
placed himself in front of me. As the interrogatories were made from -
a good distance, the numerous audience which encircled us took a direct
part in the questions and answers. I will endeavor to reproduce this
dialogue with all possible fidelity :

“ Who are you?”

‘¢ A poor roving merchant.”

‘6 Whence do you come?” __

“From a country where you certainly never were.”
170 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

“In a word, what country is it ?”

I was afraid to answer, for the passports, steeped in vinegar, were in
the hands of the judge-instructor, and I had forgotten whether I was
from Schwekat or from Leoben. Finally I answered at all hazards:

“T come from Schwekat.”

And this information happily was found to agree with that of the
passport.

“You are as much from Schwekat as I am,” answered the judge.
“You are Spanish, and, moreover, a Spaniard from the kingdom of
Valencia, as I perceive by your accent.”

‘“ Would you punish me, sir, because nature has endowed me with
the gift of languages? I learn with facility the dialects of those coun-
tries through which I pass in the exercise of my trade; | have learned,
for example, the dialect of Iviza.”

‘¢ Very well, you shall be taken at your word. I see here a soldier
from Iviza; you shall hold a conversation with him.”

“T consent; I will even sing the goat song.”

Each of the verses of this song (if verses they be) terminates by, an
imitation of the bleating of the eee

I commenced at once, with an audacity at which I really feel aston-
ished, to chant this air, which is sung by all the shepherds of the island:

Ah graciada sefora
Una canzo bouil canta
Bb, be, be, be.

No sera gaira pulida

At once my Ivizacan, upon whom this air had the effect of the ranz
des vaches on the Swiss, declared, all in tears, that I was a native of
Iviza.

I then said to the judge that if he would put me in communication
with a person knowing the French language, he would arrive at just as
embarrassing a result. An émigré officer of the Bourbon regiment offered
at dnce to make the experiment, and, after some phrases interchanged
between us, affirmed without hesitation that I was French.

The judge, rendered impatient, exclaimed, “Let us put an end to
these trials which decide nothing. I summon you, sir, to tell me who
you are. I promise that your life will be safe if you answer me with
sincerity.”

‘‘My greatest wish would be to give an answer to your satisfaction.
I will, then, try to do so; but I warn you that Iam not going to tell
you ie truth. I am fe son of the innkeeper at Mataré.” ‘I know
that innkeeper; you are not his son.” ‘You are right. I announced
to you that I should vary my answers until one of them should suit you.
J retract then, and tell you that Lam a titiretero (player of marionettes)
and that I practiced at Lerida.”
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 171

A loud shout of laughter from the multitude encircling us greeted
this answer, and put an end to the questions.

“T swear by the d——l,” exclaimed the judge, “ that I will discover
sooner or later who you are!”

And he retired.
The Arabs, the Moroccans, the Jews, who witnessed this interrogatory,

understood nothing of it; they had only seen that I had not allowed
myself to be intimidated. At the close of the interview they came to
kiss my hand, and gave me, from this moment, their entire confidence.

I became their secretary for all the individual or collective remon-
strances which they thought they had a right to address to the Spanish
government; and this right was incontestable. Every day I was occu-
pied in drawing up petitions, especially in the name of the two ostrich-
feather merchants, one of whom called himself a tolerably near relation
of the Emperor of Moroesco. Astonished at the rapidity with which I
filled a page of my writing, they imagined, doubtless, that I should write
as fastin Arabic characters, when it should be requisite to transcribe
passages from the Koran; and that this would form both for me and
for them the source of a brilliant fortune, and they besought me, in the
most earnest way, to become a Mahomedan.

Very little reassured by the last words of the judge, I sought means
of safety from another quarter. |

I was the possessor of a safe-conduct from the English admiralty; I
therefore wrote a confidential letter to the captain of an English vessel, the
“ Hagle,” I think, which had cast anchor some days before in the roads
at Rosas. I explained to him my position. ‘ You can,” I said, * claim
me, because [ have an English passport. Ifthis proceeding should cost
you too much, have the goodness at least to take my manuscripts and
to send them to the Royal Society in London.”

One of the soldiers who guarded us, and in whom I had fortunately
inspired some interest, undertook to deliver my letter. The English
captain came to see me; his name was, if my memory is right, George
Eyre. We had a private conversation on the shore. George Hyre
thought perhaps that the manuscripts of my observations were con-
tained in a register bound in morocco, and with gilt edges to the leaves.
When he saw that these manuscripts were composed of single leaves
covered with figures, which I had hidden under. my shirt, disdain suc-
ceeded to interest, and he quitted me hastily. Having returned on
board he wrote me a letter which I could find if needful, in which he
said to me, “TI cannot mix myself up in your affairs; address yourself
to the Spanish government; I am persuaded that it will do justice to
your remonstrance and will not molest you.” As I had not the same
persuasion as Captain George Eyre, I chose to take no notice of his
advice.

I ought to mention that some time after having related these partie-
wars in England at Sir Joseph Banks’s, the conduct of George Eyre was
172 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

severely blamed; but when a man breakfasts and dines to the sound of
harmonious musie, can he accord his interest to a poor devil sleeping
on straw and nibbled by vermin, even though he have manuscripts under
his shirt? Imay add that I (unfortunately for me) had to do witha
captain of ar unusual character. For, some days later, a new vessel, the
Colossus, having arrived in the roads, the Norwegian, Captain Krog,
although he had not, like me, an admiralty passport, made an applica-
tion to the commander of this new ship; he was immediately claimed
and relieved from captivity.

The report that Iwas a Spanish deserter and proprietor of the vessel,
acquiring more and more credit, and this position being the most dan-
gerous of all, I resolved to get out of it. I begged the commandant of
the place, M. Alloy, to come to receive my declaration, and I announced
to him that I was French. To prove to him the truth of my words I
invited him to send for Pablo Blanco, the sailor in the service of the
corsair who took us, and who had returned from his cruise a short time
before. This was done as I wished. In disembarking, Pablo Blanco,
who had not been warned, exclaimed with surprise, ‘‘ What! you Don
Francisco, mixed up with all these miscreants!” The sailor gave the
governor circumstantial evidence as to the mission which I fulfilled with
two Spanish commissaries. My nationality thus became proved. ;

That same day Alloy was replaced in the command of the fortress by
the Irish colonel of the Ultonian regiment; the corsair left for a fresh
cruise, taking away Pablo Blanco; and I became once more the roving
merchant from Schwekat.

From the windmill where we underwent our quarantine, I could see
the tricolored flag flying on the fortress of Figueras. The reconnoitering
parties of the cavalry came sometimes within five or six hundred meters;
it would not then have been difficult for me to escape. However, as the
regulations against those who violate the sanitary laws are very rigor-
ous in Spain, as they pronounce the penalty of death against him who
infringes them, I only determined to make my escape on the eve of our
admission to pratique.

The night being come I crept on all-fours along the briars, and I should
soon have got beyond the line of sentinels who guarded us. A noisy
uproar which I heard among the Moors made me determine to reénter,
and I found these poor people in an unspeakable state of uneasiness,
thinking themselves lost if I left; I therefore remained.

The next day a strong picket of troops presented itself before the
mill. The maneuvers made by it inspired all of us with anxiety, but
especially Captain Krog.* “ What will they do with us?” he exclaimed.
“Alas! you will see only too soon,” replied the Spanish ofiicer. This
answer made every one believe that they were going to shoot us. What
- might have strengthened me in this idea was the obstinacy with which

*This appears to be an oversight, as in a preceding page M. Arago described the for-
tunate release of Captain Krog from this captivity.
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 173

Captain Krog and two other individuals of small size hid themseives
behind me. A handling of arms made us think that we had but a few
seconds to live.

In analyzing the feelings which T experienced on this solemn occasion,
I have come to the conclusion that the man who is led to death is not as
unhappy as the public imagines him to be. Fifty ideas presented them-
selves nearly simultaneously to my mind, and I did not rack my brain
for any of them; I only recollect the two following which have remained
engraved on my memory. On turning my head to the right, I saw the
national flag flying on the bastions of Figueras, and I said to myself,

‘Ir I were to move a few hundred meters I should be surrounded by
comrades, by friends, by fellow-citizens, who would receive me affection-
ately. Here, without their being able to impute any crime to me, I am
going to suffer death at twenty-two years of age.” But what agitated
me more deeply was this: looking toward the Pyrenees I could distinetly
see their peaks, and I reflected that my mother, on the other side of the
chain, might at this awful moment be looking peaceably at them.

The Spanish authorities, finding that to redeem my life I weuld not
declare myself the owner of the vessel, had us conducted without further
molestation to the fortress of Rosas. Having to file through nearly all
the inhabitants of the town, I had wished at first, through a false feeling
of shame, to leave in the mill the remains of our week’s meals. But M.
Berthémie, more prudent than I, carried over his shoulder a great quan-
tity of pieces of black bread tied up with packthread. I imitated him.
I furnished myself famously from our old stock, set it on my shoulder,
and it was with this accoutrement that I made my entrance into the
famous fortress.

They placed us in a casemate, where we had barely the space neces-
sary for lying down. In the windmill they used to bring us, from time
to time, some provisions which came from our boat. Here, the Spanish
government purveyed our food. We received every day some bread and
a ration of rice; but as we had no means of dressing food, we were in
reality reduced to dry bread.

Dry bread was very unsubstantial food for one who could see from
his casemate, at the door of his prison, a sutler selling grapes at two
farthings a pound, and cooking, under the shelter of half a cask, bacon
and herrings; but we had no money to bring us into connection with this
merchant. I then decided, though with very great’ regret, to sell a
watch which my father had given me. Iwas only offered about a quarter
of its value; but I might well accept it since there were no competitors
for it.

AS possessors of sixty francs, M. Berthémie and I could now appease
the hunger from which we had long suffered; but we did not like this
return of fortune to be profitable to ourselves alone, and we made some
presents, which were very well received by our companions in captivity.
174 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

Though this sale of my watch brought some comfort to us, it was doomed
ata later period to plunge a family into sorrow.

The town of Rosas fell into the power of the French after a courage-
ous resistance. The prisoners of the garrison were sent to France, and
naturally passed through Perpignan. My father went in quest of news
wherever Spaniards were to befound. He entered a café at the moment
when a prisoner ofiicer drew from his fob the watch which I had sold
at Rosas. My good father saw in this act the proof of my death, and
fell into a swoon. The officer had got the watch from a third party,
and could give no account of the fate of the person to whom it had ori-
ginally belonged.

The casemate having become necessary to the defenders of the fortress,
we were taken to alittle chapel where they deposited for twenty-four
hours those who had died in the hospital. There we were guarded by
peasants who had come across the mountain from various villages, and
particularly from Cadaqués. These peasants, eager to recount all that
they had seen of interest during their one day’s campaign, questioned
me as to the deeds and behavior of all my companions in misfortune.
I satisfied their curiosity amply, being the only one of the set who could
speak Spanish.

To enlist their good will, I also questioned them at length upon the
subject of their village, on the work that they did there, on smuggling,
their principal sources of employment, &c., &e. They answered my
questions with the loquacity common to country rustics. The next day
our guards were replaced by some others who were inhabitants of the

same village. ‘(In my business of a roving merchant,” I said to these
last, ‘I have been at Cadaqués;” and then I began to talk to them of
what I had learnt the night before of such an individual, who gave him-
self up to smuggling with more success than others, of his beautiful
residence, of the property which he possessed near the village; in short,
of a number of particulars which it seemed impossible for any but an
inhabitant of Cadaqués to know. My jest produced an unexpected
effect. Such circumstantial details, our guards said to themselves, can-
not be known by a roving merchant; this personage whom we have
found here in such singular society, is certainly a native of Cadaqueés ;
and the son of the apothecary must be about his age. He had gone to
try his fortune in America; it is evidently he, who fears to make himself
known, having been found with all his riches in a vessel on its way to
France. The report spread, became more consistent, and reached the
ears of a sister of the apothecary established at Rosas. She runs to
me, believes she recognizes me, and falls on my neck. I protest against
the identity. ‘Well played!” said she to me; “ the case is serious, as
you have been found in a vessel coming to France; persist in your
denial; circumstances may perhaps take a more favorable turn, and I
shall nrotit by them to insure your deliverance. In the mean aa my
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 175

dear nephew, I will let you want for nothing.” And truly every morn-
ing M. Berthémie and I received a comfortable repast.

The church having become necessary to the garrison to serve as a
magazine, we were moved on the 25th of September, 1808, to a Trinity
fort, called the Bouton de Rosas, a citadel situated on a little mountain
at the entrance of the roads, and we were deposited deep under ground,
where the light of day did not penetrate on any side. We did not long
remain in this infected place; not because they had pity upon us, but
because it offered shelter for a part of the garrison attacked by the
French. They made us descend by night to the edge of the sea, and
then transported us on the 17th of October to the port of Palamos.
We were shut up in a hulk; we enjoyed, however, a certain degree of
liberty; they allowed us to go on land and to parade our miseries and
our rags in the town. It was there that I made the acquaintance of the
dowager Duchess of Orleans, mother of Louis Phillippe. She had left
the town of Figueras where she resided, because, she told me, thirty-
two bombs sent from the fortress had fallen in her house. She was then
intending to take refuge in Algiers, and she asked me to bring the eap-
tain of the vessel to her, of whom, perhaps, she would have to implore
protection. I related to my “rats” the misfortunes of the princess; he
was moved by them, and I conducted him to her. On entering he took
otf his slippers from respect, as if he had entered within a mosque, and
holding them in his hand, he went to kiss the front of the dress of '
Madame d’Orleans. The princess was alarmed at the sight of this manly
figure, wearing the longest beard I ever saw; sbe quickly recovered her-
self, and the interview proceeded with a mixture of French politeness
and oriental courtesy.

The sixty francs from Rosas were expended. Madame d’Orleans
would have liked much to assist us, but she was herself without money.
All that she could gratify us with was a piece of sugar-bread. The
evening of our visit I was richer than the princess. To avoid the fury
of the people the Spanish government sent those French who had
escaped the first massacres back to France in slight boats. One of the
cartels came and cast anchor by the side of our hulk. One of the un-
happy emigrants offered me a pinch of snuff. On opening the snuff-box
I found there “wna onza de oro,” (an ounce of gold,) the sole remains of
his fortune. I returned the snuff-box to him, with warm thanks, after
having shut up in it a paper containing these words: ‘My fellow-coun-
tryman who carries this note has rendered me a great service; treat
him as one of your children.” My petition was naturally favorably
received; it was by this bit of paper, the size.of the enza de oro, that
my family learnt that I was still in existence, and it enabled my mother,
a model of piety, to cease saying masses for the repose of my soul.

Five days afterward, one of my hardy compatriots arrived at Pal-
amos, after having traversed the line of posts, both French and Spanish,
carrying to a merchant who had friends at Perpignan the proposal to
176 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

furnish me with all I was in need of. The Spaniard showed a great
inclination to agree to the proposal; but I did not profit by lis good
will, because of the occurrence of events which I shall relate presently.

The observatory at Paris is very near the barrier. In my youth,
curious to study the manners of the people, I used to walk in sight of
the public houses, which the desire of escaping payment of the duty has
multiplied outside the walls of the capital. On these excursions I was
often humiliated to see men disputing for a piece of bread, just as ani-
mals might have done. My feelings on this subject have very much
altered since I have been personally exposed to the tortures of hunger.
I have discovered, in fact, that a man, whatever may have been his
origin, his education, and his habits, is governed, under certain circum-
stances, much more by his stomach than by his intelligence and his
heart. Here is the fact which suggested these reflections to me:

To celebrate the unhoped-for arrival of una onza de oro, M. Berthémie
and I had produced an immense dish of potatoes. The ordnance officer
of the Emperor was already devouring it with his eyes, when a Moroccan,
who was making his ablutions near us with one of his companions, acci-
dentally filled it with dirt. M. Berthémie could not control his anger,
he darted upon the clumsy Mussulman, and inflicted upon him a rough
punishment.

I remained a passive spectator of the combat, until the second Moroc-
van came to the aid of his compatriot. The party no longer being equal,
I also took part in the conflict, by seizing the new assailant by the
beard. The combat ceased at once, because the Moroccan would not
raise his hand against a man who could write a petition so rapidly.
This conflict, like the struggles of which I had often been a witness out-
side the barriers of Paris, had originated in a dish of potatoes.

The Spaniards always cherished the idea that the ship and_her cargo
might be confiscated; a commission came from Girone to question us.
It was composed of two civil judges and one inguisitor. I acted as
interpreter. When M. Berthémie’s turn came, I went to fetch him, and
said to him, “‘ Pretend that you can only talk Styrian, and be at ease;
1 will not compromise you in translating your answers.”

It was done as we had agreed; unfortunately the language spoken by M.
Berthémie had but little variety, and the sacrement der Teufel, which he
had learned in Germany, when he was aide-de-camp to Hautpoul, pre-
dominated too much in his discourse. Be that as it may, the judges ob-
served that there was too great a conformity between his answers and
those which I had made myself to render it necessary to continue an in-
terrogatory, which I may say, by the way, disturbed me much. The wish
to terminate it was still more decided on the part of the judges, when
it came to the turn of a sailor named Mehemet. Instead of making him
swear on the Koran to tell the truth, the judge was determined to make
him ,place his thumb on the fore-finger so as to represent the cross. I
warned him that great offense would thus be given; and, accordingly,
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 17

when Mehemet became aware of the meaning of this sign, he began to
spit upon it with inconceivable violence. The meeting ended at once.

The next day things had wholly changed their appearance; one of
the judges from Girone came to declare to us that we were free to depart.
and to go with our ship wherever we chose. What was the cause of
this sudden change? It was this:

During our quarantine in the windmill at Rosas, I had written, in the
name of Captain Braham, a letter to the Dey of Algiers. I gave him
an account of the illegal arrest of his vessel, and of the death of one of
the lions which the Dey had sent to the Emperor. This last circum-
stance transported the African monarch with rage. He sent immedi-
ately for the Spanish consul, M. Onis, claimed pecuniary damages for
his dear lion, and threatened war if his ship was not released directly.
Spain had then to do with too many difficulties to undertake wantonly
any new ones, and the order to release the vessel so anxiously coveted
arrived at Girone, and from thence at Palamos.

This solution, to which our consul at Algiers, M. Dubois Thainville,
had not remained inattentive, reached us at the moment when we least
expected it. We at once made preparations for our departure, and on
the 28th of November, 1808, we set sail, steering for Marseilles; but, as
the Mussulmen on board the vessel declared, it was written above that
we should not enter that town. We could already perceive the white
buildings which crown the neighboring hills of Marseilles, when a gust
of the “ mistral,” of great violence, sent us from the north towards the
south.

I do not know what route we followed, for I was lying in my cabin,
overcome with sea-sickness; I may, therefore, though an astronomer,
avow without shame, that at the moment when our unqualified pilots
supposed themselves to be off the Baléares, we landed, on the 5th of
December, at Bougie.

There, they pretended that during the three months of winter all
communication with Algiers, by means of the little boats named sandalis,
would be impossible, and I resigned myself to the painful prospect of so
long a stay in a place at that time almost a desert. One evening I was
making these sad reflections while pacing the deck of the vessel, when
a shot from a gun on the coast came and struck the side planks close to
which I was passing. This suggested to me the thought of going to
Algiers by land.

I went next day, accompanied by M. Berthémie and Captain Spiro
Calligero, to the Caid of the town: “TI wish,” said I to him, “to go to
Algiers by land.” The man, quite frightened, exclaimed, “I cannot
allow you to do so; you would certainly be killed on the road; your
consul would make a complaint to the Dey, and I should have my head
cut off.”

‘“‘Fear not on that ground. I will give you an acquittance.”

178 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

Tt was immediately drawn up in these terms :

“ We, the undersigned, certify that the Caid of Bougie wished to dis-
suade us from going to Algiers by land; that he has assured us that

e shall Le massacred on the road; that notwithstanding his represent-
ations, reiterated twenty times, we have persisted in our project. We
beg the Algerine authorities, particularly our consul, not to make hin
responsible for this event if it should occur. We once more repeat that
the voyage has been undertaken against his will.

“ARAGO AND BERTHEMIE. ?

Having given this declaration to the Caid, we considered ourselves
quit of this functionary ; but he came up to me, undid, without saying
a word, the knot of my cravat, took it off, and put it into his pocket.
All this was done so quickly that [ had not time, I will add that I had
not even the wish, to reclaim it.

At the conclusion of this audience, which had terminated in so singu-
lar a manner, we made @ bargain with a Mahomedan priest, who prom-
ised to conduct us to Algiers for the sum of twenty ‘‘ piastres fortes”
and a red mantle. The day was occupied in disguising ourselves, well
or ill, and we set out the next morning, accompanied by several Moorish
sailors belonging to the erew of the ship, after having shown the Ma-
homedan priest that we had nothing with us worth a sou, so that if we
were killed on the road he would inevitably lose all reward.

I went, at the last moment, to make my bow to the only lion that
“was still alive, and with whom I had lived in very good harmony; I
wished also to say good-bye to the monkeys, who during nearly tive
mouths had been equally my companions in misfortune.* These mon-
keys during our frightful misery had rendered us a service which I
scarcely dare mention, and which will scarcely be guessed by the
inhabitants of our cities, who look upon these animals as objects of
diversion: they freed us from the vermin which infested us, and showed
particularly a remarkable cleverness in seeking out the hideous insects
which lodged themselves in our hair.

Poor animals! they seem to me very unfortunate in being shut up in
the narrow inclosure of the vessel, when, on the neighboring coast, other
monkeys, as if to bully them, came on to the branches of the trees,
giving innumerable proofs of Hick agility.

At the commencement of the day, we saw on the road two Kabyls,
similar to the soldiers of Jugurtha, whose harsh appearance powerfally
allayed our fancy for wandering. In the evening we witnessed a fearful
tuinult, which appeared to be directed against us. We learnt afterward

*On my return to Paris I hastened to the Jardin des Plantes to pay a visit to the
lion, but he received me with a very unamiable gnashing of the teeth. Think, then, of
the marvelous history of the Florentine lion, the subject of so many engravings,
which is offered on the stall of every print-seller to the eyes of the moved and aston-
ished passers by.
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 179

that the Mahomedan priest had been the object of it; that it originated
with some Kabyls whom he had disarmed on one of their journeys to
Bougie. This incident, which appeared likely to be repeated, inspired
us for a moment with the thought of returning; but the sailors were
resolute, and we continued our hazardous enterprise.

In proportion as we advanced, our troops became increased by a cer-
tain number of Kabyls, who wished to go to Algiers to work there in the
quality of seamen, and who dared not undertake alone this dangerous
journey

The third day we encamped in the open air, at the entrance of a forest.
The Arabs lighted a very large fire in the form of @ circle, and placed
themselves in the middle. Toward eleven o’clock I was awakened by
the noise which the mules made, all trying to break their fastenings. I
asked what was the cause of this disturbance. They answered me that
a “sebad” had come roaming in the neighborhood. I was not aware
then that a “sebad” was a lion, and I went to sleep again. The next
day, in traversing the forest, the arrangement of the caravan was
changed. It was grouped in the smallest space possible; one Kabyl
was at the head, his gan ready for service; another was in the rear, in
the same position. I inquired of the owner of the mule the cause of
these unusual precautions. JIe answered me that they were dreading
an attack from a ‘“ sebdd,” and that if this should occur, one of us would
be carried off without having time to put himself on the defensive. “TI
would rather be a spectator,” I said to him, “than an actor in the scene
you describe; consequently, [ will give you two piastres more if you
will keep your mule always in the center of the moving group.” My
proposal was accepted. It was then for the first time that I saw that
my Arab carried a yatagan under his tunic, which he used for pricking
on the mule the w hole time that we were in the thicket. Superfluous
cautions! The “ sebda” did not show himself.

Each village being a little republic, whose territory we could not
cross Without obtaining permission and a passport from the Mahomedan
priest président, the priest who conducted our caravan used to leave us
in the fields, and went sometimes a good way off to a village to solicit
the permission, without which it would have been dangerous to continue
our route. He remained entire hours without returning to us, and we
then had oecasion to reflect sadly on the imprudence of our enterprise.
We generally slept among habitations. Once we found the streets
of a village barricaded, because they were fearing an attack from a
neighboring village. The foremost man of our caravan removed the
obstacles; but a woman came out of her house like a fury, and belabored
us with blows from a pole. We remarked that she was fair, of brilliant
whiteness, and very pretty.

Another tine we lay down in a lurking-place dignified by the beauti-
tiful name of Caravanseray. In the morning, when the sun rose, cries of
“ Roumi! Roumi!” warned us that we had been discovered. The sailor,
180 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

Mehemet, he who figured in the scene of the oath at Palamos, entered
in a melancholy mood the inclosure where we were together, and made
us understand that the cries of ‘“ Roumi!” vociferated under these cir-
cumstances, were equivalent to a sentence of death. ‘ Wait,” said he;
‘*a means of saving you has occurred to me.” Mehemet entered some
moments afterward, told us that his means had succeeded, and invited
me to join the Kabyls, who were going to say prayers.

J accordingly went out and prostrated myself toward the east. I imi-
tated minutely the gestures which I saw made around me, pronouncing
the sacred words, La elah il Allah! oua Mahommed ragoul Allah! It was
the scene of Mamamouchi of the “ Bourgeois Gentilhomme,” which I
had so often seen acted by Dugazon, with this one difference, that this
time it did not make me laugh. I was, however, ignorant of the conse-
quences it might have brought upon me on my arrival at Algiers. After
having made the profession of faith before Mahomedans, There is but one
God, and Mahomet is his prophet, if I had been informed against to the
muiti, [ must inevitably have become Mussulman, and they would not
hav. allowed me to go out of the regency.

I >nust not forget to relate by what means Mehemet had saved us
from inevitable death. ‘“ You have guessed rightly,” said he to the
Kabyls, “there are two Christians in the caravansary, but they are
Mahomedans at heart, and are going to Algiers to be adopted by the
mufti into our holy religion. You will not doubt this when I tell you
that I was myself a slave to some Christians, and that they redeemed
me with their money.” ‘In cha Allah!” they exclaimed with one voice.
And it was then that the scene took place which I have just described.

We arrived in sight of Algiers the 25th December, 1808. We took
leave of the Arab owners of our mules, who walked on foot by the side
of us, and we spurred them on in order to reach the town before the
closing of the gates. On our arrival we learnt that the Dey, to whom
we owed our first deliverance, had been beheaded. The guard of the
palace before which we passed stopped us and questioned us as to
whence we came. We replied that we came from Bougie by land. ‘It
is not possible,” exclaimed all the janissaries at once, ‘the Dey him-
self would not venture to undertake such a journey.” ‘“ We acknowl-
edge that we have committed a great imprudence, that we would not
undertake to recommence the journey for millions; but the fact that we
have just declared is the strict truth.”

Arrived at the consular house we were, as on the first occasion, very
cordially weleomed. We received a visit from a dragoman sent by the
Dey, who asked whether we persisted in maintaining that Bougie had

been our point of departure, and not Cape Matifou, or some neighboring
part. We again affirmed the truth of our recital; it was confirmed the

next day on the arrival of the proprietors of our mules.

At Palamos, during the various interviews which I had with the dow- —
ager Duchess of Orleans, one circumstance had particularly affected me. _

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 181

The princess spoke to me unceasingly of the wish she had to go and re-
join one of her sons, whom she believed to*be alive, but of whose death
J had been informed by a person belonging to her household. Hence I
was anxious to do all that lay in my power to mitigate a sorrow which
she must experience before long.

At the moment when I quitted Spain for Marseilles, the duchess con-
fided to me two letters which I was to forward in safety to their ad-
dresses. One was destined for the Empress-mother of Russia, the other
for the Empress of Austria.

Searcely had I arrived at Algiers when I mentioned these two letters
to M. Dubois Thainville, and begged him to send them to France by the
first opportunity. “I shall do nothing of the sort,” he at once answered.
‘Do you know that you have behaved in this affair like a young inex-
perienced man, or to speak out, like a blunderer? I am surprised that
you did not comprehend that the Emperor, with his pettish spirit, might
take this much amiss, and consider you, according to the contents of
the two letters, as the promoter of an intrigue in favor of the exiled
family of the Bourbons.” Thus the paternal advice of the French con-
sul taught me that in all that regards politics, however nearly or re-
motely, one cannot give himself up, without danger, to the dictates of
the heart and the reason.

LT inclosed my two letters in an envelope bearing the address of a
trustworthy person, and gave them into the hands of a corsair, who,
after touching at Algiers, would proceed to France. Ihave never known
whether they reached their destination.

The reigning Dey, successor to the beheaded Dey, had formerly filled
the humble office of “‘épileur”* of dead bodies in the mosques. He gov-
erned the regency with much gentleness, occupying himself with little
but his harem. This disgusted those who had raised him to this emi-
nent post, and they resolved upon getting rid of him. We became
aware of the danger which menaced him, by seeing the courts and ves-
tibules of the consular house full, according to the custom under such
circumstances, of Jews, carrying with them whatever they had of most
value. It was arule at Algiers that all that happened in the interval
comprised between the death of a Dey and the installation of his sue-
cessor could not be followed up by justice, and must remain unpunished.
One can imagine, then, why the children of Moses should seek safety in
the consular houses, the European inhabitants of which had the courage
to arm themselves for self-defense as soon as the danger was apparent,
and who, moreover, had a janissary to guard them.

While the unfortunate Dey “épileur” was being conducted toward
the place where he was to be strangled, he heard the cannon which an-
nounced his death and the installation of his successor. ‘' They are in
great haste,” said he, “ what will you gain by carrying matters to ex-

ascertain what office of this kind is performed in Mohamedan funerals.

tremities? Send me to the Levant; I promise you never toreturn. What
have you to reproach me with?” ‘With nothing,” answered his escort,
“but your insignificance. However, aman cannot liveasa mere private
man, after having been Dey of Algiers.” And the unfortunate man
perished by the rope.

The communication by sea between Bougie and Algiers was not so
difficult, even with the “ sandalas,” as the Caid of the former town wished
to assure me. Captain Spiro had the cases landed which belonged to
me. The Caid sought to discover what they contained; and having
perceived through a chink something yellowish, he hastened to send the
news to the Dey, that the I'renchmen who had come to Algiers by land
had among their baggage cases filled with zechins, destined to revolu-
tionize the Kabylie. They immediately had these cases forwarded to
Algiers, and at their opening before the minister of naval affairs, all the
phantasmagoria of zechins, of treasure, of revolution, disappeared at
the sight of the stands and the limbs of several repeating circles in
copper.

We are now going to sojourn several months in Algiers. I will take
advantage of this to put together some details of manners, which may

be interesting as the picture of a state of things anterior to that of the -

occupation of the regency by the French. This occupation, it must be
remarked, has already fundamentally altered the manners and the
habits of the Algerine population.

I am about to report a curious fact, and one which shows that polities,
which insinuate themselves and bring discord into the bosom of the
most united families, had succeeded, strange to say, in penetrating as
far as the galley-slaves’ prison at Algiers. The slaves belonged to three
nations; there were in 1809 in this prison, Portuguese, Neapolitans, and
Sicilians; among these two latter classes were counted partisans of
Murat and those of Ferdinand of Naples. One day, at the beginning of
the year, a dragoman came in the name of the Dey to beg M. Dubois
Thainville to go without delay to the prison, where the friends of the
Freneh and their adversaries had involved themselves in a furious
combat; and already several had fallen. The weapon with which they
struck each other was the heavy long chain attached to their legs.

Bach consul, as I said above, had a janissary placed with him as his
guard; the one belonging to the French consul was a Candiote ; he had
been surnamed The Terror. Whenever some news unfavorable to Prance
Was announced in the eafés, he came to the consulate to inform himself
as to the reality of the fact; and when we told him that the other janis.
saries had propagated false news, he returned to them, and there, yata
gan in hand, he declared himself ready to enter the lists in combat
against those who should still maintain the truth of the news. As these
continual threats might endanger him (for they had no support beyond
bis mere animal courage) we had wished to render him expert in the
handling of arms by giving him some lessons in fencing; but he could

not endure the idea that Christians should touch him at every turn with
foils; he therefore proposed to substitute for the simulated duel a real
combat with the yatagan.

One may gain an exact idea of this savage nature when I mention
that, having one day heard a pistol-shot, the sound of which proceeded
from his room, people ran and found him bathed in his blood; he had
just shot off a ball into his arm to cure himself of a rheumatic pain.

Seeing with what facility the Deys disappeared, I said one day to our
- janissary, “¢‘ With this prospect before your eyes, would you consent to
become Dey?” “ Yes, doubtless,” answered -he. ‘ You seem to count
as nothing the pleasure of doing all that one likes, if only even for a
single day !”

When we wished to take a turn in the town of Algiers, we generally
took care to be escorted by the janissary attached to the con-
sular house; it was the only means of escaping insults, affronts, and
even acts of violence. J have just said it was the only means. I made
a mistake; there was one other; that was, to goin the company of a
French “lazarist” of seventy years of age, and whose name, if my
memory serves me, was Father Joshua; he had lived in this country
tor a halfa century. This man, of exemplary virtue, had devoted him-
self with admirable self-denial to the service of the slaves of the regency,
and bad divested himself of all considerations of nationality; the Portu-
guese, Neapolitans, Sicilians, all were equally his brethren.

In the times of plague he was seen day and night carrying eager help
to the Mussulmans; thus his virtue had conquered even religious
hatreds; and vherever he passed he and the persons who might accom-
pany him recewed from multitudes of the people, from the janissaries,
and even from she officials of the mosques, the most respectful saluta-
tions.

During our torg hours of sailing on board the Algerine vessel, and
our compulsory stiy in the prisons at Rosas, and on the hulk at Palamos,

gathered some idasas tothe interior life of the Moors or the Coulougous,
which, even now wlen Algiers has fallen under the dominion of Irance,
would, perhaps, be yet worth preserving. I shall, however, confine
myself to recounting nearly word for word, a conversation which I had
with Rais Braham, woose father was a “ Ture fin,” that is to say, a Turk
born in the Levant.

“¢ How is it that youconsent,” said I to him, ‘to marry a young girl
whom you have never seen, and find im her, perhaps, an excessively
ugly woman, instead of the beauty whom you had fancied to yourself ?”

“We never marry Wthout having obtained information from the
women who serve in thecapacity of servants at tie public baths. The
Jewesses are, moreover, n these cases very useful go-betweeus.”

‘* How many legitimatewives have you ?”

“T have four—that is b say, the number authorized by the Koran.”

‘Do they live together m a good understanding ?”

184 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

“Ah, sir, my house is a hell. I never enter it without finding them
at the step of the door, or at the bottom of the stairs; then each wants
to be the first to make me listen to the complaints which she has to
bring against her companions. I am about to utter blasphemy, but J
think that our holy religion ought to prohibit a plurality of wives te
those who are not rich enough to give to each a separate habitation.”

‘¢ But since the Koran allows you to repudiate even legitimate wives,
why do you not send back three of them to their parents ?”

‘““ Why ? Because that would ruin me. On the day of the marriage
the father of the young woman to be married stipulates for a dowry, and
the half of itis paid. The other half may be exacted the day that the
woman is repudiated. It would then be three half-dowries that I should
have to pay if I sent back three of my wives. I ought, however, to
rectify one inaccuracy in what I said just now, that my four wives had
never agreed together. Once they were agreed among themselves in
the feeling of a common hatred. In going through the market { had
bought a young negress. In the evening, when I retired to rest, I per-
ceived that my wives had prepared no bed for her, and that the unfor-
tunate girl was extended on the ground. I rolled up my trowsers and
laid them under her head as a kind of pillow. In the morning the
distracting cries of the poor slave made me run to her, and J found her
nearly sinking under the blows of my four wives; for once they under-
stood each other marvelously well.”

In February, 1809, the new Dey, the successor of the * épileur,” a
short time after having entered on his functions, claimed from two to three
hundred thousand franes—I do not remember exactly the sam—which he
pretended was due to him from the French governmext. M. Dubois
Thainville answered that he had received the Empero”s orders not to
pay one centime.

The Dey was furious, and decided upon declaring war against us. A
declaration of war at Algiers used to be immediately fyllowed by putting
all the persons of other nations into prison. This time matters were not
pushed to this extreme limit. Our names might be/figuring on the list
of the slaves of the regency; but, in fact, so far as I was concerned, I
remained free in the consular house. By means o/a pecuniary guaran-
tee, contracted with the Swedish consul, M. Nyrderling, I was even
permitted to live at his country-house, situated near the Emperor’s
fort.

The most insignificant event was sufficient to modify the ideas of
these barbarians. I had come into the town me day, and was seated
at table at M. Dubois Thainville’s, when the Eyglish consul, Mr. Blank-
ley, arrived in great haste, announcing to ounconsul the entrance into
the port of a French prize. “I never will us/lessly add,” said he, gen-
erously, ‘to the severities of war; I came tqannounce to you, my col-
league, that I will give up your prisoners onA receipt which will insure
me the deliverance of an equal number a Englishmen detained in

France.” ‘TI thank you,” answered M. Dubois Thainville; “but I do
not the less deplore this event that it wil) retard, indefinitely perhaps,
the settlement of the account in which I am engaged with the Dey.”

During this conversation, armed with a telescope, I was looking
through the window of the dining-room, trying to persuade myself at
least that the captured vessel was not one of much importance. But
one must yield to evidence. It was pierced for a great number of guns.
All at once, the wind having displayed the flags, I perceived with sur-
prise the French flag over the English flag. I communicated what I
observed to Mr. Blankley. He answered immediately, “ You do not
surely pretend to observe better with your bad telescope than I did with
my Doiland ?”

‘And you cannot pretend,” said I to him in my turn, ‘to see better
than an astronomer by profession? I am sure of my fact. I beg M.
Thainville’s permission, and will go this instant to visit this mysterious
prize.”

In short, I went thére; and this is what I learnt:

General Duhesme, Governor of Barcelona, wishing to rid himself of
the most ill-disciplined portion of his garrison, formed the principal part
into the crew of a vessel, the command of which he gave to a lieutenant
of Babastro, a celebrated corsair of the Mediterranean.

There were among these improvised seamen a hussar, a dragoon, two
veterans, a miner with his long beard, &c. The vessel, leaving Bar-
celona by night, escaped the English cruiser, and got to the entrance
of Port Mahon. An English “lettre de marque” was coming out of the
port. The crew of the French vessel boarded her; and a furious com-
bat on the deck ensued, in which the French got the upper-hand. It
was this “lettre de marque” which had now arrived at Algiers.

Invested with full power by M. Dubois Thainville, | announced to the
prisoners that they were about to be immediately given up to their
consul. I respected even the trick of the captain, who, wounded by
several saber cuts, had contrived to cover up his head with his principal
flag. I reassured his wife; but my chief care was especially devoted to
a passenger whom [ saw, with one arm amputated.

‘““ Where is the surgeon,” [ said to him, ‘“‘ who operated on you ?”

“Tt was not our surgeon,” he answered. ‘ He basely fled with a part
of the crew, and saved himself on land.”

‘“¢ Who, then, cut off your arm? ”

‘It was the hussar whom you see here.”

“ Unhappy man! I exclaimed, ‘ what could lead you, when it was not
your profession, to perform this operation ?”

‘The pressing request of the wounded man. His arm had already
swollen to an enormous size. He wanted some one to cut it off for him
with a blow of a hatchet. I told him that in Egypt, when I was in hos-
pital, [ had seen several amputations made; that I would imitate what
1 had seen, and might perhaps sueceed That at any rate it would be
186 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

better than the blow of a hatchet. All wasagreed; I armed myseif with
the carpenter’s saw, and the operation was done.”

I went off immediately to the American consul to claim the assistance
of the only surgeon worthy of confidence who was then in Algiers. Mr.
Triplet—I think L recollect that that was the name of the man of the
distinguished art whose aid I invoked—came at once on board the ves-
sel, examined the dressing of the wound, and declared, to my very lively
satisfaction, that all was going on well, and that the Englishman would
survive his horrible injury.

The same day we had the wounded men earried on litters to Mr.
Blankley’s house; this operation, executed with somewhat of ceremony,
modified, though slightly, the feelings of the Dey in our favor, and his
sentiments became yet more favorable toward us in consequence of
another maritime occurrence, although a very insignificant one.

One day a corvette was seen in the horizon armed with a very great
number of guns, and shaping her way toward the port of Algiers; there
appeared immediately after an English brig of war in full sail; a combat
was, therefore, expected, and all the terraces of the town were covered with
spectators. The brig appeared to be the best sailer, and seemed to us
likely to reach the corvette, but the latter tacked about, and seemed
desirous to engage in battle; the English vessel fled before her; the
corvette tacked about the second time, and again directed her course
toward Algiers, where, one would have supposed, she had some special
mission to execute. The brig in her turn now changed her course, but
held herself constantly beyond the reach of shot from the corvette; at
last the two vessels arrived in succession in the port, and cast anchor, to
the lively disappointment of the Algerine population, who had hoped to
be present without danger at a maritime combat between the “ Christian
dogs,” belonging to two nations equally detested in a religious point of
view; but shouts of laughter could not be repressed when it was seen
that the corvette was a merchant vessel, and that she was only armed
with wooden imitations of cannon. It was said in the town that the
English sailors were furious, and had been on the point of mutiny against
their too prudent captain.

I have very little to tell in favor of the Algerines; hence I must do an
act of justice by mentioning that the corvette departed the next day for
the Autilles, her destination, and that the brig was not permitted to set
sail until the next day but one.

Bakri often came to the French consulate to talk of our affairs with
M. Dubois Thainville. ‘What can you want?” said the latter; ‘you are
an Algerine; you will be the first victim of the Dey’s obstinacy. I have
already written to Livorno that your families and your goods are to be
seized. When the vessels laden with cotton, which you have in this
port, arrive at Marseilles, they will be immediately confiscated ; it is for
you to judge whether it would not better suit you to pay the sum which
the Dey claims than to expose yourself to tenfold and certain loss.”

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 187

Such reasoning was unanswerable; and whatever it might cost him,
Bakri decided on paying the sum that was demanded of France.

Permission to depart was immediately granted to us; 1 embarked the
21st of June, 1809, on board a vessel in which M. Dubois Thainville and
his family were passengers.

The evening before our departure from Algiers, a corsair deposited at
the consul’s the Majorcan mail, which he had taken from a vessel which
he had captured. It was a complete collection of the letters which the
inhabitants of the Baléares had been writing to their friends on the
Continent.

* Look here,” said M. Dubois Thainville to me, “here is something to
amuse you during the voyage, you who generally keep your room from
sea-sickness; break the seals and read all these letters, and see whether
they contain any accounts by which we might profit how to aid the un-
happy soldiers who are dying of misery and despair in the little island
of Cabrera.”

Scarcely had we arrived on board the vessel, when I set myself to
the work, and acted without seruple or remorse the part of an official
of the black chamber, with this sole difference, that the letters were
unsealed without taking any precautions. I found among them several
dispatches in which Adiniral Collingwood signified to the Spanish gov-
ernment the ease with which the prisoners might be delivered. Imme-
diately on our arrival at Marseilles these letters were sent to the minis-
ter of naval affairs, who, L believe, did not pay much attention to them.

I knew almost every one at Palma, the capital of Majorca. I leave it
to be imagined with what curiosity I read the missives in which the
beautiful ladies of the town expressed their hatred against los malditos
cavachios, (freneh,) whose presence in Spain had rendered necessary
the departure for the Continent of a magnificent regiment of hussars;
how many persons might I not have embroiled, if under a mask I had
found myself with them at the opera ball!

Many of the letters made mention of me, and were particularly inter-
esting to me; I was sure in this instance there was nothing to constrain
the frankness of those who had written them. It is an advantage which
few people can boast having enjoyed to the same degree.

The vessel in which I was, although laden with bales of cotton, had
some corsair papers of the regency, and was the reputed escort of three
richly laden merchant vessels which were going to France.

We were off Marseilles on the Ist of July, when an English frigate
came to stop our passage: “T will not take you,” said the English cap-
tain, ‘‘ but you will go towards the Uyeéres Islands, and Admiral Colling-
wood will decide on your fate.”

“JT have received,” answered the Barbary captain, “an express com-
mission to conduct these vessels to Marseilles, and I will execute it.”

“ You, individually, can do what may seem to you best,” answered the
Englishman; “as to the merchant vessels under your escort, they will
188 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

be, I repeat to you, taken to Admiral Collingwood.” And he immedi-
ately gave orders to those vessels to set sail to the east.

The frigate had already gone a little distance when she perceived
that we were steering toward Marseilles. Having then learnt from the
crews of the merchant vessels that we were ourselves laden with cotton,
she tacked about to seize us.

She was very near reaching us, when we were enabled to enter the
port of the little island of Pomégue. In the night she put her boats to
sea to try to carry us off; but the enterprise was too perilous, and she
did not dare attempt it.

The next morning, 2d of July, 1809, I disembarked at the lazaretto.

At the present day they go from Algiers to Marseilles in four days;
it had taken me eleven months to make the same voyage. It is true
that here and there I had made involuntary sojourns.

My letters sent from the lazaretto at Marseilles were considered by
my relatives and friends as certificates of resurrection, they having for
a long time past supposed me dead. A great geometer had even pro-
posed to the Bureau of Longitude no longer to pay my allowance to my
authorized representative; which appears the more cruel inasmuch as
this representative was my father.

The first letter which I received from Paris was full of sympathy and
congratulations on the termination of my laborious and perilous adven-
tures; it was from a man already in possession of an Kuropean reputa-
tion, but whom I had never seen: M. de Humboldt, after what he had
heard of my misfortunes, offered me his friendship. Such was the first
origin of a connection which dates from nearly forty-two years back,
without a single cloud ever having troubled it.

M. Dubois Thainville had numerous acquaintances in Marseilles; his
wife was a native of that town, and her family resided there. They
received, therefore, both of them, numerous visits in the parlor of the
lazaretto. The bell which summoned them, for me alone was dumb;
and I remained as solitary and forsaken, at the gates of a town
peopled with a hundred thousand of my countrymen, as if I had been
in the heart of Africa. One day, however, the parlor bell rang three
times, (the number of times corresponding to the number of my room ;)
I thought it must be a mistake ; I did not, however, allow this to appear.
I traversed proudly under the escort of my guard of health the long
space which separates the lazaretto, properly so called, from the parlor,
and there I found, with very lively satisfaction, M. Pons, the director
of the observatory at Marseilles, and the most celebrated discoverer of
comets of whom the annals of astronomy have ever had to register the
SUCCESS.

At any time a visit from the excellent M. Pons, whom I have since
seen director of the observatory at Florence, would have been very
agreeable to me; but during my quarantine I felt it unappreciably
valuable. It proved to me that I had returned to my native soil.

Two or three days before our admission to freedom, we experienced a
loss which was deeply felt by each of us. To pass away the heavy time
of a severe quarantine, the little Algerine colony was in the habit of
going to an inclosure near the lazaretto, where a very beautiful gazelle,
belonging to M. Dubois Thainville, was confined; she bounded about
there in full liberty with a grace which excited our admiration. One of
us endeavored to stop this elegant animal in her course; he seized her
unluckily by the leg, and broke it. We all ran, but only, alas! to wit-
ness a scene which excited the deepest emotion in us.

The gazelle, lying on her side, raised her head sadly; her beantiful
eyes (the eyes of a gazelle!) shed torrents of tears; no ery of complaint
escaped her mouth; she produced that effect apes us which is always
felt when a person who is suddenly struck by an irreparable misfortune,
resigns himself to it, and shows his profound anguish only by silent
tears.

Having ended my quarantine, I went at once to Perpignan, to the
bosom of my family, where my mother, the most excellent and pious of
women, caused numerous masses to be said to celebrate my return, as
she had done before to pray for the repose of my soul, when she thought
that I had fallen under the daggers of the Spaniards. But I soon quit-
ted my native town to return to Paris; and I deposited at the Bureau
of Longitude and the Academy of Sciences my observations, which I had
succeeded in preserving amidst the perils and tribulations of my long
campaign.

A few days after my arrival, on the 18th of September, 1809, I was
nominated an academician in the place of Lalande. There were fifty-
two voters; I obtained forty-seven voices, M. Poisson four, and M. Nouet
one. I was then twenty-three years of age.

A nomination made with such a majority would appear, at first sight,
as if it would give rise to no serious difficulties ; but it proved otherwise.
The intervention of M. de Laplace, before the day of ballot, was active
and incessant to have my admission postponed until the time when a
vacancy, occurring in the geometry section, might enable the learned
assembly to nominate M. Poisson at the same time as me. The author
of the Mécanique Céleste had vowed to the young geometer an unbounded
attachment, completely justified, certainly, by the beautiful researches
which science already owed to him. M. de Laplace could not support
the idea that a young astronomer, younger by five years than M. Poisson,
a pupil, in the presence of his professor at the Polytechnic School, shouid
become an academician before him. He proposed to me, therefore, to
write to the Academy that I would not stand for election until there should
be a second place to give to Poisson. I answered by a formal refusal,
and giving my reasons in these terms: ‘I care little to be nominated at
this moment. I have decided upon leaving shortly with M. de Humboldt
for Thibet. In those savage regions the title of member of the Institute
will not smooth the difficulties which we shall have to encounter. But
190 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

I would not be guilty of any rudeness toward the Academy. If they
were to receive the declaration for which I am asked, would not the
savans who composed this illustrious body have a right to say to me:
“How are you certain that we have thought of you? You refuse what
has not yet been offered to you.”

On seeing my firm resolution not to lead myself to the inconsiderate
course which he had advised me to follow, M. de Laplace went to work
in another way: he maintained that I had not sufficient distinction for
admission into the Academy. I do not pretend that, at the age of
three-and-twenty, my scientific attainments were very considerable, if
estimated in an absolute manner; but when I judged by comparison, I
regained courage, especially on considering that the three last years of
my life had been consecrated to the measurement of an are of the meri-
dian in a foreign country ; that they were passed amid the storms of the
war with Spain; often enough in dungeons, or, what was yet worse, in
the mountains of Kabyha, and at Algiers, at that time avery dangerous
residence.

Here is, therefore, my statement of accounts for that epoch. I make
it over to the impartial appreciation of the reader:

On leaving the Polytechnic School, [ had made, in conjunction with
M. Biot, an extensive and very minute research on the determination of
the coefficient of the tables of atmospheric refraction.

We had also measured the refraction of different gases, which, up to
that time, had not been attempted.

A determination, more exact than had been previously obtained, of
the relation of the weight of air to the weight of mercury, had furnished
a direct value of the coefficient of the barometrical formula which served
for the calculation of the heights.

I had contributed, in a regular and very assiduous manner, during
nearly two years, to the observations which were made day and night
with the trausit telescope and with the mural quadrant at the Paris
Observatory.

T had undertaken, in conjunction with M. Bouvard, the observations
relating to the verification of the laws of the moon’s libration. All the
ealculations were prepared ; it only remained for me to put the numbers
into the formule, when I was, by order of the Bureau of Longitude,
obliged to leave Paris for Spain. I had observed various comets, and
calculated their orbits. I had, in concert with M. Bouvard, calcwlated,
according to Laplace’s formula, the table of refraction which has been
published in the Recueil des Tables of the Bureau ot Longitude, and in
the Connaissance des Temps. A research on the velocity of light, made
with a prism placed betcre the object end of the telescope of the mural
circle, had proved that the same tables of refraction might serve for the
sun and all the stars.

Finally, L had just terminated, ‘under very difficult circumstances, the

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. hoe

grandest triangulation which had ever been achieved, to prolong the
meridian line from France as far as the Island of Formentera.

M. de Laplace, without denying the importance and utility of these
labors and these researches, saw in them nothing more than indications
of promise; M. Lagrange then said to him expiicit!y:

“1 en you, M. de Laplace, when you entered tne Academy, bad done
nothing’ brilliant; you only gave promise. Your grand discoveries did
not come till afterward.”

Lagrange was the only man in Europe who could with authority
address such an observation to him.

M. de Laplace did not reply upon the ground of the personal question,
but he added, “I maintain that it is useful to young savans to hold
out the position of member of the Institute as a future recompense, to
excite their zeal.”

“*You resemble,” replied M. Hallé, ‘the driver of the hackney coach,
who, to excite his horses to a gallop, tied a bundle of hay at the end of
his carriage pole; the poor horses redoubled their efforts, and the bundle
of hay always flew on before them. After all, his plan made them fall
off, and soon after brought on their death.”

Delambre, Legendre, Biot, insisted on the devotion, and what they
termed the courage, with which I had combated arduous difficulties,
whether in carrying on the observations, or in saving the instruments
and the results already obtained. They drew an animated picture of
the dangers I had undergone. M. de Laplace ended by yielding when
he saw that all the most eminent men of the Academy had taken me
under their patronage, and on the day of the election he gave me his
vote. It would be, 1 must own, a subject of regret with me even to
this day, after a lapse of forty-two years, if I had become member of the
Institute without having obtained the vote of the author of the Mécanique
Céleste.

The members of the Institute were always presented to the Emperor
after he had confirmed their nominations. On the appointed day, in
coinpany with the presidents, with the secretaries of the four classes,
and with the academicians who had special publications to offer to the
Chief of the State, they assembled in one of the saloons of the Tuileries,
When the Emperor returned from mass, he held a kind of review of
these savans, these artists, these literary men, in green uniform.

I must own that the spectacle which I witnessed on the day of my
presentation did nct edify me. I even experienced real displeasure in
seeing the anxiety evinced by members of the Institute to be noticed.

‘You are very young,” said Napoleon to me on coming near me; and
without waiting for a flattering reply, which it would not have been
difficult to find, he added, ‘What is your name?” And my ueighbor
on the right, not leaving me time to answer the simple enough question
just addressed to me, hastened to say :

‘* His name is Arago.”

“What science do you cultivate?”

My neighbor on the left immediately replied—

‘« He cultivates astronomy.”

‘““ What have you done?”

My neighbour on the right, jealous of my left hand neighbor for
having encroached on his rights at the second question, now hastened to
reply, and said :

‘‘ He has just been measuring the line of the meridian in Spain.”

The Emperor, imagining doubtless that he had before him either a
dumb man or an imbecile, passed on to another member of the Institute.
This one was not a novice, but a naturalist well known through his
beautiful and important discoveries, it was M. Lamarck. The old man
presented a book to Napoleon.

‘““ What is that?” said the latter, “it is your absurd meteorology, in
which you rival Matthieu Laensberg. It is this ‘annuaire’ which dis-
honors your old age. Do something in natural history, and I should
receive your productions with pleasure. As to this volume, I only take
it in consideration of your white hair. Here!” And he passed the
book to an aide-de-camp.

Poor M. Lamarck, who, at the end of each sharp and insulting sentence
of the Emperor, tried in vain to say, “It is a work on natural history
which I present to you,” was weak enough to fall into tears.

The Emperor immediately afterward met with a more energetic antag-
onist in the person of M. Lanjuinais. The latter had advanced, book in
hand. Napoleon said to him, sneeringly :

“The entire Senate, then, is to merge in the Institute?” “Sire,”
replied Lanjuinais, ‘‘it is the body of the state to which most time is left
for occupying itself with literature.”

The Emperor, displeased at this answer, at once quitted the civil
uniforms, and busied himself among the great epaulettes which filled the
room.

Immediately after my nomination I was exposed to strange annoyances
on the part of the military authorities. Ihad left for Spain, still holding
the title of pupil of the Polytechnic School. My name could not remain
on the books more than four years; consequently I had been enjoined
to return to France to go through the examinations necessary on quit-
ting the school. But in the meantime Lalande died, and thus a place
in the Bureau of Longitude became vacant. I was named assistant
astronomer. These places were submitted to the nomination of the
Emperor. M. Lacuée, director of the conscription, thought that, through
this latter circumstance, the law would be satisfied, and I was author-
ized to continue my operations.

M. Matthieu Dumas, who succeeded him, looked at the question from
an entirely different point of view; he enjoined me either to furnish
a substitute, or else set off myself with the contingent of the twelfth
arrondissement of Paris.
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 193

All my remonstrances and those of my friends having been fruitless,
I announced to the honorable general that I should present myself in
the Place de ’Estrapade, whence the conscripts had to depart, in the
costume of a member of the Institute; and that thus I should march on
foot through the city of Paris. General Matthieu Dumas was alarmed
at the effect which this scene would produce on the Emperor, himself a
member of the Institute, and hastened, under fear of my threat, to con-
firm the decision of General Lacuée.

In the year 1809, I was chosen by the “ conseil du perfectionnement”
of the Polytechnic School to succeed M. Monge, in his chair of analysis
applied to geometry. The circumstances attending that nomination
have remained a secret; I seize the first opportunity which offers itself
to me to make them known.

M. Monge took the trouble to come to me one day, at the observatory,
to ask me to succeed him. I declined this honor, because of a proposed
journey which I was going to make into Central Asia with M. de Hum-
boldt. “You will certainly not set off forsome months to come,” said the
jlustrious geometer; “ you could, therefore, take my place temporarily.”
“Your proposal,” I replied, ‘ flatters me infinitely; but I do not know
whether I ought to accept it. I have never read your great work on
partial differential equations; I do not, therefore, feel certain that I
should be competent to give lessons to the pupils of the Polytechnic
School on sucha difficult theory.” “Try,” said he, “and you will find
that that theory is clearer than it is generally supposed to be.” <Accor-
dingly, I did try; and M. Monge’s opinion appeared to me to be well
founded.

The public could not comprehend, at that time, how it was that the
benevolent M. Monge obstinately refused to confide the delivery of his
course to M. Binet, (a private teacher under him,) whose zeal was well
known. It is this motive which I am going to reveal.

There was then in the “ Bois de Boulogne” a residence named the
Grey House, where there assembled around M. Coessin, the high-priest
of a new religion, a number of adepts, such as Lesueur, the musician,
Colin, private teacher of chemistry at the school, M. Binet, &c. A report
from the prefect of police had signified to the Emperor that the frequent-
ers of the Grey House were connected with the Society of Jesuits. The
Emperor was uneasy andirritated at this. ‘ Well,” said he to M. Monge,
“there are your dear pupils become disciples of Loyola!” And on
Monge’s denial, “You deny it,” answered the Emperor; “well, then,

_ know that the private teacher of your course is in that clique.” Every

one can understand that after such a remark, Monge could not consent
to being succeeded by M. Binet.

Having entered the Academy, young, ardent, and impassioned, f took
much greater part in the nominations than may have been suitable for
mny position and my time of life. Arrived at an epoch of life whence I
examine retrospectively all my actions with calmness and impartiality, .

194 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

T ean render this amount of justice to myself, that, excepting in three
or four instances, my vote and interest were always in favor of the most
deserving candidate, and more than once I succeeded in preventing the
Academy from making a deplorable choice. Who could blame me for
having maintained with energy the election of Malus, considering that
his competitor, M. Girard, unknown asa physicist, obtained twenty-two
votes out of fifty-three, and that an addition of five votes would have
given him the victory over the savant who had just discovered the
phenomenon of polarization by reflection, over the savant whom Europe
would have named by acclamation? The same remarks are applicable
to the nomination of Poisson, who would.have failed against this same
M. Girard if four votes had been otherwise given. Does not this suffice
to justify the unusual ardor of my conduct? Although in a third trial
the majority of the Academy was decided in favor of the same engineer,
T cannot regret that I supported up to the last moment with conviction
and warmth the election of his competitor, M. Dulong.

I do not suppose that, in the scientific world, any one will be disposed
to blame me for having preferred M. Liouville to M. de Pontécoulant.

Sometimes it happened that the government wished to influence the
choice of the Academy; with a strong sense of my rights I invariably
resisted all dictation. Once this resistance acted unfortunately on one
of my friends—the venerable Legendre; as to myself, I had prepared
myself beforehand for all the persecutions of which I could be made the
object. Having received from the minister of the interior an invitation
to vote for M. Binet against M. Navier on the occurrence of a vacant
place in the section of mechanics, Legendre nobly answered that he
would vote according to his soul and his conscience. He was immediately
deprived of a pension which his great age and his long services rendered
due to him. The protégé of the authorities failed; and, at the time, this
result was attributed to the activity with which I enlightened the mem-
bers of the Academy as to the impropriety of the minister’s proceedings.

On another occasion the King wished the Academy to name Dupuytren,
the eminent surgeon, but whose character at the time lay under grave
imputations. Dupuytren was nominated, but several blanks protested
against the interference of the authorities in academic elections.

Tsaid above that [had saved the Academy from some deplorable choices ; _ |
I will only cite a single instance, on which occasion I had the sorrow of
finding myself in opposition to M. de Laplace. The illustrious geometer
wished a vacant place in the astronomical section to be granted to M.
Nicolle-—a man without talent. At the close of a coutest, which I
maintained undisguisedly, notwithstanding the danger which might
follow from thus braving the powerful protectors of M. Nicollet, the
Academy proceeded to the ballot; the respected M. Damoiseau, whose
election I had supported, obtained forty-five votes out of forty-eight.
Thus M. Nicollet had collected but three,

“T see,” said M. de Laplace to me, ‘that it is useless to struggle
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO. 195

against young people; [ acknowledge that the man who is called the
great elector of the Academy is more powerful than I am.”

‘6 No,” replied I; ‘“M. Arago can only succeed in counterbalancing
the opinion justly preponderating for M. de Laplace, when the right is
found to be without possible contradiction on his side.”

I would warn those savants, who having early entered the Academy,
might be tempted to imitate my example, to expect nothing beyond the
satisfaction of their conscience. [ warn them, with a knowledge of the
case, that gratitude will almost always be found wanting.

The elected Academician, whose merits you have sometimes ex-
alted beyond measure, pretends that you have done no more than jus-
tice to him; that you have only fulfilled a duty, and that he therefore
owes you no thanks.

Delambre died the 19th August, 1822. After the necessary delay,
they proceeded to fill his place. The situation of perpetual secretary is
not one which can long be left vacant. The Academy named acommis-
sion to present it with candidates; it was composed of Messrs. de La-
place, Arago, Legendre, Rossel, Prony, and Lacroix. The list presented
was composed of the names of Messrs. Biot, Fourier, and Arago. It is
not necessary for me to say with what obstinacy I opposed the inscrip-
tion of my name on this list; I was compelled to give way to the will of
my colleagues, but I seized the first opportunity of declaring publicly
that I had neither the expectation nor the wish to obtain a single vote ;
that, moreover, I had on my hands already as much work as I could get
through; that in this respect M. Biot was in the same position; and
that, in short, I should vote for the nomination of M. Fourier.

It was supposed, but I dare not flatter myself that it was the fact,
that my declaration exercised a certain influence on the result of the
ballot. The result was as follows: M. Fourier received thirty-eight
votes, and M. Biot ten. In a case of this nature each man carefully con-
ceals his vote, in order not to run the risk of future disagreement with
him who may be invested with the authority which the Academy gives
to the perpetual secretary. I do not know whether I shall be pardoned
if I recount an incident which amused the Academy at the time.

M. de Laplace, at the moment of voting, took two plain pieces of pa-
_per; his neighbor was guilty of the indiscretion of looking, and saw
distinctly that the illustrious geometer wrote the name of Fourier on
both of them. After quietiy folding them up, M. de Laplace put the
papers into his hat, shook it, and said to this same curious neighbor:
“You see, I have written two papers; [am going to tear up one; I shall
put the other into the urn; I shall thus be myself ignorant for which
of the two candidates I have voted.”

All went on as the celebrated Academician had said ; only that every
one knew with certainty that his vote had been for Fourier; and “ the
calculation of probabilities” was in no way necessary for arriving at
this result.
196 AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FRANCIS ARAGO.

After having fulfilled the duties of secretary with much distinction,
but not without some feebleness and negligence in consequence of his
bad health, Fourier died the 16th of May, 1830. I declined several times
the honor which the Academy appeared willing to do me, in naming me
to succeed him. I believed, without false modesty, that I had not the
qualities necessary to fill this important place suitably. When thirty-
nine out of forty-four voters had appointed me, it was quite time that I
should give in to an opinion so flattering and so plainly expressed. On
the 7th of June, 1830, I, therefore, became perpetual secretary of the -
Academy for the Mathematical Sciences; but, conformably to the plea
of an accumulation of offices, which I had used as an argument to sup-
port, in November, 1822, the election of M. Fourier, I declared that I
should give in my resignation of the professorship in the Polytechnic
School. Neither the solicitations of Marshal Soult, the minister of war,
nor those of the most eminent members of the Academy, could avail in
persuading me to renounce this resolution.
HERSCHEL.
By M. ARAGO.

WILLIAM HERSCHEL, one of the greatest astronomers that ever lived
in any age or country, was born at Hanover, on the 15th of November,
1738. The name of Herschel has become too illustrious for the world to
neglect searching back, along the stream of time, to learn the social
position of the families that have borne it. Yet pardonable curiosity
on this subject has not been entirely satisfied. We only know that
Abraham Herschel, great-grandfather of the astronomer, resided at
Méihren, whence he was expelled on account of his strong attachment
to the Protestant faith; that Abraham’s son Isaac was a farmer in the
vicinity of Leipzig ; that Isaac’s eldest son, Jacob Herschel, disappointed
his father’s earnest desire to see him devote himself to agriculture, that
he determined on being a musician, and settled at Hanover.

Jacob Herschel, father of William, the astronomer, was an eminent
musician, not less remarkable for the good qualities of his heart than for
those of his mind. His very limited means did not enable him to bestow
a complete education on his family, consisting of six boys and four girls,
although, by his care, his ten children all became excellent musicians.
The eldest, Jacob, even acquired a rare degree of skill, which pro-
cured for him the appointment of master of the band in a Hanoverian
regiment, which he accompanied to England. The third son, William,
remained under his father’s roof, and, without neglecting the fine arts,
took lessons in the French language, and devoted himself to the study
of metaphysics, for which he retained a taste to his latest day.

In 1759 William Herschel, then about twenty-one years of age, went
over to England, not with his father, as has been erroneously stated,
but with his brother Jacob, whose connections in that country seemed
likely to favor the young man’s opening prospects in life. But neither
London nor the country towns afforded him any resource in the begin-
ning, and the first two or three years after his expatriation were marked
with cruel privations, which were, however, manfully endured. <A fortun-
ate chance finally raised the young Hanoverian to a better position ;
Lord Durham engaged him as master of the band in an English regiment
which was quartered on the borders of Scotland. From this moment
he began to acquire a reputation as a musician that was gradually
extended, until in 1766 he was appointed organist at Halifax, (York-
shire.) The emoluments of this situation, together with those of giving
private lessons both in the town and the country around, afforded him
the means to remedy, or rather to complete, his early education. It was
198 HERSCHEL.

then that he learned Latin and Italian, though without any other help
than a grammar and a dictionary, and that he also acquired some
knowledge of Greek. So great was the desire for knowledge with which
he was inspired that while residing at Halifax he found means to continue
his philological exercises, and at the same time to study deeply the learned
but very obscure mathematical work of Smith on the theory of music.
This treatise, either explicitly or implicitly, supposed the reader to
have a knowledge of algebra and geometry, which Herschel did not
possess, but of which he made himself master in a very short time.

In 1766 Herschel obtained the appointment of organist to the Octagon
Chapel at Bath. This was a more lucrative post than that at Halifax,
but it also devolved on him new obligations. He had to play inces-
santly either at the oratorios, or in the rooms at the baths, at the
theater, and in the public concerts. Besides this, from among his patrons
in the most fashionable circle of England, he could not refuse to take
numerous pupils who wished to be instructed in his art. It is difficult to
imagine how, among so many duties, so many distractions of various
kinds, Herschel could continue the studies, which even at Halifax had
required so much resolution and perseverance, with a very uncommon
degree of talent. We have seen that it was by music that Herschel
was led to mathematics; mathematics in their turn led him to opties,
the principal and fertile source of his illustrious career. The time
finally arrived when his theoretic knowledge was to guide the young
musician into a laborious application of principles quite foreign to his
habits; and of which the brilliant success, as well as the excessive
temerity, must excite reasonable astonishment.

A telescope—a simple reflector, only two English feet in length falls
into the hands of Herschel during his residence at Bath. This in-
strument, however imperfect, shows him a multitude of stars in the
sky that the naked eye cannot discern; shows him also enlarged known
objects, under their true dimensions; reveals forms to him that the
richest imaginations of antiquity had never suspected. He is trans-
ported with enthusiasm, and resolves, without delay, to have a similar in-
strument but of larger size. The answer from London is delayed for
some days. These few days appear to him as years. When the answer
arrives, the price that the optician demands proves to be much beyond
the pecuniary resources of a mere organist. To any other man this
would have been an unsurmountable obstacle. This unexpected diffi-
culty, on the contrary, inspired Herschel with fresh energy. He can-
not buy a telescope; then he will construct one with his own hands.
The musician of the Octagon Chapel rushes immediately into a mul-
titude of experiments, on metallic alloys that reflect light with the
greatest intensity, on the means of giving the parabolic figure to the
mirrors, on the causes that in the operation of polishing affect the
regularity of the reflection, &c. So rarea degree of perseverance at last
receives its reward. In i774 Herschel has the happiness of being
HERSCHEL. 199

able to examine the heavens with a Newtonian telescope of five English
feet focus, entirely made by himself. This success tempts him to under-
take still more difficult enterprises. Other telescopes of seven, of eight,
of ten, and even of twenty feet focal distance, crown his efforts. As if
to answer in advance those critics who would have accused him of a
superfluity of apparatus, of unnecessary luxury, in the large size of the
new instruments, and his extreme minutie in their execution, Nature
granted to the astronomical musician, on the 13th of March, 1781, the
unprecedented honor of commencing his career of observation with the
discovery of a new planet, situated on the confines of our solar system.
Dating from that moment, Herschel’s reputation, no longer in his
character of musician, but as a constructor of telescopes and as an
astronomer, spread throughout the world. George III, a lover of
science, and much inclined besides to protect and patronize both men
and things of Hanoverian origin, had Herschel presented to him. He
was charmed with the simple yet lucid and modest account that the
astronomer gave of his repeated endeavors; he caught a glimpse of
the glory that such an observer might reflect on his reign; granted him
a pension of three hundred guineas a year, and furnished him with a resi-
dence near Windsor Castle, first at Clay Hall and then at Slough. The
anticipations of George III were completely realized. We may confidently
assert, relative to the little house at Slough, that it is the place of all
the world where the greatest number of astronomical discoveries have
been made. The name of that village will never perish. Science will
transmit it religiously to our latest posterity.

I shall avail myself of this opportunity to rectify a mistake, of which
ignorance and idleness wish to make a triumphant handle, or, at all
events, to wield in their cause as an irresistible justification. It has
been repeated to satiety that at, the time when Herschel entered on his
astronomical career he knew nothing of mathematics. But Ihave already
said that, during his residence at Bath, the organist of the Octagon
Chapel had familiarized himself with the principles of geometry and
algebra; and a still more positive proof of this is, that a difficult
question on the vibration of strinfs loaded with small weights having
been proposed for discussion in 1779, Herschel gave it a solution which
was thought worthy to be inserted in several scientific periodicals.of the
year 1780. es

The adventurous life of Herschel is here closed. The great astrono-
mer will not quit his observatory any more, except to submit the sublime
results of his laborious vigils to the Royal Society of London. These
results are contained in his memoirs; they constitute one of the principal
riches of the celebrated collection known under the title of Philosophical
Transactions.

Herschel was even elected as a member of the principal academies of
Europe, and about 1816 he was named a Knight of the Guelphic Order
of Hanover. According to the English custom, from the time of that
200 HERSCHEL.

nomination the title of Sir William took the place, on all his memoirs,
already honored with so much celebrity, of the former appellation
of Doctor William. He had been named a doctor of laws in the
University of Oxford in 1786. This dignity, by special favor, was con-
ferred on him without any of the obligatory formalities of examination,
disputation, or pecuniary contribution, usual in that learned corporation.

I should wound the elevated sentiments that Herschel professed ail
his life, if I were not here to mention two indefatigable assistants that
this fortunate astronomer found in his own family. The one was Alex-
ander Herschel, endowed with a remarkable talent for mechanism,
always at his brother’s service, and who enabied him to realize without
delay any ideas that he had conceived;* the other was Miss Caroline
Herschel, who deserves a still more particular and detailed mention.

Miss Caroline Lucretia Herschel went to England as soon as her
brother became special astronomer to the King. She received the
appellation there of Assistant Astronomer, with a moderate salary.
From that moment she unreservedly devoted herself to the service of
her brother, happy in contributing night and day to his rapidly increasing
scientific reputation. Miss Caroline shared in all the night-watches of
her brother, with her eye constantly on the clock, and the pencil in her
hand; she, without exception, recorded all the observations; she after-
ward made three or four copies in separate registers; codrdinated,
classed, and analyzed them. If the scientific world saw with astonish-
ment how Herschel’s works succeeded each other with unexampled
rapidity during so many years, they were specially indebted for it to the
ardor of Miss Caroline. Astronomy, moreover, has been directly
enriched with several comets by this excellent and respectable lady.
After the death of her illustrious brother, she retired to Hanover, to the
house of Jahn Dietrich Herschel, a musician of high reputation, and
the only surviving brother of the astronomer.

William Herschel died without pain on the 23d of August, 1822, aged
eighty-three. Neither fame nor fortune ever changed in him the fund of
infantine candor, inexhaustible benevolence, and sweetness of character
with which nature had endowed him. He preserved to the last both
his brightness of mind and vigor of intellect. For some years before
his deat!"1e enjoyed with delight the distinguished success of his only
© u,t Sir John Herschel. At his last hour he sunk to rest with the
pleasing conviction that his beloved son, heir of a great name, would
not allow it to fall into oblivion, but would adorn it with fresh luster,

* When age and infirmities obliged Alexander Herschel to give up his profession as a
musician, he quitted Bath and returned to Hanover, very generously provided by Sir
William with a comfortable independence for life.

+ Sir W. Herschel had married Mary, the widow of John Pitt, esq., possessed of a con-
siderable jointure, and the union proved a remarkable accession of domestic happiness.
This lady survived Sir William by several years. They had but this son.—TRANSLA-
TOR’S NOTE.
HERSCHEL. 201

and that great discoveries would also honor his career. No prediction
of the illustrious astronomer has been more completely verified.

In the English journals an account is given of the interesting means
adopted by the family of Sir William Herschel for preserving the remains
of the great telescope of thirty-nine feet focus, constructed by that cele-
brated astronomer.

The metal tube of the instrument, carrying at one end the recently
cleaned mirror of four feet ten inches in diameter, has been placed hori-
zontally in the meridian on solid piers of masonry, in the midst of the
circle where formerly stood the mechanism requisite for maneuvering
the telescope. The 1st of January, 1840, Sir John Herschel, his wife,
their children, seven in number, and some old family-servants assembled
at Slough. Exactly at noon the party walked several times in proces-
sion around the instrument; they then entered the tube of the telescope,
seated themselves on benches that had been prepared for the purpose,
and sung a requiem, with English words, composed by Sir John Herschel
himself. After their exit, the illustrious family ranged themselves around
the great tube, the opening of which was then hermetically sealed. The
day concluded with a party of intimate friends.

I know not whether those persons who can only appreciate things
from the peculiar point of view from which they have been accustomed
to look, may think there was something strange in several of the details
of the ceremony that I have just described. I affirm, however, that the
whole world will applaud the pious feeling which actuated Sir John
Herschel, and that all the friends of science will thank him for having
consecrated the humble garden where his father achieved such immortal
labors by a monument more expressive in its simplicity than pyramids
or statues.

The chronological and detailed analysis of so many labors would
involve numerous repetitions. A systematic order will be preferable,
since it more distinetly fixes the eminent place that Herschel will never
cease to occupy in the small group of contemporary men of genius, while
his name will reécho to the most distant posterity. The variety and
splendor of Herschel’s labors vie with their extent. The more we study
them the more we must admire them. It is with great men as it is with
great movements in the arts: we cannot understand them without study-
ing them from various points of view.

Let us here again make a general reflection. The memoirs of Herschel
are, for the greater part, pure and simple extracts from his inexhaustible
journals of observations at Slough, accompanied by brief remarks. Such
a table would not suit historical details. In these respects the author
has left almost everything to his biographers to do for him. And they
must impose on themselves the task of assigning to the great astron-
omer’s predecessors the portion that legitimately belongs to them out
of the mass of discoveries which the public, we must say, are in the
habit of erroneously referring too exclusively..o Herschel.

At one time I thought of adding a note to the analysis of each of the
illustrious observer’s memoirs, containing a detailed account of the
improvements or corrections to which the progressive march of science
has led. But in order to avoid an exorbitant length in this biog-
raphy, I have been obliged to give up my project. In general, I shall
content myself with pointing out what belongs to Herschel, referring to
Arago’s Treatise on Popular Astronomy for the historical details. The life
of Herschel had the rare advantage of forming an epoch in an extensive
branch of astronomy; it would require us almost to write a special
treatise on astronomy to show thoroughly the importance of all the re-
searches that are due to him.

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MEANS OF OBSERVATION.

The improvements that Herschel made in the construction and manage-
ment of telescopes have contributed so directly to the discoveries with
which that observer enriched astronomy that we cannot hesitate to
bring them forward at once.

I find the following passage in a memoir by Lalande, printed in 1783,
and forming part of the preface to Volume VILI of the Ephemerides of the
Celestial Motions:

‘¢ Hach time that Herschel undertakes to polish a mirror (of a tele-
scope) he condemns himself to ten, or twelve, or even fourteen hours of
constant work. He does not quit his workshop for a minute, not even to
HERSCHEL. 205

eat, but receives from the hands of his sister that nourishment without
which one could not undergo such prolonged fatigue. Nothing could
induce Herschel to leave his work; for, according to him, if he did so
it would be to spoil it.”

The advantages that Herschel found in 1783, 1784, and 1785, in em-
ploying telescopes of twenty feet and with large apertures, made him
desire to construct one much larger still. The expense would be consid-
erable; the King provided for it. The work, begun about the close of
1785, was finished in August, 1789. This instrument had an iron eylin-
drical tube, thirty-nine feet four inches in length, and four teet ten
inches in diameter. Such dimensions are enormous as compared with
those of telescopes previously made. They will appear but small, how-
ever, to persons who have heard the report of a pretended ball given in
the Slough telescope. The propagators of this popular rumor must
have confounded the astronomer Herschel with the brewer Meux, and a
cylinder in which a man of the smallest stature could searcely stand
upright, with divers wooden vats, as large as a house, in which beer
is made in London.

Herschel’s telescope, forty English feet* in length, allowed the reali-
zation of an idea, the advantages of which would not be sufficiently
appreciated if I did not here recall to mind some facts.

In any telescope, whether refracting or reflecting, there are two prin-
cipal parts: the part that forms the aerial images of the distant objects,
and the small lens by the aid of which these images are magnified just
as if they consisted of radiating matter. When the image is produced
by means of a lenticular glass, the place it occupies will be found in the
prolongation of the line that extends from the object to the center of
the lens. The astronomer, furnished with an eye-piece and wishing to
examine that image, must necessarily place himself beyond the point
where therays that form it have crossed each other ; beyond, let us carefully
remark,means farther off from the object-glass. The observer’s head,
cannot then interfere with the formation or the brightness of the image,
however small may be the distance from which he may have to study it.
But it is no longer thus with the image formed by means of reflection.
For the image is now placed between the object and the reflecting mir-
ror, and when the astronomer approaches in order to examine it, he
inevitably intercepts, if not the totality, at least a very considerable
portion, of the luminous rays, which would otherwise have contributed
to give it great distinctness. It will now be understood why, in optical
instruments where the images of distant objects are formed by the re-
flection of light, it has been necessary to carry the images, by the aid
of a second reflection, out of the tube that contains and sustains the

* Conforming to general usage, and to Sir W. Herschel himself, we shall allude to
this instrument as the forty-foot telescope, though M. Arago adheres to thirty-nine feet
and drops the inches, probably because the Parisian foot is rather longer than the
English.— TRANSLATOR’s NOTE.

principal mirror. When the small mirror on the surface of which the
second reflection is effected is plane and inclined at an angle of 45° to
the axis of the telescope; when the image is reflected laterally through
an opening made near the edge of the tube and furnished with an eye-
piece; when, in a word, the astronomer looks definitively in a direction
perpendicular to the line described by the luminous rays coming from
the object and falling on the center of the great mirror, then the tele-
scope is called Newtonian. But in the Gregorian telescope the image
formed by the principal mirror falls on a second mirror, which is very
smnall, slightly curved, and parallel to the first. The small mirror re-
flects the first image and throws it beyond the large mirror, through an
opening made in the middle of that mirror.

Both in the one and in the other of these two telescopes, the small
mirror interposed between the object and the great mirror forms relative
to the latter a sort of screen which prevents its entire surface from con-
tributing toward forming the image. The small mirror also, in regard
to intensity, gives some trouble.

Let us suppose, in order to clear up our ideas, that the material of
which the two mirrors are made reflects only half of the incident light.
In the course of the first reflection, the immense number of rays that the
aperture of the telescope had received may be considered as reduced to
half. Nor is the diminution less on the small mirror. Now, half of a half
is a quarter. Therefore the instrument will send to the eye of the ob-
server only a quarter of the incident light that its aperture had received
If these two causes of diminished light did not exist ina refracting tele-
scope, it would give, under parity of dimensions, four times more * light
than a Newtonian or Gregorian telescope gives.

Herschel did away with the small mirror in his large telescope by
placing the large mirror obliquely in the tube which causes the images
to be formed, not in the axis of the tube, but very near the circumfer-
ence or edge of the outer mouth, as we may callit. The observer might
therefore look at them directly merely by means of an eye-glass. A
small portion of the astronomer’s head, it is true, encroaches on the tube,
forms a screen, and interrupts some incident rays. Still, in a large tel-
escope, this loss does not amount to half as much as it would inevitably
do if the small mirror were there.

Those telescopes in which the observer, standing at the anterior ex-
tremity of the tube, looks directly into it, turning his back to the objects,
were called by Herschel front-view telescopes. In Volume LX XVI of the
Philosophical Transactions, he says that the idea of this construction
occurred to him in 1776, and that he then applied it unsuccessfully to a
ten-foot telescope; that during the year 1784 he again made a fruitless
trial of it in a twenty-foot telescope. Yet I find that on the 7th of Sep-
tember, 1784, he recurred to a front view in observing some nebule and
groups of stars. However discordant these dates may be, we cannot

*It would be more correct to say four times as much light.—TRANSLATOR.
HERSCHEL. 207

without injustice neglect to remark that a front-view telescope was
already described in 1732, in Volume VI of the collection entitled ‘‘Ma-
chines and Inventions approved by the Academy of Sciences.” The author
of this innovation is Jacques Lemaire, who has been unduly confounded
with the English Jesuit, Christopher Maire, assistant to Boscovitch, in
measuring the meridian comprised between Rome and Rimini. Jacques
Lemaire, having only telescopes of moderate dimensions in view, was
obliged, in order not to sacrifice any of the light, to place the great mir-
ror so obliquely that the image formed by its surface should fall entirely
outside the tube of the instrument. So great a degree of inclination
would certainly distort theimage. The front-view construction is admis-
sible only in very large telescopes.

I find in the Transactions for 1805 that, in solar observations, Herschel
sometimes employed telescopes, the great mirror of which was made of
glass. It was with a telescope of this kind, seven feet long, and six inches
and ghree-tenths in diameter, that he observed the transit of Mercury
on the 9th of November, 1802.

Practical astronomers know how much the mounting of a telescope
contributes to produce correct observations. The difficulty of a solid
yet very movable mounting increases rapidly with the dimensions and
weight of an instrument. We may then conceive that Herschel had to
surmount many obstacles in mounting a telescope suitably of which the
mirror alone weighed upward of 1,000 kilograms, (a ton.) But he
solved this problem to his entire satisfaction by the aid of a combination
of spars, pulleys, and ropes, of which a correct idea may be formed
by referring to the wood-cut given in Arago’s Treatise on Popular

. Astronomy, (Vol. I.) This apparatus, and the different stands that

Herschel devised for telescopes of smaller dimensions, assign to that
llustrious observer a distinguished place among the most ingenious
mechanics of our age.

The public in general—I may even say the greater part of astronomers
—know not what was the effect that the great forty-foot telescope had in
the labors and discoveries of Herschel. Still, we are not less mistaken
when we suppose that the observer of Slough always used this telescope
than in imagining, with Baron von Zach, (see Monatliche Correspondenz,
January, 1802) that the colossal instrument was of no use atall; thatit
did not contribute to any new discovery; that it must be considered as a
mere object of curiosity. These assertions are distinctly contradicted
by Herschel’s own words. In the volume of Philosophical Transactions
for the year 1795 (p. 350) I read, for example: “On the 28th of August,
1789, having directed my telescope (of forty feet) to the heavens, I dis-
covered the sixth satellite of Saturn, and I perceived the spots on that
planet better than I had been able to do before.” (See also relative to
this sixth satellite the Philosophical Transactions for 1790, p. 10.) In
that same volume of 1790 (p. 11) I find: “The great light of my forty-
foot telescope was so useful that on the 17th of September, 1789, I re-
208 HERSCHEL.

marked the seventh satellite, then situated at its greatest western
elongation.”

The 10th of October, 1791, Herschel saw the ring of Saturn and the
fourth satellite, looking in at the mirror of his forty-foot telescope, with
his naked eye, without any kind of eye-piece.

Let us acknowledge the true motives that prevented Herschel from
oftener using his forty-foot telescope. Notwithstanding the excellence
of the mechanism, the maneuvering of that instrument required the
constant aid of two laborers, and that of another person charged
with noting the time at the clock. Besides this, during nights when the
variation of temperature was considerable, this telescope, on account of
its great mass, was always behind the atmosphere in thermometric
changes, giving rise to a difference of density in the air within and
without the tube very injurious to the distinctness of the images.

Herschel found thatin England there are not above a hundred hours
im a year during which the heavens can be advantageously observed
with a telescope of forty feet, furnished with a magnifying power of a
thousand. Thisremark led the celebrated astronomer to the conclusion
that to take acomplete survey of the heavens with his large instrument,
though each successive field should remain only for an instant under
inspection, would not require less than eight hundred years.

He explains very clearly the rare occurrence of the circumstances in
which it is possible to make good use of a telescope of forty feet, and
of very large aperture.

A telescope does not magnify real objects only, but magnifies also
the apparent irregularities arising from atmospheric refractions; now,
all other things being equal, these irregularities of refraction must be
so much the greater, so much the more frequent, as the stratum of
air is thicker through which the rays have passed in going to form the
image.

Astronomers expressed extreme surprise when, in 1782, they learned
that Herschel had applied linear magnifying powers of a thousand, of
twelve hundred, of two thousand two hundred, of two thousand six
hundred, and even of six thousand times, to a reflecting telescope of
seven feet in length. The Royal Society of London participated in this
surprise, and officially requested Herschel to give publicity to the
means he had adopted for using such amounts of magnifying power
in his telescopes. Such was the object of a memoir that he inserted
in Volume LX XII of the Philosophical Transactions; and it dissipated
all doubts. No one will be surprised that magnifying powers, which it
would seem ought to have shown the lunar mountains as the chain of
Mont Blane is seen from Macon, from Lyons, and even from Geneva,
were not easily believed in. They did not know that Herschel had
never used magnifying powers of three thousand and six thousand.
times, except in observing brilliant stars; they had not remembered
that light reflected by planetary bodies is too feeble to continue distinct
HERSCHEL. 209

under the same degree of magnifying power as the direct light of the
fixed stars does.

Opticians had given up, more from theory than from careful experi-
ments, attempting high magnifying powers, even for reflecting telescopes.
They thought that the image of a small circle cannot be distinct, cannot
be sharp at the edges, unless the pencil of rays coming from the object
in nearly parallel lines, and which enters the eye after having passed
through the eye-picce, be sufiiciently broad. This being once granted,
the inference followed that an image ceases to be well defined when it
does not strike at least two of the nervous filaments of the retina with
which tbat organ is supposed to be overspread. These gratuitous
conditions, grafted on each other, vanished in presence of Herschel’s
observations. After having put himself on his guard against the effects
of diffraction—that is to say, against the scattering that light undergoes
