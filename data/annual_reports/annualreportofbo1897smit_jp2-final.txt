JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

JANUARY 27, 1897.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the
fourth Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller) in the chair; the
Hon. A. E. Stevenson, Vice President of the United States; the Hon.
J.S. Morrill, the Hon. 8S. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon.
Joseph Wheeler, the Hon. kh. Rk. Hitt, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the
Hon. William L. Wilson, Dr. J. B. Angell, Dr. Andrew D. White,
the Hon. John B. Henderson, the Hon. Gardiner G. Hubbard, and the
Secretary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion the Secretary read the minutes of the
last meeting in abstract. ‘There being no objection the minutes were
approved. ‘

The Secretary presented his annual report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1896, remarking that as the Regents had already been supplied
with copies by mail he would say nothing further upon it now. On
motion the report was accepted.

Senator Henderson, as chairman of the Executive Committee, pre-
sented the report of the Executive Committee for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1896. On motion the report was adopted.

Senator Henderson presented the following customary resolution
relative to income and expenditure, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Sec-
retary with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part
of the Secretary as to items.

Senator Henderson, as Chairman of the Permanent Committee (com-
* posed of the Executive Committee and the Secretary), stated that the
matters which affect the Avery estate, and which were before the Board
at the last meeting, had had the committee’s consideration. There was
no special report, but he hoped to have a statement to make by the
next meeting.

The Chancellor then announced that if there was no objection the
matters in the Avery estate would be postponed for a report at the

next annual meeting of the Board.

XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Secretary said:

The Regents know of the irreparable loss which the Institution has sustained in the
death of Dr. Goode, a man who can not be replaced; a man who was devoted to its
service; who, it almost might be said, laid down his life for it, and who possessed a
combination of administrative ability and general scientific knowledge with every
element of moral trustworthiness for which I do not know where to look again. I
have thought that the Regents might like to make, by exception, an acknowledg-
ment of this by some resolution, and I will request Dr. White to present those
prepared.

Dr. White then read the following resolutions:

Whereas the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. G. Brown
Goode, died on September 6, 1896,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents wish to here record their sense of the devo-
tion to duty which in the late Dr. Goode came before any considerations of
personal advancement, or even before the care of his own health, and of their recog-
nition that his high administrative ability and wide knowledge were devoted unsel-
fishly to the service of the Institution, with results whose value they can not too
highly acknowledge; and they desire to express their feeling of the loss that the
Institution, the National Museum, and the cause of science has sustained in his
untimely death.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be suitably engrossed and transmitted
to the family of Dr. Goode.

Dr. White said:

In being asked to offer these resolutions i wish to say that I accept the duty as
one especially grateful to iy own feelings. FT became acquainted with Dr. Goode
about sixteen years ago when he went abroad to Berlin, representing the Smith-
sonian Institution at the Fisheries Exposition. I think every one who met him then
conceived a very high opinion not only of his executive abilities, which he had much
occasion to show, but of his personal qualities. I took occasion to bring him into
connection with the leading German men of science, and he at once seemed to win
not merely their respect but also their most kindly feelings. You are aware that on
that occasion the United States exhibition was by far superior to any of their own,
and it was then that we received the great prize from the Emperor Wiihelm, which
now stands in the Museum under our care. At various times since I have had occa-
sion to renew my acquaintance with Dr. Goode, and I have never ceased to hold the
good opinion which his admirable qualities aroused in me.

Mr. Hubbard said:

Mr. Brown Goode was a very warm personal friend of mine. I personally regret
his loss, and I regret it still more on account of the loss to the Museum. I do not
suppose that there was any man living who knew better what was necessary for the
Museum than he. I do not believe any man ever lived, or ever will live, who will
give so much of his time and thought to the work of this Museum as Mr. Brown
Goode did, and his death is a blow which the Museum will feel as long as it lasts.

Senator Morrill said:

I frequently had occasion to converse with Dr. Goode in relation to the future
growth of the Museum. It is, perhaps, well known to most of you that I have been
making an effort for some years now to secure an additional building for the Museum,
and in talking over the matter Dr. Goode was very earnest in his purpose to fill
it with something that would be worthy of our country, and he was also strongly of
the opinion that there was no country that could afford as many valuable and
attractive collections for Museum purposes as the United States, and, with the
Smithsonian, was capable of doing so in a more economical manner than perhaps
any other country in the world.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

Mr. Wilson said:

My personal relations with Dr. Goode were so pleasant and cordial that though I
can add nothing to what has been already said by Dr. White, Mr. Hubbard, and Sen-
ator Morrill, I feel at least like seconding these resolutions. I was thrown a great
deal with Dr. Goode in a most informal and unofficial way and I learned to have the
highest possible respect for him, not only as a scientific man, but as an individual.
The simplicity, modesty, and general kindliness of his character were always his
striking features, and I remember no greater shock in recent months than the
announcement of the death of this still young man, which I learned from an Amer-
ican paper as soon as [ returned from abroad last summer.

On motion, the resolutions were adopted by a rising vote.

The Secretary said that before leaving this subject he might say that
the year had been a painful one for the Institution in the loss of other
people not known to the Regents, but only less essential to it than
Dr. Goode. Mr. RK. E. Earll and others who were identified with it
had been thus taken away, and it had been difficult to find persons of
efficiency to attend to their work. The Secretary added that he had lost
not only Dr. Goode, but also Mr. Winlock, who was assistant in charge
of the Institution, who came next to Dr. Goode in authority, and who
was trusted and trustworthy in every way. It had been a sad year
here, but he would say nothing further about its losses except that the
deaths included a number of employees who were also valuable in their
positions.

The Chancellor stated that the appointment of an Assistant Secre-
tary was made by the Secretary, with the consent of the Regents; in
other words, the initiative, under the law, came from the Secretary.
He would like to hear from the Secretary about it.

The Secretary then addressed the Board as follows:

The Board is aware that a vacancy exists in the Assistant Secretaryship, caused
by the death of Dr. Goode, a like successor to whom can hardly be found.

Under correction of the Chancellor, I will recall that while the law authorizes the
Secretary to, with the consent of the Board of Regents, employ assistants, he is not
required to employ anyone.

In the early days of the Institution there was one Assistant Secretary in charge of
the library, to which there was added later by Professor Henry one in charge of the
Museum. The latter of these was Professor Baird, who was in turn appointed Sec-
retary by the Regents, and who, during a term of nearly ten years, appointed no
assistants until January 12, 1887, when he received the consent of the Regents to the
appointment of one in charge of the exchanges, library, and publications, and
another in charge of the Museum. There have been, therefore, periods in the his-
tory of the Institution when there was but one Assistant Secretary, a long period
immediately preceding the present incumbency when there was none, and subse-
quently a brief period when there were two. The work of the Institution has
enormously increased, even since the death of Secretary Baird.

In regard to subordinate positions, the power of appointment has been exercised
by the successive Secretaries for a period of over 40 years, and with an absence of
any suggestion of favoritism, partiality, or harshness, which is rare in office. In all
these appointments and in every official relationship the recognition of the plenary
authority of the Regents, as exercised through the Secretary, has been the founda-
tion of good government. It is because the authority of the Board and its method
of action is so absolutely recognized that it has been so very rarely needed to dis-
play it to make it effective, and thus during ten years of the Museum’s administra-
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

tion I do not recall a single occasion in which the Secretary has not found himself
able to act in accordance with the wish of the Assistant Secretary in all appoint-
_ments and removals.

Nothing can be more desirable in administration than a condition which can per-
mit this freedom without fear of laxity. It was justified in this case, as it is hoped
it will always be justified, by the fact that the person in this important position
possessed the entire confidence of the Secretary.

It is more than ever before desirable that the officer in charge of the Museum
shall be a man of wide experience in administrative affairs, as well as a man of
scientific position, and that the whole body of scientific men throughout the country
shall be eligible, but I have found myself unable as yet, after the most anxious pains,
to present any name to the Regents which appears entirely satisfactory.

After laying before the Regents the names of different gentlemen pro-
posed for the position, with the recommendatory letters, the Secretary
said that most of these, with others he had considered among the more
prominent ones of the country, were without the civil service and came
under the exclusions of its rules. He would add that the names outside
the civil service among whom the Institution would naturally seek were
those of persons already enjoying positions of high trust, and who, in
several of these instances, could only accept the place at a heavy
pecuniary sacrifice.

The Secretary then presented the name of Mr. Charles D. Walcott,
honorary curator of the Museum, and now director of the United States
Geological Survey, and after explaining the grounds for his confidence
in Mr. Walcott and the reasons which made it impracticable for the
latter to then accept the position, while it was desirable that some
immediate, if provisionary, arrangement should be made, asked the
consent of the Regents to the appointment of Mr. Waleott as acting
assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with the under-
standing that his duties to the Institution were to be confined exclu-
sively to the charge of the Museum. Senator Morrill then introduced
the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Prof. Charles D. Walcot, as

acting assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with duties confined to
the charge of the National Museum, be approved.

The Secretary then said:
I have received the following letter from the President of the United States:

“ HXECUTIVE MANSION,
“ Washington, June 18, 1896.

‘DEAR Sir: I inclose you a classification of the employees of the
Smithsonian Institution, which is a copy of those signed by the other
Executive Departments and bureaus.

‘‘T wish you would insert the date and sign it and notify the Civil
Service Commission that you have done so. I think it should be filed
in your office.

‘‘ Yours, truly,

“GROVER CLEVELAND.
“S. P. LANGLEY, Secretary, etc.”
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

It has been taken as a matter of course that this order does not apply to the
parent institution, and it is only as regards its application to Smithsonian bureaus’
supported wholly or in part by Government appropriations that I bring the letter
to the attention of the Regents. In the absence of their instructions the expression
of the President’s wish has been taken as a command, and the classification referred
to signed.

The Secretary then communicated to the Regents a letter from one
of their number, the Hon. W. L. Wilson, Postmaster-General, on the
subject of the relations of the Smithsonian bureaus with the United
States civil service. Mr. Wilson also personally communicated to the
Board the fact that he had had a conference on this subject with the
President, who recognized that his letter could not apply to the Smith-
sonian Institution proper, which was not supported by Government
appropriations.

The Regents then discussed with some fullness the subject of these
relationships, and without adopting any resoJution, indicated a line of
action which seemed to them suitable.

The Secretary stated that he had been requested to appear before the
Joint Committee on the Library in the early part of last month, when
he had been asked what the National Museum had which would serve
to decorate the new Library building.

Senator Gray, after discussion, offered the following resolution, which
was adopted:

Resolved, That in the opinion of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion it will not be expedient or wise to interfere with the integrity of the National
Museum by lending, for the decoration of the Library building, any of the articles
or property now in its care.

The Secretary then exhibited to the Board the ‘Half Century”
volume, explaining to what degree its preparation had arrived. He
also read a letter from Mrs. Coppée, conveying her acknowledgment of
the resolutions adopted on the death of her husband, Dr. Coppée.

The Secretary then exhibited the Hodgkins medals, in silver and
bronze, with a statement of the number sent to contestants.

Mr. Hubbard presented resolutions to the effect that the Chancellor
should appoint a committee, of which the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution should be ex officio, a member, to inquire into the condition
of various bureaus, with special reference to what could best be done
to increase their usefulness. Senator Henderson expressed the wish
that the Regents would revise the work of the Executive Committee,
and stated that the Institution needed help in Congress.

Senator Morrill remarked that, in view of the lateness of the hour,
the resolutions which had been proposed should be considered at
another meeting, and at the suggestion of the Chancellor it was

arranged that an adjourned meeting should be held on February 1, at
10 o’clock a. m.
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

FEBRUARY 1, 1897.

The Board met this morning.

Present: The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller) in the chair; the
Vice-President, the Hon. A. E. Stevenson; the Hon. J. 8S. Morrill, the
Hon. S. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
the Hon. R. R. Hitt, the Hon. W. L. Wilson, Dr. Andrew D. White, the
Hon. J. B. Henderson, the Hon. Gardiner G. Hubbard, and the Secre-
tary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion an abstract of the minutes of the
meeting of the 2/th of January was read and approved.

The Secretary then read the resolutions introduced by Mr. Hubbard,
who made an explanation of their purpose. A general discussion
ensued, and the resolutions were finally adopted in the following form:

Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed by the Chancellor, the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution being ex officio a member, upon the National Museum,
the Burean of American Ethnology, and the National Zoological Park, with especial
reference to the ascertainment of what can be done to promote their usefulness and
value, and to report to the Board of Regents at its next meeting.

The Chancellor appointed as members of the committee Mr. Hubbard,
Senator Cullom, Mr. Henderson, Mr. Wilson, and the Secretary.

The Secretary then said that a matter of importance had just been
brought to his attention in connection with a difficulty which had
occurred to the Chancellor with regard to the possible future appoint-
ment of an acting secretary, and which in the Chancellor’s opinion
made it, though not indispensable, yet desirable, that an assistant sec-
retary should be appointed.

The Secretary said that Mr. Richard Rathbun was a person whose
relationships to the Institution had been intimate for nearly twenty
years, and who had the Secretary’s personal confidence. He now held
the position of aid-in-charge of the Institution, and possessed both the
ability and experience which would warrant his selection as assistant
secretary. The Secretary accordingly asked the consent of the Regents
to his appointment.

The Vice-President then offered the following resolution, which was
adopted:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Mr. Richard Rathbun as
assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with duties connected with the
bureaus of the Institution other than the National Museum, be approved.

The Secretary presented a suggestion made by,Mr. Walcott in his
capacity as Director of the Geological Survey, and after discussion by

the Regents Senator Gray offered the following resolution, which was
adopted: :

Kesolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution look with
favor upon the proposition to establish a museum of »ractical and industrial geology
in the neighborhood of the National Museum.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion
it adjourned.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

For THE YEAR ENDI7G JUNE 30, 1897

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Institution, the appropriations by Con-
egress, and the receipts and expenditures for the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the U. S. National Museum, the International Exchanges, the
Bureau of Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
Physical Observatory for the year ending June 30, 1897, and balances
of former years:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
Condition of the fund July 1, 1897.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to act of Congress of August
10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added by authority of Congress,
February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson, savings from income
and other sources, to the amount of $134,831.

To this also have been added a bequest from James Hamilton, of
Pennsylvania, of $1,000; a bequest of Dr. Simeon Habel, of New York,
of $500; the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds, $51,500; a gift from
Thomas G. Hodgkins, of New York, of $200,000, and $8,000, being a
portion of the residuary legacy of Thomas G. Hodgkins, and $1,000, the
accumulated interest on the Hamilton bequest, making in all, as the
permanent fund, $912,000. .

The Institution also holds the additional sum of $42,000, received
upon the death of Thomas G. Hodgkins, in registered West Shore Rail-
road 4 per cent bonds, which were, by order of this committee, under
date of May 18, 1894, placed in the hands of the Secretary of the Iusti-
tution, to be held by him subject to the conditions of said order.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1897, each of
which bears the approval of the secretary or, in his absence, of the
acting secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bond approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have
been examined and found correct.

S, lee IGA INGE Ye,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith the Secretary’s
report, showing the operations of the Institution during the year end-
ing June 30, 1897, including the work placed under its direction by
Congress in the United States National Museum, the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoological
Park, and the Astrophysical Observatory.

Following the custom of several years, I have in the body of this
report given a general account of the affairs of the institution and its
bureaus, while the appendix presents more detailed statements by the
persons in direct charge of the different branches of the work. Inde-
pendently of this, the operations of the National Museum are fully
treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report prepared by
Acting Assistant Secretary C. D. Walcott, and the report of the work
of the Bureau of American Ethnology constitutes a volume prepared
under the supervision of Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of that
Bureau.

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents, adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 27, 1897, at 10
o’clock a. m., and not being able to complete the business before it on
that day, an adjourned meeting was held on February 1. The journal
of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto, in the annual report of
the Board to Congress, though reference is made in this report to
several matters upon which action was taken at these meetings.

The Secretary formally announced to the Board the death of Dr. G.
Brown Goode, assistant secretary of the Institution, in charge of the
National Museum, and the following resolutions were adopted by a
rising vote:

Whereas the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr.
G. Brown Goode, died on September 6, 1896:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents wish to here record their sense
of the devotion to duty which in the late Dr. Goode came before any
consideration of personal advancement, or even before the care of his
own health, and of their recognition that his high administrative ability
and wide knowledge were devoted unselfishly to the service of the Insti-
tution, with results whose value they can not too highly acknowledge;
and they desire to express their feeling of the loss that the Institution,
the National Museum, and the cause of science has sustained in his
untimely death.

Resolved, That acopy of these resolutions be suitably engrossed and
transmitted to the family of Dr. Goode.

In this connection, the Secretary brought up the matter of a succes-
sor to Dr. Goode, and stated that he had decided to ask the permission
of the Board to appoint as acting assistant secretary in charge of the
National Museum, Prof. Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United
States Geological Survey, and for more than twelve years honorary
curator in the Museum. Professor Walcott having consented to assume
the duties of the office until a permanent selection could be made, the
Secretary’s action was approved by the Board by the adoption of the
following resolution:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Prof. Charles D.
Walcott as acting assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
with duties confined to the charge of the National Museum, be approved.

The Secretary also announced the death of Mr. W. C. Winlock, assist-
ant in charge of office and curator of exchanges, and stated that he
had already appointed as his successor in that office Mr. Richard —
Rathbun. Mr. Rathbun had been for twenty years connected with
the Institution, and, for reasons which the Secretary had submitted to
the Regents, he now nominated Mr. Rathbun as Assistant Secretary in
charge of office and exchanges. The Board approved the Secretary’s
action by the adoption of the following resolution:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Mr. Richard
Rathbun as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

duties connected with the bureaus of the Institution other than the
National Museum, be approved.

ADMINISTRATION,

The present writer has been occupied during his tenure of office as
Secretary much more with administrative than with purely scientific
duties, which latter have been relegated to moments of comparative
leisure. In the pursuit of duties in the past years, as executive officer
of the Regents, he has endeavored to improve the business methods in
use in the Institution for its correspondence, its relations to its bureaus,
and in some measure for the details of its finance. It is perhaps well
to speak briefly here of the system which is followed in the expendi-
tures of the Institution, which are in the main like those of other
Government bureaus with some slight modifications as regards the
Institution’s own practice.

The Secretary is by law the custodian of the funds of the Institu-
tion, consisting at present of moneys deposited in the United States
Treasury and of certain bonds, held by the Regents through him under
the instructions of the permanent committee on the administration of
bequests and their investment, consisting of the executive commitiee
and the Secretary. ;

The Revised Statutes of the United States, section 5593, provide:

Whenever money is required for the payment of the debts or perform-
ance of the contracts of the Institution, incurred or entered into in
conformity with the provisions of this title, or for making the pur-
chases and executing the objects authorized by this title, the Board of
Regents, or the executive committee thereof, may certify to the chan-
cellor and secretary of the Board that such sum of money is required,
whereupon they shall examine the same, and, if they shall approve
thereof, shall certify the same to the proper officer of the Treasury for
payment.

In practice, the Chancellor and the Secretary of the Institution make
a written requisition upon the Secretary of the Treasury twice a year
for the semi-annual interest on the fund, and this sum is held in the
Treasury subject only to the order of the Secretary. Money is not, as
arule, kept on hand or drawn except for the payment of a specific
account, while at the same time it has been the practice of the present
Secretary, as of his predecessors, neither to receive nor pay personally
any moneys of the Institution, but to perform such transactions through
a bonded disbursing officer of the Government, who is also the account-
ant of the Institution. The Secretary, as the disbursing officer of the
Institution, never makes payments in cash, but only through checks
prepared by the accountant. The actual course of an ordinary account
is as follows:

Eivery purchase is preceded by a requisition which is approved by
the Secretary, except in certain excepted cases of expenditure of a
very minute amount. Upon this approved requisition an order is
issued by the Assistant Secretary, and when the bill is rendered it is
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

certified by the proper official and a voucher is prepared which
receives the certificate of two persons, one to the effect that the article
has been received or the services rendered, the other to the effect that
the charge is reasonable and just. The voucher is then examined by
the Secretary, and, if approved, payment is made by a check on the
United States Treasury signed by him.

The actual conduct of these transactions is through the bonded
disbursing officer above referred to. The Secretary makes it a rule
as far as possible to examine personally all the vouchers; but while
it is not always possible for him to thus examine every one or to be
personally cognizant of every item of detail, he has always the fore-
going assurance of the propriety of his signature before he affixes
it to the check, which finally concludes the monetary transaction.
These are the safeguards which the Secretary employs in regard to the
actions of subordinate officials, in whom, nevertheless, he has the fullest
personal confidence; and the Secretary’s own accounts are in turn
examined by the executive committee—a most important function,
which completes the chain of responsibility. In thus briefly describing
the business forms of the monetary transactions of the institution, it
will be understood that the integrity of the officials on whom the Sec-
retary relies has never in any instance been called in question, and he
desires to repeat this, and to acknowledge in particular the acceptable
service of the present accountant, in thus speaking of what may be
called the mechanism of this part of the administrative order.

What has preceded refers particularly to the administration of the
private funds of the Institution. In regard to the bureaus supported
by Government appropriations which are placed under the charge of
the Regents, the methods of keeping the accounts are assimilable to
those of other Government departments, the moneys being placed by
the United States Treasurer, on requisition by the Secretary, at the
disposal of a bonded disbursing officer, who prepares the vouchers,
which are then certified by the heads of the different bureaus to the
Secretary for his approval.

The methods of conducting the finances and of regulating expendi-
tures dnd payments here described have been so effective that in the
fifty years of the life of the Institution no loss has ever occurred.

With the steady growth of the several bureaus under the direction
of the Institution there come increased demands for their general
administration not only upon the Secretary but also upon his imme-
diate assistants. The clerical force of the Secretary’s office has been
chiefly supported from the income of the Institution, though a great
deal of the work pertains directly to the business of the bureaus, which
should be at the cost of Government appropriations. I have several
times called attention to this matter, and the Regents have authorized
me to request from Congress a specific appropriation for the Secretary’s
office, to be expended for necessary assistance in the administration of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

Government trusts, but it has thus far seemed inopportune to include
a request for such appropriation in my estimates to Congress.

FINANCES.

The unexpended balance at the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1,
1896, as stated in my last annual report, was $57,065.78. Interest on
the permanent fund in the Treasury and elsewhere, amounting to
$56,400, was received during the year, which, together with a sum of
$6,128.71 received from the sale of the publications and from miscel-
laneous sources, made the total receipts $62,528.71.

The disbursements for the year amounted to $58,061.99, the details
of which are given in the report of the executive committee. The bal-
ance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1897, for the
expenses of the Institution was $61,532.50, which includes the sum of
$10,000 referred to in previous reports, being $5,000 received from the
estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell, the latter a gift made personally to the Secretary to promote cer-
tain physical researches. This latter sum was, with the donor’s consent,
deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds of the
Institution.

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations, besides’
relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which may be
expected to mature as the result of various scientific investigations or
publications in progress.

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows:

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming a
part of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of the
properties of atmospheric air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the
fundamental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, ‘That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of

the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift, —
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion
of the purposes thereof. A

Under this section, 5591 of the Revised Statutes, modified as above
noted, the above fund of $912,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the
United States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest
alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

During the fiscal year 1896-97 Congress charged the Institution with
the disbursement of the following appropriations:

The executive committee has examined all the vouchers for disburse-
ments made during the fiscal year, and a detailed statement of the
receipts and expenditures will be found reported to Congress, in accord-
ance with the provisions of the sundry eivil acts of October 2, 1888, and
August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution, and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury,
were as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. : q

AVERY FUND.

In regard to the bequest of Mr. Robert Stanton Avery, referred to in
previous reports, a definite settlement has not been reached with the
heirs at law, so that it is not possible to state the exact amount that
this fund will reach.

BUILDINGS.

No important changes were made in the Smithsonian Building dur-
ing the year. Two Museum storage sheds adjacent to the building
have been removed, with a great improvement in the appearance of
the south front, while at the same time a source of danger from fire is
averted. It is still necessary to retain some workshops south of the
western portion of the building, no rooms being elsewhere available,
but it is hoped that these also will soon be removed.

I may call attention to the need of additional room for the proper
storage of such publications of the Institution and its bureaus as
must be retained in reserve. These are comparatively few in number
for each particular work, but the accumulations of fifty years occupy
in the aggregate so much space as to demand more storage room than
is now available and create a positive danger in the excessive weight
that is now placed upon the floors of upper stories, while the work of
distribution of publications is now carried on in very inconvenient and
inaccessible quarters. I have under consideration the feasibility of
some changes in the interior arrangement of the main north and south
towers of the building which would render suitable for storage pur-
poses much space which can not now be utilized.

I may also mention the very decided improvement that would result
from the remodeling of the steep and long iron stairways leading to
the great hall of the building, which is now used for archeological
collections.

The improvements in progress in the Museum by the erection of
galleries in several of the halls are alluded to elsewhere.

RESEARCH.

Although the time of the Secretary must be almost wholly given to
administrative affairs, yet, as in years past, in carrying out the wish of
the Regents ! and in continuation of investigations begun prior to my
connection with the Institution, [ have devoted such time as I could
spare to researches upon the solar spectrum and to experiments in
connection with certain physical data of aerodynamics.

Both of these investigations have reached a stage at which it is pos-
sible to give to the world somewhat full statements of results. In my

1 Resolved, That the Secretary continue his researches in physical science and pre-
sent such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in the Smithsonian
Contributions. (Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents January 26, 1847.)
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. —

remarks on the operations of the Astrophysical Observatory I discuss —
more fully the researches upon the solar spectrum.

In my report for the previous year I brought to the attention of the
Board the fact that my experiments in aerodynamics had finally
resulted in a successful trial on May 6, 1896, of a mechanism, built
chiefly of steel and driven by a steam engine, which made two flights,
each of over half a mile, and I appended a brief statement of my own
and of Mr. Alexander Graham Bell, originally communicated in French
to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France, describing the
actual flight. Since that time a third and a much longer flight was
made on November 28, 1896, with another machine, built of steel like
the first and driven like that by propellers actuated by a steam engine
of between 1 and 2 horsepower, making a horizontal flight of over
three-quarters of a mile and descending in safety.

I have thus brought to the test of actual successful experiment the
demonstration of the practicability of mechanical flight, which has been
so long debated and till lately so discredited. To satisfy a nearly uni-
versal interest, I am now engaged in the preparation of a full descrip-
tion of these experiments since 1891, when my first memoir on aerody-
namies was published. This memoir, with those on “ Experiments in
Aerodynamics” and ‘“ Internal Work of the Wind,” will form volume 27
of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, which will thus con-
tain a complete record of all experiments carried on thus far under ny
direction upon this subject.

HODGKINS FUND.

The Hodgkins medals of award were received at the Institution on
the 13th of July, 1896, and were transmitted on the same day to those
competitors for the Hodgkins fund prizes who were recommended by
the committee to receive medals. <A replica of the medal was sent to
each of the members of the Hodgkins advisory committee and to cer-
tain specialists who, without compensation, had rendered valuable aid
in connection with the competition. A replica was also sent to the
firm of Evarts, Choate & Beaman, the legal counsel of Mr. Hodgkins,
and to Dr. Chambers, his medical adviser and long-time friend, as a
memento of valued services rendered in connection with the Hodgkins
bequest to the Institution.

In July, 1896, Mr. E. C. C. Baly, of University College, London, a
Hodgkins competitor, whose memoir received honorable mention, was
awarded a grant of $750 to enable him to prosecute further his inves-
tigations on the decomposition of the atmosphere by means of the
passage of the electric spark. A report of the research, so far as it
has progressed, has been received from Mr. Baly.

Under an additional grant to Dr. 8S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. John 8.
Billings investigations have been conducted in the Laboratory of
Hygiene of the University of Pennsylvania, upon the effect which a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. w)

prolonged exposure to vitiated air has upon the power of individuals to
resist infectious diseases. Dr. D. H. Bergey, who conducted the experi-
ments, reports that he subjected certain animals to an impure atmos-
phere and found that while it apparently lowered their vitality, he was
unable to attenuate the fluids used for inoculating the diseases so that
they would kill such a weakened animal while not affecting a vigorous
one. Still, animals inoculated for tuberculosis died much earlier when
exposed to impure air. As these results may doubtless be applied to all
warm-blooded animals, including man, it would appear that we have
here an important confirmation of the clinical observation that tuber-
culosis thrives most in vitiated air.

January 15, 1897, a grant of $500 was made to Mr. A. Lawrence
Rotch, director of the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory at Read-
ville, Mass., to be used in securing automatic kite records of meteoro-
logical conditions at an altitude of 10,000 feet or more. An additional
grant of $400 was later made to Mr. Rotch for continuing his experi-
ments in connection with the explorations of the upper air.

With a view to being prepared to apply most advantageously the
accruing interest from that portion of the fund devoted to investiga-
tions connected with the atmosphere the Secretary has conferred, dur-
ing the year, with specialists in this country and Europe, upon the
subject of researches suitable to be aided from the Hodgkins fund.

The six Hodgkins memoirs which have been published by the Insti-
tution were issued in February and March, 1897, and a copy of each
was sent to all persons who had submitted papers in connection with
the competition.

NAPLES TABLE.

As stated in my last report, the Institution has renewed the lease of
the Smithsonian table at the Zoological Station of Naples for a second
term of three years, this action being in accordance with the urgent
solicitation of the faculties of several colleges and universities and of
many of the leading biologists of the country.

At my earnest request Dr. Billings has continued as chairman of the
advisory committee, which has rendered most efficient aid in examining
testimonials and in recommending action with regard to applications
for the occupancy of the table. The following applications have been
favorably acted upon:

Dr. F. H. Herrick, professor of biology at Adelbert College, Cleveland,
occupied the table in November, 1896, and Dr. 8. E. Meek, formerly of
the Arkansas Industrial University but more recently connected with
the United States Fish Commission, received the appointment for two
months in the spring of 1897. The application of Dr. H.S. Jennings,
of the University of Michigan and later of Harvard, was approved for
three months during the spring and summer of 1897. Through the
continued courtesy of Dr. Dohrn, in permitting two persons nominated
by the Institution to occupy tables at the same time, the residence of
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. Jennings began before the termination of Dr. Meek’s appointment.
Applications for the coming year are now under consideration.

EXPLORATIONS.

Ethnological and natural-history explorations have been continued
under the direction or with the assistance of the Institution in various
parts of the world by the Bureau of Ethnology and the National
Museum. This work is more fully described elsewhere, but I may men-
tion here that a large number of objects of interest from various parts
of the world have been added to the Museum collections, and much
valuable information has been acquired regarding the history and the
language of the American Indians. Among the explorations of the year
were those by Dr. William L. Abbott in Siam, Prof. O. F. Cook in
Africa, Dr. E. A. Mearns in Minnesota and elsewhere, Mr. Frank H.
Cushing in Maine, Mr. J. W. Fewkes in Arizona, Mr. H. T. Perkins in
Idaho, Mr. W J McGee in Iowa, Mr. J. B. Hatcher in Patagonia and
Tierra del Fuego, and Dr. Willis E. Everette in Oregon, British Columbia
and Mexico.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Institution and its bureaus during the year
comprised two works in quarto form, four in royal octavo, and fourteen
in octavo, aggregating 9,630 pages, covering to a greater or less degree
nearly all branches of human knowledge.

The Smithsonian Institution proper issues three series of works:
The Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and
the Annual Report. By the bureaus of the Institution there are
issued the Annual Report and the Bulletin of the Bureau of American
Ethnology and the Proceedings and Bulletin of the National Museum,
and the Secretary transmits to Congress the Annual Report of the
American Historical Association. The Smithsonian Contributions and
Miscellaneous Collections are printed at the expense of the Institution
and the other publications from Congressional appropriations.

Contributions to Knowledge-—Two memoirs of this series were issued
during the year, both having been submitted in competition for the
Hodgkins fund prizes.

The memoir by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay describes the
discovery of argon, for which achievement the authors were awarded
the first Hodgkins prize of $10,000. It gives an account of the reasons
which led the investigators to suspect the existence of a new element
in the atmosphere and a detailed description of the apparatus and
methods by which the presence of this hitherto unknown gas was |
detinitely established. The importance of the discovery was recog-
nized independently by the Institute of France, which awarded a prize
of 50,000 frances, and by the National Academy of Sciences, which
granted to the discoverers the Barnard medal.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

The memoir by Prof. E. Duclaux, of Paris, entitled Atmospheric
Actinometry and the Actinic Constitution of the Atmosphere, describes
the methods and results of numerous experiments on the chemical
rays of the sun by the exposure of oxalic acid to their action. Pro-
fessor Duclaux found that the chemical action of the rays when the
sky was overcast was much less than on a fine day and that with light
cumulus clouds the combustion might be more active than with a clear
blue sky or slight cirrus, so that it appeared evident that the chemical
activity and hygienic power of the sun’s rays are not related to the
apparent fineness of the day.

Miscellaneous Collections.—Nine papers of the “ Miscellaneous” series
were issued and others are in progress. The completed works were
Smithsonian Physical Tables, by Prof. Thomas Gray; Equipment and

The Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, by Dr. H. Car-
rington Bolton, mentioned in my last report, is in type and will soon
be published. It comprises the titles of more than 8,500 scientific and
technical periodicals in all languages, adding 3,500 titles to the first
edition published in 1885.

There is also completed, ready for the printer, a voluminous supple-
ment to Dr. Bolton’s Select Bibliography of Chemistry.

As a special work, there has been printed the International Exchange
List of the Smithsonian Institution, being a list of the foreign corre-
spondents, aggregating 9,414 learned societies, museums, universities,
ete., with which American publications are exchanged.

Annual reports.—The Smithsonian Annual Report is in two volumes,
one of which is devoted to the work of the National Museum. In the
general appendix of Part I are included memoirs on all branches of
knowledge, selected chiefly from publications of learned societies of the
world that are not readily accessible to the public, the basis of selec-
tion being that the papers are written by a competent person, give an
account of some important or at least interesting scientific discovery,
are untechnical in language and suitable to nonprofessional readers.

The History of the First Half Century of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, outlined with some detail in my last report, is now printed and
will soon be issued. The Institution was founded August 10, 1846, by
act of Congress approved by President Polk, and it seemed an appro-
priate memorial of the completion of its first fifty years to publish a
volume which should give an account of its origin and history, its
achievements, and its present condition.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The editorial supervision of the volume was undertaken by the late
Dr. G. Brown Goode, and to his thorough acquaintance with the his-
tory of the Institution, and his skill and critical knowledge, the com-
prehensive plan of the work is entirely due. At the time of his death,
in September, 1896, the manuscript was sufficiently advanced to per-
mit of its completion on his general plan.

The volume is royal octavo of 866 pages, with a preface by William
McKinley, President of the United States, ex-officio the head of the
establishment. It is illustrated by full-page portraits of James Smith-
son, the Chancellors, several of the Regents, the three Secretaries, and
of Assistant Secretary Goode, besides illustrations of the Smithsonian
building and of the infra-red spectrum investigations by the present
Secretary. The main divisions of the work are fifteen chapters, descrip-
tive of the history of the Institution, and a like number of chapters
giving appreciations of its work in the several branches of knowledge,
mainly by persons not connected with the Institution, followed by an
appendix of 8 pages narrating the principal events in its history.

Since it is impossible in a single volume to exhaust the subject, it
became necessary to mention but briefly many topics which it was
hoped might be elaborately treated. The book is printed from type in
an edition of 2,000, with 250 additional copies on handmade paper. It
is not classed in either of the regular series of Smithsonian publica-
tions, and will receive a special rather than a general distribution.
This course is found necessary by reason of the cost of the work.

The Annual Report of the Museum for 1894, which includes several
special papers by Museum officers or collaborators, has been issued,
and the Museum has published a volume of Proceedings, and separate
papers of other volumes, besides two octavo and two quarto bulletins,
the contents of all of which are given elsewhere.

The Bureau of Ethnology has published three reports, the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth, bringing the work down to the close of the
fiscal year 1894-95,

The Annual Report of. the American Historical Association for 1895
has been published, and the report for 1896 has been sent to the printer.
These reports are transmitted by the secretary of the association to the
Secretary of the Institution, who submits the whole or portions of the
reports to Congress, in accordance with the act of incorporation of
the association. Prior to the report for 1894 the Institution had no
Share in the distribution of these volumes, but, beginning with the
report for 1894, a limited number is available for purposes of exchange
by the Institution with historical and other learned societies of the
world. The reports contain papers relating to American history or
to the study of history in America. A most important contribution
in the report for 1895 is a bibliography of the historical societies of the
United States and British America, covering 561 printed pages, which
is a very useful reference work for writers and students of American
history.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

LIBRARY.

The library continues to grow steadily, the accessions in volumes,
parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts reaching 35,912 during the
past year. Special mention should be made of the gift of Mr. S.
Patcanof, of St. Petersburg, of over 300 volumes, consisting mostly
of oriental works and including some Arabic manuscripts and many
rare Armenian publications.

As stated in my last report, the Secretary of State had named, in
accordance with my suggestion, Dr. John S. Billings, United States
Army, retired, director of the New York Public Library, and Prof.
Simon Newcomb, United States Navy, Superintendent of the Nautical
Almanac, as the delegates of the United States to a conference to be
held at the instance of the British Government at London in July, 1896,
to consider the preparation of an international catalogue of scientific
literature. This conference met July 14 to 17, 1896, twenty-two coun-
tries being represented. The conference drew up a plan which the
respective delegates submitted to the countries they represented. The
report of Professor Newcomb and Doctor Billings, submitted to the Sec-
retary of State October 15, 1896, recommended that the United States
Government should take part in this work, and that the Smithsonian
Institution be made the agent of the Government in this important
scientific enterprise.

In accordance with this suggestion the Secretary of State invited my
opinion as to the propriety and feasibility of the United States taking
part in this work through the Smithsonian Institution, and requested an
estimate of the probable expense attendant thereto. ‘To this I replied
that I fully concurred in the view of the delegates as to the great
importance of a successful execution of the conclusions of the confer-
ence and as to the propriety of this Government taking its share of the
proposed work by providing for the cataloguing of the scientific publi-
cations of the United States. This opinion is strengthened by the fact
that the recommendations made are due to results emanating from an
international conference, at which the United States was officially rep-
resented, and by the further considerations that the benefits to be
derived from this undertaking are not only great and far-reaching for
the scientific progress of America, but also of universal value, and that
all the great and many of the smaller nations will take part in the work.
I recognized also the propriety of the suggestion that the Government
should employ the Smithsonian Institution as an agent in this matter,
particularly since the Institution first suggested this subject in 1855,
and since it has been from its earliest organization interested in scien-
tific bibliography.

I was, however, reluctant to commit the Institution to the appear-
ance of soliciting Congress in this matter in any case, or to the under-
taking of the enterprise, however worthy, unless provision could be
made for the necessary expenses of the work. After considering the
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

subject, it seemed to me that the work, if assigned to the Smithsonian
Institution, would require a person of special qualifications to imme-
diately assist the Secretary, together with a number of trained clerical
assistants, and that the salaries for these persons and the expenses
incident to the work would require an appropriation of not less than
$10,000 per annum.

In accordance with this recommendation, Secretary Olney trans-
mitted this correspondence to Congress. Although the catalogue
will not begin until 1900, much preliminary work will be necessary. I
have accordingly brought the matter to the attention of Secretary
Sherman, and the Department of State has agreed to submit an item
for this purpose in its regular estimates for the year 1898-99.

Although the new building for the Library of Congress was completed
in February, 1897, its occupancy had not begun at the close of the fiscal
year. The east stack was provisionally assigned for the Smithsonian
collection of transactions. In the past only this portion of the Smith-
sonian Library has been kept together, the remainder of the collection
being distributed throughout the Library of Congress. I trust that in
the new building, with its ample space and largely inereased force, it
will be found possible, in accordance with the resolution of the Regents
in 1889,' to assemble the entire collection in one place.

CORRESPONDENCE.

In 1855 (February 24) the Board of Regents adopted the following
resolution :

Resolved, That all correspondence of this Institution with any person
or society shall be conducted by the Secretary, and no assistant or
employee shall write or receive any official letter or communication
pertaining to the affairs of the Institution except under the authority
and by the direction of the Secretary; and all such correspondence
shall be duly registered and recorded in such manner as the Secretary
shall direct.

The Secretary has given much care to organizing a system of corre-
spondence which would insure that letters should receive prompt
replies, and that a record of receipt, subject, and date of reply shall be
kept in such a form as to be readily accessible. The system in ques-
tion was fully described in my report for 1890, and its adoption has
proved of the greatest convenience during the seven years it has been
in operation.

The correspondence has greatly increased during the past few years,

‘Resolved, That since the Smithsonian deposit now numbers over 250,000 titles,
and is still increasing at the cost of the Institution, it is, in the opinion of the
Regents, desirable that in the new building for the Library of Congress sufficient
provision shall be made for its accommodation and increase in a distinct hall or
halls, worthy of the collections, and such as, while recalling to the visitor the name
of Smithson, shall provide such facilities for those consulting the volumes as will
aid in his large purpose of the diffusion of knowledge among men.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. pe 8)

both in regard to such letters as directly concern the Institution proper
and also the mass of correspondence which, though pertaining more
particularly to the Museum and other bureaus, must nevertheless
receive the attention of the Secretary’s office.

A very unusual number of letters has been received from all parts of
the country seeking information both on scientific matters and on
political, economic, historical, and other questions in almost every
branch of knowledge. Many correspondents have the impression that
the Institution is a bureau of general information, and in dealing with
this class the policy has been to courteously answer all queries legiti-
mately within the range of the Institution, in other cases referring
inquirers to possible sources of information.

Of the more important correspondence of the Secretary’s office, 3,834
entries were made in the registry book of letters received, while many
times that number were received and referred to the different bureaus
of the Institution.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Nashville Hxposition.—The Institution participated in the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition at Nashville during the summer of 1897, under
act of Congress making appropriation for a General Government exhibit.
Accounts of the exhibit will be given after the close of the exposition.

Glover Collection.—A very valuable and interesting collection of
Chinese coins, bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution by the late Mr.
George B. Glover, of the Chinese Imperial maritime customs service,
has been received from the estate. It is believed that this collection is
the most perfect of its kind in existence. Jt includes 2,025 specimens
of Chinese, Annamese, Siamese, Japanese, and Korean coins; amulets
and bamboo tally sticks used as money; Chinese paper money; foreign
coins in circulation in China; and molds for casting coins. The series
dates back to about the year 770 B. C., the earliest authentic period of
coinage. The peculiarly shaped bronze pieces, representing knives,
cloth, and other objects used as money are fully represented, and the
Series is continuous in the coinage of each dynasty for more than 2,600
years.

Catalogue of Egyptian papyri and royal antiquities.—In April, 1896,
the Egyptian minister of foreign affairs addressed a communication to
the representatives of all foreign Governments at Cairo, pointing out
the desirability of a complete catalogue of Egyptian papyri and royal
antiquities, and inviting the cooperation of the various Governments in
securing the information needed for such a work, the editing and pub-
lication to be undertaken by the administration of antiquities of Egypt.

The consul-general of the United States informed the Egyptian Gov-
ernment that the hearty cooperation of the United States could be
relied upon, and, in his dispatch to the Department of State, suggested
that the Smithsonian Institution might be willing to collect the desired
information, °
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The communications on the subject being referred to the Institution
by the Department of State, I informed the Department that the Insti-
tution would undertake the task of collecting this information, though
I stated at the same time that the ultimate success would depend on —
the willingness which museums and private individuals exhibited in
cooperating.

I have entered into communication with the custodians of all collec-
tions known to me, and have thus far received some useful information.

At the request of Dr. D. C. Gilman, president of the American Ori-
ental Society, a communication on the subject was presented to the
society at its meeting in April, 1897, and the society appointed a com-
mittee of five to cooperate with the Institution in securing the desired
information.

Congress of Orientalists—On April 27, 1897, Dr. Paul Haupt, of
Johns Hopkins University, was appointed to represent the Smithsonian
Institution at the Congress of Orientalists at Paris in September of
this year.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The most notable occurrence of the year affecting the National
Museum was the death of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the assistant secretary
in its charge, which occurred on September 6, 1896. I alluded briefly
to this sad event in my last report, which had not gone to press at the
time of Dr. Goode’s death.

When 22 years of age Dr. Goode became associated with the Smith-
sonian Institution, and soon afterwards was designated by Professor
Baird to prepare the Government natural history exhibit for the Cen-
tennial Exhibition of 1876. This work involved severe labor, and
almost unaided he unpacked and assorted the large accumulations of
material which had been stored away in the basements of the Smith-
sonian building. His work was entirely satisfactory, but the strain to
which he was subjected in accomplishing it told severely on his strength,
and it became necessary for him to go to Bermuda to regain his health.
In 1881 the National Museum building was completed and Dr. Goode
was appointed assistant director. In 1887 he was appointed assistant
secretary of the Institution in charge of the National Museum, which
position he held at the time of his death.

There are many sides from which to view the character and work of
this remarkable man. His talents and the careful scientific training
which he had received, gave him a very prominent place as a zoologist,
but as a museum administrator he was perhaps skilled above all
others. Personally I had absolute confidence in him, and the relations
which obtained between us were those of the most intimate trust,
while those which in turn existed between him and his subordinates
were of the most fortunate kind.

I have in a special memoir spoken at some length of Dr. Goode’s life
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

and work. On February 13, 1897, a meeting to commemorate his life
and services was held in the lecture hall of the Museum. <A_ full
account of that meeting will be found in the Museum volume of the
Smithsonian Report.

After extended consideration of the needs of the Museum and the
special qualifications of several persons who had been suggested as
capable of filling the position rendered vacant by Dr. Goode’s death, I
signified to Mr. Charles D. Walcott my desire that, with the approval
of the Regents, he should take charge of the Museum, and I was glad
to learn that, notwithstanding his arduous duties as Director of the
United States Geological Survey, he felt willing to put provisionally
at the service of the Institution his known scientific and executive
qualifications, together with those which a long previous connection
with the Museum rendered doubly acceptable.

His appointment by me as acting assistant secretary in charge of the
National Museum was ratified by the Board of Regents at its meeting
on January 27, 1897.

Although comparatively little effort was made during the year to
obtain specimens for the Museum, the accessions were 168 more than
those of the previous year, representing a-total increase of nearly 40,000
specimens over the receipts during 1896. The number of specimens of
all kinds now recorded is 3,720,237.

In my estimates for 1897 I asked Congress to appropriate $180,000
for the preservation of the collections in the Museum. It is regrettable
that only $153,225 were allowed for this purpose. As the collections
in the Museum increase, it is imperative that a reasonable increase
should be made in the funds devoted to their preservation and elabora-
tion, and I most earnestly hope that the full amount which I have
estimated to be necessary for the operations of the next fiscal year will
be appropriated by Congress.

It is gratifying to record that, in accordance with my recommenda-
tion, the sum of $8,000 was allowed by Congress for the erection of
galleries in the Museum building. They will materially add to the area
available for exhibition purposes. By a fortunate circumstance the
appropriation for the galleries became available at a time when the cost
of ironwork of all kinds was unusually low, and at the time of writing
this report four galleries are in process of construction. The desire of
Congress to relieve the congested conditions which have so long existed
in the Museum has been further manifested by an additional allowance
of $8,000 in the Museum appropriations for 1898.

When the galleries are ready for the reception of fittings and furni-
ture, there will arise the necessity for the expenditure of a considerable
sum of money for this purpose. Congress has allowed $15,000 to be
thus expended during the coming fiscal year.

It seems proper to remark that while the galleries which can be
erected with this amount ($16,000) will be of very great benefit, the need

sm 97 2

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of another building is not in any degree lessened, since the additional
space obtained will be necessary to relieve the overcrowded condition
of the floors, which has given the exhibition halls almost the appearance
of storerooms.

The proper expansion of the various series now exhibited, and the
addition of others from the abundant materials already in the posses-
sion of the Museum, can not have effect within the present walls. For
these purposes, and for the increase which succeeding years may confi-
dently be expected to bring, a new building is necessary. The national
collections, as a whole, greatly surpass in value and extent those of any
other museum in the United States, but they are at the present time
by no means so well provided for as the collections assembled in some
of the larger cities of the country.

For reasons explained at length in a previous report, it was deetied
very desirable to remove the sheds adjoining the Smithsonian building
on the south. The sum of $2,500 was allowed, and the objectionable
sheds will be removed at once.

In my estimates for 1897 I explained the need of a larger allotment
for printing the Proceedings and Bulletins of the Museum. The amount
asked for was $18,000, but oly $12,000 was allowed. I repeated the
expression of my desire that $18,000 be allowed for 1898, but again
only $12,000 was allotted. I feel, therefore, it is my duty to state that
the sum provided has proved entirely inadequate.

The complete manuscript of an important and comprehensive work
by the late Professor Cope on the reptiles of North America, based on
the Museum collections, is necessarily withheld from the printer for
want of funds for its publication, and at least four others, equally valu-
able and extensive, are in an advanced stage of preparation. Delayin
the publication of these works will prove a hindrance to the progress
of American natural history.

It has long been my wish to distribute the publications of the Museum
not only to Government depositories but also to all public libraries,
colleges, scientific schools, and scientific and technical societies in this
country, as well as to the principal centers of learning throughout the
world. After this has been done, there should still remain a surplus
for distribution among investigators and teachers who really need the
books in connection with their professional work. By such an extended
distribution the Museum would greatly widen the scope of its useful-
ness, and would also be able to obtain in exchange a large number of
books and pamphlets for its own working library. It often happens,
too, that arrangements can be made to exchange the Duly avons of the
Museum for desirable specimens. .

In the estimates for 1898-99 I have inserted an item for $17,000 for
printing and binding. It is my wish to use $15,000 for printing and
$2,000 for binding serials into volumes. Many books in-constant use
in the Museum library are in urgent need of permanent binding in
order to prevent their destruction, Several series already partially
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

bound should be completed, and thus rendered easier of access for pur-
poses of reference. The amount above stated is the lowest sum which
will produce the desired result, and I therefore very much hope that
Congress will not diminish it.

In my last report I alluded to the death of Mr. William C. Winlock,
which occurred on September 20, 1896. In addition to his duties as
curator of exchanges, he held the position of honorary curator of phys-
ical apparatus in the National Museum.

Maj. Charles Bendire, United States Army (retired), honorary curator
of the department of birds’ eggs in the National Museum, died at Jack-
sonville, Fla., on February 4, 1897.

Major Bendire was a native of Germany. He served in the United
States Army and was brevetted major for bravery in action against the
Indians at Canyon Creek, Montana, in 1877. In 1886 he was retired for
disabilities incurred in the line of service. During his residence in the
West he became interested in ornithology through correspondence with
Professor Baird. He made extensive collections of birds’ eggs, which
he afterwards presented to the National Museum. After leaving the
. Army he devoted a large amount of time to scientific investigation,
and had recently published in the series of Special Bulletins of the
National Museum an important work entitled Life Histories of North
American Birds, consisting of two large quarto volumes, handsomely
illustrated.

In obedience to the provisions of the act of Congress directing that
the Institution and its dependencies should participate in the Tennes-
see Centennial Exposition, which opened on May 1, 1897, special exhibits
have been prepared. Dr. Frederick W. True was appointed represen-
tative of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on the
Government board of management, and Mr. W. V. Cox was designated
special agent in charge of the exhibit, and later was appointed secre-
tary of the board.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The researches relating to the American Indians, conducted under
the Smithsonian Institution by authority of law, have been continued
by Maj. J. W. Powell, the director of the Bureau, assisted by Mr. W J
McGee as ethnologist in charge, Mr. F. W. Hodge acting as chief clerk,
and several other scientific collaborators. The field operations have
been extended into a large number of States and Territories, and inci-
dentally into those districts of neighboring countries occupied by
native tribes closely affiliated with the aborigines of the territory now
comprised in the United States. The examinations and surveys in
field and office have been conducted with the view of obtaining for
publication definite information concerning the arts and industries, the
institutions and languages, and the beliefs of the natives. .
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

During the year special attention has been given to the classification —
of the tribes in such manner as to indicate their origin and develop-
ment, and to this end the rich archives of the Bureau, comprising the
accumulations of eighteen years of research, have been subjected to
careful study, and important conclusions have been reached.

The work of exploration within the United States was limited to
Arizona and New Mexico, where extensive surveys and excavations
were made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes with most gratifying results. He
was able to obtain the richest collection of prehistoric pottery and
associated industrial products thus far made. This noteworthy collec-
tion has been installed in the National Museum, and special reports
relating to it are in preparation. Other collections made in the South-
west include a highly interesting series of ceremonial masks used by
the shamans in the pueblos of Zuni and Sia; these also are installed in
the Museum, and will be discussed in forthcoming reports. A collec-
tion of prehistoric ware from the mounds of the Mississippi Valley was
acquired, and a smaller one of typical character was obtained from
Ohio, while a small collection of special value in comparative study
was obtained through the collaboration of an agent in Patagonia.

The investigation of the rich collection of prehistoric material
obtained in Florida has been continued, and has yielded interesting
results. Comparative studies have also been made of the stone imple-
ments used by the Seri Indians of Tiburon Island, and those of various
other tribes.

The work relating to the social organization prevailing among the
native tribes has been carried forward successfully, certain points
hitherto obscure having been cleared up during the year.

The researches in linguistics have gone forward steadily. Progress
has been made in the preparation of the comparative dictionary of the
Algonquian dialects and in the collection of new material to be incor-
porated therein, and a systematic study has been made of the Iroquoian
languages.

The study of decoration has been continued with renewed activity
with the accession of the rich collections from Arizona, New Mexico,
and Florida, while substantial progress has been made also in the
researches concerning the aboriginal systems of mythology and their
bearing on the industrial and social development of the tribesmen.

The publication of reports, which had fallen somewhat in arrears, has
been brought up, and three reports, forming four large volumes, have
been published and distributed during the year. The demand for these
has been unprecedented.

An exhibit arranged for display in the Government building at the
Tennessee Centennial Exposition included a representation of a Kiowa
camp-circle, and a report on the Kiowa Indians explaining the social
features illustrated by the exhibit is now in preparation for the press.

Further details concerning the operations of the bureau may be
found in Director Powell’s report, forming Appendix II.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. OAL

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service was inaugurated in 1849, when
Volume I of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge was distrib-
uted to 173 foreign institutions, and within a few years it became the
medium for the exchange of publications between the principal scien-
tific institutions of the world. The functions of this Service being “the
diffusion of knowledge” are in direct accord with one of the fundamental
objects for which the Smithsonian Institution was endowed, and ‘the
fact that exchanges are now made with 28,000 correspondents in every
part of the civilized world demonstrates to some degree the far-reach-
ing influence of the Institution. The weight of matter handled by the
Service during the past fiscal year was 247,444 pounds, comprising
81,162 packages of publications. From 1886 to 1895 there were received
from foreign Governments and institutions 344,078 books or pamphlets,
and 601,637 books or pamphlets were shipped abroad.

The entire cost of international exchanges prior to 1881 was borne by
the Smithsonian Institution, but for the last fifteen years appropria-
tions have been made by Congress. The first grant, in 1881, was $3,000,
and for the past year it was $19,000. The exchange of Government
documents is a most important part of the service, and I may repeat
the statement made in several previous reports that for the contin-
uation of such exchanges the Smithsonian Institution has annually
advanced varying amounts in excess of the Congressional appro-
priations, so that the aggregate amount advanced from the private
funds of the Institution since the Government has appropriated money
for international exchanges is about $46,000.

The service now provides for the distribution of the United States
Government publications to foreign libraries, and also for the distribu-
tion of books, pamphlets, and other printed matter sent as exchanges
or donations from literary and scientific societies or individuals to cor-
respondents abroad, without expense to senders beyond delivery at
the Smithsonian Institution. Publications are received at the several
foreign agencies of the Institution and forwarded to Washington for
record and are distributed under the Smithsonian frank, the entire
service being conducted under a careful system of registration which
well nigh precludes possibility of loss. Purchased books, apparatus
and instruments, are not received for transmission through the service,
which is exclusively limited to donations or exchanges.

Through the long-extended courtesies from several ocean transpor-
tation companies, permitting the free transmission of exchange pack-
ages, it has been feasible to carry on the work in a very much more
comprehensive manner than would otherwise have been possible with
the resources available.

I may mention that exchanges with Mexico and Japan, which were
temporarily interrupted at the time of my last report, have been
renewed. Hxchanges with Turkey, Greece, and Cuba, have necessarily
D2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been entirely suspended, although there is near prospect of renewed
communications with the former country.

The international exchange of official documents has aggregated
10,694 parcels received from foreign countries for various Departments
of the United States Government, and 30,008 packages have been
received from United States Government Departments and shipped
abroad.

This branch of the service is naturally of most importance to the
Government, the foreign receipts having resulted in building up a very
complete collection of publications of the various governments of the
world.

The total amount available for use of the service during the year
was $22,334.33, which included the Congressional appropriation of
$19,000 and $3,334.53 received from various Executive Departments
for transmission of their outgoing and incoming exchanges.

The slight increase in the annual appropriation granted by Congress
during the past year for improving the facilities for the transportation
of exchanges has permitted an improvement in the promptness of
dispatch by the payment of ocean freight on a portion of the ex-
changes, which have been forwarded by some of the faster steamers
instead of necessarily delaying shipments until opportunity permitted
free transmission by later vessels. This slight improvement has bene-
fited the service to such an extent that it is hoped Congress will
realize the benefits derived from expenditures of this character, and
in future will appropriate sufficient means to enable all exchanges to
be forwarded to their destination without interruption. A great deal
of matter forwarded through the International Exchanges is most val-
uable at the time of publication, and there should be no impediment
to prompt delivery.

The number of correspondents at present on the records of the
exchange service is 28,008, of which 21,427 are foreign—an increase of
2,527 over last year—and 6,581 are domestic, being an increase over
1896 of 567.

Appended to my report for the year ended June 30, 1895, was a map
of the world showing the relative extent of the exchange service.
Since that time the far-reaching influence of the service has added so
many correspondents, and so many more remote countries have been
reached, that the preparation of a new map to more nearly represent
the number of correspondents in each country will soon be necessary.

THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

I have always been of the opinion that the collection of living ani-
mals is a legitimate method of furthering the objects for which the
Smithsonian Institution was established. It was inevitable that sooner
or later an intelligent interest in such collections should be awakened
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. es

in this country, and some small collections have, in fact, for many years
existed; but I believe that the Regents of the Institution were the
first to consider the national importance of the preservation of the great
American fauna, and with that object in view to recognize the need of
establishing a preserve for their care and maintenance like the National
Zoological Park, action in this matter being all the more imperative in
view of the imminence of the extermination of many species of American
animals, particularly the bison of our Great Plains.

It gives me pleasure to state that this interest in living animals has
during the last few years greatly increased in this country, as is shown
by the many new collections that have been established and the fact that
still others are projected. A number of private individuals have under-
taken the preservation of animals, paying particular attention to those
likely to become extinct or that are best adapted to be kept on a range
or in a forest. Ican not but feel that the example of the National
Zoological Park has been of some value in stimulating such enterprises,
and that, though as yet comparatively incomplete, it has tended to
develop an interest in our native animals and in their proper protection
and preservation.

As instances of what has been done in this way may be mentioned
the large forest park of the late Mr. Austin Corbin, the game pre-
serves that have been established in various parts of the country, and
the extensive zoological collections planned for the city of Pittsburg,
Pa., and for the New York Zoological Society near New York City.
Details with regard to some of these parks are given in the appendix.

Attention is called here to these enterprises because it seems desira-
able that an institution of this kind, placed at the seat of Government
and under its control and direction, should be representative in char-
acter and not fall below the average of such collections, either at home
or abroad.

It should be noted in this connection that most cities of the size of
Washington are well provided with public parks possessing improve-
ments in the way of roads, walks, bridges, buildings for public comfort,
lawns, and plantations far in excess of what is possible under the
present circumstances in the National Zoological Park. A moderate
estimate, made by experienced landscape gardeners, places the cost of
such desirable improvements at $3,000 per acre at least. Yet all that
is here allowed for these purposes is the small sum that can be reserved
after properly caring for the animals and erecting such structures as
are required for their needs. Whiiein most establishments of this kind
the municipal authorities defray from a separate fund all the expenses
of preparing the grounds and buildings and properly policing and main-
taining the same, here all must be paid from a general sum that is
not more than sufficient to merely maintain the animals in a proper
condition. ;

The buildings and inclosures now existing are plainly inadequate.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

One of the most important needs is the establishment of suitable houses
for the preservation and care of birds. There should be a large build-
‘ing that could be heated in winter, and in addition a spacious flying
cage similar to that used in the Golden Gate Park, in San Francisco,
in which large numbers of our native birds could be harbored and fed.
This would enable the park to extend its scope to the species of native
birds now threatened with extinction. The passenger pigeon, once
found in astonishing numbers throughout the Northern United States,
has nearly disappeared because of the slaughter of the species by
man,! and the Carolina parrakeet, a bird of most beautiful plumage, is
already becoming scarce. At present it is impossible to take advantage
of numerous opportunities of obtaining specimens of birds, as they
can not be properly cared for within the park. Other buildings urgently

1The following extract from Audubon’s Birds of America may be of interest:

“The multitudes of wild pigeons in our woods are astonishing. Indeed, after hay-
ing viewed them so often and under so many circumstances, I even now feel inclined
to pause and assure myself that what I am going to relate is fact. Yet I have seen it
all, and that, too, in the company of persons who, like myself, were struck with
amazement.

“Tn the autumn of 1813 I left my house at Henderson, on the banks of the Ohio,
on my way to Louisville. In passing over the barrens a few miles beyond Hardens-
burg, I observed the pigeons flying from northeast to southwest in greater numbers
than I thought I had ever seen them before, and feeling an inclination to count the
flocks that might pass within the reach of my eye in one hour, I dismounted, seated
myself on an eminence, and began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for
every flock that passed. In a short time, finding the task which I had undertaken
impracticable, as the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose, and, counting
the dots then put down, found that 163 had been made in twenty-one minutes. I
traveled on, and still met more the farther I proceeded. The air was literally filled
with pigeons; the light of noonday was obscured as by an eclipse; the dung fell in
spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow, and the continued buzz of wings had a
tendency to lull my senses to repose.

“Whilst waiting for dinner at Young’s-Inn, at the confluence of Salt River with
the Ohio, I saw, at my leisure, immense legions still going by, with a frontreaching
far beyond the Ohio on the west and the beech-wood forests directly on the east of
me. Nota single bird alighted, for not a nut or acorn was that year to be seen in
the neighborhood, They consequently flew so high that different trials to reach them
with a capital rifle proved ineffectual, nor did the reports disturb them in the least.
I can not describe to you the extreme beauty of their aerial evolutions when a hawk
chanced to press upon the rear of a flock. At once, like a torrent, and with a noise
like thunder, they rushed into a compact mass, pressing upon each other toward the
center. In these almost solid masses they darted forward in undulating and angu-
lar lines, descended and swept close over the earth with inconceivable velocity,
mounted perpendicularly, so as to resemble a vast column, and, when high, were
seen wheeling and twisting within their continued lines, which then resembled the
coils of a gigantic serpent.

“Before sunset I reached Louisville, distant from Hardensburg 55 miles. The
pigeons were still passing in undiminished numbers, and continued to do so for tiree
days in succession. The people were all in arms. The banks of the Ohio were
crowded with men and boys incessantly shooting at the pilgrims, which there flew
lower as they passed the river. Multitudes were thus destroyed. For a week or

more the population fed on no other flesh than that of pigeons and talked of nothing
but pigeons.” 5;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

needed are a new elephant house, in place of the hastily constructed
temporary shelter now used, and a reptile house.

Many most interesting and at the same time inexpensive features,
such as a vivarium for small animals, a small house and a runway for
pheasants, and ponds for aquatic birds and mammals, are necessarily
deferred for want of the funds required for their installation.

The appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, was in the
following terms:

National Zoological Park: For continuing the construction of roads,
walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage and drainage, and for grading,
planting, and otherwise improving the grounds; erecting and repairing
buildings and inclosures, care, subsistence, transportation of animals,
including salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, and gen-
eral incidental expenses not otherwise provided for, sixty-seven thousand
dollars; one-half of which sum shall be paid trom the revenues of the
District of Columbia and the other half from the Treasury of the United
States; and of the sum hereby appropriated, five thousand dollars
shall be used for continuing the entrance into the Zoological Park from
Woodley Lane, and opening driveway into Zoological Park, from
said entrance along the bank of Rock Creek, and five thousand dollars
shall be used toward the construction of a road from the Holt Mansion
entrance (on Adams Mill road) into the park to connect with roads now
in existence, including a bridge across Rock Creck.

It will be noted that a considerable portion of the sum appropriated
is for the improvement of certain specified roads within the park and
for the construction of a new bridge in connection therewith. Accord-
ingly, a great part of the time that could be devoted to the improve-
ment of the grounds has been spent in the development of these works.
A narrow but sufficient roadway has been constructed along the line
formerly occupied by the cart path known as the Adams Mill road
and continued onward to the sharp bend in the stream near the animal
house of the park, where an inexpensive but picturesque rustic bridge
has been placed. This plan was deemed preferable to the building of
a wide driveway with a high bridge that would be very costly, far
beyond the scope of any appropriations to be expected from Congress,
and likely at the sanie time to be an intrusion in the peaceful quiet of
the valley, which it would span for some hundreds of feet.

A view of the bridge as finally erected is shown in the appendix.
The foundation at either end rests upon the rock, and the main structure
is formed of an arch of heavy oak logs solidly bolted together. The
strength of the structure is far greater than is required for the amount
of travel that may be expected over it, but not more than is needed to
withstand the force of freshets that occur from time to time in the tur-
bulent stream. A satisfactory result was reached at comparatively
small expense, and though the superstructure will undoubtedly be in
danger during times of great floods, it is believed that the foundation
will always remain uninjured, so that even if the bridge is carried away,
it can be renewed at slight cost.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The road which passes over the bridge should be continued onward up
the valley of the creek as far as the northern boundary of the park,
which is separated from the Rock Creek National Park by the Klingle
road. This would give the public an easy access to the animal pad-
docks situated on the lower levels of the park, establish a thoroughfare
between the Zoological Park and the Rock Creek Park, and afford to
the residents of the country lying immediately to the west of the lower
end of Rock Creek Park a convenient outlet toward the city.

But little has been done during the year to improve the means of
access to the park. This is owing in great measure to the fact that the
plans for the extension of the streets of the city are not yet fully
matured, and no appropriations have yet been made for carrying them
into execution. In consequence of this, there is no properly improved
roadway connecting the recently completed road in the park with the
city system.

The colony of beavers which has been installed along one of the
streams of the park and temporarily secluded, has done very well, and
the animals, while thus secured from annoyance or interference have —
worked as in a state of nature. !t is hoped that they may soon be so
far domesticated as to admit of their carrying on their very interesting
pursuits under the eyes of the public, which is not yet possible.

The accessions to the collection during the past year have been few.
The supply from the Yellowstone National Park, which was confidently
counted upon, has in some respects been disappointing. Owing to the
inroads of poachers and to inadequate winter pasturage, the bison in
that park have greatly decreased in numbers and are widely seattered
in almost inaccessible regions, so that it has been practically impossible
to secure any of them in the corral built for their protection and preser-
vation. Stringent penalties against poaching within that park have
been enacted by Congress, and it is hoped that by careful attention a
remnant of the herd of bison may yet be preserved. It is thought best
not to disturb them at present by any attempts looking toward herding
or capture.

While the bison have been decreasing in the somewhat unfavorable
locality of the Yellowstone National Park, in other parts of the coun-
try some increase has occurred. Thus it is found that a portion of the
great northern herd has been isolated near Ronan, Montana, and in the
so-called panhandle of Texas a remnant of the southern herd continues
to be maintained. It may be remarked that the vast regions of Texas
contain many animals that would be of advantage to our national col-
lection. Many of the Mexican species of deer range into this country,
and many distinctively Mexican animals, such as the peceary and the
jaguar, occur, while on the plains are found wild horses, supposed by
some to be indigenous, and therefore anterior to the Spanish occupa-
tion, and there are even a few camels running wild in some of the more
inaccessible portions of the country, relics of a herd imported for pur-
poses of transportation before the days of the Pacific railroads.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. DAU

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The operations of the Astrophysical Observatory. have consisted
chiefly in experiments in the bolographic analysis of the infra-red solar
spectrum and the preparation of a report thereon, which was completed
in May of the present year, and contains, in addition to introductory,
historical, descriptive, and theoretical matter and accounts of subsidiary
investigations, tables of positions of 222 absorption lines in the infra-
red solar spectrum in terms of angular deviations and refractive indices
for arock-salt prism, and of the approximate wave-lengths corresponding.

These results are based on observations taken between October, 1896,
and January, 1897, which are far superior to any before obtained, by
reason of the great improvements in instrumental equipment spoken
of in my last report. In this research it has thus been necessary to
bestow what may seem inordinate time on the production of preliminary
results chiefly useful in indicating requisite refinements of apparatus
and of method. This once done, the results to be obtained in a few
months exceed in value, for the main purpose of the investigation, all
that have been obtained in as many years. An examination of the
earlier bolographs has, however, recently been undertaken, and a great
number of measurements made on the relative amounts of energy in
the various parts of the spectrum, which, it is hoped, will lead to inter-
esting results when compared with weather records covering the same
interval of time.

A more detailed account of the work of the Observatory will be
found in the appendix. Itisregretted that owing to unforeseen delays,
not in any way due to the Observatory, the report above mentioned is
not yet in type, so that the results obtained, which it is believed will
be a contribution of interest and value to physical science, are not yet
generally accessible. I trust that the obstacle preventing publication
may be removed immediately after the assembling of Congress.

Respectfully submitted.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Sir: The following statement constitutes a résumé of the most important opera-
tions of the National Museum during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1897:

Accessions.—The records show the receipt of 1,467 separate accessions. These
figures indicate an excess of 168 lots over the receipts of the previous year. The
number of specimens embraced in these accessions is nearly 112,000, representing an
increase of more than 50 per cent over last year. The following accessions are
among the most interesting:

Of the zoological material, mention should first be made of two exceedingly valu-
able and interesting collections from Trong, Lower Siam, presented by Dr. W. L.
Abbott. This material is of unusual interest, the insects and shells representing
many species new to the Museum collection. ‘The specimens were received in a very
satisfactory condition. Mr. A. Boucard, Spring Vale, Isle of Wight, England, trans-
mitted aspecimen of the rare mound fowl, Leipoa ocellata, from Australia. Dr. L. T.
Chamberlain, New York City, presented shells from Central America and the West
Indies, and specimens of tourmaline from Paris, Me. From Cornell University,
Ithaca, N. Y., invertebrates collected by the Cornell Expedition to Greenland in 1896
were transmitted by Prof. J. H. Comstock. Mr. D. W. Coquillett, United States
Department of Agriculture, sent 860 specimens of beetles of the family Tachinide,
including type specimens. From Hon. W. B. Brownlow, Member of Congress, have
been received, on deposit, birds’ skins and other natural-history specimens from
British Honduras. Mr. J.G. Foetterle, Petropolis, Brazil, presented 172 specimens of
Brazilian Lepidoptera, representing 115 species. Mr. 8. Nozawa, Sapporo, Japan,
sent a collection of reptiles, batrachians, and fishes obtained at YessoIsland. A very
interesting collection of beetles collected in the Kongo region was received from
Dr. D. W. Snyder, Nashville, Tenn. Dr. W. L. Ralph, Utica, N. Y., presented birds’
skins from the western section of the United States. Zoological material repre-
senting several groups was collected by Prof. O. F. Cook during a trip to Liberia.
A collection of land and fresh-water shells was transmitted by the Perak Museum,
Straits Settlements.

Among the most important additions to the herbarium are included a series of
1,000 plants, representing the private collection of Dr. W. H. Forwood, U.S. A.,
Soldiers’ Home, Washington, D.C.; 432 herbarium specimens, also from Dr. Forwood ;
500 specimens from the Biltmore Herbarium, Biltmore, N. C.; a collection of plants
obtained by Prof. O. F’. Cook, of the National Museum, while in Africa, and a collec-
tion of Spanish plants presented by Mrs. Cook.

A number of microscopic sections from the collection of the Fortieth Parallel Sur-
vey were transmitted from the United States Geological Survey by Mr. Arnold
Hague.

Mr. R. D. Lacoe, Pittston, Pa., forwarded 208 specimens of tertiary plants from
Florissant, Colo., for addition to the Lacoe collection. Dr. C. E. Beecher, Yale
Museum, New Haven, Conn., presented a fine series of fossils, models of Triarthrus
becki, a species of crustacean, and a model of a trilobite with appendage.

30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mrs. J. Crosby Brown, New York City, contributed a collection of ethnological
objects from the western coast of Africa; Dr. W. L. Abbott transmitted some very
valuable ethnological specimens from Lower Siam, and Dr. D. W. Snyder sent
material of a similar character from the Kongo region.

A collection of engraved diplomas, inscriptions, etc., was presented to the Museum
by Messrs. Tiffany & Co., New York City. From Mr. Yang Yii, Chinese minister in -
Washington, a large blue porcelain vase, a bronze urn, and a string of beads were’
received.

Prof. D. P. Todd forwarded from Amherst College two frames of photographs illus-
trating the work of the Amherst Eelipse Expedition to Japan in 1885. Miss M. A.
Henry, Washington, D. C., transmitted specimens of electrical apparatus, and a
number of diplomas and medals presented to her father, Prof. Joseph Henry.

The scientific and administrative staff—On September 6, 1896, by the untimely and
unexpected death of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the Museum was deprived of its imme-
diate head. It was not feasible to fill at once and permanently the vacancy thus
most unfortunately occurring, and on January 27, 1897, I had the honor to receive
the temporary appointment of acting assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, in charge of the Museum.

Mr. W. C. Winlock, who, in addition to his special work as curator of the Smith-
sonian Bureau of International Exchanges and aid in charge of the office of the
Institution, held the honorary position of curator of physical apparatus in the
National Museum, died on September 20, 1896. Maj. Charles Bendire, United States
Army, honorary curator of the department of birds’ eggs, died on February 4, 1897.

Mr. M. L. Linell, aid in the department of insects, died on May 3, 1897.

Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, of New York City, was, on January 11, 1897, appointed
honorary custodian of the collection of gems and precious stones. Mr. J. N. Rose,
Mr. C. L. Pollard, and Prof. O. F. Cook, have been appointed assistant curators in
the department of botany. Mr. J. L. Willige was designated acting chief clerk in
February, 1897, relieving Mr. W. V. Cox, who was appointed special agent in charge of
the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.
Mr. Henry Horan, who, since 1880, had filled the position of superintendent of
buildings, died on September 29, 1896. Mr. Horan first became connected with the
Smithsonian Institution in 1857. Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator of the technological
collections, was placed in charge of the oew division of buildings and superintend-
ence, retaining, in addition, the curatorship of the technological collections.

Distribution of specimens.—More than 26,000 specimens have been distributed dur-
ing the year, including gifts to institutions, exchanges, and specimens sent for
study. About one-half of the entire number consisted of herbarium specimens, and
of the remainder more than 3,700 were marine invertebrates, and about 2,400 geo-
logical specimens.

Visitors.—The number of visitors to the Museum building during the year was
229,606, and to the Smithsonian building 115,709, making a total of 345,315. It
should be remarked that in the total for this year is included the increase in the
number of visitors occasioned in March by the inaugural ceremonies of President
McKinley.

Specimens received for determination.—The number of lots of material received for
determination continues to increase. During the fiscal year just closed there were
716 accessions of this character, 174 more than during the preceding year. The
labor involved in the identification of this material consumes a large share of the
-time of several of the curators, especially in the departments of birds, insects,
mollusks, and geology, for which the Museum receives very little in return. It is
believed, however, that an important field of usefulness is found in this direction.

Tennessee Centennial Kxposition.—The sum of $30,000 was appropriated by Congress
for the erection of a building for the Government exhibit at the Tennessee Centen-
nial Exposition, and the sum of $100,000 for the exhibit proper and for other inci-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

dental expenses. Of the latter amount an allotment of $14,500 was made to the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum. This amount was afterwards
increased by $1,700. Dr. Frederick W. True was designated representative of the
Institution and the Museum on the Government board of management. Mr. W. V.
Cox was made special agent in charge of the exhibit, and was afterwards also
selected as secretary of the Government board. Exhibits were prepared by 18
departments and sections of the Museum, and were shipped to Nashville in the
latter part of April, 1897, the Exposition opening on May 1. A detailed statement
regarding the participation by the Institution and its dependencies in this Expo-
sition will be presented in the report for 1898. ;

Foreign exchanges.—Exchanges of specimens have been made with a number of
foreign museums. Among them may be named the Albany Museum, Grahamstown,
South Africa; Australian Museum, Sidney, New South Wales; Berlin Zoological
Museum, Berlin, Germany; Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, India; Branicki Museum,
Varsovie, Russia; British Museum, London, England; Canterbury Museum, Christ-
church, New Zealand; Manchester Museum, Manchester, England; Museum of
Natural History, Paris, France; Museum of Natural History, Lyons, France; Museum
of Natural History, Genoa, Italy; Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland ;
Provincial Museum, Victoria, British Columbia; Royal Zoological Museum, Turin,
Italy; St. John’s College, Shanghai, China; Zoologiske Museum, Copenhagen, Den-
mark; Zurich Botanical Gardens, Zurich, Switzerland. Exchanges of interest and
value have also been made with individuals, among whom may be named Mr. A.
Batalin, St. Petersburg, Russia; Mr. Stefan Chernel von Chernelhiaza, Kiszeg, Hun-
gary; Mr. C. Copineau, Doullens, Somme, France; Dr. Wheelton Hind, Stoke-upon-
Trent, England; Prof. Wilhelm Leche, Stockholm, Sweden; Mr. J. de Morgan, Gizeh
Museum, Egypt; Mr. Victor Ritter von Tschusi zu Schmidhoffen, Hallein, Germany.

Publications.—The Report of the Museum for 1894 was published during the year,
and on June 30 the Report for 1895 was practically all in type.

Volume 18 of the Proceedings was issued in bound form. About twenty papers
belonging to Volume 19 were published separately, and advance sheets of three
papers, to be included in Volume 20, appeared during the year.

In the series of Bulletins two numbers have been issued—No. 47, the first part of
an elaborate work entitled, ‘“The Fishes of North and Middle America,” by David
Starr Jordan and Barton W. Evermann; and No. 49, “A Bibliography of the Pub-
lished Writings of Philip Lutley Sclater,” by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode.

Two important monographs have been issued as special bulletins. The first of
these (Special Bulletin No. 2) consists of a work on the deep sea and pelagic fishes
of the world, by Drs.G. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean. This volume contains
553 pages and is accompanied by an atlas of 123 plates. The second (Special Bulletin
No. 3) constitutes the second volume of Major Bendire’s ‘‘ Life Histories of North
American Birds,” and contains 518 pages and seven colored plates.

Explorations.—Dr. William L. Abbott has extended his travels into Lower Siam,
and as the result of his explorations the Museum has already received two very large
and exceedingly valuable collections, including natural history specimens and
ethnological objects. Many of the mammals were obtained at high altitudes, and
all of the material is of a peculiarly interesting character.

Additional collections of ethnological objects from Arizona and New Mexico have
been received from Mr. J. Walter Fewkes. A specimen of Canyon Diablo meteorite
was also obtained and forwarded by him.

Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford Junior University,
transmitted, in behalf of the Fur Seal Commission, a collection of natural history
specimens obtained in Japan and Bering Sea.

Prof. O. F. Cook obtained during his travels in Africa valuable collections of
flowers, ferns, etc., which have been added to the herbarium.

Collections of mammals, plants, invertebrates, and other natural history specimens,
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

were made by Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army, in connection with his explo-
rations in New York, Minnesota, Virginia, and Maryland, and these have been
transmitted by him to the National Museum.

Collections of natural history specimens obtained by the Fish Commission steam-
ers Albatross and Fish Hawk, and by field parties sent out by the Fish Commission,
have been received during the year. Important collections have been transferred to
the Museum by the Department of Agriculture. The United States Geological Sur-
vey has sent in large collections from all parts of the country, including material
obtained by the Fortieth Parallel Survey.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Sir: Ethnologic researches have been conducted during the fiscal year in accord-
ance with the act of Congress making provision ‘‘for continuing researches relating
to the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,”
approved June 11, 1896.

The researches have been carried forward in accordance with a plan of operations
submitted on June 13, 1896. The field operations of the regular officers of the
Bureau have extended into Arizona, Indian Territory, lowa, Maine, New Brunswick,
New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, and Ontario, and operations have been carried on
by special agents in California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, as
well as in British Columbia and different provinces in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico.
The office researches have dealt with material from most of the States and from
many other pertions of the American continents.

The chief duty impesed on the Bureau at the outset was the classification of the
Indian tribes; and, since the sciences of man were inchoate when the Bureau was
instituted, this duty involved the organization of those branches of the science deal-
ing with ethnic relations. Accurdingly, a classitication of ethnic science has grown
up in connection with the classification of the tribes, and has been perfected from year
to year; and during recent years, and particularly during the fiscal year just closed,
the operations have been shaped by this classification of the subject-matter of the
science. The primary lines of special research relate to (1) arts or esthetology, (2)
industries or technology (including archeology), (3) institutions or sociology, (4) Jan-
guages or philology, and (5) myths orsophiology, as well as the requisite classificatory
work involving researches in somatology and especially in psychology. The special
researches are initiated in the field and completed in the office, giving rise to (I)
field research (including exploration), and (II) office research, which together con-
stitute the original scientific work of the Bureau; while the demands of the public
service and the needs of the collaborators give rise to (III) work in descriptive eth-
nology, (IV) bibliographic work, (V) work in collecting, (VI) publication, and (VII)
concomitant administrative and miscellaneous work.

: FIELD RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION,

At the beginning of the fiscal year the Director was engaged in a reconnoissance
of shell mounds and other antiquities on the coast of Maine; here he was joined by
Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, and a number of shell mounds were surveyed and
excavated with success. Later in the season the Passamaquoddy Indians still living
in the vicinity were studied with some care, and their industries, especially in house
_ building, were investigated; subsequently some of the older men of the tribe were
employed to collect material for and to erect an aboriginal wigwam, which was
afterwards transferred to the Zoological Park at Washington.

During July and August Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was occupied in making surveys
and excavations of ruins, chiefly in Arizona, with the primary object of collecting
prehistoric material for the enrichment of the National Museum, but with the sec-
ondary purpose of investigating those activities of the aborigines recorded in the
products of their handiwork still extant. His operations were notably successful,

sm 97—3 33
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Early in July Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson proceeded. to Zuni pueblo for the
purpose of investigating certain ceremonies not adequately studied hitherto, to the
end that they might be incorporated in her monograph on the Zuni Indians. She
remained throughout half of the fiscal year, and was able to complete her researches
in a satisfactory manner. Incidentally, she obtained at Zuni and Sia a number of
sacred masks used in the peculiar religious ceremonies of the people of the pueblos,
which have been transferred to the National Museum.

Toward the end of July Dr. Albert S. Gatschet repaired to eastern Maine and
adjacent portions of New Brunswick in search of linguistic material among the
tribesmen still living on St. Croix River. His mission was successfal. <A large body
of vocables, paradigms, and texts representing the Passamaquoddy dialects of the
Algonquian linguistic stock was secured, and he was able also to trace definitely, for
the first time, the derivation of many of the peculiar place names of eastern Maine.

From the middle of August until the middle of December Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was
occupied in collecting material representing the languages and mythology of the
Iroquoian Indians located in central New York and southern Ontario. His work
was eminently productive, yielding a large amount of material of exceptional use
for comparative studies in the philology and sophiology of the Indians.

Toward the end of September Mr. James Mooney repaired to Indian Territory and
Oklahoma, where he spent several months in collecting information and material
relating chiefly to the Kiowa Indians. The primary purpose of the trip was research
concerning the peculiar heraldic system of the tribe; another purpose was the con-
tinuation of study of the use of peyote or “mescal” (a toxic plant corresponding
measurably with hashish) in the ceremonies of the Kiowa, Apache, and other
Indians; later in the season advantage was taken of his presence on the ground to
make a collection representing the Kiowa camp-circle for exhibition at the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition at Nashville.

In April Mr. W J McGee visited the Muskwaki Indian settlement near Tama,
Iowa, with the object of beginning a special study of the social organization of
this little-known tribe. Although preliminary only, his operations were successful.
Incidentally he collected a quantity of aboriginal material for the National Museum.

Early in 1896 Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of Princeton University, was commissioned as a
special agent of the Bureau to obtain photographs and other data pertaining to the
aborigines of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. He reached the field and commenced
operations in the course of a few months, and reports of progress were received |
early in the fiscal year. His field work was completed in June. The photography
was moderately successful only, but the pictures were supplemented by a small
though interesting collection of objects representing the handiwork of these south-
ernmost representatives of the American aborigines. The success of the work, due
in part to Mr. Hatcher’s energy and intrepidity, was promoted through the courtesy
of various officials of Argentina and Chile, special credit being due to Dr. Estanis¥ao
Zeballos, formerly minister plenipotentiary from Argentina to the, United States.

On December 17, 1894, Dr. Willis E. Everette was given an honorary commission to
collect linguistic and other material among the aborigines of Oregon, Washington,
British Columbia, and western Mexico, and from time to time he has submitted val-
uable linguistic material produced by his researches in these provinces. Especially
noteworthy contributions during the year relate to the Téné or Athapascan Indians
of Oregon.

Early in September Mr. E. T. Perkins, jr., of the United States Geological Sur-
vey, reported the discovery of certain remarkable Indian carvings in Snake Kiver
Valley, Idaho; and Mr. Perkins was temporarily detailed, throngh the courtesy of
Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the Survey, to make studies and photographs repre-
senting these carvings. The work was completed about the close of October.

Early in 1897 Mr. H. 8. Gane, of the Geological Survey, while on a temporary fur-
lough, made a trip through the San Juan country in southwestern Colorado and

duly transmitted and have been found of special value.

The information and material obtained by means of these field operations have been
utilized in large part in the preparation of reports; other portions have been added
to the archives for use in prospective investigations, while most of the objective
material has already been arranged in the National Museum in such manner as to be
accessible for study. The scientific results of the work are set forth in other

OFFICE RESEARCH.

WORK IN ESTHETOLOGY.

During the greater part of the year Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing was employed
in arranging and cataloguing the remarkable collection of relics exhumed from salt
marshes in western Florida during the previous fiscal year and in preparing his report
for the press. The objects collected embrace a wide variety of domestic implements
_and utensils, weapons for use in war and the chase, fabrics for apparel and fishing,
appurtenances to water craft, etc. In addition, there were many objects such as are
used in primitive ceremony, comprising elaborately painted and carved masks and
effigies, while many of the industrial devices are painted and carved in a manner
remarkable for wealth of imagery and delicacy of execution.

An important part of Mr. Cushing’s work was comparative study of the designs,
in form and color, found in connection with the ceremonial and other objects; and
substantial progress was made in the interpretation of the designs. Most of these
are zoic. The bear, the wolf, the wild-cat, the woodpecker, and different waterfowls
and aquatic animals are represented in carvings and paintings with a fidelity to
detail which renders them not only readily identifiable but really artistic. Some of
the effigies approach the natural size, and are attached to other articles in such
manner as to indicate that they were worn as masks or crests, probably in dramatic
ceremonies analogous to those of the Indians of the pueblos and other primitive
peoples. These elaborate carvings are associated with wooden masks, shaped to fit
the face, bearing painted and carved designs of corresponding character, but more or
less conventionized in form and color. The realistic or partially conventionized forms
displayed on the masks are imitated not only on other ceremonial objects but also
on the industrial devices, and the degree of conventionism increases as the repre-
sentations are reduced in size or distorted to fit forms determined by various condi-
tions, so that an unbroken series of stages in the development of convention may be
traced all the way from the essentially realistic representation of the animal head
to the design carved on the arrowshaft or tomahawk handle, which, at first sight,
would seem to be decorative merely.

The sequence displayed in these esthetic designs is, indeed, paralleled in other
collections; but the remarkably rich assemblage of aboriginal handiwork from the
Floridian salt marshes, in which such perishable materials as wood, bone, plant
fiber, feather work, paint, and even leathern thongs are preserved, is especially
noteworthy for the completeness of the sequence and the large number of links rep-
resented. Accordingly the series of objects would seem to establish the view already
advocated by different collaborators of the Bureau that higher esthetic decoration
originates in symbolism, which may gradually be transformed through convention-
izing, either in the interests of economy or to meet other industrial conditions.

During the previous year Dr. J. Walter Fewkes made a collection of fictile ware
and other aboriginal material among the ruins of Arizona and New Mexico, which
was regarded as rich beyond precedent. During the year just closed he made explo-
rations yielding a still larger body of material, which has been subjected to prelimi-
nary study, and has already been arranged in the Museum. As during the preceding
year, fictile ware was the predominant material. This ware is characterized by sym-
bolic and decorative designs, represented sometimes by modeling or by inscribed
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

figures, but more commonly by colors; and for the first time material has been
obtained in sufficient quantity to afford presumptively complete series of designs for
certain groups of aborigines at certain periods antedating Caucasian invasion, so
that various stages in the development of esthetic designs may be traced nearly as
definitely as in the Florida collection. In general the course of development traced
in this way is parallel to that made out on the Florida coast. The course of devel-
opment is from the essentially (though often crudely) symbolic to the conventional,
and through various stages of conventionizing to forms and colors which, at first
sight, would be regarded as decorative merely.

Accordingly the coHection is important as a source of new light on the devyelop-
ment of artistic concepts, while, at the same time, that course of developmental
succession which it so clearly attests has been used successfully in tracing certain
movements of the aboriginal population. It has long been known that, while most
of the traditions of the pueblo peoples recount migrations in a southerly or south-
easterly direction, there are subordinate indications of a northerly or northeasterly
drift from snowless lowlands or from saline and shell-yielding shores, and at least
one of the collaborators (Mr. McGee) has found indications of a culture migration
from the once populous valleys of Sonora, with adjacent refuges in the form of
entrenched mountains, northward into the region of cliff houses, whence the mesa-
protected pueblos seem to have sprung. Now Dr. Fewkes is able to trace a similar
northward drift of the esthetic designs characterizing the aboriginal pottery of the
pueblos. This application of the researches in the development of esthetics among
the American Indians is essentially new and is highly suggestive. Some of the
results of the work are already incorporated in reports prepared for publication ;
others are held for comparison and elaboration as the research progresses.

While in Zuni, and afterward at Sia, Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson gave special
attention to the masks and other regalia used in ceremonies, and, as already noted,
obtained a number of especially sacred masks. She found the ceremonial regalia to
be essentially symbolic; the masks themselves represent zoic deities, and their
appurtenances are designed to express real or ideal attributes of the animals deified,
while the associated regalia and insignia, including apparel and the paint applied
to faces, bodies, and extremities, are symbolic of similar or related concepts. All
of the symbols are conventionized in greater or less degree, vet the accompaniments
of voice and gesture, and even the terms of the ritual, are designed to emphasize
the symbolism, i. e., to concentrate attention on the idea symbolized and divert
attention from the conventionism.

Primarily the ceremonies and regalia are dramaturgic, and the use of the more
important regalia is limited to the ceremonial representation; yet to some extent
the mystical or sacred characteristics are supposed to cling to the actors in the mys-
tical drama, and in some measure affect their everyday life; sometimes the actors are
thereby strengthened in their positions as shamans, and they, as well as others, may
continue to wear the less important regalia, or carry about their persons miniature
symbols of the specially deific objects. In this way the devotional sentiment and
the symbolism in which it is crystallized are expressed in everyday life and common-
place manners; and the devotion and symboli-m find some expression in ordinary
handiwork and still clearer expression in the more unusual handiwork involved in
making and decorating the many articles connected with ceremonial rites. The
observations are highly significant, in that they indicate the characteristics and the
dominant influence of devotional sentiment among primitive peoples; they are
especially useful, too, in that they aid in interpreting the symbolism depicted on
prehistoric relics and corroborate the interpretations already rendered. 7

In 1877 Mr. E. W. Nelson, an acute observer and trained naturalist, was commis-
sioned to make collections for the United States National Museum in Alaska and
adjacent territory in North America and Asia. In connection with other duties,
he was authorized to make ethnologic studies and collections among the Eskimo
and other Indians at the cost of the Bureau soon after its institution. He spent

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

some years among the tribes, obtaining vocabularies and other linguistic mate-
rial and making large collections of esthetic and industrial handiwork. He also
prepared a preliminary draft of a report on the ethnology of the region covered by
his operations. On his return to Washington the collections were transferred to the
National Museum, but failure of health prevented him from completing the prepara-
tion of the report, so that the collections have hitherto remained without adequate
explanation. During the present fiscal year he returned to Washington from a pro-
longed absence, chiefly in Mexico, and at once undertook the completion of the long-
delayed report.

Through the courtesy of Museum officials the collection was brought together for
renewed study and the preparation of necessary illustrations. ‘Mr. Nelson’s original
manuscripts were placed in his hands and, before leaving the city in April, he had
practically completed a general report with illustrations of typical objects repre-
senting the handicraft of the hyperborean tribes with whom he came in contact
during his sojourn about the Arctic border. The report is particularly valuable in
its full description and illustration of the decorative designs characterizing Eskimo
art. The Eskimo are distinctive in many respects, but in none more strongly than
in their artistic development; they are clever draftsmen and fairly deft carvers of
wood, bone, and ivory; many of their implements, weapons, and utensils are graved
with artistic devices or sculptured in artistic forms, and the graving and carving
apparently represent a highly conventionized symbolism. Mr. Nelson’s motive is
_ accurate description and faithful illustration of objects rather than analysis and
synthetic arrangement of designs; yet his memoir is a rich repository of material
from which the course of development represented by Eskimo art may be traced.

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY.

While in contact with the Passamaquoddy Indians on the coast of Maine, the
Director and Mr. Cushing had opportunity for studying certain primitive industries
yet retained by this partially accultured people. Conspicuous among these were the
industries connected with the building and furnishing of domiciles. The long per-
sistence of domiciliary industries among these Indians may be explained, at least in
part, by the fact that the birch-bark wigwams are remarkably serviceable and
economic, so that they were only slowly displaced by the little more commodious
and much more expensive houses of civilization. At thesame time, there are strong
indications of ceremonial observances in connection with the erection of habitations,
which doubtless serve to prolong the retention of the aboriginal type.

There is a single model for the dwellings of this branch of the Algonquian Indians.
The structure is rectangular in plan, about 12 by 15 feet, with a narrow doorway in
one end; the end walls stand vertical, while the sides, after rising vertically for 5
or 6 feet, are continued upward to form a curved roof, interrupted by an orifice over
the center of the earthen floor for the exit of smoke. The framework is of light:
arbor-vite poles, neatly cut and shaped by stone implements and fire, the uprights
set in the ground and lashed to the horizontal pieces by means of withes or splints;
the walls and roof are made from large sections of birch-bark, carefully overlapped
shinglewise and skilfully sewn together with slender splints of ash. The door isa
dressed deer skin, attached to a light crossbar, while the smoke hole is provided
with a shifting wind guard which may be so adjusted as to draw out the smoke and
exclude most of the rain or snow in case of storm. The wigwam constructed in this
way is practically wind proof and nearly rain proof, strong enough to resist the force
of storms and the weight of winter’s snow, and is capacious and commodious in
almost the highest possible degree in proportion to the material employed in con-
struction. It lasts five years or more without repairs, and with occasienal repairs as
needed may last a generation. Asa means of studying the house and house building,
two aged Indians were employed to set up a wigwam near the field of work in Maine,
and with a view of extending the study and at the same time perpetuating this form
of aboriginal handicraft, they were afterward engaged to erect and {furnish the
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

structure in Washington. It was at first designed to place it in the National
Museum, but in view of the limitations of space it was afterward decided to locate
the building in the National Zoological Park.

While supervising the work of the Indians on the wigwam, the Director and Mr.
Cushing observed them using a curved knife, held in the hand with the blade pro-
jecting toward the body (the handle being flattened to fit the face of the thumb by
which the attitude of the curved blade is controlled), and drawn toward the body
in use; and the resemblance of the implement to that found among the primitive
peoples of Japan and the similarity in use were at once noted. At the same time -
Mr. Cushing, who was fresh from the tidal marshes of Florida in which curved
knives of shell are entombed, was enabled to interpret more cleariy the Floridian
shell knives and tooth knives, and infer the manner of their use, which must have
been prevailingly centripetal or inward, rather than centrifugal or outward from
the body like the tools of civilization. This simple discovery throws strong light
on the development of primitive industries and removes difficulties hitherto
encountered in the interpretation of primitive implements and workmanship. Then,
on examining the shell mounds and house mounds on the Maine coast, Mr. Cushing
was enabled to explain the occurrence of certain split teeth of the beaver found in
such associations as to suggest habitual use; for he found, on attaching them to
handles similar to those of the curved knives, that they constituted surprisingly
effective implements for shaving and carving wood, for opening the skins and sever-
ing the tissues of animals, and indeed for performing all of the multifarious fune-
tions of the knife. At once it became evident that the beaver-tooth knife was much
more efficient, and among hunters more economic in making and carrying, than the
knife of chipped stone; and on investigating the history of the curved steel knives
made by smiths for the Indians in accordance with their own designs, it became
evident that the beaver-tooth knife was the prototype of that in use by the tribes-
men today. Atthesame time, the connection between the shell knife of the Florida
coast and the beaver-tooth knife of the Maine coast seemed so close as to indicate
similarity in origin, the animal substance used in each case being that possessing at
once the advantages of accessibility and of economy in manufacture and use.

Connected in bearing with the foregoing researches are those conducted during
the year by Mr. W J McGee. During previous years he visited the Seri Indians of
the Gulf of California, and collected various specimens of their handicraft. The
collection comprises a series of stone implements, of which a number were observed
in use, representing a stage in the development of stone art which has hitherto been
obscure. Initially, these implements are natural pebbles picked up from among
the quantities of similar pebbles shingling the beach; yet they are used for break-
ing the shells of crustaceans; for crushing bones of fish, fowl, and animals; for
pounding apart the tough tissues of larger animals, or perchance for crushing and
grinding mesquite beans, cactus seeds, and other vegetal substances. Originally
selected almost at random, the stone is commonly used but once and then thrown
away; but, if the habitation happens to be located near, the fitter stones are used
over and oyer again, perhaps proving so serviceable that when the always temporary
residence is changed they are carried away as a part of the domestic property of
the matron. Eventually the stone becomes battered and worn by use, so that its
shape is changed; then, if rendered less useful by the change, it is thrown away,
while, if made more serviceable, it is retained to become a highly esteemed piece of
property, always carried by the matron in her wanderings and buried with her body
at death.

The series of implements collected, and the much larger series seen in Seriland,
but not collected, show no trace of predetermined design 1 form or finish. The
implements are fairly uniform in size, apparently because the users are fairly uniform
in strength and the uses fairly uniform in force required, and they are fairly uniform
in shape because of similarity in applications; but as a whole, the series is charac-
terized by absence of design, by fortuitous adaptation rather than that complex
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 333)

invention represented by even the simplest chipping or flaking. The culture stage
represented by the series has already been designated protolithic. It is to be noted
that the Seri Indians have no other stone industry, save a little known and appar-
ently accultural custom of chipping stone for the sole purpose of making arrow-
points, and that their knives, scrapers, awls, needles, and ordinary arrow points are
made from shell, bone, wood, and other substances of organic origin. Now, on
assembling the industrial devices of the Florida marshes, the Maine shell mounds,
the Seri Indians, and the more primitive survivors of the Algonquian tribes located
in the Maine woods, and comparing these with the corresponding devices of the
American tribes generally, it is found that the industries involving the use of stone
for implements or weapons fall into a highly significant order, which, despite some
overlapping of phases, seems to represent the normal course of industrial evolution.

The first stage is that in which stone is used in natural or fortuitous condition,
without predetermined design or invention, as among the Seri Indians; this is the
protolithic stage. It is noteworthy that, in the typical case, and presumptively in
others, the prevailing industrial devices of this stage are of organic material and
approach in form and function the biotic armament of lower animals. They are the
readiest substitutes for, and the direct analogues of, teeth and claws. The second
stage is that represented by wrought stone, shaped largely or wholly in accordance
with predetermined design, whether by battering (undoubtedly the original method)
or by flaking and chipping; it may be called the technolithic stage. This stage is
represented by most of the American tribes. It is clearly to be noted that this
arrangement of stages in the development of primitive industry is based wholly on
research among the American Indians and among the relics of their prehistoric
ancestors. It is not designed to supplant or discredit classifications based on the
industrial devices of other countries. It is constructive and not destructive, and is
formulated merely as a contribution to scientific knowledge concerning the abo-
rigines of the Western hemisphere.

Another line of research in technology, conducted chiefly during the year, though
the results were incorporated in a paper accompanying the preceding report, relates
to primitive surgery and medicine. The work, which was based on a collection of
Peruvian crania, was conducted by Mr. McGee. Its details are significant, in that
the interpretations are based on the primitive sophiology known to have prevailed
among the aborigines up to the time of Caucasian invasion, rather than on the more
realistic philosophy by which civilized practitioners are guided The stages of
development of curative surgical treatment, as traced in the course of the researches,
need not be repeated; suffice it to say that the investigation appears to illumine the
previously obscure origin of surgery, and at the same time to throw much light on
the origin and development of medical treatment in general.

In earlier paragraphs, summarizing the results of researches concerning the origin
and development of the arts, incidental allusion is made to the intimate relation
between the esthetic and the industrial. The relation is double—indeed, manifold—
and reciprocal: In the first place, the industrial device is usually a medium for
esthetic devices, graved or carved or painted upon it, usually as symbolic invoca-
tions to mystical powers whereby the efficiency of the implement or utensil may be
augmented; while, in the second place, the execution of the esthetic devices consti-
tutes an important and, in some lands, apparently a preponderant part, of the cccu-
pation of primitive people. Accordingly, the researches in esthetology, carried
forward during the year by various collaborators, including Messrs. Cushing, Fewkes,
and Nelson, and Mrs. Stevenson, have thrown light on the motives and other causes
underlying industrial development.

WORK IN SOCIOLOGY.

In continuing the examination and digestion of material collected during the
eighteen years of the existence of the Bureau, the Director has given special atten-
tion to the principles underlying the social organization of the American aborigines,
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A portion of the results are summarized in a chapter on regimentation incorporated -

in a preceding report. The researches are still in progress.

Mr. W J McGee has continued the comparative study of social organization with
special reference to the Seri and Papago Indians. In the former tribe the social
organization appears to rest wholly on kinship traced through the female line; and
one of the consequences of this organization and of the peculiar isolation of the
people is found in a singular marriage custom which has been noted in previous
reports. The Papago Indians, on the other hand, have an organization based pri-
marily on kinship traced in the male line, but displaying also certain indications of
transition into some such artificial system as that which, on further development,
matures in civilization, i. e., sometimes the gentes are united in such manner that
a single kinship group combines two totems; the kinship terminology is incomplete
in such way as to suggest curtailment through disuse; through seasonal migrations
and other causes there is a constant breaking up of.family groups, followed by inter-
mingling in new combinations in the form of colonies of patriarchal or even feudal-
istic character; there is clear recognition of patriarchal property right in the waters
in which the material values of their arid territory inhere; while the governmental
control, though nominally vested in patriarchal shamans, is really regulated by an
officer selected through popular approval, who may be designated the people’s
attorney.

It is noteworthy that the Spanish invaders of the Western Hemisphere assimilated
the aboriginal much more completely than the Anglo-Saxon invaders of more north-
erly regions, so that in many instances the social institutions prevailing in Mexico
today have sprung from aboriginal germs. ‘This is especially true of the patriarchal
organization characteristic of the Mexican provinces remote from the greater cities
and railways, which differs in no essential particular from the organization still
found among the Papago Indians and recorded in their time-honored traditions.
Now, the comparative studies of the Seri and Papago social organizations, with the
analogue of the Jatter among the modern Mexicans, gives opportunity for clearing
up certain misapprehensions concerning primitive society. In barbaric culture, in
which descent is reckoned in the male line, the governmental control is vested in an
elder man (whose seniority may be either real or assumed), so that the organization
is patriarchal; and it has been inferred, without adequate observation and with
undue influence growing out of the convenience of antithetic terms, that in savage
culture, in which descent is reckoned in the female line, the social organization is
matriarchal.

The case of the Seri Indians is perhaps the most striking among many examples,
indicating that, even when descent is traced exclusively through the female line.to
the extent that the father has no control over his wife’s property or his own chil-
dren, the tribal control is, nevertheless, vested in male rulers, who may be either
shamans of exceptional shrewdness or warriors of exceptional valor and cunning.
Accordingly the term “‘ matriarchal” can only be regarded as erroneous and mislead-
ing when applied to this culture stage. This becomes especially clear in the light
of the observations among the Papago Indians and the mixed-blood Mexicans, in
which the rule is patriarchal, but in which there is an associated matriarchy, for
the wife of the patriarch occupies a position among the women and children of the
group corresponding to that of her spouse, primarily among the men, but secondarily
among all, so that patriarchy and matriarchy are in reality complementary aspects
of that culture stage in which descent is traced in the male line. Confusion is
avoided by designating the more primitive organization as maternal and the more
advanced as paternal, and by restricting the terms patriarchal and matriarchal to
their legitimate functions, as indicated by the usage of southwestern peoples. The
details of the researches on this subject are too extended for summary statement;
but the principles developed through the study are important as a means of inter-
preting observation and thus guiding special research and contributing to scientific
knowledge of the aborigines. The work is still in progress.

WORK IN PHILOLOGY.

Linguistic studies were pushed forward energetically during the earlier years of
the existence of the Bureau, partly as a means of classifying the Indians in such
manner as to guide grouping on reservations. A considerable portion of the material
collected was, after the immediate practical use, placed on file for comparison and
study with a view to the discovery of the principles of linguistic development.
During the fiscal year the Director has reviewed these records in conjunction with
those pertaining to sociology and sophiology, and has made progress in developing
the principles of philology and applying them to the ethnic problems presented by
the American aborigines. In primitive society language grows in two ways: Onthe
one hand there is a steady enrichment and differentiation due to the coining of
expressions for new ideas; on the other hand there is a spasmodic enrichment and
modification, both in terms and in grammatic structure, produced by the shock of
contact (whether peaceful or bloody) with other peoples—the changes consequent
on conquest being especially important, as has been shown by different philologists.
At the same time both the lexic and the structural forms—i. e., both words and sen-
tences—are simplified through the natural tendency toward economy in expression.
These and other processes connected with the growth of language have been indi-
cated in some detail in earlier reports.

Now, on examining the aboriginal languages of America, it is found that many of
them are interrelated in such manner as to indicate specific courses of development,
and in all such cases the dominant process has been the union or blending of more
or less diverse elements, both lexie and structural. This blending can be explained
only as a record of intertribal contact, and the cases are so numerous—indeed, they
are characteristic of all of the aboriginal tongues—as to indicate that practically all
of the native languages have been built up and shaped chiefly by the combination
and blending of antecedently distinct and presumptively discrete tongues. This
conclusion as to the development of oral speech in America is corroborated by the
simpler history of the development of the so-called gesture speech, which was widely
used by the Indians as a partial substitute for, and convenient supplement to, oral
speech as an intertribal language. When the course of development ascertained by
these comparisons is so extended as to apply to the entire assemblage of native Amer-
ican peoples, it at once becomes evident that the sixty linguistic stocks and five
hundred dialects extant at the time of the discovery (themselves the product of long-
continued combination and blending of distinct tongues, as the researches have
shown) are indubitable records of still more numerous and still.more widely distinct
languages of an earlier time, and the more carefully the record is scanned the more
numerous and the more distinct do the original components appear.

It is accordingly a necessary inference that a vast number of distinct, albeit sim-
ple if not inchoate, tongues originally existed in North America, and that the sub-
sequent history has been chiefly one of linguistic integration. - It is a corollary of
this proposition, which is but the generalization of all known facts relating to the
aboriginal languages of America, that the Western Hemisphere must have been peo-
pled by the ancestors of the modern Indian tribes before the birth of language
among them. Both the main proposition and the corollary run counter to earlier
opinions entertained in this and other countries; yet they are not only sustained by
the u precedentedly rich collection of linguistic facts preserved in the Bureau
archi 1s or published in the reports, but by the cumulative evidence obtained through
the researches concerning the arts, industries, institutions, and beliefs of the Ameri-
can aborigines. A more detailed report on this subject is in an advanced stage of
preparation.

Dr. Albert 8S. Gatschet has continued the collection of linguistic material pertain
ing to the Algonquian Indians, and has made progress in the preparation of the
comparative dictionary of Algonquian terms. The new material collected during
the year was obtained chiefly among the Passamaquoddy Indians living in the woods
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of Maine and adjacent parts of New Brunswick. Advantage was taken of an
opportunity to obtain a Nez Percé vocabulary, representing the Shahaptian stock,
from Lewis D. Williams, an educated member of the tribe, who spent some months
in Washington during the earlier part of the fiscal year. This record is deemed of
special value, not only in that it is more complete than those representing the same
stock already on file, but in that it affords means of checking and clearing up doubt-
ful points in the earlier records.

In addition to collecting a rich body of material relating to the languages and
beliefs of several Iroquoian tribes, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt made considerable progress
in the systematic arrangement of material collected during preceding years. One
of the more important lines of his work was a study of the pronoun with special
reference to its function in primitive language and its relation to other parts of
speech. His researches indicate with greater clearness than others hitherto con-
ducted that the pronoun occupies a much more prominent position in primitive
speech than in the highly developed languages of cultured peoples. The prepara-
tion of a special paper on the subject was commenced by Mr. Hewitt toward the
end of the year. Another line of work by Mr. Hewitt, originating in the collection
of mythologic texts, was a comparative study of the creation myths of different
Troquoian and Algonquian tribes.. The preliminary results of this study are espe-
cially significant in their bearing on conclusions derived from the study of lan-
guage. On comparing half a dozen versions of the Indian cosmogony, he was able
to detect unmistakable indications of interchange of such sort as to prove that
originally independent myths have undergone considerable coalescence and blending,
so that the myth, like the speech in which it is crystallized, is a composite of many
elements. Coupled with the features indicating coalescence there are, indeed, cer-
tain features indicating differentiation, chiefly in the direction required to adjust
the mythic personages to the local fauna; but the indications of differentiation are
far subordinate to the evidence of coalescence or integration. A number of typical
myths representing the aborigines of the northeastern United States have been
brought together with a view to publication so soon as the general discussion is

completed.
WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY.

The scope and extent of the researches in sophiology during the fiscal year are in
some measure set forth in the foreguing paragraphs, for the various demotic activities
are interdependent, and neither arts, industries, institutions, nor languages can be
developed without the concomitant development of opinions, whether mythic or
rational. Important additions to the material representing the symbolism and cere-
monies of the Indians have been made through the labors of Mr. Cushing in Florida,
Dr. Fewkes and Mrs. Stevenson in Arizona and New Mexico, Dr. Gatschet in Maine,
and Mr. Hewitt in New York and Ontario, as already noted. Mr. James Mooney con-
tinued his researches relating to the Kiowa Indians, giving special attention to their
heraldic and calendric systems, and to the use of the peyote or mescal in their cere-
monies. It is well known that dreams and visions, commonly induced by fasting,
play an important réle in connection with the beliefs and religious usages of primi-
tive peoples; it is known also that among some peoples drugs are used to intensify
the abnormal condition attended by visions; but there is probably no better
example of this custom than that afforded by the Kiowa and some neighboring tribes
in their use of the peyote. The mental effects of the drug are something like those
produced by hashish; its influence is so strong and so certain that the Indians using
it have come to rely on it for the production of the eestatic state regarded as essential
to the proper performance of their ceremonial rites, while, in turn, the rites have
been so adjusted to the effects produced by the drug that they are, in Mr. Mooney’s
opinion, completely dependent on it for their existence. Although the researches
concerning the subject are not complete, preliminary announcements have been made
concerning the results of scientific examination of the peyote and concerning its
influence on the religious practices of the tribe.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

In connection with his work on this subject, Mr. Mooney completed during the
year a memoir on the Kiowa calendar system, which has been incorporated in the
seventeenth annual report. This memoir is deemed noteworthy as a remarkably
exhaustive rendering of what may be called the autobiographic history of an
important tribe.

In his comparative studies of the Seri, Papago, and other tribes, Mr. McGee was
led to consider the course of development of myth or of the explanation of phe-
nomena in terms of the supernatural. It is significant that, so far as can be ascer-
tained, supernaturalism is a more potent factor in determining conduct among the
warlike Seri than among the peaceful Papage, and the examination of other tribes
indicates that the relation is general, i. e., that the tendency toward supernatural
explanation, with its concomitant effect on conduct, is gradually rectified by inter-
tribal contact in a manner akin to that in which myths and languages are blended.
The studies are still in progress.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

The preparation of material for the Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes was continued
during the year under the immediate supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge. As other
duties permitted, Mr. Hodge continued extracting and placing on cards material
relating to the Pueblo Indians and other southwestern tribes. The greater part of
the work on the cyclopedia performed (during the year was that of Dr. Thomas, who
continued and nearly completed the revision, extension, and final arrangement of the
voluminous body of material relating to the Algonquian Indians, the largest and
most diversified of the aboriginal stocks of the territory of the United States. In his
detailed report Dr. Thomas acknowledges gratefully the facilities afforded by several
libraries of the national capital, especially the Congressional Library, whose rich store
of rare literature has been most courteously made accessible by Librarian Ainsworth
R. Spofford. Some additions to the cyclopedia were made also by other collabora-
tors, particularly Mr. Mooney.

BIBLIOGRAPITY.

The bibliographic work of the Bureau was interrupted in 1895 by the death of
James C. Pilling, who had prepared a series of reports on the literature relating to
the languages of several aboriginal stocks (which were issued as bulletins during
preceding years), and who had partially completed a similar report concerning the
aboriginal languages of Mexico. During the last fiscal year an arrangement was
made whereby this portion, at least, of the bibliographic work may be completed.
The task was generously undertaken by Mr. George Parker Winship, librarian of the
John Carter Brown Library, in Providence, already a contributor of valuable material
to the Bureau. Mr. Winship began operations toward the end of the year. The
material pertaining to Mexico, brought together by Mr. Pilling, was transferred to
his custody, and by the end of the year he was able to report substantial progress in
the work.

COLLECTING.

The chief work of the year in this department was that of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes
conducted under the more immediate direction of the Secretary. Already in the
field at the beginning of the fiscal year, Dr. Fewkes proceeded to the extensive ruin
of Chevlon, on Little Colorado River, early in July. Later he excavated another
ruin of imposing dimensions near Chavez Pass. His work was successful beyond
precedent, yielding by far the finest and most extensive collection of aboriginal
fictile ware and associated artifacts ever made in the United States. As noted in
earlier paragraphs, the material is especially rich in symbolic painting and other
expressions of the remarkable religious beliefs of the pueblo peoples during prehis-
toric times.
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A noteworthy collection of ceremonial masks was made at Zuni and Sia by Mrs. -
Matilda Coxe Stevenson, and has been duly installed in the National Museum. In
the course of his field operations, Mr. Mooney obtained additional material illustrating
the handiwork and ideas of the Kiowa Indians; and toward the close of the fiscal
year, while temporarily detailed to make and arrange collections for the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition at Nashville, he brought together and, with the aid of the
Indians, constructed an exhibitshowing in miniature the characteristics of the Kiowa
camp-circle, the significance of which is not generally understood. Toward the
end of the year Mr. Hatcher reported the transmission of a small collection repre-
senting the primitive industries of the aborigines of southern Patagonia. In April
Mr. McGee obtained a small but interesting collection of aboriginal matting and
wooden ware from the Muskwaki Indians, near Tama, lowa. The greater part of the
collection has been transferred to the Museum. Among the articles is a carved
wooden dish corresponding in form, dimensions, and ornamentation with an earthen-
ware type frequently found in the mounds; the specimen is of peculiar interest in
that its form was determined by the curved beaver-tooth knife with which it was
fashioned and in that its esoteric and essentially prescriptorial symbolism was ascer-
tained, so that it explains one of the most persistent forms of aboriginal ware.
Several other collaborators made minor collections, and a few others were acquired
from correspondents. One of these is a series of iron tomahawk pipes, made for the
Indian trade by the French pioneers and long used by the tribesmen in lieu of the
aboriginal weapons of stone, shell, wood, and copper; another was a particularly fine
collection, obtained from the mounds of Missouri and the adjoining part of Illinois
by Col. F. F. Hilder; still another was a series of stone implements from the mounds
of northern Ohio, which are regarded as especially desirable for purposes of compara-
tive study in the National Museum.

PUBLICATION.

Mr. Hodge has remained in charge of the details of publication, and it is gratify-
ing to be able to report activity, almost beyond precedent in the history of the Bureau
in this branch of the work. At the beginning of the year the Fourteenth Annual
Report was partly in type, the Fifteenth was in the printer’s hands, and proofs of
illustrations had been received. The Sixteenth Report was in nearly the same con-
dition. The editorial work was pushed forward successfully. About the end of the
calendar year the Fourteenth Report was issued, in two volumes, and the distribu-
tion was at once commenced. The demand for the document was unprecedented, so
that the edition was practically exhausted within three months. It may be observed
that this report was more extensively noticed and reviewed, both in scientific jour-
nals and the ephemeral press, than any preceding publication by the Bureau, and
that the tone of the reviews has been favorable or still more highly commendatory,
without exception so far as known. Meantime the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Reports
received constant attention, and both were completed and published about the end
of the fiscal year. The demand for these documents also is pressing, and they, too,
are being favorably received by the reviewers.

The manuscript of the Seventeenth Annual Report was transmitted for publica-_
tion on June 18, 1897. The accompanying papers comprise ‘‘ The Seri Indians,” by
W J McGee; “The Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians,” by James Mooney;
‘Navajo Houses,” by Cosmos Mindeleff; together with a fully illustrated account of
the “Archeological Expedition in Arizona in 1895,” by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes.

The material for the Eighteenth Report also was brought together, and the edito-
rial work was well advanced before the end of the year. It is accompanied by two
memoirs, each of considerable magnitude, so that it will be necessary to issue it in
two volumes; the first of these is ‘‘The Eskimo of Bering Strait,” by E. W. Nelson,
and the other is the memoir on ‘‘Indian Land Cessions,” by C. C. Royce and Cyrus
Thomas, which has been described in earlier reports; the former is fully illustrated.

by photographs and drawings, representing the people and the extensive collections
made by Mr. Nelson; the latter is accompanied by numerous maps.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Library.—The additions to the working library of the Bureau were unprecedented
jn number and value, particularly in respect to standard works of reference: mean-
time the normal growth due to accessions through exchange has continued. At the
close of the fiscal year the contents of the library comprised 7,138 volumes, in addi-
tion to several thousand pamphlets and periodicals. :

Illustrations.—During the earlier part of the year the preparation of illustrations
for reports was continued under the direction of Mr. De Lancey W. Gill, the photo-
graphic work being executed by Mr. William Dinwiddie. Toward the end of the
calendar year Mr. Dinwiddie retired from the Bureau, and on January 1 Mr. Wells
M. Sawyer, formerly of the Geological Survey, was placed in charge of the illustra-
tive work, including photography. This arrangement has been found satisfactory,
and the illustrative work is now carried forward acceptably in all of its phases. Mr.
Henry Walther has aided Mr. Sawyer efficiently in cataloguing and classifying nega-
tives and prints, as well as in photographic printing.

Exhibits.—As noted incidentally in earlier paragraphs, an exhibit was prepared for
the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in Nashville. It comprises half of a Kiowa
camp-circle, represented in miniature, occupying a semicircular area with a radius
of about 20 feet in a central portion of the Government Building. The installa-
tion of the material was completed in time for the formal opening, and before the
end of the fiscal year it became evident that the display will be generally regarded
as attractive and successful.

APPENDIX III.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL
EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the operations of the
Bureau of International Exchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897:

The number of packages received from all sources for distribution during the year
was 81,162, or 7,716 less than during the preceding year, although the territory
reached by exchanges emanating from the Smithsonian Institution was increased by
the addition of 2,527 names of institutions, libraries, and individuals in other coun-
tries than the United States, while the domestic list was increased by 567. The
ageregate weight of packages handled was 247,444 pounds.

By reference to previous reports it will be noticed that three or four boxes of
United States Congressional publications have been forwarded to each of the foreign
national libraries every year, while but two boxes were forwarded during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1897. One more box to each of the fifty recipients would have
made the total number of packages transmitted by the Institution equal to that of
the previous year. It is also worthy of note that while the number of packages was
less than during the preceding year, the number of boxes shipped abroad was nearly
one-fourth greater than during the previous year. The difference is accounted for
by the fact that the number of exchange packages reported as having been received
during the fiscal year were those that had been delivered to the Institution between
July 1, 1896, and June 30, 1897, while the cases shipped during the same period con-
tained many tons of exchanges that had been delivered principally from United
States Government Departments and Bureaus during the last week of the previous
fiscal year, and which could not be forwarded during the same year in which they
were received.

The comparison of exchanges during past years shows that transmissions are
exceedingly variable, especially those from abroad, and while during one year
thousands of parcels may be received from a single society for distribution in the
United States, no more may come from the same society for two or three years, and
when there may be several such instances in a single year it is easy to understand
that the annual statistical tables must vary to a marked degree.

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is provided for in part by direct appropria-
tion by Congress to the Smithsonian Institution, and in part by the various Executive
Departments of the United States Government, which in most instances pay 5 cents
per pound for the transportation of their exchanges, both outgoing and incoming.
This charge was exacted by the Regents before the United States Government made
any appropriation whatever for exchanges, and since appropriations have been made
the exchange system has been taxed to such an extent that it has never been possible
to relinquish the practice of making this charge, which, during the past year, has
realized an income amounting to $3,334.33

The Congressional appropriation made to the Institution in support of the exchange
system for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, read as follows:

“Wor expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, nineteen thousand dollars.”

The following statement represents the receipts and expenditures on account of
the system of international exchanges for the year preceding July 1, 1897.

On account of the inadequacy of available resources with which to bear the expense
necessary to the forwarding of all exchanges by the most expeditious routes, it has
at all times been necessary to obtain free ocean freight when practicable, and while
some of the steamship companies have forwarded exchanges as promptly as other
freight on which the full rates were paid, several of the lines have only been willing
to take exchange cases when there was ample room.

To provide more adequate means with which to defray the expense of forwarding
exchanges promptly and by the fastest steamers, $2,000 was added to the appropria-
tion for 1896-97. Of this amount $1,283.53 was directly expended in the improvement
of freight facilities and the balance for the necessary increase in the cost of packing

boxes and postage.
CORRESPONDENTS.

The publication of a revised foreign exchange list authorized by the Secretary in
March, 1895, has been accomplished, and the book is now being sent to societies and
libraries in the United States, to which it will be of assistance in locating the names
of all institutions outside of the United States which have received packages through
the exchange system. This list, corrected to July 1, 1897, contains the liames of
9,414 institutions, libraries, and societies, but owing to the frequent change in the
addresses of individuals, the names of persons, with few exceptions, have not been
included in this list, although the same minute ledger account of the interchange of
publications is kept with individuals as with institutions.

There are now a total of 28,008 names on the records of the exchange bureau, an
excess of 3,094 over the preceding year; 21,427 of this number being foreign and
6,581 domestic.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

The following table shows that during the past year 10,694 parcels have been
received through the exchange service and delivered to the various Departments of
the United States Government, while 30,008 packages have been received from Gov-

RELATIVE INTERCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

Since July 1, 1896, a new feature has been adopted in the system of records of the
Exchange Bureau, showing the number of packages exchanged between the United
States and each of the other countries, thus supplying information that has not here-
tofore been obtainable without a tedious tabulation of each year’s transactions.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

From.

During the past year the exchange of parliamentary documents with Mexico has
been resumed, and twenty cases that had accumulated were forwarded on Decem-

ber 29, 1896. Hereafter each case as completed will be transmitted promptly.

The exchange of public documents with Japan has also been renewed during the

past year, but, although several attempts have been made through the Japanese
minister to induce his Government to assume the distribution of miscellaneous pub-
lications, the effort has not yet met with success.

The only countries with which exchange relations are at present entirely sus-
pended are those disturbed by strife, viz, Turkey, Greece, and Cuba. The exchange
of public documents with Turkey, however, has been reestablished, but, on account
of the difficulties in delivering consignments at Constantinople, the steamship com-
panies for the moment have declined to accept freight for that port.

The efficiency of the force of the Exchange Bureau, as well as its agents, Messrs.
William Wesley & Son, London, and Dr. Felix Fliigel, at Leipsic, is well established.
On account, however, of the increasing duties of the Leipsic agency, covering as it
does the territory of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Balkan countries, and Switzer-
land, I would respectfully recommend that the territory so covered be subdivided
and that other agents be appointed, in order to avoid too much pressure at Leipsic,
which condition is liable to exist where so much is expected of a single agency.

The following list represents the names of companies and other mediums of trans-
portation that continue to contribute free freight on exchanges or lend their aid in
the transportation and delivery of such consignments.

APPENDIX IV.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: Ihave the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897:

The close of the last year found the system of roadways in the park, authorized
by acts of Congress, still in an unfinished condition. This state of affairs has been
markedly improved by the completion of the Adams Mill road, by making the road
from Woodley practicable for carriages, and by completing the macadamization of
the main driveway through the park.

The Adams Mill road, laid out with a width of about 20 feet, has been fully mac-
adamized, the base used being broken quartz rock and the surface layer pulverized
blue limestone. It makes a very pleasant winding driveway, affording an excellent
view of the valley of Rock Creek, and while the grades upon it are steeper than is
desirable for easy driving, they are not more so than most of the roads that approach
the valley in this region.

In order to connect the roadway from Woodley with the main system of the park,
it was necessary to construct a bridge at a point considerably below the one at the
Quarry road entrance. By boring it was found that solid rock could be reached at
a short distance below the surface, and it was accordingly decided that it would not
be necessary to build a masonry foundation. By excavating the sand and gravel
sufficiently to denude this rock, and by blasting enough to obtain a good bearing
surface, a suitable bed was formed upon which to lay concrete, forming a massive
block of sufficient size to afford a solid support for the flat stones upon which could
rest the beams of an arch forming a single span of 70 feet, made as low and flat as
practicable.

The main driveway through the park, which was laid out so as to make the grades
as light as possible, proved upon practical trial to be too tortuous for the safety of
the numerous carriages that frequent it in ever increasing numbers. Some of the
more abrupt curves were accordingly modified, and its macadamization, which was
commenced last year, was then completed. Broken quartzite was used for the base
of this road, the surface being of fine gravel mixed with a small quantity of clay.
As far as can be judged by the experience of one winter, the result is satisfactory.
It is hoped that the coming year may see the entire road system of the park in such
condition that it will be possible to reach all the principal exhibits over good roads
during any season or weather.

The walks of the park have also been improved to some extent during the year.
About the principal animal house there has been constructed a granolithic footway
of ample width leading along the outer or summer cages. This walk will be prop-
erly shaded, and is a much needed improvement. From the animal house to the
main driveway there has been laid a pathway of pulverized bluestone, which is
found to be much better than the board walk formerly in use. As fast as the avail-
able funds permit, foot walks of this kind should be constructed in all parts of the
park. Although the first cost is somewhat more, their much greater durability
makes them really more economical than the unsightly board walks that now disfigure
the roadsides.

A well graded and macadamized carriage road from the street-car line of the Capi-

tal Traction Company, upon Cincinnati street, to the entrance of the park near the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

Holt house, communicating there with the Adams Mill road, would be a very desira-
ble improvement, as it would allow a much better approach than is now obtained by
the steep grade upon the Quarry road. Another carriage road should be constructed
from Connecticut avenue extended to the park, a distance of only about 180 feet,
but almost impassable during wet winter weather because of deepmud. The atten-
tion of the Commissioners of the District has been called to this matter, and I am
informed that Congress has already appropriated funds that can next year be applied
to remedying these defects.

The only permanent house that it has been possible to build during the year is one
for the zebus, or East Indian cattle. This has been placed on a hillside opposite the
buffalo house, a location not wholly desirable, yet one that brings the animals fully
to the notice of the public. It is, properly speaking, a shelter barn, made of
concrete mixed with large pebbles, the roof of tile supported upon wooden beams.
An illustration showing this house is appended hereto. About it there have been
inclosed paddocks of sufficient size for the accommodation of the animals.

Some effort has been made during the year to procure a satisfactory exhibit of the
varieties of the domesticated dog, both for the purpose of showing the amount of
variation that occurs in a single species, as well as to display typical specimens of
each breed for the information of those unacquainted with their characteristic
appearances. A similar exhibit is made at the Jardin d’Acclimatation, near Paris,
forming one of the principal features of the collection there. By corresponding
_ with breeders and dog fanciers a number of typical specimens were secured, and a
temporary wooden structure to be used as a kennel was erected not far from the
principal animal house. The exhibit has excited considerable public interest, but
the dogs being very noisy, so much so as to greatly disturb the residents on the
eastern side of the park, the principal kennel was finally removed to a more distant
and secluded situation on the western side.

An unfortunate accident has greatly retarded the growth of this collection.
Lieutenant Peary, U.S. N., temporarily withdrew from the park, for purposes of
exhibition, two of the Eskimo dogs deposited by him. After these were returned,
one of them almost immediately developed a case of distemper which, in spite of
all that could be done in the way of isolation and disinfection, ran entirely through
the kennels, affecting not only the dogs but also the wolves and foxes. Many ani-
mals, particularly the younger ones, died from it. The Eskimo dogs suffered with
especial severity, the fine group possessed by the park last year being now reduced
to a single specimen,

An extension of the paddocks for the wapiti or American elk was made impera-
tively necessary by the increase in growth of the young males received from the
Yellowstone National Park. Accordingly, there was selected for this purpose a large
tract, comprising some 9 acres, situated between Rock Creek and the fence on
the eastern side of the park, and still covered with primitive forest. This was
inclosed by means of the Page wire fence, and within it, at a short distance from
the fence, was built a small shelter for holding feed. Access to this is by an ele-
vated walk, a precaution rendered necessary by the ferocity of the males during the
fall and winter season, which makes it dangerous to enter the inclosure at that
time. The animals have made themselves entirely at home within this precinct, and
appear very much as they do in their native haunts.

It has been necessary to replace the fence for the inclosure situated on one of the
little tributaries of Rock Creek within the park where the beavers have built quite
extensively and also brought forth young. The fence, already used for some years to
confine these animals, was of strong wire mesh, but proved insufficient to withstand
their powerful teeth. Severing it in several places, they went outside their inclo-
sure and felled small trees, which they endeavored to drag into their dams. On
several occasions, notwithstanding the repeated repair of the fence, they escaped at
night, returning to the inclosure during the day, and finally one of them established
himself permanently outside and has not as yet been recovered. It being necessary
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to construct a new fence of sufficient strength to withstand the attacks of their
teeth, one was built of vertical steel rods, ;; inch in diameter, curved inward at the
top, 80 as to prevent any possibility of climbing over. This is believed to be per-
fectly effective in preventing their escape.

During the year the scope of the operations of these animals has been greatly
increased, and they have now constructed three large dams, one of which is at least
4 feet high. Each of these has been built wholly by the beavers themselves, either
from trees felled by them within the inclosure or from branches furnished them for
food. They cut this material into suitable lengths, which they drag to the water,
float to the dam, and there combine with mud and twigs to form a compact structure.
In connection with each dam they have built houses, together with several smaller
burrows in the bank. The entrance to the houses is always under water and can
only be reached by diving.

The animals have become quite accustomed to the presence of man, and it is
believed that under proper restrictions the public may be allowed to see them at
work. The paddock in which they are inclosed should be somewhat enlarged, as it
is now so small that the different families interfere with each other, and the weaker
ones can not escape from their pursuers.

On September 29, 1896, the city of Washington was pane” by one of the severest
storms that ever occurred in this region. The velocity of the wind reached for a
short time 80 miles per hour, and its force was terrific, unroofing and blowing down

‘houses and uprooting trees, so that the whole vicinity was a scene of wreck and dev-
astation. Within the park hundreds of trees were laid prostrate, and a portion of the
root of the Holt house, where the office is situated, was blown off. The roads wereso
blocked with fallen trees as to be impassable, and the fences of the elk and buffalo.
inclosures were, by the same cause, crushed in, so that for a short time there was
considerable danger that the animals might escape. Fortunately, this did not occur;
none of the animals were seriously injured, and no very serious damage was done to
‘any of the buildings. The cost of clearing away the wreckage from this storm was
over $500, and the repairing of the roof of the Holt house cost $100, sums that could
ill be spared from the limited appropriation at the disposal of the park.

The accessions to the collection during the year have not been very numerous. As
no purchase of animals was allowed, all additions must be by gift, by births, by col-
lections from the Yellowstone National Park, or by exchange.

A list of all the animals donated is appended hereto. Especially valuable and
welcome additions from this source were four harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), presented
by Mr. J. H. Starin, already well-known for his generosity; a mule deer (Cariacus
macrotis), presented by Mr. Frank Maumey, of Telluride, Colorado, and a brush-
tailed rock kangaroo (Petrogale penicillata), presented by Mr. M. J. Flood, of Sydney, -
Australia. Other valuable animals presented by Mr. Flood unfortunately died en
route. is

The most important births have been those of two sea lions (Zalophus californianus),
a buffalo (Bison americanus), a zebu (Bos indicus), and two beaver (Castor fiber).

From the Yellowstone Park there has been received during the year one consign-
ment, comprising, among other animals, six young prong-horn antelopes (dntilocapra
americana). These beautiful creatures were captured when very young, and fed by
hand until sufficiently well-grown to endure transportation. They are quite accus-
tomed to the sight of men, horses, and even dogs. They have been placed in a small
paddock at the western side of the park, and have thriven well since their arrival,
a fact of considerable interest when it is remembered that much difficulty has been
experienced by others in rearing them in captivity.

As surplus stock of any particular species accumulates in the park, effort is made
to exchange it for other animals, and thus produce a greater variety of exhibits.
By this means several most important accessions have been obtained. Among these
were an African ostrich (Siruthio camelus), an Indian antelope (Antilope cervicapra),
and two of the exceedingly rare West Indian seals (Monachus tropicalis). Unfortu-

nately there has been great difficulty in inducing these latter animals to eat, for
they do not seem to relish any of the fish or other sea products procurable in the
markets of Washington. These seals are among the most important acquisitions
ever made by the National Zoological Park. The species has been known for more
than two centuries past to exist in the Caribbean Sea, but it has been exceedingly dif-
ficult to get specimens, even the extensive zoological garden at Lon¢ on never having
possessed one. Those in the possession of the park were obtained on a small island
in the Gulf of Campeche.

I am informed by Dr. J. Eugene Jarnigan, United States consul at Utilla, Hon-
duras, that the species is Os aie seen among the reefs about 70 miles north of
Cape Gracios-a-Dios.

In concluding my report I wish to call attention to the fact that since the estab-
lishment of the National Zoological Park there have been many other enterprises of
a similar character projected and established in various parts of the country, and
that these are, as a rule, supported by far greater resources than are allowed for the
national collection. Among these I will mention the following:

The Blue Mountain Forest Park, established by the late Mr. Austin Corbin, is a
large tract of forest and abandoned farm land, situated in the western part of New
Hampshire, comprising an inclosed area of 26,000 acres. Within this inclosure are
kept about 4,000 wild animals, including 74 bison, 200 moose, 1,500 elk, 1,700 deer of
different species, and 150 wild boars. These animals are rapidly multiplying, and,
with the exception of the bison, which are sheltered and fed during the winter, live
in perfect freedom.

In the Adirondack region of New York a game preserve of 9,000 acres has been
stocked with elk, Virginia deer, mule deer, rabbits, pheasants, etc., and Mr. W. C.
Whitney has established a preserve of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire hills, near Lenox,
Mass., where he maintains not only the species of animals above mentioned, but also
bison and antelope. Other preserves are Ne-ha-sa-ne Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000
acres; Tranquillity Park, near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve,
near Tacoma, Wash., 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St. Paul, Minn., 400 acres, and
Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, New York, 600 acres. These are all fenced inclos-
ures, well stocked with animals.

At Pittsburg, Pa., certain public-spirited citizens have undertaken, iu one of the
public parks, the construction of a number of buildings intended for the exhibition
of animals. These are already nearing completion and will cost more than $200,000,
exclusive of the animals they are to contain. A further collection of buildings and
inclosures intended for American animals only is also projected for that city.

In 1895 certair gentlemen interested in natural history organized the New York
Zoological Society, whose objects are stated to be as follows:

“ First.—The establishment of a free zoological park containing collections of
North American and exotic animals, for the benefit and enjoyment of the general
public, the zoologist, the sportsman, ‘and every lover of nature.

“ Second.—The “systematic encouragement of interest in animal life or zoology
among all classes of the people and the promotion of zoological science in general.

“ Third.—Cooperation with other organizations in the preservation of the native

animals of North America and encouragement of the growing sentiment against
their wanton destruction.”

To carry out this plan these gentlemen obtained from the city of New York a
grant of some 261 acres in the southern portion of Bronx Park, near that city, for
the purpose of establishing there a zoological garden, which is to be free to the pub-
lic for at least five daysin each week. Plans are now being prepared for the deveiop-
ment of a collection on the most generous and attractive scale. The bulletin issued
by the society states that it is expected that there will be at once spent $125,000 for
preparing the ground and $250,000 for buildings and inclosures.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Str: The work of the observatory during the past year has consisted largely in
preparing for publication an account of the research on the positions of absorption
bands in the infra-red solar spectrum.

In this report, which was completed in May, 1897, but which, owing to unavoid-
able delay, has not yet appeared in type, the positions of about 225 absorption lines
and bands are determined in deviation and refractive index for a 60° rock-salt prism
at the temperature of 20° centigrade. These lines are distributed in the salt spec-
trum between deviations of 40° 25’ and 38° 45’, corresponding to wave lengths 0.76
and 5.20 4, respectively. The average error probable in the absolute angular devia-
tions of these lines is about 4 seconds of arc, but in their relative deviations meas-
ured from the A line in the visible spectrum the probable error averages only about
0.5 seconds of arc, a degree of accuracy even exceeding the anticipations held forth
in last year’s report. The bolographs from which these results were obtained were
taken on exceptionally favorable occasions between October 26, 1896, and January 9,
1897. These bolographs, 13 in number, were selected from among many more, of
all degrees of excellence, taken during the same interval.

The forthcoming report contains, in addition to the results above mentioned, an
account of the investigations leading up to this research on the infra-red absorption
lines; a description of the successive improvements in the instrumental conditions
which have rendered possible the present results; a description of the present appa-
ratus and its adjustment; and a discussion of present sources of error and the pos-
sibility of future progress. The results of several subsidiary investigations are
given, among others being the change of deviation of rock salt with change of tem-
perature, the heat conductivity of rock salt, the effect of diffraction in decreasing
the intensity of energy in the spectrum with narrowing slit widths. The report is
illustrated with reproductions of photographs and drawings of apparatus, platted
curves explanatory of various matters, bolographic curves, and line spectra similar to
that here given. With the illustrations, the report is expected to cover about 175
quarto pages.

DETAILS OF THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

There have been taken during the year 83 bolographs (none were taken after Jan-
uary 20, 1897), of which about one-third are notably superior to any of previous
years in freedom from ‘‘drift” and accidental inflections, in genuine detail, and in
accuracy of position. On 6 bolographs covering the region 0.76 y to 2 , and 7 con-
tinuing from 1.8 « to 5.5 uw, all the lines determined to be “real,” after the manner
described in the report of last year, have been measured in position upon a compara-
tor, both to determine the deviation in the spectrum and the relative intensity of
energy at the various points. Each curve was twice independently measured.

These measurements were reduced and tables prepared of deviations, indices of
refraction, approximate wave lengths, and giving the relative importance of the
lines discovered (about 225 in number), and the relative intensities of energy at the
corresponding points in the solar spectrum. A composite linear photograph has
been prepared from three curves, for purposes of illustration after the manner here-
tofore described.

INFRA-RED SOLAR SPECTRUM OF A 60° ROCK-SALT PRISM, 6.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

A determination has been made of the change in deviation of the A line with
change of temperature of the salt prism. The value obtained was —12.0| 0.4” for
the change in deviation, corresponding to 1° rise in the temperature of the prism.

Interesting results were obtained, experimentally, showing that for slit widths less
than 0.15 millimeter the increase in the loss of energy by diffraction is very rapid.
An investigation was begun, and bids fair to end successfully, with the design of
constructing a galvanometer far more sensitive than the one in present use, which
may enable a considerable gain to be made in the number of lines to be discovered
by the bolographic method of spectrum analysis.

ACQUISITIONS AND ALTERATIONS OF APPARATUS.

1. A concave mirror 26 centimeters in diameter and of 230 centimeters principal
focal length was obtained for use in the system of collimation by two mirrors, as
proposed in last year’s report, and actually installed with advantage in August, 1896.
The metal work required in the mirror mountings was done at the Observatory shop.

2. Three very accurate optical flats, 12 centimeters in diameter, were procured for
testing the faces of the salt prism during its occasional polishings, and for use as
plane mirrors when required.

3. A train of totally reflecting prisms, so adjusted as to invert an image, was
obtained for use with the 6-inch telescope as an erecting eyepiece.

4. A number of large blocks of sait were received through the courtesy of the
Russian Government, and from one of the blocks, which promised good optical qual-
ity, there was cut a large prism. On polishing, however, the quality of the interior
was found to be so far below the exterior appearance that the prism has not been
made use of. The optical work on the pieces of apparatus above mentioned was
done by Mr. J. A. Brashear.

5. A Zeiss anastigmatic wide-angle photographic lens was procured for use in
photographing interior rooms.

6. A Nachet compound microscope with mechanical stage and various accessories
was obtained and is frequently used for measurements of bolometer threads and
other small objects.

7. There have been made at the Observatory shop during the year, in addition to
such repairs as were required, the following pieces of apparatus:

- a. Bearing for circle shaft to insure greater accuracy of motion.

b, A mounting for oblong plane mirror and prism to form an auxiliary fixed-arm
spectroscope. This piece of apparatus was used in the determination of the change
of deviation of rock salt with change of temperature.

c. A special rheostat for balancing the bolometer, provided with a slide wire oper-
ated mechanically from without, and all inclosed by a water jacket. —

8. It was shown that the circle of the spectrometer moved less accurately than was
desired, and that the error arose in the action of the worm-and-wheel mechanism,
which connects it with the clock. Messrs. Warner and Swasey undertook the task of
replacing the worm and wheel-segment in use, by others of the desired degree of
accuracy. In this they were successful, and the degree of accuracy attained may be
inferred when it is said that it is required that the position of the circle shall not be
inerror by more that 0.5 second of arc, which corresponds to a linear distance of
0.00003 inch on the circumference where the worm and wheel-segment is applied.

9. A comparator for the measurement of bolographs in ordinates and abscissa was
procured of Warner & Swasey. The specifications were prepared at the Observa-
tory with a provisional design which was elaborated and modified by the makers.

10. The large Zeiss photographic lens has been fitted with a Prosch rapid shutter.

11. A new motor and a set of small taps and dies have been added to the shop
equipment. ;

12. On the recommendation of Dr. Kayser, of the University of Bonn, who inspected
the Observatory during a visit to this country, sulphuric acid has been used to dry the
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

spectrometer chamber in the place of lime, as heretofore. A lead tank about 6 feet
long and 15 inches wide is supplied with about a gallon ata time of crude sulphuric
acid. This acid will abstract more than an equal volume of water from the air
before requiring changing, and its use has been attended with very satisfactory
results in preserving the faces-of the rock-salt optical apparatus.

GENERAL ALTERATIONS.

The Observatory has received necessary repairs, and has beenrepainted. Its color
is now a light drab, and the roof is white in place of the previous brown. Itis
found that the difference of the temperature maxima of thermometers within and
without the Observatory has become nearly 4° C. greater since the repainting. This
greatly ameliorates the condition of the observers.

It is proposed to introduce a system of cooling by ammonia gas, to be regulated
automatically, so that the apparatus can be maintained through the months of
April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, as in the winter, at a
standard, constant temperature. As much of the clear observing weather comes in
these months, much is hoped from this change.

PERSONNEL.

Mr. L. E. Emerson closed his period of service at the Observatory July 1, 1897.

SUMMARY.

I may sum up the result of the year’s work by saying that the positions of between
200 and 300 lines in the infra-red solar spectrum have been accurately established ;
that an account of the researches of the observatory has been prepared for publica-
tion; and that the instrumental equipment has reached a state of excellence never
before equaled.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Sir: I have the honor to present herewith a report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1897.

The entry numbers of accessions to the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Con-
gress extend from 339,340 to 364,972.

The following table gives an analysis, in volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets,
and charts, during the year:

In addition to this there have been added to the Secretary’s library, office library,
and the library of the Astrophysical Observatory, 332 volumes and pamphlets, and
2,044 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,376, and a grand total of accessions for
the year of 35,912 volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts.

These accessions show a gain of 992 in volumes, parts of volumes, and charts
over the previous year, and in the number of entries, 793.

The following universities have sent complete sets of their academic publications,
including inaugural dissertations:

Basel. Freiberg. Kiel. Pennsylvania.
Berlin. Giessen. Konigsberg. Strassburg.
Bern. Griefswald. Leipzig. Tubingen.
Bonn. Halle-am-Saale. Louvain. Utrecht.
Breslau. Heidelberg. Lund. Wurzburg.
Cornell. Helsingfors. Marburg. Zurich.
Dorpat. 3 Jena. Montevideo.

Erlanger. Johns Hopkins. Montreal.

While it is not possible to specify the large number of academies, learned societies,
editors of periodicals, and private persons who have sent their publications to the
Institution, one gift is deserving of especial notice, that of Mr. 8. Patcanof, of St.
Petersburg. Mr. Patcanof presented over 300 volumes, including manuscripts,
printed books, and pamphlets, relating to oriental and Russian philology, archzeology,
geography, and folklore, and more especially works relating to Armenian literature.
The collection includes quite a number of rare works.

Several months were spent in revising the list of foreign establishments to which
Smithsonian publications were being sent. It was found that many of them were
not sending an adequate return, and a systematic correspondence has been begun

with a view to remedying this state of affairs.
69
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A check list of scientific periodicals in the Smithsonian library is being prepared
for the new edition of Dr. Bolton’s Bibliography of Scientific Periodicals, to be issued
by the Institution. In view of the very large number of publications of this charac-
ter belonging to the Institution, the preparation of this list entails much labor and
is not yet completed. :

In accordance with the plan of the Secretary for increasing the library exchanges,
673 letters were written for new exchanges and for completing series already in the
library, with the result that 104 new exchanges were added to the list and 101 defec-
tive series were either completed or added to as far as the publishers could supply
the missing parts.

I have little doubt but that much more could be done in this direction if more
assistance could be had. The preparation and revision of lists and the examination
of the library records for the ascertainment of missing parts requires much and
careful labor, and must necessarily proceed slowly. The time occupied in writing
the letters is but trifling, compared with that required for the preliminary work.

During the year I attended two meetings of the American Library Association—one
at Cleveland, in August, 1896, at which I presented a paper entitled ‘‘ Fifty years of
library promotion at the Smithsonian Institution,” and at the meeting of the same
association held at Philadelphia in June, 1897, a paper on the proposed ‘‘Interna-
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature.”

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX VII.
REPORT OF THE EDITOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the publications of the
Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1897:

I. CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

Two memoirs of the Contributions have been issued this year, each of them hay-
ing been submitted in the Hodgkins fund prize competition.

No. 1033. Argon; a New Constituent of the Atmosphere; by Lord Rayleigh and
Prof. William Ramsay. (Part of Vol. XXIX of Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.) Quarto pamphlet of 43 pages, illustrated with 5 text figures.

This memoir was submitted in competition for one of the Hodgkins Fund prizes
offered by the Smithsonian Institution, and the first prize of $10,000, for a treatise
embodying some new and important discovery in regard to the nature or properties
of atmospheric air, was awarded to Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay for their
discovery of ‘‘Argon,”’ anew element of the atmosphere. The authors give a detailed
description of the apparatus and methods of their investigation.

No. 1034. Atmospheric Actinometry and the Actinic Constitution of the Atmos-
phere; by E. Duclaux, professor of physics in the Agronomical Institute at Paris.
(Part of Vol. XXIX of Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.) Quarto pamphlet
of 48 pages.

Professor Duclaux summarizes his work as follows:

“1. The oxidation of oxalic acid in a weak solution takes place mainly, and almost
exclusively, under the influence of the chemical rays of solar light; it can therefore
be used as an actinometric measure.

“<2. It depends on the concentration of the liquid, which for the best results should
not exceed about 3 grams per liter.

“3. With an equal volume of solution combustion decreases as depth increases.
There is an absorption of chemical rays, although the liquid is and remains very
transparent.

“4. For equal depths of liquid, combustion is proportional to the surface, and con-
sequently also to the volume.

“5. It depends on the age of the solution—that is to say, of the time which has
elapsed since preparation. As it grows older an oxalic solution becomes more sensi-
tive and attains a certain maximum which is quite stable and quite regular. it is
well to wait till this state of sensitiveness has been produced.

“6. The daily combustion, such as is measured with sterilized liquids, varies from
one day to another much more than any other meteorological phenomenon, and, while
subject to the influence of what we call ‘fine weather’ and ‘overcast weather,’ it
manifests very clearly other influences which are less visible.

“7, It shows also the influence of the seasons, and manifestly exhibits a maximum
in spring.

aR. It is but feebly subject to the influence of altitude.

“9. On the other hand, it betrays so strongly the presence of divers oxidizable
essences or substances in the air that we must consider local and daily variations
as due to the presence in the atmosphere of actinic clouds, which are discoverable
only by the reduction and absorption which they produce in the chemical radiations
of sunlight.

“10. The atmosphere of extreme northern regions is less absorbent than that of
our temperate zones, and, consequently, at the same hours of the day actinic radia-
tion is more powerful, at the level of the soil, in the north than at the center of
Europe.

71
a2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

“11. Northern countries add to this cause of superiority, which they owe to the
constitution of their atmosphere, another, which is due to their geographical posi-
tion, namely, that the actinic effect of the sun increases more ra)idly than the
duration of its presence above the horizon. The very long days of the north dur-
ing the period of vegetation are, therefore, in their actinic effect more active than
an equal number of days in our temperate regions, and we can thus explain the par-
ticularly intense rate of the progress which vegetation makes in the vicinity of the
polar circle. e

‘12. This increase of sensitiveness which oxalic acid experiences in the sun does
not cease when the light begins to fade, and may continue several days. Hence fol-
lows a conclusion which may also be applied to our temperate regions. This is that
the actinic effect of a number of fine days in succession increases more rapidly than
its duration, and also that the effect of a fine morning is not lost by a dark and
cloudy evening.

“13. We must therefore give up the hope of finding, in the duration of a day or
of solar action, a measure of its effects, and meteorological instruments which
accept such a proportionality are to be rejected.

“14. The importance of these actinic phenomena in the general economy of the
world is great enough to make it necessary that we should approach the investiga-
tion by appropriate means.”

II. SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

The series of Miscellaneous Collections now includes 36 completed volumes,
embracing 173 distinct papers, besides parts of 4 additional volumes. The following
were published during the past fiscal year:

No. 1035. Mountain Observatories in America and Europe, by Edward S. Holden,
director of the Lick Observatory. (Part of Vol. XXX VII of Smithsonian Miscella-
neous Collections.) Octavo pamphlet of v1, 77 pages, with 24 full page illustrations.

In this paper Professor Holden describes the conditions of good vision at moun-
tain stations all over the globe, and makes a short study of the high-level observa-
tories in this country and Europe. The main scientific and practical conclusions to
be drawn from the facts presented are stated by Professor Holden as follows:

“‘Briefly they show the necessity for a careful examination of the sites proposed
for an astronomical (or meteorological) observatory before a final choice is made.
They prove that while some mountain stations present great advantages for astro-
nomical and astrophysical observatories, this is by no means the case for all. And
they point out that the more frequent use of balloons, etc., in meteorology is likely
to result in a rapid advance in our knowledge of the physics of the atmosphere, and
to do away, in a great degree, with the need for permanent meteorological stations
at high levels.

“Tt appears that different researches require different conditions. All would be
best done at a station where both steadiness and transparency were absolute. But
some can be very well performed under less perfect conditions. If one is searching
for the site for a new observatory, both conditions should be insisted upon; if one
is planning work at a station already established, the work should be chosen so that
it can be well done under existing conditions.

“None of these (and other) obvious conclusions are new. The mass of evidence
will, however, bring new conviction even to those most familiar with it; and it may
serve as a check on the wasteful expenditure of public and private endowments.
The subsidies to science, great as they are, thanks to the generosity of governments
and of individuals, must be carefully husbanded if we are to exploit its entire
domain, which is enlarging day by day.”

No. 1037. Methods for the Determination of Organic Matter in Air, by David
Hendricks Bergey, B. S., M. D., of the University of Pennsylvania. (Part of Vol.
XXXIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo pamphlet of 1, 28 pages,
with 3 text figures.

The difficulties that were encountered in estimating the quantity of organic mat-
ter in expired air, while conducting the research on the Composition of Expired Air
and its Effects upon Animal Life, are said by Dr. Bergey to have demonstrated the
fact that some of the methods in use were unsatisfactory. He reviews various
forms of apparatus used by foreign and American investigators, and concludes as
follows:

“J. The quantity of organic matter bears an intimate relation to the amount of

dust floating in the air. It is probable that the gaseous organic matter forms but
an exceedingly small proportion of the total organic matter.

cs Del EI
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

“<2. The attachment of a dust filter of asbestus to the absorption apparatus pro-
duces results that are constantly lower than those obtained without the dust filter.

“The most reliable method for the estimation of organic matter in air is that
known as Remsen’s method, and is called Method IIa in this research.!. The pum-
ice stone seems to be the best form of absorbent material, because it can be thor-
oghly cleansed by heat without changing its condition or usefulness.

“‘4. Those methods which determine the or ganic matter from its reducing action
on permanganate do not seem to afford as satisfactory results as those in which
the organic matter is estimated as ammonia.”

No. 1038. Smithsonian Physical Tables, prepared by Thomas Gray. (Part of Vol.
XXXV of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo volume of xxxiv, 301
pages.

“Tn connection with the system of meteorological observations established by the
Smithsonian Institution about 1850, a series of “meteorolog ical tables was compiled
by Dr. Arnold Guyot, at the request "of Seer etary Henry, and was published in 1852.
A second edition was issued in 1857, and a third edition, with further amendments,
in 1859. Though primarily designed for meteorological observers reporting to the
Smithsonian Institution, the tables were so widely, used. by physicists that, after
twenty-five years of valuable service, the work was again revised and a fourth edi-
tion was published in 1884. In a few years the demand for the tables exhausted the
edition, and it appeared to Secretary Langley desirable to recast the work entirely,
rather than to undertake its revision again. It was decided to publish a new work
in three parts—Meteorological Tables, Geographical Tables, and Physical Tables—
each representative of the latest knowledge in its field, and independent of the
others, but the three forming a homogeneous series. Althou gh thus historically
related to Dr. Guyot’s tables, “the present work is so entirely changed with respect
to material, arranevement, and presentation that it is not a fifth edition of the older
tables, but "essentially a new publication.”

The first volume of the new series, the Meteorological Tables, appeared in 1893, and
a second edition was published in 1896. The second volume, the Geographical Tables,
prepared by Prof. R. 8. Woodward, was published in 1894. The volume of Physical
Tables, forming the third of the series, was published during this year. It was pre-
pared by Prof. Thomas Gray, of the Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terre Haute, Ind.
In the preface to the tables Professor Gray says:

“In the space assigned to this book it was impossible to include, even approxi-
mately, allthe physical data available. The object has been to make the tables easy
of reference and to contain the data most frequently required. In the subjects
included it has been necessary in many cases to make brief selections from a large
number of more or less discordant results obtained by different experimenters.
I have endeavored, as far as possible, to compile the tables from papers which are
vouched for by well-known autborities, or which, from the method of experiment
and the apparent care taken in the investigation, seem likely to give reliable results.

“‘Such matter as is commonly found in books of mathematical tables has not been
included, as it seemed better to utilize the space for physical data. Some tables of
a mathematical character which are useful to the physicist, and which are less easily
found, have been given. Many of these have been calculated for this book, and
where they have not been so calculated their source is given.

“The authorities from which the physical data have been derived are quoted on
the same page with the table, and this is the case also with regard to explanations
of the meaning or use of the tabular numbers. In many cases the actual numbers
given in the tables are not to be found in the memoirs quoted. In such cases the
tabular numbers have been obtained by interpolation or calculation from the pub-
lished results. The reason for this is the desirability of uniform change of argument
in the tables, in order to save space and to facilitate comparison of results. Where
it seemed desirable the tables contain values both in metric and in British units, but
as a rule the centimeter, gram, and second have been used as fundamental units.
In the comparison of British and metric units, and quantities expressed in them, the
meter has been taken as equal to 39.37 inches, which is the legal ratio in the U nited
States. It is hardly possible that a series of tables, such as those here given, involy-~

it is hoped that these are not so numerous as to seriously detract from the use of the
book.”

No. 1039. Virginia Cartography: A Bibliographical Description, by P. Lee Phil-
lips. (Part of Vol. XXXVII, Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 85 pages.

Mr. Phillips’s work is a bibliographical description of all known maps of Virginia
since the year 1585. Special mention is made of the John With, or John White, map
of 1585, the Capt. John Smiu. — > 9f1608, and the map made by Augustine Herman
in 1670, now exceedingly rare. These three maps were copied by nearly all map
makers up to 1751, when the Fry and Jefferson map appeared. The list comprises in
all about 300 maps.

No. 1071. Air and Life, by Henry De Varigny, of the Paris Museum of Natural
History. (Part of Vol. XX XIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 69 pages.

Dr. Varigny’s essay was awarded the Hodgkins prize of $1,000 for the best popular
essay on atmospheric air. In order to give this work, as also those of Mr. Russell
and Dr. Cohen, as wide a circulation as possible they have been printed both in the
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections and in the Annual Report, separate editions
from the report being also issued in pamphlet form. Dr. Varigny in a popular
manner discusses air from the physical and from the chemical point of view, and after
explaining the biological réle of the chemical constituents of the air concludes
with a chapter on the biological réle of air physically considered.

No. 1072. The Atmosphere in Relation to Human Life and Health, by Francis
Albert Rollo Russell, vice-president of the Royal Meteorological Society. (Part of
Vol. XXXIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octayo pamphlet of 148
pages.

This essay by Mr. Russell which was awarded a silver medal in the Hodgkins prize
competition, is a discussion of the principal functions of the various elements and
substances of which the atmosphere is composed, with special reference to their
influence upon human life and welfare. It also discusses the influence of climate
upon national health and shows in what manner the spreading of infectious or
epidemic diseases in the animal world and in mankind depends, in a very great degree,
upon aerial influences. In conclusion the author indicates lines of research in the
study of atmospheric air that may be beneficial to mankind.

No. 1073. The Air of Towns, by Dr. J. B. Cohen, of Yorkshire College, Leeds, Eng-
land. (Part of Vol. XXXIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 41 pages, with 2 text figures and 21 full-page illustrations.

Dr. Cohen’s paper was also entered in the Hodgkins prize competition, and was
granted honorable mention by the committee of award and recommended for publi-
cation by the Institution. The author treats the subject in the form of four lectures
on “Close rooms,” “Smoke,” ‘‘Town fog,” and “The germs of the air.” In the
discussion of the several topics Dr. Cohen indicates the many impurities in the air
of cities, especially where there is much smoke from factory chimneys, and suggests
various remedies for exterminating the impurities or for alleviating the danger
therefrom. The paper is accompanied by a number of illustrations of atmospheric
microbes and of apparatus used in his investigation of the atmosphere of cities.

No. 1075. The Constants of Nature. Part V. A Recalculation of the Atomic
Weights, by Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, chief chemist of the United States Geo-
logical Survey. New edition, revised and enlarged. (Part of Vol. XXXVIII,
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo pamphlet of v1, 370 pages.

“This work is one of a series devoted to the discussion and more precise determi-
nation of various ‘constants of nature,’ and forms the fifth contribution to that
subject published by this Institution.

“The first number of the series, embracing tables of ‘Specific gravities’ and of

‘Melting and boiling points of bodies,’ prepared by the same author, Prof. F. W.
Clarke, was ) ublished in 1873. The fourth part of the series, comprising a com-

plete digest of the various ‘Atomic weight’ determinations of the chemical ele-
ments published since 1814, commencing with the well-known “Table of equivalents,’
by Wollaston (given in the Philosophical Transactions for that year), compiled by
Mr. George F. Becker, was published by the Institution in 1880. The present work
comprises a very full discussion and recalculation of the ‘Atomic weights’ from all
the existing data and the assignment of the most probable value to each of the
elements. ,

“The first edition of this work was published in 1882, and this new edition, revised
and enlarged by Professor Clarke, contains new information accumulated during the
past fifteen years.”

No. 1077. Equipment and Work of an Aero-physical Observatory, by Alexander
MeAdie. (Part of Vol. XXXIX, Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 30 pages. Mr. McAdie’s essay was submitted in the Hodgkins fund
prize competition and was awarded honorable mention with a bronze medal.

GENERAL APPENDIX

SMEPHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1897,

sm 97—_6
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers -as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent’ collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1897.

ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. !

By Smwon NEwcome.

The University of Chicago yesterday accepted one of the most
munificent gifts ever made for the promotion of any single science, and
with appropriate ceremonies dedicated it to the increase of our knowl-
edge of the heavenly bodies.

The president of your university has done me the honor of inviting
me to supplement what was said on that occasion by some remarks of
a more general nature suggested by the celebration. One is naturally
disposed to say first what is uppermost in his mind. At the present
moment this will naturally be the general impression made by what has
been seen and heard. The ceremonies were attended, not only by a
remarkable delegation of citizens, but by a number of visiting astrono-
mers which seems large when we consider that the profession itself is
not at all numerous in any country. As one of these, your guests, I am
sure that I give expression only to their unanimous sentiment in say-
ing that we have been extremely gratified in many ways by all that we
have seen and heard. The mere fact of so munificent a gift to science
can not but excite universal admiration. We knew well enough that
it was nothing more than might have been expected from the public
spirit of this great West; but the first view of a towering snow peak is
none the less impressive because you have learned in your geography
how many feet high it is, and great acts are none the less admirable
because they correspond to what you have heard and read, and might
therefore be led to expect.

The next gratifying feature is the great public interest excited by the
occasion. That the opening of a purely scientific institution should
have led so large an assemblage of citizens to devote an entire day,
including a long journey by rail, to the celebration of yesterday is
something most suggestive from its unfamiliarity. A great many Sci-
entific establishments have been inaugurated during the last half cen-
tury, but if on any such occasion so large a body of citizens has gone so

great a distance to take part in the inauguration the fact has at the
moment escaped my mind. :

That the interest thus shown is not confined to the hundreds of
attendants, but must be shared by your great public, is shown by the
unfailing barometer of journalism. Here we have a field in which the
nonsurvival of the unfit is the rule in its most ruthless form. The
journals that we see and read are merely the fortunate few of a count-
less number, dead and forgotten, that did not know what the public
wanted to read about. The eagerness shown by the representatives of
your press in recording everything your guests would say was accom-
plished by an enterprise in making known everything that occurred,
and, in case of an emergency requiring a heroic measure, what did not
occur, showing that smart journalists of the Hast must have learned
their trade, or at least breathed their inspiration, in these regions. ~ I
think it was some twenty years since I told a European friend that the
eighth wonder of the world was a Chicago daily newspaper. Since
that time the course of journalistic enterprise has been in the reverse
direction to that of the course of empire, eastward instead of westward.

It has been sometimes said—wrongfully, I think—that scientific men
form a mutual admiration society. One feature of the occasion made
me feel that we, your guests, ought then and there to have organized
such a society and forthwith proceeded to business. This feature con-
sisted in the conferences on almost every branch of astronomy by
which the celebration of yesterday was preceded. The fact that beyond
the acceptance of a graceful compliment I contributed nothing to these
conferences relieves me from the charge of bias or self-assertion in
saying that they gave me a new and most inspiring view of the energy
now being expended in research by the younger generation of astrono-
mers. All the experience of the past leads us to believe that this
energy will reap the reward which nature always bestows upon those
who seek her acquaintance from unselfish motives. In one way it
might appear that little was to be learned from a meeting lke that of
the present week. Each astronomer may know by publications per-
taining to the science what all the others are doing. But knowledge
obtained in this way has a sort of abstractness about it a little like our
knowledge .of the progress of civilization in Japan, or of the great
extent of the Australian continent. It was, therefore, a most happy
thought on the part of your authorities to bring together the largest
‘possible number of visiting astronomers from Europe, as well as
America, in order that each might see, through the attrition of personal
contact, what progress the others were making in their researches. To
the visitors at least I am sure that the result of this meeting has been
extremely gratifying. They earnestly hope, one and all, that the callers
of the conference will not themselves be more disappointed in its
results; that however little they may have actually to learn of methods
and results, they will feel stimulated to well-directed efforts and find
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 87

themselves inspired by thoughts which, however familiar, will now be
more easily worked out.

We may pass from the aspects of the case as seen by the strictly pro-
fessional class to those general aspects fitted to excite the attention of
the great public. From the point of view of the latter it may well
appear that the most striking feature of the celebration is the great
amount of effort which is shown to be devoted to the cultivation of a
‘field quite outside the ordinary range of human interests.

A little more than two centuries ago Huyghens prefaced an account
of his discoveries on the planet Saturn with the remark that many,
even among the learned, might think he had been devoting to things
too distant to interest mankind an amount of study which would
better have been devoted to subjects of more immediate concern. It
must be admitted that this fear has not deterred succeeding astrono-
mers from pursuing their studies. The enthusiastic students whom we
see around us are only a detachment from an army of investigators
who, in many parts of the world, are seeking to explore the mysteries
of creation. Why so great an expenditure of energy? Certainly not to
gain wealth, for astronomy is perhaps the one field of scientific work
which, in our expressive modern phrase, “has no money in it.” It is true
that the great practical use of astronomical science to the country and
the world in affording us the means of determining positions on land and
at sea is frequently pointed out. It is said that an Astronomer Royal
of England once calculated that every meridian observation of the
moon made at Greenwich was worth a pound sterling on account of
the help it would afford to the navigation of the ocean. An accurate
map of the United States can not be constructed without astronomical
observations at numerous points scattered over the whole country,
aided by data which great observatories have been accumulating for
more than a century, and must continue to accumulate in the future.

But neither the measurement of the Earth, the making of maps, nor
the aid of the navigator is the main object which the astronomers of
today have in view. If they do not quite share the sentiment of that
eminent mathematician, who is said to have thanked God that his sei-
ence was one which could not be prostituted to any useful purpose,
they still know well that to keep utilitarian objects in view would only
prove a handicap on their efforts. Consequently they never ask in
what way their science is going to benefit mankind.

As the great captain of industry is moved by the love of wealth, and
the politician by the love of power, so the astronomer is moved by the
love of knowledge for its own sake, and not for the sake of its applica-
tion. Yet he is proud to know that his science has been worth more to
mankind than it has cost. He does not value its results merely as a
means of crossing the ocean or mapping the country, for he feels that
man does not live by bread alone. If it is not more than bread to know
the place we occupy in the universe, it is certainly something which
88 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

we should place not far behind the means ot subsistence. That we now
look upon a comet as something very interesting, of which the sight
affords us a pleasure unmixed with fear of war, pestilence, or other
calamity, and of which we therefore wish the return, is a gain we can
not measure by money. In all ages astronomy has been an index to
the civilization of the people who cultivated it. It has been crude or
exact, enlightened or mingled with superstition, according to the cur-
rent mode of thought. When once men understand the relation of the’
planet on which they dwell to the universe at large, superstition is
doomed to speedy extinction. This alone is an object worth more than
money.

Astronomy may fairly claim to be that science which transcends all
others in its demands upon the practical application of our reasoning
powers. Look at the stars that stud the heavens on a clear evening.
What more hopeless problem to one confined to earth than that of
determining their varying distances, their motions, and their physical
constitution? Everything on earth we can handle and investigate.
But how investigate that which is ever beyond our reach, on which we
can never make an experiment? On certain occasions we see the moon
pass in front of the sun and hide it from our eyes. To an observer a
few miles away the sun was not entirely hidden, for the shadow of the
moon in a total eclipse is rarely 100 miles wide. On another continent
no eclipse at all may have been visible. Who shall take a map of the
world and mark upon it the line on which the moon’s shadow will
travel during some eclipse a hundred years hence? Who shall map
out the orbits of the heavenly bodies as they are going to appear in a
hundred thousand years? How shall we ever know of what chemical
elements the sun and the stars are made? All this has been done, but
not by the intellect of any one man. The road to the stars has been
opened only by the efforts of many generations of mathematicians and
observers, each of whom began where his predecessor had left off.

We have reached a stage where we know much of the heavenly bodies.
We have mapped out our solar system with great precision. But
how with that great universe of millions of stars in which our solar
system is only a speck of star dust, a speck which a traveler through
the wilds of space might pass a hundred times without notice? We
have learned much about this universe, though our knowledge of it is
still dim. We see it as a traveler on a mountain top sees a distant
city in a cloud of mist, by a few specks of glimmering light from
steeples or roofs. We want to know more about it, its origin and its
destiny; its limits in time and space, if it has any; what function it
serves in the universal economy. The journey is long, yet we want, in
knowledge at least, to reach the stars. Hence we build observatories
and train. observers and investigators. Slow indeed is progress in the
solution of the greatest of problems, when measured by what we want
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 89

to know. Some questions may require centuries, others thousands of
years for their answer. And yet never was progress more rapid than
during our time. In some directions our astronomers of to-day are
out of sight of those of fifty years ago; we are even gaining heights
which tweuty years ago looked hopeless. Never before had the astron-
omer so much work—good, hard, yet hopeful work—before him as to-day.
He who is leaving the stage feels that he has only begun, and must
leave his successors with more to do than his predecessors left him.

To us an interesting feature of this progress is the part taken in
it by our own country. The science of our day, it is true, is of no
country. Yet we very appropriately speak of American science from
the fact that our traditional reputation has not been that of a people
deeply interested in the higher branches of intellectual work. Men
yet living can remember when in the eyes of the universal church
of learning all cisatlantic countries, our own included, were partes
infidelium.

Yet American astronomy is not entirely of our generation. In the
middle of the last century Professor Winthrop, of Harvard, was an
industrious observer of eclipses and kindred phenomena, whose work
was recorded in the transactions of learned societies. But the greatest
astronomical activity during our colonial period was that called out
by the transit of Venus in 1769, which was visible in this country. A
committee of the American Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia,
organized an excellent systems of observations, which we now know
to have been fully as successful, perhaps more so, than the majority of
those made on other continents, owing mainly to the advantages of air
and climate. Among the observers was the celebrated Rittenhouse,
to whom is due the distinction of having been the first American
astronomer whose work has an important place in the history of the
science. In addition to the observations which he has left us, he was
the first inventor or proposer of the collimating telescope, an instru-
ment which has become almost a necessity wherever accurate observa-
tions are made. The fact that the subsequent invention by Bessel was
quite independent does not detract from the merits of either.

Shortly after the transit of Venus, which I have mentioned, the war
of the Revolution commenced. The generation which carried on that
war and the following one, which framed our Constitution and laid the
bases of our political institutions, were naturally too much oceupied
with these great problems to pay much attention to pure science.
While the great mathematical astronomers of Europe were laying the
foundation of celestial mechanics their writings were a sealed book
to everyone on this side of the Atlantic, and so remained until Bow-
ditch appeared, early in the present century. His translation of the
Mécanique Céleste made an epoch in American science by bringing
the great work of Laplace down to the reach of the best American
students of his time.
90) ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

American astronomers must always honor the names of Rittenhouse
and Bowditch. And yet in one respect their work was disappointing
of results. Neither of them was the founder of a school. Rittenhouse
left no successor to carry on his work. The help which Bowditch
afforded his generation was invaluable to isolated students who, here
and there, dived alone and unaided into the mysteries of the celestial
motions. His work was not mainly in the field of observational astron-
omy, and therefore did not materially influence that branch of science.
In 1832 Professor Airy, afterwards astronomer royal of England, made a
report to the British Association on the condition of practical astronomy
in various countries. In this report he remarked that he was unable to
say anything about American astronomy because, so far as he knew,
no public observatory existed in the United States.

William C. Bond, afterwards famous as the first director of Harvard
Observatory, was at that time making observations with a small tele-
scope, first near Boston and afterwards at Cambridge. But with so
meager an outfit his establishment could scarcely lay claim to being
an astronomical observatory, and it was not surprising if Airy did not
know anything of his modest efforts.

If at this time Professor Airy had extended his investigations into
yet another field, with a view of determining the prospects for a great
city at the site of Fort Dearborn, on the southern shore of Lake
Michigan, he would have seen as little prospect of civic growth in that
region as of a great development of astronomy in the United States at
large. <A plat of the proposed town of Chicago had been prepared
two years before, when the place contained perhaps half a dozen fami-
lies. Inthe same month in which Professor Airy made his report,
August, 1832, the people of the place, then numbering 28 voters,
decided to become incorporated, and selected five trustees to carry on
their government.

In 1837 a city charter was obtained from the legislature of Illinois.
The growth of this infant city, then small even for an infant, into the
great commercial metropolis of the West has been the just pride of
its people and the wonder of the world. I mention it now because of
a remarkable coincidence. With this civic growth has quietly gone on
another, little noted by the great world, and yet in its way equally
wonderful and equally gratifying to the pride of those who measure
greatness by intellectual progress. If it be true that—

In Nature nothing is great but man; in man nothing is great but mind—

then may knowledge of the universe be regarded as the true measure
of progress. I therefore invite attention to the fact that American
astronomy began with your city and has slowly but surely kept pace
with it until to-day our country stands second only to Germany in the
number of researches being prosecuted and second to none in the num-
ber of men who have gained the highest recognition by their labors.
In 1836 Prof. Albert Hopkins, of Williams College, and Prof. Elias
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 91

Loomis, of Western Reserve College, Ohio, both commenced little
observatories. Professor Loomis went to Europe for all his instruments,
but Hopkins was able even then to get some of his in this country.
Shortly afterwards a little wooden structure was erected by Captain
Gilliss on Capitol Hill, at Washington, and supplied with a transit
instrument for observing moon culminations, in conjunction with Cap-
tain Wilkes, who was then setting out on his exploring expedition to
the Southern Hemisphere. The date of these observatories was prac-
tically the same as that on which a charter for the city of Chicago was
obtained from the legislature. With their establishment the popula-
tion of your city had increased to 703.

The next decade, 1840 to 1850, was that in which our practical
astronomy seriously commenced. The little observatory of Captain
Gilliss was replaced by the Naval Observatory, erected at Washington
during the years 1843-44 and fitted out with what were then the most
approved instruments. About the same time the appearance of the
great comet of 1843 led the citizens of Boston to erect the observatory
of Harvard College. Thus it is little more than a half century since
the two principal observatories in the United States were established.
But we must not for a moment suppose that the mere erection of an
observatory can mark an epoch in scientific history. What must make
the decade of which I speak ever memorable in American astronomy
was not merely the erection of buildings, but the character of the work
done by astronomers away from them as well as in them.

The Naval Observatory very soon became famous by two remarkable
steps which raised our country to an important position among those
applying modern science to practical uses. One of these consisted of
the researches of Sears Cook Walker on the motion of the newly dis-
covered planet Neptune. He was the first astronomer to determine
fairly good elements of the orbit of that planet, and, what is yet more
remarkable, he was able to trace back the movement of the planet in
the heavens for half a century and to show that it had been observed
as a fixed star by Lalande in 1795, without the observer having any
suspicion of the true character of the object.

The other work to which I refer was the application to astronomy
and to the determination of longitudes of the chronographic method
of registering transits of stars or other phenomena requiring an exact
record of the instant of their occurrence. It is to be regretted that
the history of this application has not been fully written. In some
points there seems to be as much obscurity as with the discovery of
ether as an anesthetic, which took place about the same time. Hap-
pily no such contest has been fought over the astronomical as over the
surgical discovery, the fact being that all who were engaged in the
application of the new method were more anxious to perfect it than
they were to get credit for themselves. We know that Saxton, of the
Coast Survey; Mitchell and Locke, of Cincinnati; Bond, at Cambridge,
92 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

as well as Walker and other astronomers at the Naval Observatory, all
worked at the apparatus; that Maury seconded their efforts with untir-
ing zeal; that it was used to determine the longitude of Baltimore as
early as 1844 by Captain Wilkes, and thatit was put into practical use
in recordin ¢ observations at the Naval Observatory as early as 1846.

At the Cambridge Observatory the two Bonds, father and son,
speedily began to show the stuff of which the astronomer is made. <A
well-devised system of observations was put in operation. The discoy-
ery of the dark ring of Saturn and of a new satellite to that planet
gave additional fame to the establishment.

Nor was activity confined to the cbservational side of the science.
The same decade of which I speak was marked by the beginning of
Professor Pierce’s mathematical work, especially his determination of
the perturbations of Uranus and Neptune. At this time commenced
the work of Dr. B. A. Gould, who soon became the leading figure in
American astronomy. Immediately on graduating at Harvard in 1845,
he determined to devote all the energies of his life to the prosecution
of his favorite science. He studied in Europe for three years, took the
doctor’s degree at Gottingen, came home, founded the Astronomical
Journal, and took an active part in that branch of the work of the
Coast Survey which included the determination of longitudes by astro-
nomical methods.

An episode which may not belong to the history of astronomy must
be acknowledged to have had a powerful influence in exciting public
interest in that science. Prof. O. M. Mitchell, the founder and first
director of the Cincinnati Observatory, made the masses of our intelli-
gent people acquainted with the leading facts of astronomy by courses
of lectures which, in lucidity and eloquence, have never been excelled.
Theimmediate object of the lectures was toraise funds for establishing his
observatory and fitting it out with a fine telescope. The popular interest
thus excited in the science had an important effect in leading the public
to support astronomical research. If public support, based on pub-
lic interest, is what has made the present fabric of American astronomy
possible, then should we honor the name of a man whose enthusiasm
leavened the masses of his countrymen with interest in our science.

The civil war naturally exerted a depressing influence upon our sci- ©
entific activity. The cultivator of knowledge is no less patriotic than
his fellow citizens, and vies with them in devotion to the public-welfare.
The active interest which such cultivators took, first in the prosecution
of the war and then in the restoration of the union, naturally distracted
their attention from their favorite pursuits. But no sooner was politi-
cal stability reached than a wave of intellectual activity set in, which has
gone on increasing up to the present time. If it be true that never
before in our history has so much attention been given to education as
now; that never before did so many men devote themselves to the dif-
fusion of knowledge, it is no less true that never was astronomical work
so energetically pursued among us as now.
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 93

One deplorable result of the civil war was that Gould’s Astronomical
Journal had to be suspended. Shortly after the restoration of peace,
instead of reestablishing the journal, its founder conceived the project
of exploring the southern heavens. The northern hemisphere being
the seat of civilization, that portion of the sky which could not be
seen from our latitudes was comparatively neglected. What had been
done in the southern hemisphere was mostly the occasional work of
individuals and of one or two permanent observatories. The latter
were so few in number and so meager in their outfit that a splendid
field was open to the inquirer. Gould found the patron which he
desired in the government of the Argentine Republic, on whose terri-
tory he erected what must rank in the future as one of the memorable
astronomical establishments of the world. His work affords a most
striking example of the principle that the astronomer is more impor-
tant than his instruments. Not only were the means at the command of
the Argentine Observatory slender in the extreme when compared with
those of the favored institutions of the North, but, from the very
nature of the case, the Argentine Republic could not supply trained
astronomers. The difficulties thus growing out of the administration
can not be overestimated. And yet the sixteen great volumes in
which the work of the institution has been published will rank in the
future among the classics of astronomy.

Another wonderful focus of activity, in which one hardly knows
whether he ought most to admire the exhaustless energy or the admir-
able ingenuity which he finds displayed, is the Harvard Observatory.
Its work has been aided by gifts which have no parallel in the liberal-
ity that prompted them. Yet without energy and skill such gifts
would have been useless. The activity of the establishment includes
both hemispheres. Time would fail to tell how it has not only mapped
out important regions of the heavens from the north to the south pole,
but analyzed the rays of light which come from hundreds of thousands
of stars by recording their spectra in permanence on photographic
plates.

The work of the establishment is so organized that a new star can
‘not appear in any part of the heavens nor a known star undergo any
noteworthy change without immediate detection by the photographic
eye of one or more little telescopes, all-seeing and never sleeping police-
men that scan the heavens unceasingly while the astronomer may
Sleep, and report in the morning every case of irregularity in the pro-
ceedings of the heavenly bodies.

Yet another example, showing what great results may be obtained
with limited means, is afforded by the Lick Observatory, on Mount
Hamilton, Cal. During the ten years of its activity its astronomers
have made it known the world over by works and discoveries too varied
and numerous to be even mentioned at the present time.

The astronomical work of which I have thus far spoken has been
almost entirely that done at observatories. I fear that I may in this
94 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

way have strengthened an erroneous impression that the seat of impor-
tant astronomical work is necessarily connected with an observatory. —
It must be admitted that an institution which has a local habitation
and a magnificent building commands public attention so strongly that
valuable work done elsewhere may be overlooked. A very important
part of astronomical work is done away from telescopes and meridian
circles and requires nothing but a good library for its prosecution.
One who is devoted to this side of the subject may often feel that the
public does not appreciate his work at its true relative value from the
very fact that he has no great buildings or fine instruments to show. I
may therefore be allowed to claim as an important factor in the Ameri-
can astronomy of the last half century an institution of which few have
heard and which has been overlooked because there was nothing about
it to excite attention.

In 1849 the American Nautical Almanae office was established by a
Congressional appropriation. The title of this publication is somewhat
misleading in suggesting a simple enlargement of the family almanac
which the sailor is to hang up in his cabin for daily use. The fact is
that what started more than a century ago as a nautical almanac has
since grown into an astronomical ephemeris for the publication of
everything pertaining to times, seasons, eclipses, and the motions of
the heavenly bodies. It is the work in which astronomical observa-
tions made in all the great observatories of the world are ultimately
utilized for scientific and public purposes. Each of the leading nations
of western Europe issues such a publication. When the preparation
and publication of the American ephemeris was decided upon the office
was first established in Cambridge, the seat of Harvard University,
because there could most readily be secured the technical knowledge
of mathematics and theoretical astronomy necessary for the work.

A field of activity was thus opened, of which a number of able young
men who have since earned distinction in various walks of life availed
themselves. ‘The head of the office, Commander Davis, adopted a policy
well fitted to promote their development: He translated the classic
work of Gauss, Theoria Motus Corporum Crelestium, and made the
office a sort of informal school, not, indeed, of the modern type, but
rather more like the classic grove of Hellas, where philosophers con-
ducted their discussions and profited by mutual attrition. When, after
a few years of experience, methods were well established and a routine
adopted, the office was removed to Washington, where it has since
remained. The work of preparing the ephemeris has, with experience,
been reduced to a matter of routine which may be continued indefi-
nitely, with occasional changes in methods and data and improvements
to meet the increasing wants of investigators.

The mere preparation of the ephemeris includes but a small part
of the work of mathematical calculation and investigation required
in astronomy. One of the great wants of the science to-day is the
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. e)

rereduction of the observations made during the first half of the present
century, and even during the last half of the preceding one. The labor
which could profitably be devoted to this work would be more than that
required in any one astronomical observatory. It is unfortunate for this
work that a great building is not required for its prosecution because
its needfulness is thus very generally overlooked by that portion of the
public interested in the progress of science. An organization especially
devoted to it is one of the scientific needs of our time.

In such an epoch-making age as the present it is dangerous to cite
any one step as making a new epoch. Yet it may be that when the
historian of the future reviews the science of our day he will find the
most remarkable feature of the astronomy of the last twenty years of
our century to be the discovery that this steadfast earth of which the
poets have told us is not after all quite steadfast; that the north and
south poles move about a very little, describing curves so complicated
that they have not yet been fully marked out. The periodic variations
of latitude thus brought about were first suspected about 1880, and
announced with some modest assurance by Kiistner, of Berlin, a few
years later. The progress of the views of astronomical opinion from
incredulity to confidence was extremely slow until, about 1890, Chan-
dler, of the United States, by an exhaustive discussion of innumerable
results of observations, showed that the latitude of every point on the
earth was subject to a double oscillation, one having a period of a year,
the other of four hundred and twenty-seven days.

Notwithstanding the remarkable parallel between the growth of
American astronomy and that of your city, one can not but fear that
if a foreign observer had been asked only half a dozen years ago at
what point in the United States a great school of theoretical and praec-
tical astronomy. aided by an establishment for the exploration of the
heavens, was likely to be established by the munificence of private
citizens, he would have been wiser than most foreigners had he guessed
Chicago. Had this place been suggested to him, I fear he would have
replied that were it possible to utilize celestial knowledge in acquir-
ing earthly wealth, here would be the most promising seat for such
a school. But he would need to have been a little wiser than his
generation to reflect that wealth is at the base of all progress in knowl-
edge and the liberal arts; that it is only when men are relieved from
the necessity of devoting all their energies to the immediate wants of
life that they can lead intellectual lives, and that we should therefore
look to the most enterprising commercial center as the likeliest seat
for a great scientific institution. :

Now we have the school, and we have the observatory, which we hope
will in the near future do work that will cast luster on the name of its
founder as well as on the astronomers who may be associated with it.
You will, I am sure, pardon me if I make some suggestions on the subject
of the future needs of the establishment. We want this newly founded
96 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN AS'TRONOMY.

institution to be a great success, to do work which shall show that
the intellectual productiveness of your community will not be allowed
to lag behind its material growth. The public is very apt to feel that
when some munificent patron of science has mounted a great telescope
under a suitable dome, and supplied all the apparatus which the
astronomer wants to use, success is assured. But such is not the case.
The most important requisite, one more difficult to command than tele-
scopes or observatories, may still be wanting. <A great telescope is of
no use without a man at the end of it, and what the telescope may do
depends more upon this appendage than upon the instrument itself.
The place which telescopes and observatories have taken in astronom-
ical history are by no means proportional to their dimensions. Many a
great instrument has been a mere toy in the hands of its owner. Many
a small one has become famous.

Twenty years ago there was here in your own city a modest little
instrument which, judged by its size, could not hold up its head with
the great ones even of that day. It was the private property of a
young man holding no scientific position and scarcely known to the
public. And yet that little telescope is to-day among the famous ones
of the world, having made memorable advances in the astronomy of
double stars, and shown its owner to be a worthy successor of the
Herschels and Struves in that line of work.

A hundred observers might have used the appliances of the Lick
Observatory for a whole generation without finding the fifth satellite of
Jupiter; without successfully photographing the cloud forms of the
Milky Way; without discovering the extraordinary patches of nebu-
lous light, nearly or quite invisible to the human eye, which fill some
regions of the heavens. :

When I was in Zurich last year I paid a visit to the little but not
unknown observatory of its famous polytechnic school. The professor
of astronomy was especially interested in the observations of the sun
with the aid of the spectroscope, and among the ingenious devices
which he described, not the least interesting was the method of photo-
graphing the sun by special rays of the spectrum, which had been
worked out at the Kenwood Observatory in Chicago. The Kenwood
Observatory is not, I believe, in the eye of the public one of the note-
worthy institutions of your city which every visitor is taken to see, and
yet this invention has given it an important place in the science of our
day.

Should you ask me what are the most hopeful features in the great
establishment which you are now dedicating, I would say that they are
not alone to be found in the size of your unequaled telescope, nor in
the cost of the outfit, but in the fact that your authorities have shown
their appreciation of the requirements of success by adding to the
material outfit of the establishment the three men whose works I have
described.

Gentlemen of the Trustees, allow me to commend to your fostering
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. Di,

eare the men at the end of the telescope. The constitution of the
astronomer shows curious and interesting features. If he is destined
to advance the science by works of real genius, he must, like the poet,
be born, not made. The born astronomer, when placed in command
of a telescope, goes about using it as naturally and effectively as the
babe avails itself of its mother’s breast. He sees intuitively what less
gifted men have to learn by long study and tedious experiment. He is
moved to celestial knowledge by a passion which dominates his nature.
He can no more avoid doing astronomical work, whether in the line of
observations or research, than a poet can chain his Pegasus to earth.
I donot mean by this that education and training will be no use to
him. They will certainly accelerate his early progress. If he is to
become great on the mathematical side, not only must his genius have
a bend in that direction, but he must have the means of pursuing his
studies. And yet I have seen so many failures of men who had the
best instruction, and so many successes of men who scarcely learned
anything of their teachers, that I sometimes ask whether the great
American celestial mechanician of the twentieth century will be a
graduate of a university or of the back woods.

Is the man thus moved to the exploration of nature by an uncon-
querable passion more to be envied or pitied? In no other pursuit
does success come with such certainty to him who deserves it. No life

is So enjoyable as that whose energies are devoted to following out the
inborn impulses of one’s nature. The investigator of truth is little
subject to the disappointments which await the ambitious man in other
fields of activity. It is pleasant to be one of a brotherhood extending
over the world, in which no rivalry exists except that which comes out
of trying to do better work than anyone else, while mutual admiration
stifles jealousy. And yet, with all these advantages, the experience of
the astronomer may have its dark side. As he sees his field widening
faster than he can advance he is impressed with the littleness of all
that can be done in one short life. He feels the same want of succes-
sors to pursue his work that the founder of a dynasty may feel for
heirs to occupy his throne. He has no desire to figure in history as a
Napoleon of science whose conquests must terminate with his life.
Even during his active career his work may be of such a kind as to
require the cooperation of others and the active support of the public.
If he is disappointed in commanding these requirements, if he finds
neither cooperation nor support, if some great scheme to which he may
have devoted much of his life thus proves to be only a castle in the
air, he may feel that nature has dealt hardly with him in not enduwing
him with passions like to those of other men. ;

In treating a theme of perennial interest one naturally tries to fancy
what the future may have in store. If the traveler, contemplating the
ruins of some ancient city which in the long ago teemed with the life
and activities of generations of men, sees every stone instinct with

emotion and the dust alive with memories of the past, may he not be
similarly impressed when he feels that he is looking around upon a
seat of future empire—a region where generations yet unborn may take
a leading part in molding the history of the world? What may we
not expect of that energy which in sixty years has transformed a
straggling village into one of the world’s great centers of commerce?
May it not exercise a powerful influence on the destiny not only of the
country but of the world? If so, shall the power thus to be exercised
prove an agent of beneficence, diffusing light and life among nations,
or shall it be the opposite?

The time must come ere long when wealth shall outgrow the field in
which it can be profitably employed. In what direction shall its
possessors then look? Shail they train a posterity which will so use
its power as to make the world better that it has lived in it? Will the
future heir to great wealth prefer the intellectual life to the life of
pleasure?

We can have no more hopeful answer to these questions than the
establishment of this great university in the very focus of the commer-
cial activity of the West. Its connection with the institution we have
been dedicating suggests some thoughts on science as a factor in that
scheme of education best adapted to make the power of a wealthy
community a benefit to the race at large. When we see what a factor
science has been in our present civilization, how it has transformed
the world and increased the means of human enjoyment by enabling
men to apply the powers of nature to their own uses, it is not wonderful
that it should claim the place in education hitherto held by classical
studies. In the contest which has thus arisen I take no part but that
of a peacemaker, holding that it is as important to us to keep in touch
with the traditions of our race, and to cherish the thoughts which have
come down to us through the centuries, as it is to enjoy and utilize
what the present has to offer us. Speaking from this point of view, I
would point out the error of making the utilitarian applications of
knowledge the main object in its pursuit. It is an historic fact that
abstract science—science pursued without any utilitarian end—has been
at the base of our progress in the utilization of knowledge. If in the
last century such men as Galvani and Volta had been moved by any
other motive than love of penetrating the secrets of nature they would
never have pursued the seemingly useless experiments they did, and
the foundation of electrical science would not have been laid. Our
present applications of electricity did not become possible until Ohm’s
mathematical laws of the electric current, which when first made
known seemed little more than mathematical curiosities, had become
the common property of inventors. Professional pride on the part of
our own Henry led him, after making the discoveries which rendered
the telegraph possible, to go no further in their application, and to live
and die without receiving a dollar of the millions which the country
has won through his agency.
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 99

In the spirit of scientific progress thus shown we have patriotism in
its highest form—a sentiment which does not seek to benefit the coun-
try at the expense of the world, but to benefit the world by means of
one’s country. Science has its competition, as keen as that which is
the life of commerce. But its rivalries are over the question who shall
contribute the most and the best to the sum total of knowledge; who
shall give the most, not who shall take the most. Its animating spirit
is love of truth. Its pride is to do the greatest good to the greatest
number. It embraces not only the whole human race but all nature
in its scope. The public spirit of which this city is the focus has made
the desert blossom as the rose, and benefited humanity by the diffusion
of the material products of the earth. Should you ask me how it is in
the future to use its influence for the benefit of humanity at large, I
would say, look at the work now going on in these precincts, and study
its spirit. Here are the agencies which will make ‘the voice of law
the harmony of the world.” Here is the love of country blended with
love of the race. Here the love of knowledge is as unconfined as your
commercial enterprise. Let not your youth come hither merely to
learn the forms of vertebrates and the properties of oxides, but rather
to imbibe that catholic spirit which, animating their growing energies,
shall make the power they are to wield an agent of beneficence to all
mankind.
THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY!

By EDWARD S. HOLDEN.

It is impossible, even in the briefest sketch, not to emphasize the
debt of American science and learning to the intelligent interest and
patronage of our early Presidents— Washington, John Adams, Jeffer-
son, Madison, Monroe, John Quincy Adams. The powerful impetus
given by them and through them has shaped the liberal policy of our
governments, National and State, toward education and toward science.
Sir Lyon Playfair, in his address to the British Association for the
Advancement of Science (1885) has recognized this influence in the
truest and most graceful way. He said: ‘“‘In the United Kingdom we
are just beginning to understand the wisdom of Washington’s Farewell
Address to his countrymen (1796) when he said: ‘Promote then, as an
object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives
force to publie opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be
enlightened.’ ”

Until the Revolution (1776) American science was but English science
transplanted, and it looked to the Royal Society of London as its cen-
sor and patron. Winthrop, Franklin, and Rittenhouse were, more or
less, English astronomers. Franklin was the sturdiest American of
the three. As early as 1743 he suggested the formation of the Ameri-
ean Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. John Adams founded the |
American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston in 1780. These
two societies, together with Harvard College (founded in 1636), Yale
College (1701), the University of Virginia (founded by Jefferson in
1825), and the United States Military Academy at West Point (1801),
were the chief foci from which the light of learning spread. Other
colleves were formed or forming all over the Eastern and Middle States
during the early years of the century.

The leading school of pure science was the Military Academy at
West Point, and it continued to hold this place until the civil war of
1861. From its corps of professors and students it gave two chiefs to
the United States Coast Survey; and the Army, particularly the Corps
of Engineers, provided many observers to that scientific establishinent,

besides furnishing a large number of professors and teachers of science
to the colleges of the country. The observatory of the academy was
founded by Bartlett in 1841, and much work was done there, only a
small part of which is published. The Coast Survey was a school of
practice for army officers, and their experience was utilized in numer-
ous boundary surveys during the period 1830-1850. Col. J. D. Graham,
for example, was astronomer of the survey of the boundary between
Texas and the United States in 1839-40; commissioner of the Northeast
boundary survey, 1840-1843; astronomer of the Northwest boundary
survey, 1843-1847; of the boundary between the United States and
Canada, 1848-1850; of the survey of the boundary between Pennsyl-
vania and Virginia, 1849-50; of the boundary survey between Mexico
and the United States, 1850-51. The names of Bonneville, Talcott,
Cram, Emory, and other army officers are familiar in this connection,
and their work was generally of a high order. It was in such service
that Talcott invented or reinvented the zenith telescope, now univer-
sally employed for all delicate determinations of latitude. The me-
chanical taet of Americans has served astronomy well. The sextant
was invented by Thomas Godfray, of Philadelphia, in 1730, a year
before Hadley brought forward his proposal for such an instrument.!
The chronograph of the Bonds, the zenith telescope of Talcott, and
the break-cireuit chronometer of Winlock are universally used to-day.
The diffraction gratings of Rutherfurd were the best to be had in the
world till they were replaced by those of Rowland. The use of a tele-
scope as a collimator was first proposed by Rittenhouse. The pioneer
opticians of the United States were Holcomb (1826), Fitz (1846 or
earlier), Clark (1845), Spencer (1851). Only the Clarks have a world-
wide reputation. Wiirdemann, instrument maker to the United States
Coast Survey (1834), had a decided influence on observers and instru-
ment makers throughout the United States, as he introduced extreme
German methods and models among us, where extreme English methods
had previously prevailed. The system of rectangular land surveys,
which proved to be so convenient for the public lands east of the Rocky
Mountains, was devised and executed by Mansfield, a graduate of the
Military Academy.

The list of army officers who became distinguished in civil life as
professors in the colleges of the country is a very long one. Courtenay
(class of 1821 at West Point) was professor of mathematics at the
University of Pennsylvania, 1834-1836; at the University of Virginia,
1842-43, and was the author of admirable text-books. Norton (class
of 1831) became professor at New Haven, and wrote a very useful text-
book of astronomy in 1839; and the list could be much extended. The
excellent training in mathematics at West Point (chiefly in French

‘In 1700 Sir Isaac Newton sent drawings and descriptions of a reflecting sextant
to Hadley for his advice. At Hadley’s: death these were found among his papers.
Hadley’s device (1731) was undoubtedly derived from Newton’s MSS. The Royal
Society of London granted £200 to Godfray for his invention, which his brother,
Captain Godfray, had previously put into practical use in the West Indies.
THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 103

methods) early made itself felt throughout the whole country. The
mathematical text-books of Peirce, of Harvard, and of Chauvenet, of
the Naval Academy, brought the latest learning of Europe to American
students. Mitchell (class of 1829 at West Point) was the only gradu-
ate who became a professional astronomer (1842-1861). His direct
service to practical observing astronomy is small, but his lectures
(1842-1848), the conduct of the Cincinnati observatory (1845-1859), and
his publication of the Sidereal Messenger (1546-1848), together with
his popular books, excited an intense and widespread public interest
in the science, and indirectly led to the foundation of many observa-
tories. He was early concerned in the matter of using the electric
current for longitude determinations, and his apparatus was only dis-
placed because of the superior excellence of the chrouograph devised
by the Bonds. His work was done under immense disadvantages, in a
new community (Ohio), but the endowment of astronomical research in
America owes a large debt to his energy and efforts.

The Navy and the United States Naval Academy (founded by Ban-
croft in 1845, at the suggestion of Chauvenet) were very active in astro-
nomical work. Chauvenet (Yale College, 1840) published a text-book
of trigonometry in 1850, which had an important share in directing
attention to rigid, elegant, and general methods of research. His
astronomy (1863) is a handbook for all students. Walker, Gilliss,
Coffin, Hubbard, Ferguson, Keith, Yarnall, Winlock, Maury, Wilkes,
were all connected with the Navy, more or less intimately. Walker’s
career was especially brilliant; he graduated at Harvard College in
1825, and established the observatory of the Philadelphia High School
in 1840. He was the leading spirit in the United States Naval Observ-
atory at Washington (1845-1847) and introduced modern methods into
its practice at the beginning. From the observatory he went to the
Coast Survey to take charge of its longitude operations, and he contin-
ued to direct and expand this department until his death, in 1855. To
him, more than to any single person, is due the idea of the telegraphic
method (“the American method”) of determining differences of longi-
tude. His assistant in this work was Gould, who succeeded to the
charge of it in 1853. His researches extended to the field of mathe-
matical astronomy also, and his theory of the planet Neptune (then
newly discovered) marks an important step forward. His investiga-
tions and those of Peirce were conducted in concert and attracted gen-
eral and deserved attention.

The exploring expedition of Wilkes required corresponding observa-
tions to be made in America, and during the period 1838-1842 William
Bond, at Dorchester, and Lieutenant Gilliss, at Washington, main-
- tained such a series with infinite assiduity and with success. The
results of Gilliss’ astronomical expedition to the southern hemisphere
(Chile, 1849-1852) were most creditable to him and to the Navy, though
his immediate object—the determination of the solar parallax—was not
attained.
104 THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

The Coast Survey began its work in 1817 under Hassler, a professor
from West Point, who impressed upon the establishment a thoroughly
scientific direction. Bache, his successor (a grandson of Benjamin
Franklin), was a graduate of West Point in the class of 1825, and took
charge of the Survey in 1843. He is the true father of the institution,
and gave it the practical efficiency and high standard which character-
ized its work. He called around him the flower of the Army and Navy,
and was ably seconded by the permanent corps of civilian assistants—
Walker, Saxton, Gould, Dean, Blunt, Pourtales, Boutelle, Hilgard,
Schott, Goodfellow, Cutts, Davidson, and others.

Silliman’s (and Dana’s) American Journal of Science had been
founded at New Haven in 1818, and served as a medium of communica-
tion among scientific men. A great step forward was made in the
establishment of the Astronomical Journal by Dr. Gould on his return
from Europe at the close of 1849.1 Silliman’s Journal was chiefly con-
cerned in the nonmathematical sciences, though it has always con-
tained valuable papers on mathematics, astronomy, and physics,
especially from the observers of Yale College—OlImsted, Herrick, Brad-
ley, Norton, Newton, Lyman, and others. In Mason, who died in 1840
at the age of 21, the country lost a practical astronomer of the highest
promise.’ Gould’s Journal was an organ devoted to a special science.
It not only gave a convenient means of prompt publication, but it
immediately quickened research and helped to enforce standards
already established and to form new ones. The Astronomical Notices
of Briinnow (1858-1862) might have been an exceedingly useful
journal with an editor who was willing to give more attention to
details, but, in spite of Briinnow’s charming personality and great
ability, it had comparatively little influence on the progress of the
science.

The translation of the Mécanique Céleste of Laplace by Nathaniel
Bowditch, the superecargo of a Boston ship (1815-1817), marks the
beginning of an independent mathematical school in America. The
first volume of the translation appeared in 1829. At that time there
were not more than two or three persons in the country who could read
it critically. The works of the great mathematicians and astronomers
of France and Germany—Laplace, Lagrange, Legendre, Olbers, Gauss,
W. Struve, Bessel—were almost entirely unknown.

Bowditch’s translation of the Mécanique Céleste, and, still more, his
extended commentary, brought this monumental work to the attention
of students and within their grasp. His Practical Navigator" contained

*First edition, 1802. Sumner’s method in navigation (1843)—a very original and
valuable contribution from a Boston sea captain—and Maury’s Wind and Current
Charts, begun in 1844, are two other notable contributions from a young country to
an art as old as commerce.

THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 105

the latest and best methods for determining the position of a ship at
sea, expressed in simple rules. American navigators had no superiors
in the first half of this century. Nantucket whalers covered the
Pacific, Salem ships swarmed in the Indies, and the clipper ships made
passages round the Horn to San Francisco, which are a wonder to-day.
Part of their success is due to the bold enterprise of their captains
(who were said to carry deck loads of studding-sail booms to replace
those carried away!), but an important part depended on their skill as
observers with the sextant. One of the sister ships to the one of which
Bowditch was supercargo was visited at Genoa by a European astron-
omer of note (Baron de Zach), who found that the latest methods of
working lunar distances to determine the longitude were known to all
on board, sailors as well as officers. His bewilderment reached its
climax when the navigator called the negro cook from tbe galley and
bade him expound the methods of determining the longitude to the
distinguished visitor.

On Bowditch’s own ship there was ‘a crew of twelve men, every one
of whom could take and work a lunar observation as well, for all prae-
tical purposes, as Sir Isaac Newton himself.” Such crews were only to
be found on American ships in the palmy days of democracy. All were
cousins or neighbors and each had a “venture” in the voyage. But
these anecdotes may serve as illustrations of the intellectual awakening
which came about as soon as our young country was relieved from the
pressure of the two wars of 1776 and 1812. An early visitor, Baron
Hyde de Neuville (1805) felt ‘an unknown something in the air,” “a
new wind blowing.” This new spirit, born of freedom, entered first
into practical life, as was but natural; science next felt its impulse,
and, last of all, literature was born. Emerson hailed it (in 1837) ‘as the
sign of an indestructible instinct.” ‘Perhaps the time has already
come,” he says, ‘ when the sluggard intellect of this country will look
from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectation of the world
with something better than the exertions of mechanical skill. Our day
of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands,
draws toa close. The millions that around us are rushing into life
can not always be fed with the sere remains of foreign harvests.” —°

Benjamin Peirce, a graduate of Harvard in the elass of 1829, had
been concerned with the translation of the Mécanique Céleste, and was
early familiar with the best mathematical thought of HKurope. He
became professor in Harvard College in 1835, and, after the death of
Bowditch in 1838, he was easily the first mathematical astronomer in
the country. His instruction was precisely fitted to develop superior
intelligences, and this was his prime usefulness. Just such a man was
needed at that time. Besides his theoretical researches on the orbits
of the planets (specially Uranus and Neptune) and of the moon, his
study of the theory of perturbations, and his works on pure mathe-
matics and mechanics, he concerned himself with questions of practical
106 THR BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

astronomy, although the observations upon which he depended were
the work of others. He was the consulting astronomer of the American
Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac from its foundation in 1849, and its
plans were shaped by him to an important degree. His relative, Lieu-
tenant Davis, United States Navy (the translator of Gauss’s Theoria
Motus Corporum Coelestium (1857) ), was placed in charge of the
Ephemeris, and the members of its staff—Runkle, Ferrel, Wright,
Newcomb, Winlock, and others—most effectively spread its exact
methods by example and precept. Professor Peirce undertook the eal-
culations relating to the sun, Mars, and Uranus in the early volumes of
the Ephemeris. As a compliment to her sex, Miss Maria Mitchell was
charged with those of Venus; Mercury was computed by Winlock,
Jupiter by Kendall, Saturn by Downes, Neptune by Sears Walker.

The Smithsonian Institution was founded in 1846, and Joseph Henry
was called from Princeton College to direct it. There never was a
wiser choice. His term of service (1846-1878) was so long that his
ideals became firmly fixed within the establishment and were impressed
upon his contemporaries and upon a host of younger men. The interests
of astronomy were served by the encouragement of original research
through subsidies and otherwise, by the purchase of instruments for
scientific expeditions, by the free exchange of scientific books between
America and Europe, and by the publication of the results of recondite
investigations. It is by these and like services that the Institution is
known and valued among the wide community of scientific men through-
out the world.

But this enumeration of specific benefits does not convey an adequate
idea of the immense influence exercised by the Institution upon the
scientific ideals of the country. It was of the first importance that
the beginnings of independent investigation among Americans should
be directed toward right ends and by high and unselfish aims. In the
formation of a scientific and, as it were, a moral standard a few names
will ever be remembered among us, and no one will stand higher than
that of Henry. His wise, broad, and generous policy and his hign per-
sonal ideals were of immense service to his colleagues and to the
country.

The establishment of a National Observatory in Washington was
proposed by John Quincy Adams in 1825, but it was not until 1544
that the United States Naval Observatory was built by Lieutenant
Gilliss, of the Navy, from plans which he had prepared. By what seems
to have been an injustice Gilliss was not appointed to be its first
director.! This place fell to Lieut. M. F. Maury. Gilliss had been on
detached service for some years, and a rigid construction of rules
required that he should be sent to sea, and not remain to Jaunch the
institution which he had built and equipped.

The first Gusts of observers at Washington Se contained men of

THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 107

first-class ability—Walker, Hubbard, Coffin. Gilliss’s work as astron-
omer to Wilkes Exploring Expedition (1838-1842) at his little observa-
tory on Capitol Hill had shown him to be one of the best of observers,
as well as one of the most assiduous. His study and experience in
planning and building the Naval Observatory had broadened his mind,
To the men just named, with Peirce, Gould, and Chauvenet, and to
their coadjutors and pupils, we owe the introduction of the methods of
Gauss, Bessel, and Struve into the United States, and it is for this
reason that American astronomy is the child of German and not of
English science.

The most natural evolution might seem to have been for Americans
to follow the English practice of Maskelyne and Pond. But the break
caused by the War of Independence, by the War of 1812, and by the
years necessary for our youthful governments to consolidate (1776-1836)
allowed our young men of science to make a perfectly unbiased choice
of masters. The elder Bond (William Cranch Bond, born 1789, director
of Harvard College Observatory, 1840-1859) was one of the older school
and received his impetus from British sources during a visit to England
in 1815.

In estimating the place of the elder Bond among scientific men it is
necessary to take into account the circumstances which surrounded
him. He was born in the first year of the French Revolution (1789) ;
he was absolutely self-taught; practically no astronomical work was
done in America before 1833. When Admiral Wilkes was seeking for
coadjutors to prosecute observations in the United States during the
absence of his exploring expedition he was indeed fortunate in finding
two such men as Bond and Gilliss. Their assiduity was beyond praise
and it led each of them to important duties. Bond became the founder
and director of the Observatory of Harvard College, while Gilliss is
the father of the United States Naval Observatory at Washington, as
well as that of Santiago de Chile, the oldest observatory in South
America. Cambridge, though the seat of the most ancient university
in America, was but a village in 1839. The college could afford no
salary to Bond, but only the distinction of a title, ‘‘ Astronomical
Observer to the University,” and the occupancy of the Dana house, in
which his first observatory was established. His work there, as else-
where, was well and faithfully done, and it led the college authorities
to employ him as the astronomer of the splendid observatory which
was opened for work in 1847. At that time the two largest telescopes
in the world were those of the Imperial Observatory of Russia (Poul-
kova) and its companion at Cambridge. Hach of these instruments
has a long and honorable history. Their work has been very different.
Who shall say that one has surpassed the other? We owe to Bond
and his son the discovery of an eighth satellite to Saturn, of the dusky
ring to that planet, the introduction of stellar photography, the inven-
tion of the chronograph by which the electric current is employed in
108 THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

the registry of observations, the conduct of several chronometrice expe-
ditions between Liverpool and Boston to determine the trans-Atlantic
longitude, and a host of minor discoveries and observations.

Gilliss visited France for study in 1835, before he took up his duties
at Washington. The text-books of Bond and Gilliss were the Astron-
omies of Vince (1797-1808) and of Pearson (1824-1829). The younger
Bond (George Phillips Bond, born 1825, Harvard College 1844, direc-
tor of the Harvard College Observatory 1859-1865) and his contempo-
raries, on the other hand, were firmly grounded in the German methods,
then, as now, the most philosophical and thorough.

It was not until 1850, or later, that it was indispensable for an Ameri-
can astronomer to read the German language and to make use of the
memoirs of Bessel, Encke, and Struve and the text-books of Sawitsch
and Briinnow.! This general acquaintance with the German language
and methods came nearly a generation later in England. The tradi-
tions of Piazzi and Oriani came to America with the Jesuit Fathers of
Georgetown College (1844), of whom Secchi and Sestini are the best
known.

The dates of the foundation of a few observatories of the United
States may be set down here. Those utilized for the observation of
the transit of Venus in 1769 were temporary stations merely. The
first college observatory was that of Chapel Hill, N. C. (1831); Wil-
liams College followed (1836); Hudson Observatory (Ohio) (1838); the
Philadelphia High School (1840); the Dana House Observatory of Har-
vard College (1840); West Point (1841); the United States baval
Observatory (1844); the Georgetown College Observatory (1844); the
Cincinnati Observatory (1845); the new observatory of Harvard Colleg :
(1846); the private observatory of Dr. Lewis M. Rutherfurd in New
York City (1848); the observatory at Ann Arbor (1854); the Dudley
Observatory at Albany (1856); and that of Hamilton College (1856).

These dates and the summary history just given will serve to indicate
the situation of astronomy in the United States during the first half of
the present century. A little attention to the dates will enable the
reader to place an individual or an institution on its proper background.
It must constantly be kept in mind that the whole country was very
young and that public interest in astronomical matters was neither edu-
cated nor very general. The data here set down will have a distinct
value as a contribution to the history of astronomy in America. The
developments of later years have been so amazing that we forget that
the first working observatories were founded so late as 1845.

American science is scarcely more than half a century old. The day
will soon come—it is now here—when we shall look back with wonder
and gratitude to ask who were the men who laid the wide and deep
foundations which already maintain so noble an edifice.

THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES!

By G. H. DARWIN.

ik

The Atlantic Monthly for October, 1897, contains an interesting
paper by Mr. See on ‘“‘ Recent discoveries respecting the origin of the
universe.” In the present article I propose to explain, in greater
detail than the necessary limitations of space permitted him, the
theory which forms the point of departure for his speculations.
Although the natural sequence is thus inverted, it may be hoped that
the postponement of explanation to application will be condoned. In
any case, this article owes its origin to the former one, and it might not
otherwise have been justifiable to expound a theory which was laid
before the scientific world some fifteen years ago in the pages of the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.’

After the explanation of this theory I have added some comments on
Mr. See’s views. 2

If familiarity does not always breed contempt, yet at least it gener-
ally breeds indifference. This is the case with most of us in regard to
the rise and fall of the tide by the seashore, and so the problem as to
whether the tide will serve conveniently to allow the children to dig
in the sand or search for seaweed looms larger than that presented by
the gigantic forces which now produce only these somewhat insignifi-
cant pulsations of the sea. Yet the tides should call forth in us a
deeper interest—I might almost say an emotion—for, as I shall show,

they are the feeble residue of influences which have probably exercised
‘a predominant control over the history of the earth and the moon since
an indeterminate but remote epoch in the past, and will continue that
control into the distant future.

Newton was the first to prove that the tides are caused by the attrac-
tions of the moon and the sun. It would need much space to explain
fully the manner in which those attractions operate, yet it is possible
to give in a few words a rough sketch of the mode in which the tide-
generating forces arise. It will suffice for this purpose to confine our
attention to the more important of the two bodies, the moon, since the
action of the sun will then follow by parity of reasoning. According to—
the law of universal gravitation, the moon attracts matter which stands
near to her more strongly than that which is more remote. It follows
that the attraction on the ocean, at the side of the earth which is near-
est to the moon must be greater than that exercised on the solid earth
itself. Hence there is a tendency for the sea to depart from its natural
spherical shape, and to bulge outward toward the moon. So far the
matter is simple, but it is perplexing to many that the moon should
apparently repel the water lying on the farther side of the earth. This
action, however, is not due to any ideal repulsion from the moon, but
results from the fact that on the farther side the moon must attract the
solid earth more strongly than she does the water. On the nearer side
the moon pulls the water away from the earth, and on the farther side
she pulls the earth away from the water, thus producing an apparent
repulsion of the water to an extent equal to the attraction on the other
side. In this way there arises a tendency for the ocean to bulge equally
toward and away from the moon, and to assume an egg-like shape, with
the length of the egg pointed toward the moon.

If the whole planet were fluid, instead of being partly fluid and
partly solid, the same tendency would still exist, but the tide-generat-
ing force would have the whole mass of the planet as its field of opera-
tion, instead of merely the superficial ocean. The fact that the earth,
the moon, and the planets are all nearly spherical proves that in early
times they were molten and plastic, and that they assumed their pres-
ent round shape under the influence of gravitation. When the material
of which any planet is formed was semiliquid through heat, its satel-
lites, or at any rate the sun, must have produced tidal oscillations in the
molten rock, just as the sun and the moon now raise tides in our oceans.

Molten rock and molten iron are rather sticky or viscous substances,
and any movement which agitates them must be subject to much fric-
tion. Hven water, which is a very good lubricant, is not entirely free
from friction, and so our present oceanic tides must be influenced by
fluid friction, although to a far less extent than the molten solid just
referred to. Now, all moving systems which are subject to friction
gradually come to rest. <A train will run a long way when the steam is
turned off, but it stops at last, and a fly wheel will continue to spin for
only a limited time. This general law renders it certain that the fric-
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. etalk

tion of the tide, whether it consists in the swaying of molten lava or of
an ocean, must be stopping the rotation of the planet, or at any rate
stopping the motion of the system in some way. .

It is the friction upon its bearings which brings a fly wheel to rest;
but as the earth has no bearings, it is not easy to see how the friction
of the tidal wave, whether corporeal or oceanic, can tend to stop its
rate of rotation. The result must clearly be brought about, in some
way, by the interaction between the moon and the earth. Action and
reaction must be equal and opposite, and if we are correct in supposing
that the friction of the tides is stopping the earth’s rotation, there must
be a reaction upon the moon tending to hurry her onward. To give a
homely illustration of the effects of reaction, I may recall to mind how
aman riding a high bicycle, on applying the brake too suddenly, was
shot over the handles. The desired action was to stop the front wheel,
but this could not be done without a reaction on the rider, which some-
times led to unpleasant consequences.

The general conclusion as to the action: and reaction due to tidal
friction is of so vague a character that it is desirable to consider in
detail how they operate. The circle
in the figure is supposed to represent
the undisturbed shape of the planet, -
which rotates in the direction of the
curved arrow. A portion of the orbit
of the satellite is indicated by part of
a larger circle, and the direction of its
motion is shown by an arrow. I will
first suppose that the water lying on the planet, or the molten rock of
which it is formed, is a perfect lubricant, devoid of friction; and that at
the moment represented in the figure the satellite is at M’. The fluid
will then be distorted by the tidal force until it assumes the egg-like
shape marked by the ellipse, projecting on both sides beyond the circle.
When there is no friction, the long axis of the egg is always directed
straight toward the satellite M’, and the fluid maintains a continuous
rhythmical movement, so that as the planet rotates and the satellite
revolves, it always preserves the same shape and attitude toward the
satellite.

But when, as in reality, the fluid is subject to friction, it gets belated
in its rhythmical rise and fall, and the protuberance is carried onward
by the rotation of the planet beyond its proper place. In order to
make the same figure serve for this condition of affairs, I set the satel-
lite backward to M; for this amounts to just the same thing, and is less
confusing than redrawing the protuberance in its more advanced posi-
tion. The planet then constantly maintains this shape and attitude
with regard to the satellite, and the interaction between the two will
be the same as though the planet were solid, but continually altering
its Shape.

1 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

We have now to examine what effects must follow from the attrac-
tion of the satellite on an egg-shaped planet, when the two bodies con-
stantly maintain the same attitude relatively to each other. It will
make the matter somewhat easier of comprehension if we replace the
tidal protuberances by two particles of equal masses, one at P, and the
other at P’. If the masses of these particles be properly chosen, so as
to represent the amount of matter in the protuberances, the proposed
change will make no material difference in the result.

The gravitational attraction of the satellite is greater on bodies
which are near than on those which are far, and accordingly it attracts
the particle P more strongly than the particle P’.. It is obvious from
the figure that the pull on P must tend to stop the planet’s rotation,
while the pull on P’ must tend to accelerate it. If a man pushes
equally on the two pedals of a bicycle, the crank has no tendency to
turn; and besides, there are dead points in the revolution of the crank
where pushing and pulling have no effect. So also in the astronomical
problem, if the two attractions were exactly equal, or if the protuber-
ances were at a dead point, there would be no resultant effect on the
rotation of the planet. But it is obvious that here the retarding pull
is stronger than the accelerating pull, and that the set of the protuber-
ances is such that we have passed the dead point. It follows from this
that the primary eifect of fluid friction is to throw the tidal protuber-
ance forward, and the secondary effect is to retard the planet’s rotation.

Action and reaction are equal and opposite, and if the satellite pulls
at the protuberances, they pull in return at the satellite. The figure
shows that the attraction of the protuberance P tends in some measure
to hurry the satellite onward in its orbit, while that of P’ tends to
retard it. But the attraction of P is stronger than that of P’, and
therefore the resultant of the two is a force tending to carry the satel-
lite forward more rapidly in the direction of the arrow. When the
satellite is thus influenced, it ust move in aspiral curve, ever inecreas-
ing its distance from the planet. Besides this, the satellite has a longer
path to travel in its circuit, and takes longer to get round the planet,
than was the case before tidal friction began to operate.! 3

Now, let us apply these ideas to the case of the earth and the moon.
A man standing on the planet, as it rotates, is carried past places
where the fluid is deeper and shallower alternately; at the deep places
he says that it is high tide, and at the shallow places that it is low tide.
In the figure it is high tide when the observer is carried past P. Now,

'It is somewhat paradoxical that the effect of attempting to hurry the satellite is
to make it actually move slower. It would be useless to attempt an explanation of
this in such an article as the present one, but the converse case, where a retarding
force acts on the body, may be more intelligible. When a meteorite rushes through
the atmosphere it moves faster and faster, because it gains more velocity by the
direct action of the earth’s gravity on it than it loses by the friction of the air. And
yet it is the friction of the air which allows gravity to have play; so that we have
the paradox of friction accelerating the motion.

THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 113

it was pointed out that when there is no fluid friction we must put the
moon at M’, but when thereis friction she must be at M. Accordingly,
if there is no friction it is high tide when the moon is over the observer’s
head, but when there is fluid friction the moon has passed his zenith
before he reaches high tide. Hence he would remark that fluid friction
retards the time of high water.!

A day is the name for the time in which the earth rotates once, and
a month for the time in which the moon revolves once. Then, since
tidal friction retards the earth’s rotation and the moon’s revolution, we
may state that both the day and the month are being lengthened, and
that these results follow from the retardation in the time of high tide.
It must also be noted that the spiral in which the moon moves is an
increasing one, so that her distance from the earth increases. These
are absolutely certain and inevitable results of the mechanical inter-
action of the two bodies.

At the present time the rates of increase of the day and month are
excessively small, so that it has not been found possible to determine
them with any approach to accuracy. It may be well to notice in
passing that if the rate of change of either element were determinable
that of the other would be deducible by calculation.

The extreme slowness of the changes within historical times is estab-
lished by the records in early Greek and Assyrian history of eclipses
of the sun which occurred on certain days and at certain places. Not-
withstanding the changes in the calendar, it is possible to identify the
day according to our modern reckoning, and the identification of the
place presents no difficulty. Astronomy affords the means of calculat-
ing the exact time and place of the occurrence of an eclipse even three
thousand years ago, on the supposition that the earth spun at the same
rate then as now, and that the complex laws governing the moon’s
motion are unchanged. ‘The particular eclipse referred to in history is
known, but any considerable change in the earth’s rotation and in the
moow’s motion would have shifted the position of visibility on the earth
from the situation to which modern computation would assign it. Most
astronomical observations would be worthless if the exact time of the
occurrence were uncertain, but in the case of eclipses the place of
observation aftords just that element of precision which is otherwise
wanting. As, then, the situations of the ancient eclipses agree fairly
well with modern computations, we are sure that there has been no
great change within the last three thousand years either in the earth’s
rotation or in the moon’s motion. There is, however, a small outstand-
ing discrepancy which indicates that there has been some change. But
the exact amount involves elements of uncertainty, because our knowl-

'This must not be considered as a fair statement of the case when the oceans are
as shallow as inactuality. The reader must accept the assurance that the friction of
the tides of shallow seas also causes retardation of the planet’s rotation, although in
a somewhat different manner from that explained above.

sm 97 8

114 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

edge of the laws of the moon’s motion is not yet quite accurate enough
for the absolutely perfect calculation of eclipses which occurred many
centuries ago. In this way it is known that within historical times the
retardation of the earth’s rotation and the recession of the moon have
been, at any rate, very slight.

It does not follow from this that the changes have always been
equally slow, and indeed it may be shown by mathematical arguments
that the efficiency of tidal friction increases with enormous rapidity as
we bring the tide raising satellite nearer to the planet. The law of tidal
friction is that it varies according to the inverse sixth power of the
distance; so that with the moon at half her present distance, the rate
of retardation of the earth’s rotation would be sixty-four times as great
as it now is. Thus, although the action may now be almost insensibly
slow, yet it must have proceeded with much greater rapidity when the
moon was nearer to us.

There are many problems in which it would be very difficult to follow
the changes in the system according to the times of their occurrence,
but where it is possible to banish time, and to trace the changes them-
selves in due order, without reference to time. In the sphere of com-
mon life, we know the succession of stations which a train must pass
between New York and Boston, although we may have no time-table.
This is the case with our astronomical problem; for although we have
no time-table, yet the sequence of the changes in the systein may be
traced accurately.

Let us then banish time, and look forward to the ultimate outcome of
the tidal interaction of the moon and the earth. The day and the
month are now lengthening at relative rates which are calculable,
although the absolute rates in time are unknown. It will suffice for a
general comprehension of the problem to know that the present rate of
increase of the day is much more rapid than that of the month, and
that this will hold good in the future. Thus, the number of rotations
of the earth in the interval comprised in one revolution of the moon
diminishes; or, in other words, the number of days in the month dimin-
ishes, although the length of each day increases so rapidly that the
month itself is longer than at present. For example, when the day
Shall be equal in length to two of our actual days, the month may be
as long as thirty-seven of our days, and then the earth will spin round
only about eighteen times in the month.

This gradual change in the day and the month proceeds continuously
until the duration of a rotation of the earth is prolonged to fifty-five of
our present days. At the same time, the month, or the time of a revo-
lution of the moon around the earth, will also occupy fifty-five of our
days. Since the month here means the period of the return of the moon
to the same place among the stars, and since the day is to be estimated
in the same way, the moon must then always face the same part of the
earth’s surface, and the two bodies must move as though they were
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 115

united by a bar. The outcome of the lunar tidal friction will therefore
be that the moon and the earth will go round as though locked together
in a period of fifty-five of our present days, with day and month identi-
cal in length.

Now, looking backward in time, we find the day and the month short-
ening, but the day changing more rapidly than the month. The earth
was therefore able to complete more revolutions in the month, although
that month was itself shorter than it is now. We get back, in fact, to
a time when there were twenty-nine rotations of the earth in the time
of the moon’s revolution, instead of twenty-seven and one-third, as at
present. This epoch is a sort of crisis in the history of the moon and
the earth, for it may: be proved that there never could have been more
than twenty-nine days in the month. Earlier than this epoch, the
days were fewer than twenty-nine; and later, fewer also. Although
measured in years this epoch in the earth’s history must be very
remote, yet when we contemplate the whole series of changes it must
be considered as a comparatively recent event. In a sense, indeed, we
may be said to have passed recently through the middle stage of our
history.

Now, pursuing the series of changes farther back than the epoch
when there was the maximum number of days in the month, we find
the earth still rotating faster and faster and the moon drawing nearer
and nearer to the earth and revolving in shorter and shorter periods.
But a change has supervened, so that the rate at which the month is
shortening is more rapid than the rate of change in the day. Conse-
quently, the moon now gains, as it were, on the earth, which can not
get round so frequently in the month as it did before. In other words,
the number of days in the month declines from the maximum of twenty-
nine, and is finally reduced to one. When there is only one day in the
month the earth and the moon go round at the same rate, so that the
moon always looks at the same side of the earth, and as far as concerns
the motion they might be fastened together by iron bands.

This is the same conclusion at which we arrived with respect to the
remote future. But the two cases differ widely; for whereas in the
future the period of the common rotation will be fifty-five of our pres-
ent days, in the past we find the two bodies going round each other in
between three and five of our present hours. A satellite revolving
round the earth in so short a period must almost touch the earth’s sur-
face. The system is therefore traced until the moon nearly touches the
earth, and the two go round each other like a single solid body in
about three to five hours.

The series of changes has been traced forward and backward from
the present time, but it will make the whole process more intelligible,
and the opportunity will be afforded for certain further considerations,
if I sketch the history again in the form of a continuous narrative.

Let us imagine a planet attended by a satellite which revolves ina
116 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

circular orbit so as nearly to touch its surface and continuously to face
the same side of the planet. If now, for some cause, the satellite’s
month comes to differ very slightly from the planet’s day, the satellite
will no longer continuously face the same side of the planet, but will
pass over every part of the planet’s equator in turn. This is the con-
dition necessary for the generation of tidal oscillations in the planet,
and as the molten lava, of which we suppose the planet to be formed,
is a Sticky or viscous fluid, the tides must be subject to friction. Tidal
friction will then begin to do its work, but the result will be very dif-
erent according as the satellite revolves a little faster or a little slower
than the planet. If it revolves a little faster, so that the month is
shorter than the day, we have a condition not contemplated in the
figure above. It is easy to see, however, that as the satellite is always
leaving the planet behind it, the apex of the tidal protuberance must
be directed to a point behind the satellite in its orbit. In this case the
rotation of the planet must be accelerated by the tidal friction, and the
satellite must be drawn inward toward the planet, into which it must
ultimately fall. In the application of this theory to the earth and the
moon, it is obvious that the very existence of the moon negatives the
hypothesis that the initial month was even infinitesimally shorter than
the day. We must then suppose that the moon revolved a little more
slowly than the earth rotated. In this case the tidal friction would
retard the earth’s rotation, and force the moon to recede from the earth,
and so perform her orbit more slowly. Accordingly, the primitive day
and the primitive month lengthen, but the month increases much more
rapidly than the day, so that the number of days in the month becomes
greater. This proceeds until that number reaches a maximum, which
in the case of our planet is about twenty-nine.

After the epoch of maximum number of days in the month, the rate
of change in the length of the day becomes less rapid than that in the
length of the month; and although both periods increase, the number
of days in the month begins to diminish. The series of changes then
proceeds until the two periods come again to an identity, when we have
the earth and the moon, as they were at the beginning, revolving in the
same period, with the moon always facing the same side of the planet.
But in her final condition the moon will be a long way off from the
earth, instead of being quite close to it.

Although the initial and final states resemble each other, yet they
differ in one respect, which is of much importance; for in the initial
condition the motion is unstable, while finally it is stable. The mean-
ing of this is that if the moon were even infinitesimally disturbed from
the initial mode of motion, she would necessarily either fall into the
planet or recede therefrom, and it would be impossible for her to con-
tinue to move in that neighborhood. She is unstable in the same sense
in which an egg balanced on its point is unstable, the smallest mote of
dust will upset it, and practically it can not stay in that position. But
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 117

the final condition resembles the case of an egg lying on its side, which
only rocks a little when we disturb it. So if the moon were slightly
disturbed from her final condition, she would continue to deseribe very
nearly the same path round the earth, and would not assume some
entirely new form of orbit.

It is by methods of rigorous argument that the moon is traced back
to the initial unstable condition when she revolved close to the earth.
But the argument here breaks down, and calculation is incompetent to
tell us what occurred before, and how she attained that unstable mode
of motion. We can only speculate as to the preceding history, but
there is some basis for our speculation, for I say that if a planet, such
as the earth, made each rotation in a period of three hours, it would
very nearly fly to pieces. The attraction of gravity would be barely
strong enough to hold it together, just as the cohesive strength of iron
is insufficient to hold a fly wheel together if it is spun too fast. There
is, of course, an important distinction between the case of the ruptured
fly wheel and the supposed break-up of the earth, for when the fly
wheel breaks the pieces are hurled apart as soon as the force of
cohesion fails, whereas when a planet breaks up, through too rapid
rotation, gravity must continue to hold the pieces together after they
have ceased to form parts of a single body.

Hence, we have grounds for conjecturing that the moon is composed
of fragments of the primitive planet which we now call the earth, which
detached themselves when the planet spun very swiftly, and afterwards
became consolidated. It surpasses the powers of mathematical caleu-
lation to trace the details of the process of this rupture and subsequent
consolidation, but we can hardly doubt that the system would pass
through a period of turbulence before order was reestablished in the
formation of a satellite.

I have said that rapid rotation was probably the cause of the birth
of the moon, but this statement needs qualification. There are certain
considerations which prevent us from ascertaining the common period
of revolution of the moon and the earth with accuracy. It may lie
between three and five hours. I think that such a speed might not,
perhaps, be quite sufficient to cause the planet to break up. Is it pos-
sible, then, to suggest any other cause which might have cooperated
with the tendency to instability of the rotating planet? I think that
there is such a cause, and though we are here déaling with guesswork,
I will hazard the suggestion.

The primitive planet, before the birth of the moon, was rotating
rapidly with reference to the sun, and it must, therefore, have been
agitated by tidal oscillations due to the sun’s attraction. Now, the
magnitude of these solar tides is much influenced by the speed of rota-
tion of the planet, and mathematical reasoning appears to show that.
when the day was about three or four hours in length the oscillations
must have been very great, although the sun stood no nearer to the

SY
118 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

earth fhen than it does now. May we not conjecture that the oscilla-
tion of the molten planet became so violent that, in cooperation with
the rapid rotation, it shook the planet to pieces, Ieiaghtne huge frag-
ments, which ultimately were consolidated into the moon? There is
nothing to tell us whether this theory affords the true explanation of
the birth of the moon, and I say that it is only a wild speculation,
incapable of verification.

But the truth or falsity of this speculation does not militate against
the acceptance of the general theory of tidal friction, which, standing
on the firm basis of mechanical necessity, throws much light on the
history of the earth and the moon, and correlates the lengths of our
present day and month.

I have said above that the sequence of events has been stated with-
out reference to the scale of time. It is of the utmost importance, how-
ever, to gain some idea of the time requisite for all the changes in the
system. If millions of millions of years were necessary, the applica-
bility of the theory to the moon and the earth would have to be
rejected, because it is known from other lines of argument that there
is not an unlimited bank of time on which to draw. The uncertainty
as to the duration of the solar system is wide, yet we are sure that it
has not existed for an almost infinite past.

Now, although the actual time scale is indeterminate, it is possible to
find the minimum time adequate for the transformation of the moon’s
orbit from its supposed initial condition to its present shape. It may
be proved, in fact, that if tidal friction had always operated under the
conditions most favorable for producing rapid change, the sequence of
events from the beginning’ until to-day would have occupied a period of
between fifty and sixty millions of years. The actual period, of course,
must have been much greater. Various lines of argument as to the age
of the solar system have led to results which differ widely among them-
selves, yet I can not think that the applicability of the theory of tidal
friction is negatived by the magnitude of the period demanded. It may
be that science will have to reject the theory in its full extent, but it
seems improbable that the ultimate verdict will be adverse to the pre-
ponderating influence of the tide on the evolution of our planet.

III.

If this history be true of the earth and the moon, it should throw
light on many peculiarities of the solar system. In the first place, a
corresponding series of changes must have taken place in the moon
herself. Once on a time she must have been molten, and the great
extinct volcanoes revealed by the telescope are evidences of her primi-
tive heat. The molten mass must have been semifluid, and the earth
must have raised in it enormous tides of molten lava. Doubtless the
moon once rotated rapidly on her axis, and the frictional resistance to
her tides must have impeded her rotation. She rotated then more and
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 119

more slowly until the tide solidified, and thenceforward and to the
present day she has shown the same face to the earth. Helmholtz
was, I believe, among the first in modern times to suggest this as the
explanation of the fact that the moon always shows us the same face.!
Our theory, then, receives a striking confirmation from the moon; for,
having ceased to rotate relatively to us, she has actually advanced to
that condition which may be foreseen as the fate of the earth.

Thus far I have referred in only one passage to the influence of solar
tides, but these are of considerable importance, being large enough to
cause the conspicuous phenomena of spring and neap tides. Now,
while the moon is retarding the earth’s rotation, the sun is doing so
also. But these solar tides react only on the earth’s motion around the
sun, leaving the moon’s motion around the earth unaffected. It might
perhaps be expected that parallel changes in the earth’s orbit would
have proceeded step by step, and that the earth might be traced to an
origin close to the sun. But the smaliness of the earth’s mass com-
pared with that of the sun here prohibits the application of the theory
of tidal friction, and it is improbable that our year is now longer, from
this cause at any rate, by more than a few seconds than it was at the
very birth of the solar system.

Although the solar tides can have had no perceptible influence upon
the earth’s movement in its orbit, they will have affected the rotation
of the earth to a considerable extent. Let us imagine ourselves trans-
ported to the indefinite future, when the moon and the earth shall be
revolving together in fifty-five of our days. The lunar tide in the
earth will then be unchanging, just as the earth tide in the moon is
now fixed; but the earth will be rotating with reference to the sun,
and, if there are unfrozen oceans, its rotation will still be subject to
retardation in consequence of the solar tidal friction. The day will
then become longer than the month, which for a very long time will
continue to occupy about fifty-five of our present days. It is known
that there are neither oceans nor atmosphere on the moon; but if
there were, she would have been subject to solar tidal friction, and
would have undergone a parallel series of changes.

Up to recent times it might have been asserted plausibly that the
absence of any such mode of motion in the solar system afforded a
reason for rejecting the actual efficiency of tidal friction in celestial
evolution. But in 1877 Prof. Asaph Hall discovered in the system of
the planet Mars a case of the kind of motion which we have reason to
foresee as the future fate of the earth and the moon; for he found two
satellites, one of which has a month shorter than the planet’s day.

In his paper on the discovery of these satellites Professor Hall gives

1Kant, in the middle of the last century, drew attention to the importance of
tidal friction in celestial dynamics; butas he did not clothe his argument in mathe-
matical form, he was unable to deduce most of the results which are explained in
this paper.
120 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

an interesting account of what had been conjectured, partly in jest
and partly in earnest, as to the existence of satellites attending that
planet. He quotes Kepler as writing, after the discovery of the satel-
lites of Jupiter, “I am so far from disbelieving the existence of the
four cireumjovial planets” (that is, satellites) “that I long for a_tele-
scope to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering two around Mars,
six or eight around Saturn, as the proportion seems to require, and
perhaps one each around Mercury and Venus.” This was, of course,
serious, although based on fantastic considerations. At a later date
Swift poured contempt on men of science in his account of the inhab-
itants of Laputa, whom he describes as dexterous enough on a piece
of paper and in the management of the rule, the pencil, and the
dividers, but as a clumsy, awkward, and unhandy people, and _ per-
plexed in their conceptions upon all subjects except mathematics and
music. He writes, however, of the Laputans, ‘‘They have likewise
discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about Mars,
whereof the innermost is distant from the center of the primary
exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost five.” In one of his
satires Voltaire also represents an imaginary traveler from Sirius as
making a similar discovery.

These curious prognostications were at length verified by Prof.
Asaph Hall in the discovery of two satellites, which he named Phobos
and Deimos—Fear and Panic, the dogs of war. The period of Deimos
is about thirty hours, and that of Phobos about eight hours, while the
Martian day is of nearly the same length as our own. ‘The month of
the inner minute satellite is thus less than a third of the planet’s day;
it rises to the Martians in the west, and passes through all its phases
in afew hours. Sometimes it must even rise twice in a single Martian
night. As we here find an illustration of the condition foreseen for
our own planet and satellite, it seems legitimate to suppose that solar
tidal friction has slowed down the planet’s rotation. The ultimate fate
of Phobos must almost certainly be absorption by the planet.

Several of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn present faint inequal-
ities of coloring, and telescopic examination has led astronomers to
believe that they always present the same face to their planets. The
theory of tidal friction would certainly lead us to expect that these
enormous planets would have worked out the same result for these
relatively small satellites that the earth has effected in the moon.

The efficiency of solar tidal friction must be far greater in its action
on the planets Mercury and Venus than on the earth. The determina-
tion of the periods of rotation of these planets thus becomes a matter of
much interest. But the markings on their disks are so obscure that
their rates of rotation have remained under discussion for many years.
Until recently the prevailing opinion was that in each case the day
was of nearly the same length as ourown; but a few years ago Schiap-
arelli, of Milan, an observer endowed with extraordinary acuteness of
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 121

vision, announced as the result of his observation that both Mercury
and Venus rotate only once in their respective years, and that each of
them always presents the same face to the sun. These conclusions
have recently been confirmed by Mr. Percival Lowell from observations
made in Arizona, and are exactly conformable to our theoretical expec-
tation. While it is not easy to see how these astronomers can have
been mistaken, yet it is proper to note that others possessing appar-
ently equal advantages have failed to detect the markings on the
planets. Accepting, however, this conclusion, we have the planets
Mereury and Venus, the satellites of the earth, and Jupiter and Saturn
presenting evidence favorable to the theory of tidal friction, while the
case of the Martian system is yet more striking as an instance of an
advanced stage in evolution.

It would need another article to discuss the various aspects of this
theory in relation to the histories of the planets and of their satellites.
I may say, however, that it serves in great measure to explain the fact
that the earth is tilted over with reference to its orbit round the sun,
and that it throws light on the fact that the plane of the moon’s orbit
is not coincident with that of the earth. The same cause may also be
proved to tend toward making the orbit of a satellite eccentric, and it is
this effect of tidal friction to which Mr. See has appealed. I shall not
here repeat his arguments, but in Section IV I will make some coin-
ments on his theories. .

With respect to the efficacy of tidal friction as a factor in the evolu-
tion of the earth, it is not too much to say that if we postulate a planet
consisting partly or wholly of molten lava, and rapidly rotating about
an axis at right angles to its orbit around the sun, and if that planet
have a single satellite, revolving nearly as rapidly as the planet rotates,
then a system will necessarily be evolved in time closely resembling
our own.

A theory reposing on true causation, which brings into quantitative
correlation the lengths of the present day and month, the obliquity of
the ecliptic, and the eccentricity and inclination of the moon’s orbit,
must, I think, have strong claims to acceptance.

VE

There are in the heavens many pairs of closely neighboring stars
which revolve about each other under the influence of their mutual
gravitation. The fact that both members of a pair are visible seems to
indicate that they do not differ widely in mass, and it is also a striking
peculiarity of these binary systems that the orbit is commonly very
eccentric. The distinction is great between our solar system, with its
large central mass and infinitesimal planets moving in nearly circular
_ orbits, and these binary systems, aud hence there is abundant reason
for supposing that the course of evolution has been very different in
the two cases.
122 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

Mr. See explains the high degree of eccentricity in these binary orbits
by the influence of tidal friction. The tide undoubtedly operates under
conditions which give it a wide scope, when two large masses are
revolving about one another; and tidal friction is the only known cause
capable of converting a nearly circular orbit into a very eccentric one.
But this does not afford quite sufficient reason for the acceptance of
the theory, for the assumption is involved that orbits now very eccen-
tric were formerly nearly circular. Mr. See accordingly also puts for-
ward a theory of the method by which double stars originated, and to
this I shall return later.

At first it may not be easy to see how the truth of this theory of the
origin of the eccentricity is to be tested; it may be worth while, there-
fore, to point out the direction which to me, at least, seems the most
promising in the search for confirmation or refutation.

It is thought by some spectroscopists that the ages of the stars are
already determinable by the nature of their spectra, and although the
theories which have been advanced do not meet with universal accept-
ance, yet they foreshadow views which may some day be universally
accepted. It has been plausibly contended that stars which are young
in their evolution must consist of incandescent gas, and must there-
fore have spectra furrowed by bright lines; later in their histories they
are supposed to become more condensed and to give continuous spectra.
Now, if from theories of this kind we could ascertain the stage of evo-
lution of a binary system, we should be able to form a judgment of the
truth of the tidal theory; for the younger systems should present
smaller eccentricity or orbit than the older ones, and the periodic times
in the young systems should be shorter on the whole than those in the
old ones. Delicate spectroscopic measurements make it theoretically
possible to determine the relative masses of a binary pair, but hitherto
the measurements have been carried to a Successful issue in only a very
few cases. It is to be expected, however, that the number of known
masses will be largely multiplied in the future. A small star must cool
more rapidly than a large one, and should present the appearance of
greater age. We may hope, then, in time, not only to attain to crucial
tests of spectroscopic theories of age, but also to be furnished with the
materials for judging of the truth of the tidal theory of evolution of
stellar systems.

The second and yet more speculative branch of Mr. See’s theory is
that which concerns the mode of origin of binary systems. Man must
ultimately be brought. face to face with the incomprehensibility of the
origin of matter and motion, but this consideration will never prevent
him from peering into the past to the utmost of his powers. It is
certain that the stars are continually undergoing change, and it seems
impossible to accept their existence as an ultimate fact not susceptible
of explanation. Thus we feel bound to trace their histories back
to a past so remote that their preceding course of evolution becomes
inscrutable.
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. Dz

The fact that two stars are now found to be revolving about each
other leads to the conviction that their relationship is not a casual one,
but that they have been connected from an early epoch, which for
convenience we may call the origin of the system. It appears almost
beyond question that this starting point must have been at a time
when the two stars were united in a single rotating mass. As the basis
of his explanation of the manner in which a single mass may split into
two, Mr. See takes certain theoretical investigations as to the shapes
which a mass of gravitating and rotating fluid is capable of main-
taining. I will not recapitulate his theories, but I wish to emphasize
the uncertainties with which we are here brought face to face.

Many years ago Sir John Herschel drew a number of twin nebule
as they appear through a powerful telescope. The drawings probably
possess the highest degree of accuracy attainable by this method of
delineation, and the shapes present evidence confirmatory of Mr. See’s
theory of the fission of nebule. But since Herschel’s time it has been
discovered that many details, to which our eyes must remain forever
blind, are revealed by celestial photography. The photographie film
is, In fact, sensitive to those photographic rays which we may eall
invisible light, and many nebul are now found to be hardly recogniz-
able, when photographs of them are compared with drawings. <A
conspicuous example of this is furnished by the great nebula in Andro-
meda; for whereas the drawing exhibits a cloud with a few dark
streaks in it, the photograph shows a flattened disk surrounding a
central condensation; moreover, the disk is seen to be divided into
rings, so that the whole system might have been drawn by Laplace to
illustrate his celebrated nebular hypothesis of the origin of the solar
System.

Photographs, however, do not always aid interpretation, for there
are some which serve only to increase the chaos visible with the tele-
scope. We may suspect, in fact, that the complete system of a nebula
often contains masses of cool and photographically invisible gas, and
in such cases it would seem that the true nature of the whole will be
forever concealed from us.

Another group of strange celestial objects is that of the spiral neb-
ule, whose forms irresistibly suggest violent whirlpools of incandescent
gas. Although in all probability the motion of the gas is very rapid,
yet no change of form has been detected. We are here reminded of a
rapid stream rushing past a post, where the form of the surface
remains constant whilst the water itself is in rapid movement, and it
seems reasonable to suppose that in these nebule it is only the lines of
flow of the gas which are visible. Again, there are other cases in
which the telescopic view may be almost deceptive in its physical sug-
gestions. Thus, the Dumb-Bell Nebula (27 Messier Vulpecule), as
viewed telescopically, might be taken as a good illustration of a nebula
almost ready to split into two stars. If this were so, the rotation
would be about an axis at right angles to the length of the nebula.
124 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

But a photograph of this object shows that the system really consists
of a luminous globe surrounded by a thick and less luminous ring, and
that the opacity of the sides of the ring takes a bite, as it were, out of
each side of the disk, and so gives it the apparent form of a dumb bell.
In this case the rotation must be about an axis at right angles to the
ring, and therefore along the length of the dumb-bell.'

From what I have said it must be obvious that the subject is sur-
rounded by difficulties and uncertainties. Mr. See is therefore to be
congratulated on having laid before the world an hypothesis which
appears to explain the facts as far as we know them. ‘The subject is
necessarily a speculative one, and we must look forward to future
spectroscopic and photographic researches for the confirmation or refu-
tation of his theories.

1Tt is proper to state that Mr. See does not refer to this nebula as confirmatory of
his theory.
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.!

By Eviau THomson,

The variety of service to which electricity has already contributed
can not fail to impress every one. We communicate by telegraph over
the land and under the seas. Our electric signals may bring into
almost instantaneous action the machinery of a modern fire depart-
ment, or simply note the flight of time in a clock system.

The stock ticker records the changing values; the police telegraph
anticipates the criminal in his flight. The same agent, which in the
telephone carries the inexpressibly feeble overtones of the voice to
great distances with the speed of light, conveys energy equal to thou-
sands of horsepower and distributes it for lighting our streets, our
factories, our shops, and our homes. The electric search light may
rival the sun in the brillianey of its beams, or a tiny incandescent
lamp may not equal one-tenth of a candle light. Electric motors ven-
tilate our buildings, drive our machinery, and run our elevators. We
travel swiftly on electric cars, propelled by current from wires which
also furnish the means for lighting and heating the cars.

In mills and factories the power is carried to the different buildings
oftentimes by electricity, and electric railways distribute the raw mate-
rials and deliver the finished products for shipment. In mines, coal is
cut and transported to the pit’s mouth by electric power, and the same
power works the ventilating fans. Metals are welded and forged by
electric heat, and some are smelted from their ores by electricity. The
electrolytic bath either refines crude metals or coats and protects them,
as in nickel plating.

Power is now transmitted over great distances by wire, and the
energy of waterfalls is made available for innumerable uses far from
its source. New and valuable products arise from the high heats of
the electric furnace. That paragon of nature, the diamond, can now
be fashioned in an electric crucible from plain black soot.

Nearly all the larger electrical work has been the result of the past
twenty years of progress. Before directing our attention to the great
work of advance in recent years, we may recall some of the more

lishing Company.
125
LAG ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

notable events in applied electricity which occurred in the late seventies
and immediately thereafter. It was then that the commercial begin-
nings of are lighting took place. The incandescent lamp or burner and
the electric main for supply of current soon followed. The telephone
itself, considered as a practically working speech transmitter, belongs
to the period referred to. Its birth was first made known at the Cen-
tennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. The almost ideal power
of electric motors was applied in a limited way. The fruits of the
pioneer work of that period have ripened in recent years. The experi-
mental work in electric railways, begun in the early eighties, resulted
in the enormous electric traction development of to-day, when almost
all our street railways are operated by electricity.

In this connection, it is very interesting to note that, at a convention
of street-railway men held so recently as 1887, a discussion of electric
traction as applied to horse railways was vigorously criticised as a waste
of time which, it was urged, might have been better applied to practi-
cal subjects, instead of to such a fanciful or theoretical one. In fact,
the contention was that the care and feeding of horses should take pre-
cedence of so unimportant a subject as electricity, considered as the
motive power of a car system. Yet, in less than five years from that
time, the horse question had everywhere become an exploded one. A
convention of the same association in the present year assumed in its
papers and discussions the universal application of electricity to street
car propulsion. Had the advent of the electric railway marked the only
great advance within the ten years just past, that period might still
be well characterized as one of great technical progress in electricity.
Had the decadence of horse traction occupied a much longer period than
it did, the advance could justly be deemed rapid.

Many of the largest street-railway systems were transformed in a
few months’ or in a year’s time. The advance still goes on by exten-
sions of existing lines, by the establishment of additional interurban
and suburban traffic facilities, by the increase of equipment, and by the
steady improvement in the quality of that equipment.

To appreciate the real progress of the past ten years demands a wider
view. We must consider many other branches of ‘electrical work
besides electric traction.

What, then, was the condition of the art ten years ago? By com-
parison with the present status, we may, generally speaking, get some:
idea of the growth during the past ten years. In thus looking back-
ward, we find that there were telephone-exchange systems, but prac-
tically no long-distance extensions. We also find that in the larger
cities and towns are-lighting circuits for street and store service were
in use, employing only the constant-current or series system; while to-
day are lights of various kinds are worked on several plans, or with
different kinds of current supply. There were, in addition, a moderate
number of electric stations, supplying incandescent lamps, together
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 127

with a few electric motors. Here and there, isolated lighting plants in
mills and other large buildings were in operation; but the alternating
current, so large a factor in electrical enterprises nowadays, had scarcely
become known or applied practically. There were perhaps not more
than twenty trolley cars in actual service in 1887, and these were of
doubtful success. There were no regularly constituted electric rail-
ways worthy of the name. The telephone and electric lighting wires
were largely overhead, and frequently the construction was of the most
imperfect and temporary character. Among some notable exceptions
stood prominent the Edison three-wire underground system, which had
the elements of permanence. ‘The extensive underground mains and
wires in use in cities to-day testify to the great progress which has
taken place in the means of distributing electric energy. They repre-
sent a very large investment of capital, but they also confer that reli-
ability and permanence which was before lacking.

Within the past eight or ten years much has been done in the perfec-
tion of thoroughly practical forms of meters and other instruments for
the measurement of electric forces and quantities. While such work
resembles in its delicacy that demanded by watch mechanism, on the
other hand the large station dynamos are examples of the heaviest
machine construction. Some of them demand steel castings more than
30,000 pounds in weight. Indeed, in the same electric factory we may
find watchmaking tools turning out the fine pieces of electric meters,
which may not weigh more than a few grains, and electric cranes han-
dling masses of metal of many tons—parts of the larger dynamos under
construction. A few years ago a dynamo was large if it demanded 100
or 200 horsepower to drive it, while now such machines are diminutive
when compared with those of 2,000 horsepower commonly constructed.

Dynamos are in use at Niagara of 5,000 horsepower capacity. A
single one of these would supply more than 50,000 incandescent lights
such as are ordinarily used, or would give motion to 500 trolley cars.

The period since 1887 has been marked by great extension in electric
lighting by both are and incandescent lamps. Prior to that year only
the largest cities, broadly speaking, possessed any electric-lighting
service. Now, however, even the smaller towns have their electric sta-
tions, their are lamps for street lighting, and the smaller incandescents
for general use. The same wires or mains frequently supply both kinds
of lights. The incandescent lamps in use in the United States are num-
bered by millions, and there are several hundred thousand are lamps
beside. There are in operation nearly 3,000 electric-light-supply sta-
tions, and these, together with isolated electric plants, represent a
capital of about $500,000,000.

One of the chief factors in this great extension has been the applica-
tion of alternating electric currents, or currents of wave-like nature,
reversing their direction many times in each second. The direct or
continuous current had previously occupied the field alone. But the
128 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

alternating current possessed the advantage of readily permitting the
sending out over a long distance of a high-pressure current with but
little loss and by means of comparatively small and inexpensive lines.
This current, relatively dangerous, could then be exchanged for a safe
low-pressure current on the house mains for working the lights.

The device which makes the exchange is called a transformer. It
is in reality a modified induction coil—a simple structure of copper
wire, sheet iron, and insulating materials, with no moving parts to need
attention or to get out of order. The properties and use of the trans-
former in an alternating-current system were comparatively unknown
before 1887, but since that time it has played a part in electric develop-
ment the importance of which can not easily be overestimated. It has
been, furthermore, brought to a high degree of perfection by the per-
sistent and painstaking effort of numerous workers.

In transforming a current of high pressure to one of lower pressure,
or the reverse, only a very slight loss of power or energy is suffered.
On a large scale, this loss is barely 3 per cent of the energy of the
transformed current. The larger sizes of transformers now in use
have capacities equivalent to considerably over 1,000 horsepower.
Some of these structures are employed at Niagara and others at
Buffalo.

As in the case of the apparatus just mentioned, the effort spent in
the perfection of the huge dynamo-electric generators used in lighting
aud power stations has resulted in machines so perfect as to leave but
little chance of further increase of effectiveness. They waste only a
small percentage in converting mechanical power into electrical energy,
and run for years with but little attention or need of repairs.

Along with all this improvement has gone a like betterment in the
thousand and one details and minor devices which go to make up an
electric system. Both incandescent lamps and are lamps are not only
much improved, but, also, their cost is greatly reduced by the use of
special machinery and processes of manufacture. Wires, insulating
materials, switches, ete., are all far in advance of what they were a few
years ago. Safety is secured by many ingenious devices, and the
methods of operating have been made far more effective.

It can not, with truth, be said that electrical arts or industries are
still in their infancy, if we are to judge by the perfection of electric
manufactures. It has been many years since electrical work could in
any sense be regarded as empirical, except by the uninformed. Few of
the older arts have possessed or do possess the means for such exact
measurement or research; few, indeed, are based upon simpler laws of
action. Had it been otherwise, the rapid progress which has character-
ized the past twenty years would have been impossible.

A striking feature of electrical energy is that it may be readily
applied to widely varied work.

A few instances of this may be given: The large electric-lighting
ELECTRICAL ADVANGE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 129

stations in our cities not only supply from the same mains, at the same
time, electric current which lights both are and incandescent lamps
indiscriminately, but the system carries also a large load. in electric
motors employed for such service as running elevators, driving venti-
lating fans, supplying power for pumping, and driving machinery in
shops of all kinds. The same mains supply current for charging stor-
age batteries, for heating metals for welding or working, for warming
rooms by electric heat, or for cooking by electric heaters. The physician
or surgeon draws upon the same system for current for the treatment
of disease, for galvano cautery, for electrolysis, and for the generation
of Kontgen rays.

Another example is found in a modern war ship, which may embody
an electric plant for working its incandescent lights. ‘The same machin-
ery supplies the search light, which is essentially an are light of great
power. There are also electric cranes and hoists, turret-turning and
gun-training apparatus, motors for ventilating fans or for forced draft
in the boiler furnaces, all depending on the same supply.

Perhaps, however, no better example of the varied application of
electric energy exists than at Niagara. Certainly no grander exempli-
fication of the way in which electric forces may be called into play, to
replace other and unlike agencies, can be cited. Here at Niagara we
may forcibly realize the importance of cheap and unfailing power devel-
oped from water in its fall. We find the power of huge water wheels
delivered to the massive dynamos for giving out electric energy. This
energy is variously employed. The electric lighting of the city of Niag-
ara and surroundings and the electric railways naturally depend upon
the water power. Besides these, which may be termed the ordinary
applications of electricity, there are clustered at Niagara a number of
unique industrial establishments, the importance of which will undoubt-
edly increase rapidly. In the carborundum factory we find huge
furnaces heated by the passage of electric current, and attaining temper-
atures far beyond those of the ordinary combustion of fuel. These elee-
tric furnaces produce carborundum, a new abrasive nearly as hard as the
diamond, which is a combination of carbon and silicon, unknown before
the electric furnace gaveit birth. Sand and coke are the raw substances
for its production, and these are acted upon by the excessively high
heat necessary to form the new product, already in extensive use for
grinding hard materials.

The metal aluminum, which not many years ago cost $2 an ounce, is
now produced on a large scale at Niagara, and sold at a price which
makes it, bulk for bulk, cheaper than brass. Here, again, electricity
is the agent; but in this case its power of electrolyzing or breaking up
strong chemical unions is employed. Great vats containing fused com-
pounds, such as fluorides of certain metals in which the aluminum ore
is dissolved, are arranged so that a powerful electric current sent
through the fused mass separates out the metallic aluminum. The

SM 97 9

130 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

metal is then collected and cast into ingots for shipment, or is rolled
into sheets or rods, or drawn into tubes or wire.

Works for the production of metallic sodium and other metals sim-
ilarly depend upon the decompositions effected by the electric current.

Solutions of ordinary salt or brine are electrolyzed on a large scale
in extensive works established for the purpose. The chlorine of the
salt is used with lime to make bleaching powder, so important an agent
in paper making and textile industries. The sodium of the decomposed
salt goes to form caustic soda, which is the base of soap, and is employed
in many manufactures.

The very high temperature which exists in an electric are, or between
the carbons of an are lamp, has in recent years found application in
the manufacture of another important compound, which was formerly
but slightly known as a chemical difficult to prepare. Carbide of cal-
cium is the compound referred to, and large works for its production
exist at Niagara. Here again, as in the carborundum works, raw
materials of the simplest and cheapest kind are acted upon in what
may be termed an electric-arc furnace. Coke, or carbon, and lime are
mixed and charged into a furnace in which an enormous electric are is
kept going. The carbons in an ordinary are lamp are usually less than
one-half inch in diameter, or they have a section of less than one-fifth
of a square inch, while in the carbide of calcium furnaces the section
of the carbon may be upward of half a square foot. The light of the
enormous are produced is, however, smothered, so to speak, in pow-
dered lime and coke—the raw materials mentioned above. The
importance of carbide of calcium rests in the fact that, by contact with
water, it produces acetylene gas. The illuminating power of this gas,
when burned, is its remarkable property.

It will be seen that the metallurgical and chemical developments at
Niagara are the direct outgrowth of electrical utilization of water
power. With many water powers, however, the outlet for the applica-
tion of the electrical energy exists many miles away from the place at
which the water power is found. Even at Niagara there is an example
of the beginning of long-distance transmission, by a high-pressure line
extending to Buffalo and delivering electric energy to an electric station
there.

In this case “step-up” transformers, as they are called, are employed
at the Niagara power plant to step up or raise the electrical pressure or
potential from that given by the dynamos to that required for the traus-
mission to Buffalo. This transformation is from about 2,500 up to
10,000 volts. At the Buffalo end the reverse process is carried on by
“step-down” transformers, and the energy is delivered to the trolley
hines at about 500 volts. At Buffalo the “step down” in pressure is
accompanied by a conversion of the alternating current into a contin-
uous current in one direction, or adirect current. It would require too
much space to explain the meaning of these technical designations of
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 131

the kinds of current; and they are referred to here solely to illustrate
the extreme flexibility of electrical work as lately developed. The
whole Niagara plant has grown into existence within the past five
years, and as a consequence of the technical advances within the
period of the past ten years. There are, however, in active operation,
besides the Niagara power plant, several other water-power transmis-
sions, some of them far exceeding in distance that between Niagara
and Buffalo, and some in which the amount of power conveyed, as well
as the pressure of the current used upon the line, is much greater than
is yet to be found at Niagara.

Hlectric transmissions are in particular favor in regions where the
cost of steam power, owing to dear fuel, is a stimulus to the utilization
of water powers which already exist or which are capable of develop-
ment. It is not surprising, therefore, that the far West should furnish
some of the most notable examples.

No limit can as yet be definitely set as to the distance which can be
covered in an electrical transmission. The higher the voltage or elec-
trical pressure which may be found practicable, the greater the distance
which may exist between the transmitting and receiving machinery. So,
also, the higher the cost of fuel in a locality, the greater the distance
over which it is feasible to make the transmission. It may be said that
at present the range of distances is between 30 and 100 miles.

It is interesting to compare the conditions in long-distance telephony
with those of a power transmission. With the former an exceedingly
feeble current is sent out; and though only a small percentage reach
the receiving telephone, still it may be sufficient to produce the sounds
of the voice with such distinctness as to enable them to be recognized.
To secure this result the long-distance telephone lines are made of heavy
copper wires, and the longer the distance to be covered the thicker
must be the line wire.

The cost of the copper in the line becomes very heavy for great dis-
tances, over 1,000,000 pounds of copper being required for a single cir-
cuit from Boston to Chicago. Ina power transmission, on the other
hand, the currents are of great pressure and sometimes represent thou-
sands of horsepower, and it is essential that in the transmission not
more than a certain percentage of the energy be lost. Thus in some
cases a 20 per cent loss would be too much to allow and in others a 25
to 30 per cent loss might not be inordinate.

In this case, again, heavy copper wires are used for the lines, insu-
lated as well as possible; and the cost of the copper for obtaining con-
ducting power sufficient to prevent undue loss, other things being equal,
sets the limit of distance. In the telephonic transmission the percent-
age of loss is not important, provided the characteristics which represent
speech in the receiver are not lost, while in the power transmission the
percentage of loss is vital, as the object of the plant is simply to trans-
mit energy under economical conditions.
aye ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

In the large work of to-day the general practice is to build the dynamo
directly upon the shaft of the engine which drives it or upon the water-
wheel shaft, as the case may be. This avoids loss in belts or other forms
of gearing.

Indeed, these large machines for producing electricity from power
have in late years reached a perfection far beyond that of the steam
engine itself. The steam engine, in fact, has been forced to a higher
development in response to the demands of the electrical engineer.

No service demanded of electricity has taxed the resources of elec-
trical and mechanical engineering so much as that of railway work.
The electric motors must work under the most varied conditions, stand
the hardest service, and run in the presence of water, slush, mud, and
dirt. They must run at all speeds, and be, so to speak, mechanically
and electricallyeinvulnerable.

In the same way the engines and dynamos, together with other
parts of the system, must be of the most robust character. Inventive
and engineering talent was required to provide for the new and urgent
conditions. In the early days of electric-railway work the prospect
was not always bright or promising; and one of the chief setbacks
was the enormous wear and tear of certain parts of the machinery—
chiefly those known as commutators. This difficulty was solved by the
invention and application of carbon blocks in place of metal “brushes”
used with the offending commutators. The “carbon brush” thence-
forth became almost as essential to the railway-motor machinery as the
carbon stick is to an are lamp and did more than anything else to
change the prospect of failure into inevitable success. These technical
matters make along story which would be out of place here. They
are merely alluded to for the purpose of emphasizing the fact that pio-
neer work in these advance movements has not been without its trials
and that a glinpse behind the scenes might have disclosed at times a
none too rosy aspect.

In spite of the difficulties to be overcome, the electric railway has,
in a very few years, put an end to horse traction on city railways, the
cruelties of which—not always to be avoided, perhaps—remain now
only as a fading memory. Electric traction has given greater speed,
better cars, which are lighted and heated electrically, and a resulting
cleanliness and comfort not otherwise attainable.

But facts so evident call for no comment. Meanwhile it has been
shown that single cars may be propelled at high train speeds with com-
parative safety. Even 60 miles an hour has been exceeded. It has
also been proved, by the construction of several huge electric locomo-
tives for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, expressly for tunnel service,
that such electric machinery can haul the heaviest train loads and can
more than equal in power locomotives worked by steam.

Klectric traction is now generally regarded as the ideal method for
elevated railways and as practically indispensable to underground or
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 133

tunnel traffic in cities. A new underground road is now being con-
structed in London, which, when completed, will be a splendid example
of the latest methods of the distribution and application of electricity
to train service.

Indeed, electricity seems destined at no distant day to play an impor-

tant part in revolutionizing passenger traffic between large centers of
population. The facility with which electric service may be superposed
on ordinary steam roads will greatly further this development. The
- work with the third-rail system, undertaken by one of our prominent
railway organizations, has abundantly demonstrated the practicability
of such superposition. The future will witness the growing substitu-
tion of either single motor cars or two or three coupled cars for long,
heavy trains drawn by locomotives, and a more frequent service will
result. There is an eventual possibility of higher average speeds, since
stops will not consume much time, and the time required to recover the
speed after a stop will be much less than at present. There will be no
annoyance due to escaping steam, smoke, or cinders; no sparks to cause
forest or brush fires; no stopping to change engines nor for taking up
water or coal. The locomotive will be supplanted by electric motors
driving the axles of the cars as in street-railway service. Cheap fuel
can be used to generate the power in the electric stations and the best
conditions for economy of fuel maintained. Where water power is
available within 30 or 40 miles it may be transmitted to the railway
line and used instead of power obtained from coal.

The present outlook, then, is most encouraging, so far as electric-
railway extension is concerned; and, just as in electric lighting the
foundations of present practice were laid fifteen or twenty years ago,
so it may be said that the foundations of the railway practice of twenty
years hence can be found in the work of to-day. In fact, great enter-
prises are now being planned and undertaken which will mean much to
the future of the electric railroad.

Besides the work which is thus going on, and in which the electrical
forces may be publicly witnessed in full operation, there are now other
forms of industry in which the part played by electricity is not dis-
tinctly evident. Thus enormous amounts of crude copper are annually .
refined by electrolysis, with the result that a nearly pure metal is
obtained, where formerly impurities lessened the value of the copper.
Not only is this the case, but in some instances amounts of the precious
metals, gold and silver, have been separated in the refining sufficient
to pay the cost of the process. This work is all comparatively recent
in its development.

The heating power of the electric current is now also utilized in a
variety of ways. Hlectric welding machinery has been put into service
either for accomplishing results which were not possible to be obtained
before its development, or to improve the work and lessen the cost.

Here again the part played by the electric current sometimes leaves
134 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

little indication in the finished product. As an instance, it may be
mentioned that the solid rubber tires of carriages are held in place by
wires welded into bands by electric welding machines built for the pur-
pose. Similarly, carriage hardware, axles, wheel tires, parts of bicy-
cles, parts of machines, tools, and innumerable other articles are made.
Metal bands for pails, tubs, and barrels are now largely made by electric _
welding. Even steel tubes for bicycles and vehicle frames are formed
by the same means; and new industries are based upon it. A curious
and instructive instanee of the adaptability of electric methods to new
uses is seen in the annealing of armor for war vessels. A serious diffi-
culty arose in the application of armor plate having a hardened face and
known as harveyized armor. It was found almost impossible to drill
or cut holes in the face—an operation frequently rendered necessary
in the construction of an armored ship. Various methods of anneal-
ing or softening the spots where the plate was to be drilled were tried,
with indifferent results. The construction of some of our battle ships
was delayed on account of this difficulty. It was overcome by a special
electric method, with appropriate machinery somewhat resembling that
used for electric welding, capable of heating to redness the desired
spots in the face of the heaviest armor plate, and of automatically redue-
ing the heat of the spots so as to anneal them. The heating and con-
trol of the cooling is perfectly brought about, in spite of the enormous
mass of cold metal surrounding the portion under treatment. Together
with electric welding work, this armor annealing is a striking instance
of the extreme localization of heating in metal, possible only by the
delivery of electrical energy and its conversion into heat at the desired
point. In electric welding, the electric heat is sharply localized at the
weld itself, softening and uniting the pieces; the operation being under
the same perfect control as in the armor annealing referred to. Before
the advent of the electric process, iron and platinum only were known
as the weldable metals. Afterwards, all metals became capable of
welding under electric treatment.

Hlectric heating is now also applied in many other ways. There are
to be found electric cooking utensils, electric sad irons, electric solder-
ing tools, and similar devices; while many street cars are provided with
electric heat in winter.

Vhe chief bar to the employment of electricity for general heating
lies in the fact that in using coal to develop power by steam engines—
which power in turn is sent out as electrical energy—85 to 90 per cent
of the heating value is lost in the boiler and engine. This loss is so
great as to make it undesirable, from the standpoint of cost, to recon-
vert the electric energy back into low heat, which can be more ecouom-
ically obtained from the direct use of burning fuel.

Besides the technical and industrial development which has gone
on so rapidly in the electrical field, the science of electricity, considered
simply as a department of physics, has advanced very rapidly. It is
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 135

but a few years since the late Dr. Hertz gave to the world his experi-
mental demonstrations of the fact that light of all kinds and from all
sources is really an electrical phenomenon, differing from ordinary
alternate-current waves only in the rate or frequency of vibrations. We
produce electric waves of about one hundred vibrations per second for
alternating-current work; and in the waves of red light the rapidity is
as high as four hundred millions of millions of vibrations per second.
Hertz and others used waves of some millions per second, and showed
how they could transmit signals to distances without wires; these
invisible waves being recognized by suitable receivers. The recently
announced Marconi wireless telegraph is much the same thing, with
certain improvements in detail. It may be of limited use, but will not
replace telegraph lines and submarine cables.

Our store of scientific facts has been greatly increased and our elec-
trical theories have been made more precise in late years; while the
enormous industrial expansion has furnished the means for researches
otherwise difficult to carry on.

Hardly had the work of Hertz and others who followed in his foot-
steps been assimilated, before the truly remarkable, not to say astound-
ing, discovery by Professor Rontgen of what he called the X-rays pro-
duced a profound impression not only in the scientific world, but upon
the general public as well. The interest of the scientist had a different
basis from the popular one of disclosure of objects hidden in opaque
structures; for he saw in the discovery a new weapon of attack upon
the secrets of nature. This weapon has already proved to be so serv-
iceable as to show that his anticipations were not unfounded. The
X-rays, which became at once indispensable to surgery, are the result
of electrical actions in certain vacuum bulbs; and the discovery is
properly an electrical one.

The rapid extension of electrical application must naturally be of
importance in social and economic questions. Changes in our methods
give rise to extension of possibilities in the lives of our people. The
effect of electric railways alone must be an important study for the
economist and social scientist. Fresh questions of law and equity arise
out of the conflict of the new and the old.

The increasing importance of electrical work has had a powerful
effect upon the development of many other arts. It has stimulated
workers in other than electrical fields to the attainment of higher stand-
ards, to the improvement of materials and construction, to the bringing
out of new products and processes in response to the demands of elec-
tric engineering. As a consequence, we have better and more econom-
ical engines, improved methods in the casting, forging, and working of
iron, brass, copper, and other metals. We have new alloys with special
properties, special grades and kinds of steel, improved methods of
working such substances as glass, porcelain, rubber, asbestos, mica,
etc. In street railways we have far better rails and rolling stock.
136 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

No existing industry employs a greater range of materials, from the
rarest to the most common, than does electric work. None requires or
employs such a variety, in character, kind, and quality, of materials, or
of treatment of them, tosupply daily needs. Nature has been ransacked
to discover whatever may possess qualities desirable in electrical con-
struction; and the resources of art and ingenuity have been called to
supply whatever might be lacking.

This material progress, coupled with the civilizing and educative
influences naturally accompanying it, as well as the many other ad-
vances in the application of science to the needs of mankind, will ever
remain the crowning glory of the latter half of the nineteenth century.
THE X-RAYS.

By W. C. RONTGEN.

I.—UPON A NEW KIND OF RAYs.!

1. If the discharge of a great Ruhmkorff induction coil be passed
through a Hittorf vacuum tube, or’a Lenard’s, Crooke’s, or similar appa-
ratus containing a sufficiently high vacuum, then, the tube being covered
with a close layer of thin black pasteboard and the room darkened, a
paper screen covered on one side with barium-platinum cyanide and
brought near the apparatus will be seen to glow brightly and fluoresce
at each discharge whichever side of the screen is toward the vacum tube.
The fluorescence is visible even when the screen is removed to a distance
of 2 meters from the apparatus.

The observer may easily satisfy himself that the cause of the fluores-
cence is to be found at the vacuum tube and at no other part of the
electrical circuit.

2. It is thus apparent that there is here an agency which is able to
pass through the black pasteboard impenetrable to visible or ultra
violet rays from the sun or the electric arc, and having passed through
is capable of exciting a lively fluorescence, and it is natural to inquire
whether other substances can be thus penetrated.

It is found that all substances transmit this agency, but in very dif-
ferent degree. I will mention some examples. Paper is very trans-
missible.?

I observed fluorescence very distinctly behind a bound book of about
1,000 pages. The ink presented no appreciable obstacle. Similarly
fluorescence was seen behind a double whist pack. A single card held
between the fluorescent screen and the apparatus produced no visible
effect. A single sheet of tin foil, too, produces hardly any obstacle, and
it is only when several sheets are super weston that their shadow appears

2 By the transmissibility of a substance I designate the ratio between the bright-
ness of a fluorescent screen held behind the body and that which the screen would
have under the same conditions in the absence of the interposed substance.

distinctly on the screen. Thick wooden blocks are transmissible. Slabs
of pine 2 or 3 centimeters thick absorb only very little. A plate of
aluminum about 15 millimeters thick diminished the effect very con-
siderably, but did not cause the fluorescence to entirely disappear.
Blocks of hard rubber several centimeters thick still transmitted the
rays.’

Glass plates of equal thickness behave very differently according to
whether they contain lead (flint glass) or not. ‘The first class are much
less transmissible than the second.

If the hand is held between the vacuum tube and the screen, the
dark shadow of the bones is seen upon the much lighter shadow out-
line of the hand. Water, carbon bisulphide, and various other liquids
investigated proved very transmissible. I could not find that hydrogen
was more transmissible than air. The fluoresence was visible behind
plates of copper, silver, lead, gold, and platinum, when the thickness
of the plate was not too great. Platinum 0.2 millimeter thick is still
transmissible, and silver and copper plates may be still thicker. Lead
1.5 millimeters thick is practically impenetrable, and advantage was
frequently taken of this characteristic. A wooden stick of 20 imilli-
meters square cross section, having one side covered with white lead,
behaved differently when interposed between the vacuum tube and the
screen according as the X-rays traversed the block parallel to the
painted side or were compelled to pass through it. In the first case
there was no 2ffect appreciable, while in the second a dark shadow was
thrown on the screen. Salts of the metals, whether solid or in solution,
are to be ranged in almost the same order as the metals themselves for
transmissibility.

3. These observations and others lead to the conclusion that the
transmissibility of equal thicknesses of different substances depends
on their density. At least no other characteristic exerts so marked an
influence as this.

The following experiment shows, however, that the density is not the
sole factor. I compared the transmissibility of nearly equally thick
plates of glass, aluminum, calespar, and quartz. The density of these
substances is substantially the same, and yet it was quite evident that
the calespar was considerably less transmissible than the others, which
are about alike in this respect.

4, All bodies became less transmissible with increasing thickness.
For the purpose of finding a relation between transmissibility and
thickness I have made photographic exposures, in which the photo-
graphic plate was partly covered with a layer of tin foil consisting of a
progressively increasing number of sheets. I shall make a photometric
measurement when I am in possession of a suitable photometer.

5. Sheets were rolled from platinum, lead, zinc, and aluminum of such

? For brevity’s sake I employ the word ‘“‘rays,” and in distinction from others make
use of the expression ‘‘ X-rays.”
THE X-RAYS. 139

thickness that all appeared to be equally transmissible. The following
table gives the measured thickness in millimeters, the relative thickness
compared with platinum, and the specific gravity:

From these values it may be seen that the transmissibility of plates
of different metals so chosen that the product of the thickness and
density is constant would not be equal. The transmissibility increases
much faster than this product falls off.

6. The fluoresence of barium-platinum-cyanide is not the only action
by which X-rays may be recognized. It should be remarked that they
cause other substances to fluoresce, as for example the photophores-
cent calcium compounds, uranium glass, common glass, calespar, rock
salt, ete.

Jt is of particular importance from many points of view that photo-
graphic dry plates are sensitive to X-rays. It thus becomes possible
to fix many phenomena so that deceptions are more easily avoided; and
J have where practicable checked all important observations made with
a fluorescent screen by photographic exposures.

It appears questionable whether the chemical action upon the silver
salts of the photographic plate is produced directly by the X-rays. It
is possible that this action depends upon the fluorescent light which, as
is mentioned above, may be excited in the glass plate, or perhaps in
the gelatine film. ‘“ Films” may indeed be made use of as well as glass
plates.

I have not as yet obtained experimental evidence that the X-rays are
capable of giving heat. This characteristic might, however, be assumed
as present, since in the excitation of fluorescent phenomena the capacity
of the energy of the X-rays for transformation is proved, and since it
is certain that of the X-rays falling upon a body not all are given up.

The retina of the eye is not sensitive to these rays. Nothing is to be
noticed by bringing the eye near the vacuum tube, although according
to the preceding observations the media of the eye must be sufficiently
transmissible to the rays in question.

7. After I had discovered the transmissibility of various bodies of
relatively great thickness I hastened to investigate whether or not the
X-rays were refracted in passing through a prism. Experiments with
water and carbon bisulphide in mica prisms of 30 degrees refracting
angle showed no deviation either when observations were made with the
fluorescent screen or with the photographic plate. For comparison, the
deviation of light rays was observed under the same conditions. The
140 THE X-RAYS.

refracted portion lay from 10 to 20 centimeters distant from that not
refracted. With prisms of hard rubber and aluminum of about 30
degrees refracting angle I obtained exposures on a photographic plate
which perhaps indicated a slight refraction. This is, however, very
doubtful and the deviation is, if present, so small that the index of
refraction for X-rays in these substances can not exceed 1.05. I could
not observe with the fluorescent screen any deviation in these cases.
Experiments with prisms of the denser metals have so far yielded no
certain results on account of the slight transmissibility and the conse-
quent decrease of the intensity of the transmitted ray.

In consideration of these results on the one hand, and on the other
of the importance of the question whether or not the X-rays in passing
from one medium to another undergo refraction, it is very gratifying
that this question may be investigated by other means than by the help
of prisms. Finely pulverized bodies in suitable layers allow but little
light to pass, in consequence of refraction and reflection. If now the
X-rays are transmitted equally well through powder as through the
coherent substance, equal masses being presupposed, it is proved that
neither refraction nor regular reflection is present in any marked
degree. This experiment was performed using finely pulverized rock-
salt, finely divided silver, obtained by electrolysis, and the zinc dust
so frequently utilized in chemical processes. In no case was any differ-
ence in transmissibility between the powder and the coherent sub-
stance detected either by the use of the fluorescent screen or the pho-
tographie plate.

It follows of course from the results thus obtained that the X-rays
can not be concentrated by the use of lenses; and, indeed, a great hard
rubber lens and a glass lens actually proved without effect. The
shadow of a round rod is darker in the middle than at the edges, while
that of a tube which is filled with some substance more transmissible
than the material of which the tube is composed is darker at the edges
than at the center.

8. The question as to the reflection of X-rays is so far settled by the
experiments already described that no marked regular reflection was
to be found with any of the substances examined. Other experiments
which [ will here pass over lead to the same results.

Nevertheless an observation should be mentioned which indicated at
first glance an opposite result. A photographic plate shielded from the
action of light rays by a black paper was exposed to X-rays so that the
glass side was toward the discharge tube. The sensitive film was par-
tially covered with bright plates of platinum, lead, zinc, and aluminum,
arranged in a star-shaped figure. Upon development it was observed
that the darkening of the film under the platinum, the lead, and espe-
cially the zine, was distinctly greater than in the other parts. No such
effect was produced by the aluminum. Thus it seemed as if the three
metals mentioned reflected. However, there were other causes to be
THE X-RAYS. 141

conceived which might have produced the increased darkening, and in
order to be sure I performed a second experiment, interposing a thin
sheet of aluminum foil (very transmissible to X-rays, but not to those
of the ultraviolet) between the metals and the sensitive film. Since in
this case again practically the same result was obtained, the fact of
reflection of X-rays by the metals above mentioned is established.

Taking this result together with the observation that powder is as
transmissible as coherent substance, and further, that bodies with
rough surfaces behave in the transmission of X-rays and also in the
experiments just described exactly like polished bodies, the conclusion
is reached that there is, as before remarked, no regular reflection, but
that the bodies behave toward X-rays in the same manner as a turbid
medium with reference to light.

As I have not been able to discover any refraction in the passage
from one medium to another, it appears as if the X-rays travel with
equal velocity in all bodies, and hence in a medium which is every-
where present and in which the particles of the bodies are embedded.
These latter act as a hindrance to the propagation of the X-rays,
which is in general greater the greater the density of the body in
question.

9. In accordance with this supposition it might be possible that the
arrangement of the molecules of the body would exert an intlueice on
its transmissibility, and that, for example, a piece of calespar would
be unequally transmissible for equal thicknesses when the rays passed
along or at right angles to the axis. Experiments with calespar and
quartz gave, however, a negative result.

10. It will be recalled that Lenard, in his beautiful experiments on
the transmission of the Hittorf cathode rays through thin aluminum
foil, obtained the result that these rays are disturbances in the ether,
and that they diffuse themselves in all bodies. We may make a similar
statement with regard to our rays.

In his last research Lenard has determined the relative absorption of
different substances for the cathode rays, and in determining the same
for air at atmospheric pressure has given the values 4.10, 3.40, 3.10 as
referred to 1 centimeter thickness according to the density of the gas
in the discharge tube. Judging from the length of spark observed, I
have, in my researches, generally employed tubes of about equal exhaus-
tion and only seldom those of much greater or less density. Using the
photometer of L. Weber, the best at my command, I compared the
intensity of fluorescence on the screen in two positions distant 100 and
200 millimeters, respectively, from the discharge tube. From the results
of these experiments, agreeing well with each other, it appeared that
the intensity varies inversely as the square of the distance. Hence the
air absorbs a much smaller portion of the X-rays passing through it
than of cathode rays. This result is in accord with the observation
above mentioned, that it is possible to distinguish fluorescence at 2
meters distance trom the discharge tube.
142 THE X-RAYS.

Most other substances are, like the air, more transmissible for X-rays
than for the cathode rays.

11. Another very noteworthy difference between the behavior of the
cathode rays and the X-rays was exhibited in that I was unable to pro-
duce any deviation of the latter by the action of the most powerful
magnetic fields. The property of being subject to deviation by mag-
nets is, on the other hand, very characteristic of the cathode rays.
Hertz and Lenard have observed various kinds of cathode rays which
‘are to be distinguished by their differences in their capacities for
exciting phosphorescence in their absorptibility and in their deviation
by the magnet,” but a considerable magnetic deviation was to be observed
with all of them, and I do not believe that this characteristic would be
given up except for the most urgent reasons.

12. According to the results of experiments particularly directed to
discover the source of the X-rays, it is certain that the part of the wall
of the discharge tube which most strongly fluoresces is the principal
starting point. The X-rays therefore radiate from the place where,
according to various observers, the cathode rays meet the glass wall.
If one Crates the cathode rays within the tube by a magnet, the source
of the X-ray is also seen to change its position so that these radiations
still proceed from the end points of the cathode rays. The X-rays
being undeviated by magnets can not, however, be simply cathode rays
passing unchanged through the glass wall. The greater density of the
gas outside the discharge tube can not, according to Lenard, be made
answerable for the great difference of the deviation.

I come therefore to the results that the X-rays are not identical with
the cathode rays, but that they are excited by the cathode rays in the
glass wall of the vacuum tube.

13. This generating action takes place not only in glass, but as I
observed it in apparatus with aluminum walls 2 millimeters thick, exists
also for this metal. Other substances will be investigated.

14. The warrant for giving the title “rays” to the agent which pro-
ceeds from the wall of the discharge tube arose in part from the quite
regular formation of shadows appearing when more or less transmissible
substances are interposed between the generating apparatus and a
phoshorescent screen or photographic plate. I have many times
observed and sometimes photographed such shadow forms, in whose
production there lies a particular charm. I have, for example, photo-
graphs of the shadow of the profile of a door which separates the two
rooms, in one of which was the discharge apparatus, in the other the
photographic plate; of the shadow of the hand bones; of the shadow
of a wooden spool wound with wire; of a set of weights in a box; of a
compass in which the magnetic needle is quite inclosed in metal; of
a piece of metal which is shown to lack homogeneity by the use of
X-rays, ete.

The propagation of ile X-rays in right lines is shown by pin-hole
photography, which I have been able to do with the discharge appara-

tus covered with black paper. The picture is weak, but unmistakably
correct.

15. I have much sought to obtain interference phenomena with
X-rays, but unfortunately—perhaps on account of their slight intensit y—
without result.

16. Experiments have been begun to see if electrostatic forces can
in any way influence X-rays, but these are not yet finished.

17. If the question is asked what the X-rays—which certainly are
not cathode rays—really are, one might at first, on account of their
lively fluorescent and chemical action, compare them to ultra-violet
light. But here one falls upon serious difficulties. Thus, if the X-rays
were ultra-violet light, then this light must possess the following
characteristics:

(a) That in passing from air into water, carbon bisulphide, aluminum,
rock salt, glass, zine, ete., it experiences no notable refraction.

(b) That it is not regularly reflected by these substances.

(c) That it can not be polarized by the usual materials.

(d) That its absorption by substances is influenced by nothing so
much as by their density.

In other words, one must assume that these ultra-violet radiations
comport themselves quite differently from all previously known infra-
red, visible, and ultra-violet rays.

I have not been able to admit this, and have sought some other
explanations.

A kind of relation seems to subsist between the new radiation and
light radiation, or at least the shadow formation, the fluorescence, and
the chemical action, which are common phenomena of these two kinds
of radiation, point in this direction. It has been long known that
longitudinal as well as transverse vibrations are possible in the ether,
and according to various physicists must exist. To be sure, their
existence has not, up to the present time, been proved, and hence their
characteristics have not thus far been experimentally investigated.

Should not the new radiations be ascribed to longitudinal vibrations
in the ether? I may say that in the course of the investigation this
hypothesis has impressed itself more and more favorably with me, and
I venture to propose it, although well aware that it requires much
further examination.

II.—UPON A NEW KIND OF RAYS (ABSTRACT)!

As my work must be interrupted for several weeks, I take the oppor-
tunity of presenting in the following some new results:
18. At the time of my first publication I was aware that the X-rays

der Physik und Chemie, 64, p. 12, 1898.
144 THE X-RAYS.

have the property of discharging electrified bodies, and I intimated
that it was the X-rays and not the cathode rays passing unchanged
through the aluminum window of his apparatus which produced the
effect described by Lenard on electrified bodies at a distance. I have,
however, delayed publication of my experiments until I could present
conclusive results.

These can be obtained only when the observations are carried on in a
room which is not only completely insulated from the electrostatic
forces emanating from the vacuum tube, the conducting wires, the
induction apparatus, etc., but is also closed to the air which comes in
the neighborhood of the discharge apparatus.

For this purpose I had a box constructed by soldering together
zine sheets, and this box was large enough to contain me and the
necessary apparatus, and was air-tight with the exception of an open-
ing which could be closed by a zine door. The side opposite to the door
was mostly lined with lead, and immediately adjacent to the discharge
tube an opening 4 centimeters wide was cut in the lead and zine wall,
and its place filled up air-tight with aluminum foil. Through this
window passed the X-rays to be investigated. I have with this appa-
ratus verified the following results:

(a) Positively or negatively electritied bodies placed in air are dis-
charged when immersed in X-rays, and the action is the more rapid
the more intense the radiations. The intensity of the rays is deter-
mined by their action upon a fluorescent screen or a photographic
plate. °

It is in general immaterial whether the electrified substance is a con-
ductor or nonconductor. Thus far I have discovered no difference in
the behavior of different bodies relative to the rapidity of their dis-
charge, or between positive or negative charges. These points are,
however, open to further investigation.

(b) When an electrified conductor is surrounded by a solid insulator,
as for example, paraffine, the radiation produces the same effect as
would the flashing of the insulating shell by a flame placed in contact
with the ground. Q

(c) If this insulator be in its turn closely surrounded by a grounded
conductor and both itself and this outer conductor be transmissible to
X-rays, the action of the X-radiations upon the inner conductor is
unnoticeable with the apparatus at my command.

(d) The observations recorded under (a), (b), and (¢) indicate that
the air through which X-rays pass possesses the property of dischare-
ing any electrified bodies with which it comes in contact.

(¢) If this be indeed the case, and if the air retains for some con-
siderable time this property imparted to it by the X-rays, it must be
possible to discharge electrified bodies not themselves under the influ-
ence of X-rays by bringing to them air which has been subject to these
radiations.
THE X-RAYS. 145

One may satisfy himself in various ways that this is the case. The
following, though perhaps not the simplest method, may be mentioned:

I employed a brass tube 3 centimeters wide and 45 centimeters long.
At 1 centimeter’s distance from one end a portion of the tube was cut
away and replaced by a thin sheet of aluminum. At the other end
there was introduced a brass ball, which was supported by a metal
support, and this end was closed air-tight. Between the brass ball
and the closed end of the tube a side tube was soldered in, which was
connected with an air-pump. By this means a current of air was
made to flow by the brass ball, after having passed the aluminum
window. The distance from the ball to the window was 20 centimeters.

I mounted this tube in the zine box in such a manner that the
X-rays entered the tube at right angles to its axis, and the insulated
ball lay outside the reach of these rays, in the shadow. The tube and
zine box were placed: in contact and the ball was connected with a
Hankel electroscope. ;

It was shown that a charge on the ball, whether positive or negative,
was not influenced by X-rays so long as the air remained quiet in the
tube, but that a marked diminution of the charge was produced by
sucking a strong current of air through. If the ball was kept at con-
stant potential by connecting it with accumulators, and a continuous
eurrent of air was kept flowing in the tube, an electrical current was
set up just as if the ball was connected with the walls of the tube by
a conductor of high resistance. * * *

20. In section 13 of my first article it was stated that the X-rays may
be generated not only in glass butin aluminum. In conducting experi-
ments in this direction no solid bodies were found which were not capa-
ble of producing X-rays when under the influence of cathode rays. I
know no reason to suppose that liquids and gases also do not act
similarly.

Different substances, however, possess this property in different
degrees. For example, if cathode rays are caused to fall upon a plate
of which one-half is composed of platinum foil 0.5 millimeter thick and
the other half of aluminum 1 millimeter thick, one may observe in the
photographic image taken with the pinhole camera that the platinum
foil sends out many more X-rays from the side bombarded by the
cathode rays than does the aluminum on the same side. But from the
back side of the plate there go out almost no X-rays from the platinum,
while the aluminum sends out a relatively largenumber. ‘These latter
rays are generated at the front layers of the aluminum and pass through
the plate.

It should be remarked that these observations have a practical sig-
nificance. For the generation of X-rays of the greatest possible inten-
sity my experience recommends the employment of platinum. I have —
used for some weeks with advantage a discharge apparatus having a
concave mirror of aluminum as cathode, and as annode a platinum

plate placed in the center of curvature, and at an angle of 45 degrees
with the axis.

21. The X-rays proceed from the annode with this apparatus. As I
have concluded from experiments with apparatus with various forms,
it is immaterial with regard to the intensity of the X-rays whether they
proceed from the annode or not. * * *

IIl.—FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROPERTIES OF X-RAYS
(ABSTRACT).!

1. If between a discharge tube sending out intense X-rays? and a
fluorescent screen one interposes an untransmissible plate so placed
that it shades the whole screen, one can still observe a luminosity of
the barium-platinum cyanite. This luminescence is still visible when
the screen is close up to the plate, and one is at first inclined to regard
the plate as transmissible. When, however, one
covers the fluorescent plate with a thick glass slide
the fluorescence becomes much weaker, and it com-
pletely disappears when instead of using the glass
plate one covers the screen with a lead cylinder -
1 millimeter thick, which passes entirely over the
head of the observer and is closed by the untrans-
missible plate.

The phenomena described might be due to the
diffraction of rays of great wave length or to the
sending out of X-rays by the objects surrounding
the discharge tube, such, for example, as the air
through which the rays pass.

The Jatter explanation is the true one, as may be easily shown by the
use of the following apparatus. The figure shows a thick-walled glass
bell jar 20 centimeters high and 10 centimeters in diameter, which is
closed by a thick zine plate inserted with cement.
