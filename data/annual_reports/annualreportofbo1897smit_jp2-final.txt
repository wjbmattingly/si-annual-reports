JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

JANUARY 27, 1897.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the
fourth Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller) in the chair; the
Hon. A. E. Stevenson, Vice President of the United States; the Hon.
J.S. Morrill, the Hon. 8S. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon.
Joseph Wheeler, the Hon. kh. Rk. Hitt, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the
Hon. William L. Wilson, Dr. J. B. Angell, Dr. Andrew D. White,
the Hon. John B. Henderson, the Hon. Gardiner G. Hubbard, and the
Secretary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion the Secretary read the minutes of the
last meeting in abstract. ‘There being no objection the minutes were
approved. ‘

The Secretary presented his annual report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1896, remarking that as the Regents had already been supplied
with copies by mail he would say nothing further upon it now. On
motion the report was accepted.

Senator Henderson, as chairman of the Executive Committee, pre-
sented the report of the Executive Committee for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1896. On motion the report was adopted.

Senator Henderson presented the following customary resolution
relative to income and expenditure, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Sec-
retary with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part
of the Secretary as to items.

Senator Henderson, as Chairman of the Permanent Committee (com-
* posed of the Executive Committee and the Secretary), stated that the
matters which affect the Avery estate, and which were before the Board
at the last meeting, had had the committee’s consideration. There was
no special report, but he hoped to have a statement to make by the
next meeting.

The Chancellor then announced that if there was no objection the
matters in the Avery estate would be postponed for a report at the

next annual meeting of the Board.

XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Secretary said:

The Regents know of the irreparable loss which the Institution has sustained in the
death of Dr. Goode, a man who can not be replaced; a man who was devoted to its
service; who, it almost might be said, laid down his life for it, and who possessed a
combination of administrative ability and general scientific knowledge with every
element of moral trustworthiness for which I do not know where to look again. I
have thought that the Regents might like to make, by exception, an acknowledg-
ment of this by some resolution, and I will request Dr. White to present those
prepared.

Dr. White then read the following resolutions:

Whereas the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. G. Brown
Goode, died on September 6, 1896,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents wish to here record their sense of the devo-
tion to duty which in the late Dr. Goode came before any considerations of
personal advancement, or even before the care of his own health, and of their recog-
nition that his high administrative ability and wide knowledge were devoted unsel-
fishly to the service of the Institution, with results whose value they can not too
highly acknowledge; and they desire to express their feeling of the loss that the
Institution, the National Museum, and the cause of science has sustained in his
untimely death.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be suitably engrossed and transmitted
to the family of Dr. Goode.

Dr. White said:

In being asked to offer these resolutions i wish to say that I accept the duty as
one especially grateful to iy own feelings. FT became acquainted with Dr. Goode
about sixteen years ago when he went abroad to Berlin, representing the Smith-
sonian Institution at the Fisheries Exposition. I think every one who met him then
conceived a very high opinion not only of his executive abilities, which he had much
occasion to show, but of his personal qualities. I took occasion to bring him into
connection with the leading German men of science, and he at once seemed to win
not merely their respect but also their most kindly feelings. You are aware that on
that occasion the United States exhibition was by far superior to any of their own,
and it was then that we received the great prize from the Emperor Wiihelm, which
now stands in the Museum under our care. At various times since I have had occa-
sion to renew my acquaintance with Dr. Goode, and I have never ceased to hold the
good opinion which his admirable qualities aroused in me.

Mr. Hubbard said:

Mr. Brown Goode was a very warm personal friend of mine. I personally regret
his loss, and I regret it still more on account of the loss to the Museum. I do not
suppose that there was any man living who knew better what was necessary for the
Museum than he. I do not believe any man ever lived, or ever will live, who will
give so much of his time and thought to the work of this Museum as Mr. Brown
Goode did, and his death is a blow which the Museum will feel as long as it lasts.

Senator Morrill said:

I frequently had occasion to converse with Dr. Goode in relation to the future
growth of the Museum. It is, perhaps, well known to most of you that I have been
making an effort for some years now to secure an additional building for the Museum,
and in talking over the matter Dr. Goode was very earnest in his purpose to fill
it with something that would be worthy of our country, and he was also strongly of
the opinion that there was no country that could afford as many valuable and
attractive collections for Museum purposes as the United States, and, with the
Smithsonian, was capable of doing so in a more economical manner than perhaps
any other country in the world.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

Mr. Wilson said:

My personal relations with Dr. Goode were so pleasant and cordial that though I
can add nothing to what has been already said by Dr. White, Mr. Hubbard, and Sen-
ator Morrill, I feel at least like seconding these resolutions. I was thrown a great
deal with Dr. Goode in a most informal and unofficial way and I learned to have the
highest possible respect for him, not only as a scientific man, but as an individual.
The simplicity, modesty, and general kindliness of his character were always his
striking features, and I remember no greater shock in recent months than the
announcement of the death of this still young man, which I learned from an Amer-
ican paper as soon as [ returned from abroad last summer.

On motion, the resolutions were adopted by a rising vote.

The Secretary said that before leaving this subject he might say that
the year had been a painful one for the Institution in the loss of other
people not known to the Regents, but only less essential to it than
Dr. Goode. Mr. RK. E. Earll and others who were identified with it
had been thus taken away, and it had been difficult to find persons of
efficiency to attend to their work. The Secretary added that he had lost
not only Dr. Goode, but also Mr. Winlock, who was assistant in charge
of the Institution, who came next to Dr. Goode in authority, and who
was trusted and trustworthy in every way. It had been a sad year
here, but he would say nothing further about its losses except that the
deaths included a number of employees who were also valuable in their
positions.

The Chancellor stated that the appointment of an Assistant Secre-
tary was made by the Secretary, with the consent of the Regents; in
other words, the initiative, under the law, came from the Secretary.
He would like to hear from the Secretary about it.

The Secretary then addressed the Board as follows:

The Board is aware that a vacancy exists in the Assistant Secretaryship, caused
by the death of Dr. Goode, a like successor to whom can hardly be found.

Under correction of the Chancellor, I will recall that while the law authorizes the
Secretary to, with the consent of the Board of Regents, employ assistants, he is not
required to employ anyone.

In the early days of the Institution there was one Assistant Secretary in charge of
the library, to which there was added later by Professor Henry one in charge of the
Museum. The latter of these was Professor Baird, who was in turn appointed Sec-
retary by the Regents, and who, during a term of nearly ten years, appointed no
assistants until January 12, 1887, when he received the consent of the Regents to the
appointment of one in charge of the exchanges, library, and publications, and
another in charge of the Museum. There have been, therefore, periods in the his-
tory of the Institution when there was but one Assistant Secretary, a long period
immediately preceding the present incumbency when there was none, and subse-
quently a brief period when there were two. The work of the Institution has
enormously increased, even since the death of Secretary Baird.

In regard to subordinate positions, the power of appointment has been exercised
by the successive Secretaries for a period of over 40 years, and with an absence of
any suggestion of favoritism, partiality, or harshness, which is rare in office. In all
these appointments and in every official relationship the recognition of the plenary
authority of the Regents, as exercised through the Secretary, has been the founda-
tion of good government. It is because the authority of the Board and its method
of action is so absolutely recognized that it has been so very rarely needed to dis-
play it to make it effective, and thus during ten years of the Museum’s administra-
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

tion I do not recall a single occasion in which the Secretary has not found himself
able to act in accordance with the wish of the Assistant Secretary in all appoint-
_ments and removals.

Nothing can be more desirable in administration than a condition which can per-
mit this freedom without fear of laxity. It was justified in this case, as it is hoped
it will always be justified, by the fact that the person in this important position
possessed the entire confidence of the Secretary.

It is more than ever before desirable that the officer in charge of the Museum
shall be a man of wide experience in administrative affairs, as well as a man of
scientific position, and that the whole body of scientific men throughout the country
shall be eligible, but I have found myself unable as yet, after the most anxious pains,
to present any name to the Regents which appears entirely satisfactory.

After laying before the Regents the names of different gentlemen pro-
posed for the position, with the recommendatory letters, the Secretary
said that most of these, with others he had considered among the more
prominent ones of the country, were without the civil service and came
under the exclusions of its rules. He would add that the names outside
the civil service among whom the Institution would naturally seek were
those of persons already enjoying positions of high trust, and who, in
several of these instances, could only accept the place at a heavy
pecuniary sacrifice.

The Secretary then presented the name of Mr. Charles D. Walcott,
honorary curator of the Museum, and now director of the United States
Geological Survey, and after explaining the grounds for his confidence
in Mr. Walcott and the reasons which made it impracticable for the
latter to then accept the position, while it was desirable that some
immediate, if provisionary, arrangement should be made, asked the
consent of the Regents to the appointment of Mr. Waleott as acting
assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with the under-
standing that his duties to the Institution were to be confined exclu-
sively to the charge of the Museum. Senator Morrill then introduced
the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Prof. Charles D. Walcot, as

acting assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with duties confined to
the charge of the National Museum, be approved.

The Secretary then said:
I have received the following letter from the President of the United States:

“ HXECUTIVE MANSION,
“ Washington, June 18, 1896.

‘DEAR Sir: I inclose you a classification of the employees of the
Smithsonian Institution, which is a copy of those signed by the other
Executive Departments and bureaus.

‘‘T wish you would insert the date and sign it and notify the Civil
Service Commission that you have done so. I think it should be filed
in your office.

‘‘ Yours, truly,

“GROVER CLEVELAND.
“S. P. LANGLEY, Secretary, etc.”
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

It has been taken as a matter of course that this order does not apply to the
parent institution, and it is only as regards its application to Smithsonian bureaus’
supported wholly or in part by Government appropriations that I bring the letter
to the attention of the Regents. In the absence of their instructions the expression
of the President’s wish has been taken as a command, and the classification referred
to signed.

The Secretary then communicated to the Regents a letter from one
of their number, the Hon. W. L. Wilson, Postmaster-General, on the
subject of the relations of the Smithsonian bureaus with the United
States civil service. Mr. Wilson also personally communicated to the
Board the fact that he had had a conference on this subject with the
President, who recognized that his letter could not apply to the Smith-
sonian Institution proper, which was not supported by Government
appropriations.

The Regents then discussed with some fullness the subject of these
relationships, and without adopting any resoJution, indicated a line of
action which seemed to them suitable.

The Secretary stated that he had been requested to appear before the
Joint Committee on the Library in the early part of last month, when
he had been asked what the National Museum had which would serve
to decorate the new Library building.

Senator Gray, after discussion, offered the following resolution, which
was adopted:

Resolved, That in the opinion of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion it will not be expedient or wise to interfere with the integrity of the National
Museum by lending, for the decoration of the Library building, any of the articles
or property now in its care.

The Secretary then exhibited to the Board the ‘Half Century”
volume, explaining to what degree its preparation had arrived. He
also read a letter from Mrs. Coppée, conveying her acknowledgment of
the resolutions adopted on the death of her husband, Dr. Coppée.

The Secretary then exhibited the Hodgkins medals, in silver and
bronze, with a statement of the number sent to contestants.

Mr. Hubbard presented resolutions to the effect that the Chancellor
should appoint a committee, of which the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution should be ex officio, a member, to inquire into the condition
of various bureaus, with special reference to what could best be done
to increase their usefulness. Senator Henderson expressed the wish
that the Regents would revise the work of the Executive Committee,
and stated that the Institution needed help in Congress.

Senator Morrill remarked that, in view of the lateness of the hour,
the resolutions which had been proposed should be considered at
another meeting, and at the suggestion of the Chancellor it was

arranged that an adjourned meeting should be held on February 1, at
10 o’clock a. m.
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

FEBRUARY 1, 1897.

The Board met this morning.

Present: The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller) in the chair; the
Vice-President, the Hon. A. E. Stevenson; the Hon. J. 8S. Morrill, the
Hon. S. M. Cullom, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
the Hon. R. R. Hitt, the Hon. W. L. Wilson, Dr. Andrew D. White, the
Hon. J. B. Henderson, the Hon. Gardiner G. Hubbard, and the Secre-
tary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion an abstract of the minutes of the
meeting of the 2/th of January was read and approved.

The Secretary then read the resolutions introduced by Mr. Hubbard,
who made an explanation of their purpose. A general discussion
ensued, and the resolutions were finally adopted in the following form:

Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed by the Chancellor, the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution being ex officio a member, upon the National Museum,
the Burean of American Ethnology, and the National Zoological Park, with especial
reference to the ascertainment of what can be done to promote their usefulness and
value, and to report to the Board of Regents at its next meeting.

The Chancellor appointed as members of the committee Mr. Hubbard,
Senator Cullom, Mr. Henderson, Mr. Wilson, and the Secretary.

The Secretary then said that a matter of importance had just been
brought to his attention in connection with a difficulty which had
occurred to the Chancellor with regard to the possible future appoint-
ment of an acting secretary, and which in the Chancellor’s opinion
made it, though not indispensable, yet desirable, that an assistant sec-
retary should be appointed.

The Secretary said that Mr. Richard Rathbun was a person whose
relationships to the Institution had been intimate for nearly twenty
years, and who had the Secretary’s personal confidence. He now held
the position of aid-in-charge of the Institution, and possessed both the
ability and experience which would warrant his selection as assistant
secretary. The Secretary accordingly asked the consent of the Regents
to his appointment.

The Vice-President then offered the following resolution, which was
adopted:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Mr. Richard Rathbun as
assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with duties connected with the
bureaus of the Institution other than the National Museum, be approved.

The Secretary presented a suggestion made by,Mr. Walcott in his
capacity as Director of the Geological Survey, and after discussion by

the Regents Senator Gray offered the following resolution, which was
adopted: :

Kesolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution look with
favor upon the proposition to establish a museum of »ractical and industrial geology
in the neighborhood of the National Museum.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion
it adjourned.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

For THE YEAR ENDI7G JUNE 30, 1897

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Institution, the appropriations by Con-
egress, and the receipts and expenditures for the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the U. S. National Museum, the International Exchanges, the
Bureau of Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
Physical Observatory for the year ending June 30, 1897, and balances
of former years:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
Condition of the fund July 1, 1897.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to act of Congress of August
10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added by authority of Congress,
February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson, savings from income
and other sources, to the amount of $134,831.

To this also have been added a bequest from James Hamilton, of
Pennsylvania, of $1,000; a bequest of Dr. Simeon Habel, of New York,
of $500; the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds, $51,500; a gift from
Thomas G. Hodgkins, of New York, of $200,000, and $8,000, being a
portion of the residuary legacy of Thomas G. Hodgkins, and $1,000, the
accumulated interest on the Hamilton bequest, making in all, as the
permanent fund, $912,000. .

The Institution also holds the additional sum of $42,000, received
upon the death of Thomas G. Hodgkins, in registered West Shore Rail-
road 4 per cent bonds, which were, by order of this committee, under
date of May 18, 1894, placed in the hands of the Secretary of the Iusti-
tution, to be held by him subject to the conditions of said order.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1897, each of
which bears the approval of the secretary or, in his absence, of the
acting secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bond approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have
been examined and found correct.

S, lee IGA INGE Ye,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith the Secretary’s
report, showing the operations of the Institution during the year end-
ing June 30, 1897, including the work placed under its direction by
Congress in the United States National Museum, the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoological
Park, and the Astrophysical Observatory.

Following the custom of several years, I have in the body of this
report given a general account of the affairs of the institution and its
bureaus, while the appendix presents more detailed statements by the
persons in direct charge of the different branches of the work. Inde-
pendently of this, the operations of the National Museum are fully
treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report prepared by
Acting Assistant Secretary C. D. Walcott, and the report of the work
of the Bureau of American Ethnology constitutes a volume prepared
under the supervision of Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of that
Bureau.

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents, adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 27, 1897, at 10
o’clock a. m., and not being able to complete the business before it on
that day, an adjourned meeting was held on February 1. The journal
of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto, in the annual report of
the Board to Congress, though reference is made in this report to
several matters upon which action was taken at these meetings.

The Secretary formally announced to the Board the death of Dr. G.
Brown Goode, assistant secretary of the Institution, in charge of the
National Museum, and the following resolutions were adopted by a
rising vote:

Whereas the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr.
G. Brown Goode, died on September 6, 1896:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents wish to here record their sense
of the devotion to duty which in the late Dr. Goode came before any
consideration of personal advancement, or even before the care of his
own health, and of their recognition that his high administrative ability
and wide knowledge were devoted unselfishly to the service of the Insti-
tution, with results whose value they can not too highly acknowledge;
and they desire to express their feeling of the loss that the Institution,
the National Museum, and the cause of science has sustained in his
untimely death.

Resolved, That acopy of these resolutions be suitably engrossed and
transmitted to the family of Dr. Goode.

In this connection, the Secretary brought up the matter of a succes-
sor to Dr. Goode, and stated that he had decided to ask the permission
of the Board to appoint as acting assistant secretary in charge of the
National Museum, Prof. Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United
States Geological Survey, and for more than twelve years honorary
curator in the Museum. Professor Walcott having consented to assume
the duties of the office until a permanent selection could be made, the
Secretary’s action was approved by the Board by the adoption of the
following resolution:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Prof. Charles D.
Walcott as acting assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
with duties confined to the charge of the National Museum, be approved.

The Secretary also announced the death of Mr. W. C. Winlock, assist-
ant in charge of office and curator of exchanges, and stated that he
had already appointed as his successor in that office Mr. Richard —
Rathbun. Mr. Rathbun had been for twenty years connected with
the Institution, and, for reasons which the Secretary had submitted to
the Regents, he now nominated Mr. Rathbun as Assistant Secretary in
charge of office and exchanges. The Board approved the Secretary’s
action by the adoption of the following resolution:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Mr. Richard
Rathbun as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

duties connected with the bureaus of the Institution other than the
National Museum, be approved.

ADMINISTRATION,

The present writer has been occupied during his tenure of office as
Secretary much more with administrative than with purely scientific
duties, which latter have been relegated to moments of comparative
leisure. In the pursuit of duties in the past years, as executive officer
of the Regents, he has endeavored to improve the business methods in
use in the Institution for its correspondence, its relations to its bureaus,
and in some measure for the details of its finance. It is perhaps well
to speak briefly here of the system which is followed in the expendi-
tures of the Institution, which are in the main like those of other
Government bureaus with some slight modifications as regards the
Institution’s own practice.

The Secretary is by law the custodian of the funds of the Institu-
tion, consisting at present of moneys deposited in the United States
Treasury and of certain bonds, held by the Regents through him under
the instructions of the permanent committee on the administration of
bequests and their investment, consisting of the executive commitiee
and the Secretary. ;

The Revised Statutes of the United States, section 5593, provide:

Whenever money is required for the payment of the debts or perform-
ance of the contracts of the Institution, incurred or entered into in
conformity with the provisions of this title, or for making the pur-
chases and executing the objects authorized by this title, the Board of
Regents, or the executive committee thereof, may certify to the chan-
cellor and secretary of the Board that such sum of money is required,
whereupon they shall examine the same, and, if they shall approve
thereof, shall certify the same to the proper officer of the Treasury for
payment.

In practice, the Chancellor and the Secretary of the Institution make
a written requisition upon the Secretary of the Treasury twice a year
for the semi-annual interest on the fund, and this sum is held in the
Treasury subject only to the order of the Secretary. Money is not, as
arule, kept on hand or drawn except for the payment of a specific
account, while at the same time it has been the practice of the present
Secretary, as of his predecessors, neither to receive nor pay personally
any moneys of the Institution, but to perform such transactions through
a bonded disbursing officer of the Government, who is also the account-
ant of the Institution. The Secretary, as the disbursing officer of the
Institution, never makes payments in cash, but only through checks
prepared by the accountant. The actual course of an ordinary account
is as follows:

Eivery purchase is preceded by a requisition which is approved by
the Secretary, except in certain excepted cases of expenditure of a
very minute amount. Upon this approved requisition an order is
issued by the Assistant Secretary, and when the bill is rendered it is
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

certified by the proper official and a voucher is prepared which
receives the certificate of two persons, one to the effect that the article
has been received or the services rendered, the other to the effect that
the charge is reasonable and just. The voucher is then examined by
the Secretary, and, if approved, payment is made by a check on the
United States Treasury signed by him.

The actual conduct of these transactions is through the bonded
disbursing officer above referred to. The Secretary makes it a rule
as far as possible to examine personally all the vouchers; but while
it is not always possible for him to thus examine every one or to be
personally cognizant of every item of detail, he has always the fore-
going assurance of the propriety of his signature before he affixes
it to the check, which finally concludes the monetary transaction.
These are the safeguards which the Secretary employs in regard to the
actions of subordinate officials, in whom, nevertheless, he has the fullest
personal confidence; and the Secretary’s own accounts are in turn
examined by the executive committee—a most important function,
which completes the chain of responsibility. In thus briefly describing
the business forms of the monetary transactions of the institution, it
will be understood that the integrity of the officials on whom the Sec-
retary relies has never in any instance been called in question, and he
desires to repeat this, and to acknowledge in particular the acceptable
service of the present accountant, in thus speaking of what may be
called the mechanism of this part of the administrative order.

What has preceded refers particularly to the administration of the
private funds of the Institution. In regard to the bureaus supported
by Government appropriations which are placed under the charge of
the Regents, the methods of keeping the accounts are assimilable to
those of other Government departments, the moneys being placed by
the United States Treasurer, on requisition by the Secretary, at the
disposal of a bonded disbursing officer, who prepares the vouchers,
which are then certified by the heads of the different bureaus to the
Secretary for his approval.

The methods of conducting the finances and of regulating expendi-
tures dnd payments here described have been so effective that in the
fifty years of the life of the Institution no loss has ever occurred.

With the steady growth of the several bureaus under the direction
of the Institution there come increased demands for their general
administration not only upon the Secretary but also upon his imme-
diate assistants. The clerical force of the Secretary’s office has been
chiefly supported from the income of the Institution, though a great
deal of the work pertains directly to the business of the bureaus, which
should be at the cost of Government appropriations. I have several
times called attention to this matter, and the Regents have authorized
me to request from Congress a specific appropriation for the Secretary’s
office, to be expended for necessary assistance in the administration of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

Government trusts, but it has thus far seemed inopportune to include
a request for such appropriation in my estimates to Congress.

FINANCES.

The unexpended balance at the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1,
1896, as stated in my last annual report, was $57,065.78. Interest on
the permanent fund in the Treasury and elsewhere, amounting to
$56,400, was received during the year, which, together with a sum of
$6,128.71 received from the sale of the publications and from miscel-
laneous sources, made the total receipts $62,528.71.

The disbursements for the year amounted to $58,061.99, the details
of which are given in the report of the executive committee. The bal-
ance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1897, for the
expenses of the Institution was $61,532.50, which includes the sum of
$10,000 referred to in previous reports, being $5,000 received from the
estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell, the latter a gift made personally to the Secretary to promote cer-
tain physical researches. This latter sum was, with the donor’s consent,
deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds of the
Institution.

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations, besides’
relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which may be
expected to mature as the result of various scientific investigations or
publications in progress.

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows:

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming a
part of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of the
properties of atmospheric air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the
fundamental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, ‘That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of

the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift, —
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion
of the purposes thereof. A

Under this section, 5591 of the Revised Statutes, modified as above
noted, the above fund of $912,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the
United States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest
alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

During the fiscal year 1896-97 Congress charged the Institution with
the disbursement of the following appropriations:

The executive committee has examined all the vouchers for disburse-
ments made during the fiscal year, and a detailed statement of the
receipts and expenditures will be found reported to Congress, in accord-
ance with the provisions of the sundry eivil acts of October 2, 1888, and
August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution, and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury,
were as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. : q

AVERY FUND.

In regard to the bequest of Mr. Robert Stanton Avery, referred to in
previous reports, a definite settlement has not been reached with the
heirs at law, so that it is not possible to state the exact amount that
this fund will reach.

BUILDINGS.

No important changes were made in the Smithsonian Building dur-
ing the year. Two Museum storage sheds adjacent to the building
have been removed, with a great improvement in the appearance of
the south front, while at the same time a source of danger from fire is
averted. It is still necessary to retain some workshops south of the
western portion of the building, no rooms being elsewhere available,
but it is hoped that these also will soon be removed.

I may call attention to the need of additional room for the proper
storage of such publications of the Institution and its bureaus as
must be retained in reserve. These are comparatively few in number
for each particular work, but the accumulations of fifty years occupy
in the aggregate so much space as to demand more storage room than
is now available and create a positive danger in the excessive weight
that is now placed upon the floors of upper stories, while the work of
distribution of publications is now carried on in very inconvenient and
inaccessible quarters. I have under consideration the feasibility of
some changes in the interior arrangement of the main north and south
towers of the building which would render suitable for storage pur-
poses much space which can not now be utilized.

I may also mention the very decided improvement that would result
from the remodeling of the steep and long iron stairways leading to
the great hall of the building, which is now used for archeological
collections.

The improvements in progress in the Museum by the erection of
galleries in several of the halls are alluded to elsewhere.

RESEARCH.

Although the time of the Secretary must be almost wholly given to
administrative affairs, yet, as in years past, in carrying out the wish of
the Regents ! and in continuation of investigations begun prior to my
connection with the Institution, [ have devoted such time as I could
spare to researches upon the solar spectrum and to experiments in
connection with certain physical data of aerodynamics.

Both of these investigations have reached a stage at which it is pos-
sible to give to the world somewhat full statements of results. In my

1 Resolved, That the Secretary continue his researches in physical science and pre-
sent such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in the Smithsonian
Contributions. (Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents January 26, 1847.)
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. —

remarks on the operations of the Astrophysical Observatory I discuss —
more fully the researches upon the solar spectrum.

In my report for the previous year I brought to the attention of the
Board the fact that my experiments in aerodynamics had finally
resulted in a successful trial on May 6, 1896, of a mechanism, built
chiefly of steel and driven by a steam engine, which made two flights,
each of over half a mile, and I appended a brief statement of my own
and of Mr. Alexander Graham Bell, originally communicated in French
to the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France, describing the
actual flight. Since that time a third and a much longer flight was
made on November 28, 1896, with another machine, built of steel like
the first and driven like that by propellers actuated by a steam engine
of between 1 and 2 horsepower, making a horizontal flight of over
three-quarters of a mile and descending in safety.

I have thus brought to the test of actual successful experiment the
demonstration of the practicability of mechanical flight, which has been
so long debated and till lately so discredited. To satisfy a nearly uni-
versal interest, I am now engaged in the preparation of a full descrip-
tion of these experiments since 1891, when my first memoir on aerody-
namies was published. This memoir, with those on “ Experiments in
Aerodynamics” and ‘“ Internal Work of the Wind,” will form volume 27
of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, which will thus con-
tain a complete record of all experiments carried on thus far under ny
direction upon this subject.

HODGKINS FUND.

The Hodgkins medals of award were received at the Institution on
the 13th of July, 1896, and were transmitted on the same day to those
competitors for the Hodgkins fund prizes who were recommended by
the committee to receive medals. <A replica of the medal was sent to
each of the members of the Hodgkins advisory committee and to cer-
tain specialists who, without compensation, had rendered valuable aid
in connection with the competition. A replica was also sent to the
firm of Evarts, Choate & Beaman, the legal counsel of Mr. Hodgkins,
and to Dr. Chambers, his medical adviser and long-time friend, as a
memento of valued services rendered in connection with the Hodgkins
bequest to the Institution.

In July, 1896, Mr. E. C. C. Baly, of University College, London, a
Hodgkins competitor, whose memoir received honorable mention, was
awarded a grant of $750 to enable him to prosecute further his inves-
tigations on the decomposition of the atmosphere by means of the
passage of the electric spark. A report of the research, so far as it
has progressed, has been received from Mr. Baly.

Under an additional grant to Dr. 8S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. John 8.
Billings investigations have been conducted in the Laboratory of
Hygiene of the University of Pennsylvania, upon the effect which a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. w)

prolonged exposure to vitiated air has upon the power of individuals to
resist infectious diseases. Dr. D. H. Bergey, who conducted the experi-
ments, reports that he subjected certain animals to an impure atmos-
phere and found that while it apparently lowered their vitality, he was
unable to attenuate the fluids used for inoculating the diseases so that
they would kill such a weakened animal while not affecting a vigorous
one. Still, animals inoculated for tuberculosis died much earlier when
exposed to impure air. As these results may doubtless be applied to all
warm-blooded animals, including man, it would appear that we have
here an important confirmation of the clinical observation that tuber-
culosis thrives most in vitiated air.

January 15, 1897, a grant of $500 was made to Mr. A. Lawrence
Rotch, director of the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory at Read-
ville, Mass., to be used in securing automatic kite records of meteoro-
logical conditions at an altitude of 10,000 feet or more. An additional
grant of $400 was later made to Mr. Rotch for continuing his experi-
ments in connection with the explorations of the upper air.

With a view to being prepared to apply most advantageously the
accruing interest from that portion of the fund devoted to investiga-
tions connected with the atmosphere the Secretary has conferred, dur-
ing the year, with specialists in this country and Europe, upon the
subject of researches suitable to be aided from the Hodgkins fund.

The six Hodgkins memoirs which have been published by the Insti-
tution were issued in February and March, 1897, and a copy of each
was sent to all persons who had submitted papers in connection with
the competition.

NAPLES TABLE.

As stated in my last report, the Institution has renewed the lease of
the Smithsonian table at the Zoological Station of Naples for a second
term of three years, this action being in accordance with the urgent
solicitation of the faculties of several colleges and universities and of
many of the leading biologists of the country.

At my earnest request Dr. Billings has continued as chairman of the
advisory committee, which has rendered most efficient aid in examining
testimonials and in recommending action with regard to applications
for the occupancy of the table. The following applications have been
favorably acted upon:

Dr. F. H. Herrick, professor of biology at Adelbert College, Cleveland,
occupied the table in November, 1896, and Dr. 8. E. Meek, formerly of
the Arkansas Industrial University but more recently connected with
the United States Fish Commission, received the appointment for two
months in the spring of 1897. The application of Dr. H.S. Jennings,
of the University of Michigan and later of Harvard, was approved for
three months during the spring and summer of 1897. Through the
continued courtesy of Dr. Dohrn, in permitting two persons nominated
by the Institution to occupy tables at the same time, the residence of
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. Jennings began before the termination of Dr. Meek’s appointment.
Applications for the coming year are now under consideration.

EXPLORATIONS.

Ethnological and natural-history explorations have been continued
under the direction or with the assistance of the Institution in various
parts of the world by the Bureau of Ethnology and the National
Museum. This work is more fully described elsewhere, but I may men-
tion here that a large number of objects of interest from various parts
of the world have been added to the Museum collections, and much
valuable information has been acquired regarding the history and the
language of the American Indians. Among the explorations of the year
were those by Dr. William L. Abbott in Siam, Prof. O. F. Cook in
Africa, Dr. E. A. Mearns in Minnesota and elsewhere, Mr. Frank H.
Cushing in Maine, Mr. J. W. Fewkes in Arizona, Mr. H. T. Perkins in
Idaho, Mr. W J McGee in Iowa, Mr. J. B. Hatcher in Patagonia and
Tierra del Fuego, and Dr. Willis E. Everette in Oregon, British Columbia
and Mexico.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Institution and its bureaus during the year
comprised two works in quarto form, four in royal octavo, and fourteen
in octavo, aggregating 9,630 pages, covering to a greater or less degree
nearly all branches of human knowledge.

The Smithsonian Institution proper issues three series of works:
The Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and
the Annual Report. By the bureaus of the Institution there are
issued the Annual Report and the Bulletin of the Bureau of American
Ethnology and the Proceedings and Bulletin of the National Museum,
and the Secretary transmits to Congress the Annual Report of the
American Historical Association. The Smithsonian Contributions and
Miscellaneous Collections are printed at the expense of the Institution
and the other publications from Congressional appropriations.

Contributions to Knowledge-—Two memoirs of this series were issued
during the year, both having been submitted in competition for the
Hodgkins fund prizes.

The memoir by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay describes the
discovery of argon, for which achievement the authors were awarded
the first Hodgkins prize of $10,000. It gives an account of the reasons
which led the investigators to suspect the existence of a new element
in the atmosphere and a detailed description of the apparatus and
methods by which the presence of this hitherto unknown gas was |
detinitely established. The importance of the discovery was recog-
nized independently by the Institute of France, which awarded a prize
of 50,000 frances, and by the National Academy of Sciences, which
granted to the discoverers the Barnard medal.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

The memoir by Prof. E. Duclaux, of Paris, entitled Atmospheric
Actinometry and the Actinic Constitution of the Atmosphere, describes
the methods and results of numerous experiments on the chemical
rays of the sun by the exposure of oxalic acid to their action. Pro-
fessor Duclaux found that the chemical action of the rays when the
sky was overcast was much less than on a fine day and that with light
cumulus clouds the combustion might be more active than with a clear
blue sky or slight cirrus, so that it appeared evident that the chemical
activity and hygienic power of the sun’s rays are not related to the
apparent fineness of the day.

Miscellaneous Collections.—Nine papers of the “ Miscellaneous” series
were issued and others are in progress. The completed works were
Smithsonian Physical Tables, by Prof. Thomas Gray; Equipment and

The Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, by Dr. H. Car-
rington Bolton, mentioned in my last report, is in type and will soon
be published. It comprises the titles of more than 8,500 scientific and
technical periodicals in all languages, adding 3,500 titles to the first
edition published in 1885.

There is also completed, ready for the printer, a voluminous supple-
ment to Dr. Bolton’s Select Bibliography of Chemistry.

As a special work, there has been printed the International Exchange
List of the Smithsonian Institution, being a list of the foreign corre-
spondents, aggregating 9,414 learned societies, museums, universities,
ete., with which American publications are exchanged.

Annual reports.—The Smithsonian Annual Report is in two volumes,
one of which is devoted to the work of the National Museum. In the
general appendix of Part I are included memoirs on all branches of
knowledge, selected chiefly from publications of learned societies of the
world that are not readily accessible to the public, the basis of selec-
tion being that the papers are written by a competent person, give an
account of some important or at least interesting scientific discovery,
are untechnical in language and suitable to nonprofessional readers.

The History of the First Half Century of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, outlined with some detail in my last report, is now printed and
will soon be issued. The Institution was founded August 10, 1846, by
act of Congress approved by President Polk, and it seemed an appro-
priate memorial of the completion of its first fifty years to publish a
volume which should give an account of its origin and history, its
achievements, and its present condition.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The editorial supervision of the volume was undertaken by the late
Dr. G. Brown Goode, and to his thorough acquaintance with the his-
tory of the Institution, and his skill and critical knowledge, the com-
prehensive plan of the work is entirely due. At the time of his death,
in September, 1896, the manuscript was sufficiently advanced to per-
mit of its completion on his general plan.

The volume is royal octavo of 866 pages, with a preface by William
McKinley, President of the United States, ex-officio the head of the
establishment. It is illustrated by full-page portraits of James Smith-
son, the Chancellors, several of the Regents, the three Secretaries, and
of Assistant Secretary Goode, besides illustrations of the Smithsonian
building and of the infra-red spectrum investigations by the present
Secretary. The main divisions of the work are fifteen chapters, descrip-
tive of the history of the Institution, and a like number of chapters
giving appreciations of its work in the several branches of knowledge,
mainly by persons not connected with the Institution, followed by an
appendix of 8 pages narrating the principal events in its history.

Since it is impossible in a single volume to exhaust the subject, it
became necessary to mention but briefly many topics which it was
hoped might be elaborately treated. The book is printed from type in
an edition of 2,000, with 250 additional copies on handmade paper. It
is not classed in either of the regular series of Smithsonian publica-
tions, and will receive a special rather than a general distribution.
This course is found necessary by reason of the cost of the work.

The Annual Report of the Museum for 1894, which includes several
special papers by Museum officers or collaborators, has been issued,
and the Museum has published a volume of Proceedings, and separate
papers of other volumes, besides two octavo and two quarto bulletins,
the contents of all of which are given elsewhere.

The Bureau of Ethnology has published three reports, the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth, bringing the work down to the close of the
fiscal year 1894-95,

The Annual Report of. the American Historical Association for 1895
has been published, and the report for 1896 has been sent to the printer.
These reports are transmitted by the secretary of the association to the
Secretary of the Institution, who submits the whole or portions of the
reports to Congress, in accordance with the act of incorporation of
the association. Prior to the report for 1894 the Institution had no
Share in the distribution of these volumes, but, beginning with the
report for 1894, a limited number is available for purposes of exchange
by the Institution with historical and other learned societies of the
world. The reports contain papers relating to American history or
to the study of history in America. A most important contribution
in the report for 1895 is a bibliography of the historical societies of the
United States and British America, covering 561 printed pages, which
is a very useful reference work for writers and students of American
history.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

LIBRARY.

The library continues to grow steadily, the accessions in volumes,
parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts reaching 35,912 during the
past year. Special mention should be made of the gift of Mr. S.
Patcanof, of St. Petersburg, of over 300 volumes, consisting mostly
of oriental works and including some Arabic manuscripts and many
rare Armenian publications.

As stated in my last report, the Secretary of State had named, in
accordance with my suggestion, Dr. John S. Billings, United States
Army, retired, director of the New York Public Library, and Prof.
Simon Newcomb, United States Navy, Superintendent of the Nautical
Almanac, as the delegates of the United States to a conference to be
held at the instance of the British Government at London in July, 1896,
to consider the preparation of an international catalogue of scientific
literature. This conference met July 14 to 17, 1896, twenty-two coun-
tries being represented. The conference drew up a plan which the
respective delegates submitted to the countries they represented. The
report of Professor Newcomb and Doctor Billings, submitted to the Sec-
retary of State October 15, 1896, recommended that the United States
Government should take part in this work, and that the Smithsonian
Institution be made the agent of the Government in this important
scientific enterprise.

In accordance with this suggestion the Secretary of State invited my
opinion as to the propriety and feasibility of the United States taking
part in this work through the Smithsonian Institution, and requested an
estimate of the probable expense attendant thereto. ‘To this I replied
that I fully concurred in the view of the delegates as to the great
importance of a successful execution of the conclusions of the confer-
ence and as to the propriety of this Government taking its share of the
proposed work by providing for the cataloguing of the scientific publi-
cations of the United States. This opinion is strengthened by the fact
that the recommendations made are due to results emanating from an
international conference, at which the United States was officially rep-
resented, and by the further considerations that the benefits to be
derived from this undertaking are not only great and far-reaching for
the scientific progress of America, but also of universal value, and that
all the great and many of the smaller nations will take part in the work.
I recognized also the propriety of the suggestion that the Government
should employ the Smithsonian Institution as an agent in this matter,
particularly since the Institution first suggested this subject in 1855,
and since it has been from its earliest organization interested in scien-
tific bibliography.

I was, however, reluctant to commit the Institution to the appear-
ance of soliciting Congress in this matter in any case, or to the under-
taking of the enterprise, however worthy, unless provision could be
made for the necessary expenses of the work. After considering the
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

subject, it seemed to me that the work, if assigned to the Smithsonian
Institution, would require a person of special qualifications to imme-
diately assist the Secretary, together with a number of trained clerical
assistants, and that the salaries for these persons and the expenses
incident to the work would require an appropriation of not less than
$10,000 per annum.

In accordance with this recommendation, Secretary Olney trans-
mitted this correspondence to Congress. Although the catalogue
will not begin until 1900, much preliminary work will be necessary. I
have accordingly brought the matter to the attention of Secretary
Sherman, and the Department of State has agreed to submit an item
for this purpose in its regular estimates for the year 1898-99.

Although the new building for the Library of Congress was completed
in February, 1897, its occupancy had not begun at the close of the fiscal
year. The east stack was provisionally assigned for the Smithsonian
collection of transactions. In the past only this portion of the Smith-
sonian Library has been kept together, the remainder of the collection
being distributed throughout the Library of Congress. I trust that in
the new building, with its ample space and largely inereased force, it
will be found possible, in accordance with the resolution of the Regents
in 1889,' to assemble the entire collection in one place.

CORRESPONDENCE.

In 1855 (February 24) the Board of Regents adopted the following
resolution :

Resolved, That all correspondence of this Institution with any person
or society shall be conducted by the Secretary, and no assistant or
employee shall write or receive any official letter or communication
pertaining to the affairs of the Institution except under the authority
and by the direction of the Secretary; and all such correspondence
shall be duly registered and recorded in such manner as the Secretary
shall direct.

The Secretary has given much care to organizing a system of corre-
spondence which would insure that letters should receive prompt
replies, and that a record of receipt, subject, and date of reply shall be
kept in such a form as to be readily accessible. The system in ques-
tion was fully described in my report for 1890, and its adoption has
proved of the greatest convenience during the seven years it has been
in operation.

The correspondence has greatly increased during the past few years,

‘Resolved, That since the Smithsonian deposit now numbers over 250,000 titles,
and is still increasing at the cost of the Institution, it is, in the opinion of the
Regents, desirable that in the new building for the Library of Congress sufficient
provision shall be made for its accommodation and increase in a distinct hall or
halls, worthy of the collections, and such as, while recalling to the visitor the name
of Smithson, shall provide such facilities for those consulting the volumes as will
aid in his large purpose of the diffusion of knowledge among men.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. pe 8)

both in regard to such letters as directly concern the Institution proper
and also the mass of correspondence which, though pertaining more
particularly to the Museum and other bureaus, must nevertheless
receive the attention of the Secretary’s office.

A very unusual number of letters has been received from all parts of
the country seeking information both on scientific matters and on
political, economic, historical, and other questions in almost every
branch of knowledge. Many correspondents have the impression that
the Institution is a bureau of general information, and in dealing with
this class the policy has been to courteously answer all queries legiti-
mately within the range of the Institution, in other cases referring
inquirers to possible sources of information.

Of the more important correspondence of the Secretary’s office, 3,834
entries were made in the registry book of letters received, while many
times that number were received and referred to the different bureaus
of the Institution.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Nashville Hxposition.—The Institution participated in the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition at Nashville during the summer of 1897, under
act of Congress making appropriation for a General Government exhibit.
Accounts of the exhibit will be given after the close of the exposition.

Glover Collection.—A very valuable and interesting collection of
Chinese coins, bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution by the late Mr.
George B. Glover, of the Chinese Imperial maritime customs service,
has been received from the estate. It is believed that this collection is
the most perfect of its kind in existence. Jt includes 2,025 specimens
of Chinese, Annamese, Siamese, Japanese, and Korean coins; amulets
and bamboo tally sticks used as money; Chinese paper money; foreign
coins in circulation in China; and molds for casting coins. The series
dates back to about the year 770 B. C., the earliest authentic period of
coinage. The peculiarly shaped bronze pieces, representing knives,
cloth, and other objects used as money are fully represented, and the
Series is continuous in the coinage of each dynasty for more than 2,600
years.

Catalogue of Egyptian papyri and royal antiquities.—In April, 1896,
the Egyptian minister of foreign affairs addressed a communication to
the representatives of all foreign Governments at Cairo, pointing out
the desirability of a complete catalogue of Egyptian papyri and royal
antiquities, and inviting the cooperation of the various Governments in
securing the information needed for such a work, the editing and pub-
lication to be undertaken by the administration of antiquities of Egypt.

The consul-general of the United States informed the Egyptian Gov-
ernment that the hearty cooperation of the United States could be
relied upon, and, in his dispatch to the Department of State, suggested
that the Smithsonian Institution might be willing to collect the desired
information, °
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The communications on the subject being referred to the Institution
by the Department of State, I informed the Department that the Insti-
tution would undertake the task of collecting this information, though
I stated at the same time that the ultimate success would depend on —
the willingness which museums and private individuals exhibited in
cooperating.

I have entered into communication with the custodians of all collec-
tions known to me, and have thus far received some useful information.

At the request of Dr. D. C. Gilman, president of the American Ori-
ental Society, a communication on the subject was presented to the
society at its meeting in April, 1897, and the society appointed a com-
mittee of five to cooperate with the Institution in securing the desired
information.

Congress of Orientalists—On April 27, 1897, Dr. Paul Haupt, of
Johns Hopkins University, was appointed to represent the Smithsonian
Institution at the Congress of Orientalists at Paris in September of
this year.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The most notable occurrence of the year affecting the National
Museum was the death of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the assistant secretary
in its charge, which occurred on September 6, 1896. I alluded briefly
to this sad event in my last report, which had not gone to press at the
time of Dr. Goode’s death.

When 22 years of age Dr. Goode became associated with the Smith-
sonian Institution, and soon afterwards was designated by Professor
Baird to prepare the Government natural history exhibit for the Cen-
tennial Exhibition of 1876. This work involved severe labor, and
almost unaided he unpacked and assorted the large accumulations of
material which had been stored away in the basements of the Smith-
sonian building. His work was entirely satisfactory, but the strain to
which he was subjected in accomplishing it told severely on his strength,
and it became necessary for him to go to Bermuda to regain his health.
In 1881 the National Museum building was completed and Dr. Goode
was appointed assistant director. In 1887 he was appointed assistant
secretary of the Institution in charge of the National Museum, which
position he held at the time of his death.

There are many sides from which to view the character and work of
this remarkable man. His talents and the careful scientific training
which he had received, gave him a very prominent place as a zoologist,
but as a museum administrator he was perhaps skilled above all
others. Personally I had absolute confidence in him, and the relations
which obtained between us were those of the most intimate trust,
while those which in turn existed between him and his subordinates
were of the most fortunate kind.

I have in a special memoir spoken at some length of Dr. Goode’s life
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

and work. On February 13, 1897, a meeting to commemorate his life
and services was held in the lecture hall of the Museum. <A_ full
account of that meeting will be found in the Museum volume of the
Smithsonian Report.

After extended consideration of the needs of the Museum and the
special qualifications of several persons who had been suggested as
capable of filling the position rendered vacant by Dr. Goode’s death, I
signified to Mr. Charles D. Walcott my desire that, with the approval
of the Regents, he should take charge of the Museum, and I was glad
to learn that, notwithstanding his arduous duties as Director of the
United States Geological Survey, he felt willing to put provisionally
at the service of the Institution his known scientific and executive
qualifications, together with those which a long previous connection
with the Museum rendered doubly acceptable.

His appointment by me as acting assistant secretary in charge of the
National Museum was ratified by the Board of Regents at its meeting
on January 27, 1897.

Although comparatively little effort was made during the year to
obtain specimens for the Museum, the accessions were 168 more than
those of the previous year, representing a-total increase of nearly 40,000
specimens over the receipts during 1896. The number of specimens of
all kinds now recorded is 3,720,237.

In my estimates for 1897 I asked Congress to appropriate $180,000
for the preservation of the collections in the Museum. It is regrettable
that only $153,225 were allowed for this purpose. As the collections
in the Museum increase, it is imperative that a reasonable increase
should be made in the funds devoted to their preservation and elabora-
tion, and I most earnestly hope that the full amount which I have
estimated to be necessary for the operations of the next fiscal year will
be appropriated by Congress.

It is gratifying to record that, in accordance with my recommenda-
tion, the sum of $8,000 was allowed by Congress for the erection of
galleries in the Museum building. They will materially add to the area
available for exhibition purposes. By a fortunate circumstance the
appropriation for the galleries became available at a time when the cost
of ironwork of all kinds was unusually low, and at the time of writing
this report four galleries are in process of construction. The desire of
Congress to relieve the congested conditions which have so long existed
in the Museum has been further manifested by an additional allowance
of $8,000 in the Museum appropriations for 1898.

When the galleries are ready for the reception of fittings and furni-
ture, there will arise the necessity for the expenditure of a considerable
sum of money for this purpose. Congress has allowed $15,000 to be
thus expended during the coming fiscal year.

It seems proper to remark that while the galleries which can be
erected with this amount ($16,000) will be of very great benefit, the need

sm 97 2

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of another building is not in any degree lessened, since the additional
space obtained will be necessary to relieve the overcrowded condition
of the floors, which has given the exhibition halls almost the appearance
of storerooms.

The proper expansion of the various series now exhibited, and the
addition of others from the abundant materials already in the posses-
sion of the Museum, can not have effect within the present walls. For
these purposes, and for the increase which succeeding years may confi-
dently be expected to bring, a new building is necessary. The national
collections, as a whole, greatly surpass in value and extent those of any
other museum in the United States, but they are at the present time
by no means so well provided for as the collections assembled in some
of the larger cities of the country.

For reasons explained at length in a previous report, it was deetied
very desirable to remove the sheds adjoining the Smithsonian building
on the south. The sum of $2,500 was allowed, and the objectionable
sheds will be removed at once.

In my estimates for 1897 I explained the need of a larger allotment
for printing the Proceedings and Bulletins of the Museum. The amount
asked for was $18,000, but oly $12,000 was allowed. I repeated the
expression of my desire that $18,000 be allowed for 1898, but again
only $12,000 was allotted. I feel, therefore, it is my duty to state that
the sum provided has proved entirely inadequate.

The complete manuscript of an important and comprehensive work
by the late Professor Cope on the reptiles of North America, based on
the Museum collections, is necessarily withheld from the printer for
want of funds for its publication, and at least four others, equally valu-
able and extensive, are in an advanced stage of preparation. Delayin
the publication of these works will prove a hindrance to the progress
of American natural history.

It has long been my wish to distribute the publications of the Museum
not only to Government depositories but also to all public libraries,
colleges, scientific schools, and scientific and technical societies in this
country, as well as to the principal centers of learning throughout the
world. After this has been done, there should still remain a surplus
for distribution among investigators and teachers who really need the
books in connection with their professional work. By such an extended
distribution the Museum would greatly widen the scope of its useful-
ness, and would also be able to obtain in exchange a large number of
books and pamphlets for its own working library. It often happens,
too, that arrangements can be made to exchange the Duly avons of the
Museum for desirable specimens. .

In the estimates for 1898-99 I have inserted an item for $17,000 for
printing and binding. It is my wish to use $15,000 for printing and
$2,000 for binding serials into volumes. Many books in-constant use
in the Museum library are in urgent need of permanent binding in
order to prevent their destruction, Several series already partially
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

bound should be completed, and thus rendered easier of access for pur-
poses of reference. The amount above stated is the lowest sum which
will produce the desired result, and I therefore very much hope that
Congress will not diminish it.

In my last report I alluded to the death of Mr. William C. Winlock,
which occurred on September 20, 1896. In addition to his duties as
curator of exchanges, he held the position of honorary curator of phys-
ical apparatus in the National Museum.

Maj. Charles Bendire, United States Army (retired), honorary curator
of the department of birds’ eggs in the National Museum, died at Jack-
sonville, Fla., on February 4, 1897.

Major Bendire was a native of Germany. He served in the United
States Army and was brevetted major for bravery in action against the
Indians at Canyon Creek, Montana, in 1877. In 1886 he was retired for
disabilities incurred in the line of service. During his residence in the
West he became interested in ornithology through correspondence with
Professor Baird. He made extensive collections of birds’ eggs, which
he afterwards presented to the National Museum. After leaving the
. Army he devoted a large amount of time to scientific investigation,
and had recently published in the series of Special Bulletins of the
National Museum an important work entitled Life Histories of North
American Birds, consisting of two large quarto volumes, handsomely
illustrated.

In obedience to the provisions of the act of Congress directing that
the Institution and its dependencies should participate in the Tennes-
see Centennial Exposition, which opened on May 1, 1897, special exhibits
have been prepared. Dr. Frederick W. True was appointed represen-
tative of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on the
Government board of management, and Mr. W. V. Cox was designated
special agent in charge of the exhibit, and later was appointed secre-
tary of the board.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The researches relating to the American Indians, conducted under
the Smithsonian Institution by authority of law, have been continued
by Maj. J. W. Powell, the director of the Bureau, assisted by Mr. W J
McGee as ethnologist in charge, Mr. F. W. Hodge acting as chief clerk,
and several other scientific collaborators. The field operations have
been extended into a large number of States and Territories, and inci-
dentally into those districts of neighboring countries occupied by
native tribes closely affiliated with the aborigines of the territory now
comprised in the United States. The examinations and surveys in
field and office have been conducted with the view of obtaining for
publication definite information concerning the arts and industries, the
institutions and languages, and the beliefs of the natives. .
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

During the year special attention has been given to the classification —
of the tribes in such manner as to indicate their origin and develop-
ment, and to this end the rich archives of the Bureau, comprising the
accumulations of eighteen years of research, have been subjected to
careful study, and important conclusions have been reached.

The work of exploration within the United States was limited to
Arizona and New Mexico, where extensive surveys and excavations
were made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes with most gratifying results. He
was able to obtain the richest collection of prehistoric pottery and
associated industrial products thus far made. This noteworthy collec-
tion has been installed in the National Museum, and special reports
relating to it are in preparation. Other collections made in the South-
west include a highly interesting series of ceremonial masks used by
the shamans in the pueblos of Zuni and Sia; these also are installed in
the Museum, and will be discussed in forthcoming reports. A collec-
tion of prehistoric ware from the mounds of the Mississippi Valley was
acquired, and a smaller one of typical character was obtained from
Ohio, while a small collection of special value in comparative study
was obtained through the collaboration of an agent in Patagonia.

The investigation of the rich collection of prehistoric material
obtained in Florida has been continued, and has yielded interesting
results. Comparative studies have also been made of the stone imple-
ments used by the Seri Indians of Tiburon Island, and those of various
other tribes.

The work relating to the social organization prevailing among the
native tribes has been carried forward successfully, certain points
hitherto obscure having been cleared up during the year.

The researches in linguistics have gone forward steadily. Progress
has been made in the preparation of the comparative dictionary of the
Algonquian dialects and in the collection of new material to be incor-
porated therein, and a systematic study has been made of the Iroquoian
languages.

The study of decoration has been continued with renewed activity
with the accession of the rich collections from Arizona, New Mexico,
and Florida, while substantial progress has been made also in the
researches concerning the aboriginal systems of mythology and their
bearing on the industrial and social development of the tribesmen.

The publication of reports, which had fallen somewhat in arrears, has
been brought up, and three reports, forming four large volumes, have
been published and distributed during the year. The demand for these
has been unprecedented.

An exhibit arranged for display in the Government building at the
Tennessee Centennial Exposition included a representation of a Kiowa
camp-circle, and a report on the Kiowa Indians explaining the social
features illustrated by the exhibit is now in preparation for the press.

Further details concerning the operations of the bureau may be
found in Director Powell’s report, forming Appendix II.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. OAL

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service was inaugurated in 1849, when
Volume I of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge was distrib-
uted to 173 foreign institutions, and within a few years it became the
medium for the exchange of publications between the principal scien-
tific institutions of the world. The functions of this Service being “the
diffusion of knowledge” are in direct accord with one of the fundamental
objects for which the Smithsonian Institution was endowed, and ‘the
fact that exchanges are now made with 28,000 correspondents in every
part of the civilized world demonstrates to some degree the far-reach-
ing influence of the Institution. The weight of matter handled by the
Service during the past fiscal year was 247,444 pounds, comprising
81,162 packages of publications. From 1886 to 1895 there were received
from foreign Governments and institutions 344,078 books or pamphlets,
and 601,637 books or pamphlets were shipped abroad.

The entire cost of international exchanges prior to 1881 was borne by
the Smithsonian Institution, but for the last fifteen years appropria-
tions have been made by Congress. The first grant, in 1881, was $3,000,
and for the past year it was $19,000. The exchange of Government
documents is a most important part of the service, and I may repeat
the statement made in several previous reports that for the contin-
uation of such exchanges the Smithsonian Institution has annually
advanced varying amounts in excess of the Congressional appro-
priations, so that the aggregate amount advanced from the private
funds of the Institution since the Government has appropriated money
for international exchanges is about $46,000.

The service now provides for the distribution of the United States
Government publications to foreign libraries, and also for the distribu-
tion of books, pamphlets, and other printed matter sent as exchanges
or donations from literary and scientific societies or individuals to cor-
respondents abroad, without expense to senders beyond delivery at
the Smithsonian Institution. Publications are received at the several
foreign agencies of the Institution and forwarded to Washington for
record and are distributed under the Smithsonian frank, the entire
service being conducted under a careful system of registration which
well nigh precludes possibility of loss. Purchased books, apparatus
and instruments, are not received for transmission through the service,
which is exclusively limited to donations or exchanges.

Through the long-extended courtesies from several ocean transpor-
tation companies, permitting the free transmission of exchange pack-
ages, it has been feasible to carry on the work in a very much more
comprehensive manner than would otherwise have been possible with
the resources available.

I may mention that exchanges with Mexico and Japan, which were
temporarily interrupted at the time of my last report, have been
renewed. Hxchanges with Turkey, Greece, and Cuba, have necessarily
D2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been entirely suspended, although there is near prospect of renewed
communications with the former country.

The international exchange of official documents has aggregated
10,694 parcels received from foreign countries for various Departments
of the United States Government, and 30,008 packages have been
received from United States Government Departments and shipped
abroad.

This branch of the service is naturally of most importance to the
Government, the foreign receipts having resulted in building up a very
complete collection of publications of the various governments of the
world.

The total amount available for use of the service during the year
was $22,334.33, which included the Congressional appropriation of
$19,000 and $3,334.53 received from various Executive Departments
for transmission of their outgoing and incoming exchanges.

The slight increase in the annual appropriation granted by Congress
during the past year for improving the facilities for the transportation
of exchanges has permitted an improvement in the promptness of
dispatch by the payment of ocean freight on a portion of the ex-
changes, which have been forwarded by some of the faster steamers
instead of necessarily delaying shipments until opportunity permitted
free transmission by later vessels. This slight improvement has bene-
fited the service to such an extent that it is hoped Congress will
realize the benefits derived from expenditures of this character, and
in future will appropriate sufficient means to enable all exchanges to
be forwarded to their destination without interruption. A great deal
of matter forwarded through the International Exchanges is most val-
uable at the time of publication, and there should be no impediment
to prompt delivery.

The number of correspondents at present on the records of the
exchange service is 28,008, of which 21,427 are foreign—an increase of
2,527 over last year—and 6,581 are domestic, being an increase over
1896 of 567.

Appended to my report for the year ended June 30, 1895, was a map
of the world showing the relative extent of the exchange service.
Since that time the far-reaching influence of the service has added so
many correspondents, and so many more remote countries have been
reached, that the preparation of a new map to more nearly represent
the number of correspondents in each country will soon be necessary.

THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

I have always been of the opinion that the collection of living ani-
mals is a legitimate method of furthering the objects for which the
Smithsonian Institution was established. It was inevitable that sooner
or later an intelligent interest in such collections should be awakened
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. es

in this country, and some small collections have, in fact, for many years
existed; but I believe that the Regents of the Institution were the
first to consider the national importance of the preservation of the great
American fauna, and with that object in view to recognize the need of
establishing a preserve for their care and maintenance like the National
Zoological Park, action in this matter being all the more imperative in
view of the imminence of the extermination of many species of American
animals, particularly the bison of our Great Plains.

It gives me pleasure to state that this interest in living animals has
during the last few years greatly increased in this country, as is shown
by the many new collections that have been established and the fact that
still others are projected. A number of private individuals have under-
taken the preservation of animals, paying particular attention to those
likely to become extinct or that are best adapted to be kept on a range
or in a forest. Ican not but feel that the example of the National
Zoological Park has been of some value in stimulating such enterprises,
and that, though as yet comparatively incomplete, it has tended to
develop an interest in our native animals and in their proper protection
and preservation.

As instances of what has been done in this way may be mentioned
the large forest park of the late Mr. Austin Corbin, the game pre-
serves that have been established in various parts of the country, and
the extensive zoological collections planned for the city of Pittsburg,
Pa., and for the New York Zoological Society near New York City.
Details with regard to some of these parks are given in the appendix.

Attention is called here to these enterprises because it seems desira-
able that an institution of this kind, placed at the seat of Government
and under its control and direction, should be representative in char-
acter and not fall below the average of such collections, either at home
or abroad.

It should be noted in this connection that most cities of the size of
Washington are well provided with public parks possessing improve-
ments in the way of roads, walks, bridges, buildings for public comfort,
lawns, and plantations far in excess of what is possible under the
present circumstances in the National Zoological Park. A moderate
estimate, made by experienced landscape gardeners, places the cost of
such desirable improvements at $3,000 per acre at least. Yet all that
is here allowed for these purposes is the small sum that can be reserved
after properly caring for the animals and erecting such structures as
are required for their needs. Whiiein most establishments of this kind
the municipal authorities defray from a separate fund all the expenses
of preparing the grounds and buildings and properly policing and main-
taining the same, here all must be paid from a general sum that is
not more than sufficient to merely maintain the animals in a proper
condition. ;

The buildings and inclosures now existing are plainly inadequate.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

One of the most important needs is the establishment of suitable houses
for the preservation and care of birds. There should be a large build-
‘ing that could be heated in winter, and in addition a spacious flying
cage similar to that used in the Golden Gate Park, in San Francisco,
in which large numbers of our native birds could be harbored and fed.
This would enable the park to extend its scope to the species of native
birds now threatened with extinction. The passenger pigeon, once
found in astonishing numbers throughout the Northern United States,
has nearly disappeared because of the slaughter of the species by
man,! and the Carolina parrakeet, a bird of most beautiful plumage, is
already becoming scarce. At present it is impossible to take advantage
of numerous opportunities of obtaining specimens of birds, as they
can not be properly cared for within the park. Other buildings urgently

1The following extract from Audubon’s Birds of America may be of interest:

“The multitudes of wild pigeons in our woods are astonishing. Indeed, after hay-
ing viewed them so often and under so many circumstances, I even now feel inclined
to pause and assure myself that what I am going to relate is fact. Yet I have seen it
all, and that, too, in the company of persons who, like myself, were struck with
amazement.

“Tn the autumn of 1813 I left my house at Henderson, on the banks of the Ohio,
on my way to Louisville. In passing over the barrens a few miles beyond Hardens-
burg, I observed the pigeons flying from northeast to southwest in greater numbers
than I thought I had ever seen them before, and feeling an inclination to count the
flocks that might pass within the reach of my eye in one hour, I dismounted, seated
myself on an eminence, and began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for
every flock that passed. In a short time, finding the task which I had undertaken
impracticable, as the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose, and, counting
the dots then put down, found that 163 had been made in twenty-one minutes. I
traveled on, and still met more the farther I proceeded. The air was literally filled
with pigeons; the light of noonday was obscured as by an eclipse; the dung fell in
spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow, and the continued buzz of wings had a
tendency to lull my senses to repose.

“Whilst waiting for dinner at Young’s-Inn, at the confluence of Salt River with
the Ohio, I saw, at my leisure, immense legions still going by, with a frontreaching
far beyond the Ohio on the west and the beech-wood forests directly on the east of
me. Nota single bird alighted, for not a nut or acorn was that year to be seen in
the neighborhood, They consequently flew so high that different trials to reach them
with a capital rifle proved ineffectual, nor did the reports disturb them in the least.
I can not describe to you the extreme beauty of their aerial evolutions when a hawk
chanced to press upon the rear of a flock. At once, like a torrent, and with a noise
like thunder, they rushed into a compact mass, pressing upon each other toward the
center. In these almost solid masses they darted forward in undulating and angu-
lar lines, descended and swept close over the earth with inconceivable velocity,
mounted perpendicularly, so as to resemble a vast column, and, when high, were
seen wheeling and twisting within their continued lines, which then resembled the
coils of a gigantic serpent.

“Before sunset I reached Louisville, distant from Hardensburg 55 miles. The
pigeons were still passing in undiminished numbers, and continued to do so for tiree
days in succession. The people were all in arms. The banks of the Ohio were
crowded with men and boys incessantly shooting at the pilgrims, which there flew
lower as they passed the river. Multitudes were thus destroyed. For a week or

more the population fed on no other flesh than that of pigeons and talked of nothing
but pigeons.” 5;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

needed are a new elephant house, in place of the hastily constructed
temporary shelter now used, and a reptile house.

Many most interesting and at the same time inexpensive features,
such as a vivarium for small animals, a small house and a runway for
pheasants, and ponds for aquatic birds and mammals, are necessarily
deferred for want of the funds required for their installation.

The appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, was in the
following terms:

National Zoological Park: For continuing the construction of roads,
walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage and drainage, and for grading,
planting, and otherwise improving the grounds; erecting and repairing
buildings and inclosures, care, subsistence, transportation of animals,
including salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, and gen-
eral incidental expenses not otherwise provided for, sixty-seven thousand
dollars; one-half of which sum shall be paid trom the revenues of the
District of Columbia and the other half from the Treasury of the United
States; and of the sum hereby appropriated, five thousand dollars
shall be used for continuing the entrance into the Zoological Park from
Woodley Lane, and opening driveway into Zoological Park, from
said entrance along the bank of Rock Creek, and five thousand dollars
shall be used toward the construction of a road from the Holt Mansion
entrance (on Adams Mill road) into the park to connect with roads now
in existence, including a bridge across Rock Creck.

It will be noted that a considerable portion of the sum appropriated
is for the improvement of certain specified roads within the park and
for the construction of a new bridge in connection therewith. Accord-
ingly, a great part of the time that could be devoted to the improve-
ment of the grounds has been spent in the development of these works.
A narrow but sufficient roadway has been constructed along the line
formerly occupied by the cart path known as the Adams Mill road
and continued onward to the sharp bend in the stream near the animal
house of the park, where an inexpensive but picturesque rustic bridge
has been placed. This plan was deemed preferable to the building of
a wide driveway with a high bridge that would be very costly, far
beyond the scope of any appropriations to be expected from Congress,
and likely at the sanie time to be an intrusion in the peaceful quiet of
the valley, which it would span for some hundreds of feet.

A view of the bridge as finally erected is shown in the appendix.
The foundation at either end rests upon the rock, and the main structure
is formed of an arch of heavy oak logs solidly bolted together. The
strength of the structure is far greater than is required for the amount
of travel that may be expected over it, but not more than is needed to
withstand the force of freshets that occur from time to time in the tur-
bulent stream. A satisfactory result was reached at comparatively
small expense, and though the superstructure will undoubtedly be in
danger during times of great floods, it is believed that the foundation
will always remain uninjured, so that even if the bridge is carried away,
it can be renewed at slight cost.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The road which passes over the bridge should be continued onward up
the valley of the creek as far as the northern boundary of the park,
which is separated from the Rock Creek National Park by the Klingle
road. This would give the public an easy access to the animal pad-
docks situated on the lower levels of the park, establish a thoroughfare
between the Zoological Park and the Rock Creek Park, and afford to
the residents of the country lying immediately to the west of the lower
end of Rock Creek Park a convenient outlet toward the city.

But little has been done during the year to improve the means of
access to the park. This is owing in great measure to the fact that the
plans for the extension of the streets of the city are not yet fully
matured, and no appropriations have yet been made for carrying them
into execution. In consequence of this, there is no properly improved
roadway connecting the recently completed road in the park with the
city system.

The colony of beavers which has been installed along one of the
streams of the park and temporarily secluded, has done very well, and
the animals, while thus secured from annoyance or interference have —
worked as in a state of nature. !t is hoped that they may soon be so
far domesticated as to admit of their carrying on their very interesting
pursuits under the eyes of the public, which is not yet possible.

The accessions to the collection during the past year have been few.
The supply from the Yellowstone National Park, which was confidently
counted upon, has in some respects been disappointing. Owing to the
inroads of poachers and to inadequate winter pasturage, the bison in
that park have greatly decreased in numbers and are widely seattered
in almost inaccessible regions, so that it has been practically impossible
to secure any of them in the corral built for their protection and preser-
vation. Stringent penalties against poaching within that park have
been enacted by Congress, and it is hoped that by careful attention a
remnant of the herd of bison may yet be preserved. It is thought best
not to disturb them at present by any attempts looking toward herding
or capture.

While the bison have been decreasing in the somewhat unfavorable
locality of the Yellowstone National Park, in other parts of the coun-
try some increase has occurred. Thus it is found that a portion of the
great northern herd has been isolated near Ronan, Montana, and in the
so-called panhandle of Texas a remnant of the southern herd continues
to be maintained. It may be remarked that the vast regions of Texas
contain many animals that would be of advantage to our national col-
lection. Many of the Mexican species of deer range into this country,
and many distinctively Mexican animals, such as the peceary and the
jaguar, occur, while on the plains are found wild horses, supposed by
some to be indigenous, and therefore anterior to the Spanish occupa-
tion, and there are even a few camels running wild in some of the more
inaccessible portions of the country, relics of a herd imported for pur-
poses of transportation before the days of the Pacific railroads.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. DAU

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The operations of the Astrophysical Observatory. have consisted
chiefly in experiments in the bolographic analysis of the infra-red solar
spectrum and the preparation of a report thereon, which was completed
in May of the present year, and contains, in addition to introductory,
historical, descriptive, and theoretical matter and accounts of subsidiary
investigations, tables of positions of 222 absorption lines in the infra-
red solar spectrum in terms of angular deviations and refractive indices
for arock-salt prism, and of the approximate wave-lengths corresponding.

These results are based on observations taken between October, 1896,
and January, 1897, which are far superior to any before obtained, by
reason of the great improvements in instrumental equipment spoken
of in my last report. In this research it has thus been necessary to
bestow what may seem inordinate time on the production of preliminary
results chiefly useful in indicating requisite refinements of apparatus
and of method. This once done, the results to be obtained in a few
months exceed in value, for the main purpose of the investigation, all
that have been obtained in as many years. An examination of the
earlier bolographs has, however, recently been undertaken, and a great
number of measurements made on the relative amounts of energy in
the various parts of the spectrum, which, it is hoped, will lead to inter-
esting results when compared with weather records covering the same
interval of time.

A more detailed account of the work of the Observatory will be
found in the appendix. Itisregretted that owing to unforeseen delays,
not in any way due to the Observatory, the report above mentioned is
not yet in type, so that the results obtained, which it is believed will
be a contribution of interest and value to physical science, are not yet
generally accessible. I trust that the obstacle preventing publication
may be removed immediately after the assembling of Congress.

Respectfully submitted.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Sir: The following statement constitutes a résumé of the most important opera-
tions of the National Museum during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1897:

Accessions.—The records show the receipt of 1,467 separate accessions. These
figures indicate an excess of 168 lots over the receipts of the previous year. The
number of specimens embraced in these accessions is nearly 112,000, representing an
increase of more than 50 per cent over last year. The following accessions are
among the most interesting:

Of the zoological material, mention should first be made of two exceedingly valu-
able and interesting collections from Trong, Lower Siam, presented by Dr. W. L.
Abbott. This material is of unusual interest, the insects and shells representing
many species new to the Museum collection. ‘The specimens were received in a very
satisfactory condition. Mr. A. Boucard, Spring Vale, Isle of Wight, England, trans-
mitted aspecimen of the rare mound fowl, Leipoa ocellata, from Australia. Dr. L. T.
Chamberlain, New York City, presented shells from Central America and the West
Indies, and specimens of tourmaline from Paris, Me. From Cornell University,
Ithaca, N. Y., invertebrates collected by the Cornell Expedition to Greenland in 1896
were transmitted by Prof. J. H. Comstock. Mr. D. W. Coquillett, United States
Department of Agriculture, sent 860 specimens of beetles of the family Tachinide,
including type specimens. From Hon. W. B. Brownlow, Member of Congress, have
been received, on deposit, birds’ skins and other natural-history specimens from
British Honduras. Mr. J.G. Foetterle, Petropolis, Brazil, presented 172 specimens of
Brazilian Lepidoptera, representing 115 species. Mr. 8. Nozawa, Sapporo, Japan,
sent a collection of reptiles, batrachians, and fishes obtained at YessoIsland. A very
interesting collection of beetles collected in the Kongo region was received from
Dr. D. W. Snyder, Nashville, Tenn. Dr. W. L. Ralph, Utica, N. Y., presented birds’
skins from the western section of the United States. Zoological material repre-
senting several groups was collected by Prof. O. F. Cook during a trip to Liberia.
A collection of land and fresh-water shells was transmitted by the Perak Museum,
Straits Settlements.

Among the most important additions to the herbarium are included a series of
1,000 plants, representing the private collection of Dr. W. H. Forwood, U.S. A.,
Soldiers’ Home, Washington, D.C.; 432 herbarium specimens, also from Dr. Forwood ;
500 specimens from the Biltmore Herbarium, Biltmore, N. C.; a collection of plants
obtained by Prof. O. F’. Cook, of the National Museum, while in Africa, and a collec-
tion of Spanish plants presented by Mrs. Cook.

A number of microscopic sections from the collection of the Fortieth Parallel Sur-
vey were transmitted from the United States Geological Survey by Mr. Arnold
Hague.

Mr. R. D. Lacoe, Pittston, Pa., forwarded 208 specimens of tertiary plants from
Florissant, Colo., for addition to the Lacoe collection. Dr. C. E. Beecher, Yale
Museum, New Haven, Conn., presented a fine series of fossils, models of Triarthrus
becki, a species of crustacean, and a model of a trilobite with appendage.

30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mrs. J. Crosby Brown, New York City, contributed a collection of ethnological
objects from the western coast of Africa; Dr. W. L. Abbott transmitted some very
valuable ethnological specimens from Lower Siam, and Dr. D. W. Snyder sent
material of a similar character from the Kongo region.

A collection of engraved diplomas, inscriptions, etc., was presented to the Museum
by Messrs. Tiffany & Co., New York City. From Mr. Yang Yii, Chinese minister in -
Washington, a large blue porcelain vase, a bronze urn, and a string of beads were’
received.

Prof. D. P. Todd forwarded from Amherst College two frames of photographs illus-
trating the work of the Amherst Eelipse Expedition to Japan in 1885. Miss M. A.
Henry, Washington, D. C., transmitted specimens of electrical apparatus, and a
number of diplomas and medals presented to her father, Prof. Joseph Henry.

The scientific and administrative staff—On September 6, 1896, by the untimely and
unexpected death of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the Museum was deprived of its imme-
diate head. It was not feasible to fill at once and permanently the vacancy thus
most unfortunately occurring, and on January 27, 1897, I had the honor to receive
the temporary appointment of acting assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, in charge of the Museum.

Mr. W. C. Winlock, who, in addition to his special work as curator of the Smith-
sonian Bureau of International Exchanges and aid in charge of the office of the
Institution, held the honorary position of curator of physical apparatus in the
National Museum, died on September 20, 1896. Maj. Charles Bendire, United States
Army, honorary curator of the department of birds’ eggs, died on February 4, 1897.

Mr. M. L. Linell, aid in the department of insects, died on May 3, 1897.

Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, of New York City, was, on January 11, 1897, appointed
honorary custodian of the collection of gems and precious stones. Mr. J. N. Rose,
Mr. C. L. Pollard, and Prof. O. F. Cook, have been appointed assistant curators in
the department of botany. Mr. J. L. Willige was designated acting chief clerk in
February, 1897, relieving Mr. W. V. Cox, who was appointed special agent in charge of
the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.
Mr. Henry Horan, who, since 1880, had filled the position of superintendent of
buildings, died on September 29, 1896. Mr. Horan first became connected with the
Smithsonian Institution in 1857. Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator of the technological
collections, was placed in charge of the oew division of buildings and superintend-
ence, retaining, in addition, the curatorship of the technological collections.

Distribution of specimens.—More than 26,000 specimens have been distributed dur-
ing the year, including gifts to institutions, exchanges, and specimens sent for
study. About one-half of the entire number consisted of herbarium specimens, and
of the remainder more than 3,700 were marine invertebrates, and about 2,400 geo-
logical specimens.

Visitors.—The number of visitors to the Museum building during the year was
229,606, and to the Smithsonian building 115,709, making a total of 345,315. It
should be remarked that in the total for this year is included the increase in the
number of visitors occasioned in March by the inaugural ceremonies of President
McKinley.

Specimens received for determination.—The number of lots of material received for
determination continues to increase. During the fiscal year just closed there were
716 accessions of this character, 174 more than during the preceding year. The
labor involved in the identification of this material consumes a large share of the
-time of several of the curators, especially in the departments of birds, insects,
mollusks, and geology, for which the Museum receives very little in return. It is
believed, however, that an important field of usefulness is found in this direction.

Tennessee Centennial Kxposition.—The sum of $30,000 was appropriated by Congress
for the erection of a building for the Government exhibit at the Tennessee Centen-
nial Exposition, and the sum of $100,000 for the exhibit proper and for other inci-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

dental expenses. Of the latter amount an allotment of $14,500 was made to the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum. This amount was afterwards
increased by $1,700. Dr. Frederick W. True was designated representative of the
Institution and the Museum on the Government board of management. Mr. W. V.
Cox was made special agent in charge of the exhibit, and was afterwards also
selected as secretary of the Government board. Exhibits were prepared by 18
departments and sections of the Museum, and were shipped to Nashville in the
latter part of April, 1897, the Exposition opening on May 1. A detailed statement
regarding the participation by the Institution and its dependencies in this Expo-
sition will be presented in the report for 1898. ;

Foreign exchanges.—Exchanges of specimens have been made with a number of
foreign museums. Among them may be named the Albany Museum, Grahamstown,
South Africa; Australian Museum, Sidney, New South Wales; Berlin Zoological
Museum, Berlin, Germany; Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, India; Branicki Museum,
Varsovie, Russia; British Museum, London, England; Canterbury Museum, Christ-
church, New Zealand; Manchester Museum, Manchester, England; Museum of
Natural History, Paris, France; Museum of Natural History, Lyons, France; Museum
of Natural History, Genoa, Italy; Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland ;
Provincial Museum, Victoria, British Columbia; Royal Zoological Museum, Turin,
Italy; St. John’s College, Shanghai, China; Zoologiske Museum, Copenhagen, Den-
mark; Zurich Botanical Gardens, Zurich, Switzerland. Exchanges of interest and
value have also been made with individuals, among whom may be named Mr. A.
Batalin, St. Petersburg, Russia; Mr. Stefan Chernel von Chernelhiaza, Kiszeg, Hun-
gary; Mr. C. Copineau, Doullens, Somme, France; Dr. Wheelton Hind, Stoke-upon-
Trent, England; Prof. Wilhelm Leche, Stockholm, Sweden; Mr. J. de Morgan, Gizeh
Museum, Egypt; Mr. Victor Ritter von Tschusi zu Schmidhoffen, Hallein, Germany.

Publications.—The Report of the Museum for 1894 was published during the year,
and on June 30 the Report for 1895 was practically all in type.

Volume 18 of the Proceedings was issued in bound form. About twenty papers
belonging to Volume 19 were published separately, and advance sheets of three
papers, to be included in Volume 20, appeared during the year.

In the series of Bulletins two numbers have been issued—No. 47, the first part of
an elaborate work entitled, ‘“The Fishes of North and Middle America,” by David
Starr Jordan and Barton W. Evermann; and No. 49, “A Bibliography of the Pub-
lished Writings of Philip Lutley Sclater,” by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode.

Two important monographs have been issued as special bulletins. The first of
these (Special Bulletin No. 2) consists of a work on the deep sea and pelagic fishes
of the world, by Drs.G. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean. This volume contains
553 pages and is accompanied by an atlas of 123 plates. The second (Special Bulletin
No. 3) constitutes the second volume of Major Bendire’s ‘‘ Life Histories of North
American Birds,” and contains 518 pages and seven colored plates.

Explorations.—Dr. William L. Abbott has extended his travels into Lower Siam,
and as the result of his explorations the Museum has already received two very large
and exceedingly valuable collections, including natural history specimens and
ethnological objects. Many of the mammals were obtained at high altitudes, and
all of the material is of a peculiarly interesting character.

Additional collections of ethnological objects from Arizona and New Mexico have
been received from Mr. J. Walter Fewkes. A specimen of Canyon Diablo meteorite
was also obtained and forwarded by him.

Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford Junior University,
transmitted, in behalf of the Fur Seal Commission, a collection of natural history
specimens obtained in Japan and Bering Sea.

Prof. O. F. Cook obtained during his travels in Africa valuable collections of
flowers, ferns, etc., which have been added to the herbarium.

Collections of mammals, plants, invertebrates, and other natural history specimens,
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

were made by Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army, in connection with his explo-
rations in New York, Minnesota, Virginia, and Maryland, and these have been
transmitted by him to the National Museum.

Collections of natural history specimens obtained by the Fish Commission steam-
ers Albatross and Fish Hawk, and by field parties sent out by the Fish Commission,
have been received during the year. Important collections have been transferred to
the Museum by the Department of Agriculture. The United States Geological Sur-
vey has sent in large collections from all parts of the country, including material
obtained by the Fortieth Parallel Survey.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Sir: Ethnologic researches have been conducted during the fiscal year in accord-
ance with the act of Congress making provision ‘‘for continuing researches relating
to the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,”
approved June 11, 1896.

The researches have been carried forward in accordance with a plan of operations
submitted on June 13, 1896. The field operations of the regular officers of the
Bureau have extended into Arizona, Indian Territory, lowa, Maine, New Brunswick,
New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, and Ontario, and operations have been carried on
by special agents in California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, as
well as in British Columbia and different provinces in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico.
The office researches have dealt with material from most of the States and from
many other pertions of the American continents.

The chief duty impesed on the Bureau at the outset was the classification of the
Indian tribes; and, since the sciences of man were inchoate when the Bureau was
instituted, this duty involved the organization of those branches of the science deal-
ing with ethnic relations. Accurdingly, a classitication of ethnic science has grown
up in connection with the classification of the tribes, and has been perfected from year
to year; and during recent years, and particularly during the fiscal year just closed,
the operations have been shaped by this classification of the subject-matter of the
science. The primary lines of special research relate to (1) arts or esthetology, (2)
industries or technology (including archeology), (3) institutions or sociology, (4) Jan-
guages or philology, and (5) myths orsophiology, as well as the requisite classificatory
work involving researches in somatology and especially in psychology. The special
researches are initiated in the field and completed in the office, giving rise to (I)
field research (including exploration), and (II) office research, which together con-
stitute the original scientific work of the Bureau; while the demands of the public
service and the needs of the collaborators give rise to (III) work in descriptive eth-
nology, (IV) bibliographic work, (V) work in collecting, (VI) publication, and (VII)
concomitant administrative and miscellaneous work.

: FIELD RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION,

At the beginning of the fiscal year the Director was engaged in a reconnoissance
of shell mounds and other antiquities on the coast of Maine; here he was joined by
Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, and a number of shell mounds were surveyed and
excavated with success. Later in the season the Passamaquoddy Indians still living
in the vicinity were studied with some care, and their industries, especially in house
_ building, were investigated; subsequently some of the older men of the tribe were
employed to collect material for and to erect an aboriginal wigwam, which was
afterwards transferred to the Zoological Park at Washington.

During July and August Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was occupied in making surveys
and excavations of ruins, chiefly in Arizona, with the primary object of collecting
prehistoric material for the enrichment of the National Museum, but with the sec-
ondary purpose of investigating those activities of the aborigines recorded in the
products of their handiwork still extant. His operations were notably successful,

sm 97—3 33
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Early in July Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson proceeded. to Zuni pueblo for the
purpose of investigating certain ceremonies not adequately studied hitherto, to the
end that they might be incorporated in her monograph on the Zuni Indians. She
remained throughout half of the fiscal year, and was able to complete her researches
in a satisfactory manner. Incidentally, she obtained at Zuni and Sia a number of
sacred masks used in the peculiar religious ceremonies of the people of the pueblos,
which have been transferred to the National Museum.

Toward the end of July Dr. Albert S. Gatschet repaired to eastern Maine and
adjacent portions of New Brunswick in search of linguistic material among the
tribesmen still living on St. Croix River. His mission was successfal. <A large body
of vocables, paradigms, and texts representing the Passamaquoddy dialects of the
Algonquian linguistic stock was secured, and he was able also to trace definitely, for
the first time, the derivation of many of the peculiar place names of eastern Maine.

From the middle of August until the middle of December Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was
occupied in collecting material representing the languages and mythology of the
Iroquoian Indians located in central New York and southern Ontario. His work
was eminently productive, yielding a large amount of material of exceptional use
for comparative studies in the philology and sophiology of the Indians.

Toward the end of September Mr. James Mooney repaired to Indian Territory and
Oklahoma, where he spent several months in collecting information and material
relating chiefly to the Kiowa Indians. The primary purpose of the trip was research
concerning the peculiar heraldic system of the tribe; another purpose was the con-
tinuation of study of the use of peyote or “mescal” (a toxic plant corresponding
measurably with hashish) in the ceremonies of the Kiowa, Apache, and other
Indians; later in the season advantage was taken of his presence on the ground to
make a collection representing the Kiowa camp-circle for exhibition at the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition at Nashville.

In April Mr. W J McGee visited the Muskwaki Indian settlement near Tama,
Iowa, with the object of beginning a special study of the social organization of
this little-known tribe. Although preliminary only, his operations were successful.
Incidentally he collected a quantity of aboriginal material for the National Museum.

Early in 1896 Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of Princeton University, was commissioned as a
special agent of the Bureau to obtain photographs and other data pertaining to the
aborigines of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. He reached the field and commenced
operations in the course of a few months, and reports of progress were received |
early in the fiscal year. His field work was completed in June. The photography
was moderately successful only, but the pictures were supplemented by a small
though interesting collection of objects representing the handiwork of these south-
ernmost representatives of the American aborigines. The success of the work, due
in part to Mr. Hatcher’s energy and intrepidity, was promoted through the courtesy
of various officials of Argentina and Chile, special credit being due to Dr. Estanis¥ao
Zeballos, formerly minister plenipotentiary from Argentina to the, United States.

On December 17, 1894, Dr. Willis E. Everette was given an honorary commission to
collect linguistic and other material among the aborigines of Oregon, Washington,
British Columbia, and western Mexico, and from time to time he has submitted val-
uable linguistic material produced by his researches in these provinces. Especially
noteworthy contributions during the year relate to the Téné or Athapascan Indians
of Oregon.

Early in September Mr. E. T. Perkins, jr., of the United States Geological Sur-
vey, reported the discovery of certain remarkable Indian carvings in Snake Kiver
Valley, Idaho; and Mr. Perkins was temporarily detailed, throngh the courtesy of
Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the Survey, to make studies and photographs repre-
senting these carvings. The work was completed about the close of October.

Early in 1897 Mr. H. 8. Gane, of the Geological Survey, while on a temporary fur-
lough, made a trip through the San Juan country in southwestern Colorado and

duly transmitted and have been found of special value.

The information and material obtained by means of these field operations have been
utilized in large part in the preparation of reports; other portions have been added
to the archives for use in prospective investigations, while most of the objective
material has already been arranged in the National Museum in such manner as to be
accessible for study. The scientific results of the work are set forth in other

OFFICE RESEARCH.

WORK IN ESTHETOLOGY.

During the greater part of the year Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing was employed
in arranging and cataloguing the remarkable collection of relics exhumed from salt
marshes in western Florida during the previous fiscal year and in preparing his report
for the press. The objects collected embrace a wide variety of domestic implements
_and utensils, weapons for use in war and the chase, fabrics for apparel and fishing,
appurtenances to water craft, etc. In addition, there were many objects such as are
used in primitive ceremony, comprising elaborately painted and carved masks and
effigies, while many of the industrial devices are painted and carved in a manner
remarkable for wealth of imagery and delicacy of execution.

An important part of Mr. Cushing’s work was comparative study of the designs,
in form and color, found in connection with the ceremonial and other objects; and
substantial progress was made in the interpretation of the designs. Most of these
are zoic. The bear, the wolf, the wild-cat, the woodpecker, and different waterfowls
and aquatic animals are represented in carvings and paintings with a fidelity to
detail which renders them not only readily identifiable but really artistic. Some of
the effigies approach the natural size, and are attached to other articles in such
manner as to indicate that they were worn as masks or crests, probably in dramatic
ceremonies analogous to those of the Indians of the pueblos and other primitive
peoples. These elaborate carvings are associated with wooden masks, shaped to fit
the face, bearing painted and carved designs of corresponding character, but more or
less conventionized in form and color. The realistic or partially conventionized forms
displayed on the masks are imitated not only on other ceremonial objects but also
on the industrial devices, and the degree of conventionism increases as the repre-
sentations are reduced in size or distorted to fit forms determined by various condi-
tions, so that an unbroken series of stages in the development of convention may be
traced all the way from the essentially realistic representation of the animal head
to the design carved on the arrowshaft or tomahawk handle, which, at first sight,
would seem to be decorative merely.

The sequence displayed in these esthetic designs is, indeed, paralleled in other
collections; but the remarkably rich assemblage of aboriginal handiwork from the
Floridian salt marshes, in which such perishable materials as wood, bone, plant
fiber, feather work, paint, and even leathern thongs are preserved, is especially
noteworthy for the completeness of the sequence and the large number of links rep-
resented. Accordingly the series of objects would seem to establish the view already
advocated by different collaborators of the Bureau that higher esthetic decoration
originates in symbolism, which may gradually be transformed through convention-
izing, either in the interests of economy or to meet other industrial conditions.

During the previous year Dr. J. Walter Fewkes made a collection of fictile ware
and other aboriginal material among the ruins of Arizona and New Mexico, which
was regarded as rich beyond precedent. During the year just closed he made explo-
rations yielding a still larger body of material, which has been subjected to prelimi-
nary study, and has already been arranged in the Museum. As during the preceding
year, fictile ware was the predominant material. This ware is characterized by sym-
bolic and decorative designs, represented sometimes by modeling or by inscribed
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

figures, but more commonly by colors; and for the first time material has been
obtained in sufficient quantity to afford presumptively complete series of designs for
certain groups of aborigines at certain periods antedating Caucasian invasion, so
that various stages in the development of esthetic designs may be traced nearly as
definitely as in the Florida collection. In general the course of development traced
in this way is parallel to that made out on the Florida coast. The course of devel-
opment is from the essentially (though often crudely) symbolic to the conventional,
and through various stages of conventionizing to forms and colors which, at first
sight, would be regarded as decorative merely.

Accordingly the coHection is important as a source of new light on the devyelop-
ment of artistic concepts, while, at the same time, that course of developmental
succession which it so clearly attests has been used successfully in tracing certain
movements of the aboriginal population. It has long been known that, while most
of the traditions of the pueblo peoples recount migrations in a southerly or south-
easterly direction, there are subordinate indications of a northerly or northeasterly
drift from snowless lowlands or from saline and shell-yielding shores, and at least
one of the collaborators (Mr. McGee) has found indications of a culture migration
from the once populous valleys of Sonora, with adjacent refuges in the form of
entrenched mountains, northward into the region of cliff houses, whence the mesa-
protected pueblos seem to have sprung. Now Dr. Fewkes is able to trace a similar
northward drift of the esthetic designs characterizing the aboriginal pottery of the
pueblos. This application of the researches in the development of esthetics among
the American Indians is essentially new and is highly suggestive. Some of the
results of the work are already incorporated in reports prepared for publication ;
others are held for comparison and elaboration as the research progresses.

While in Zuni, and afterward at Sia, Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson gave special
attention to the masks and other regalia used in ceremonies, and, as already noted,
obtained a number of especially sacred masks. She found the ceremonial regalia to
be essentially symbolic; the masks themselves represent zoic deities, and their
appurtenances are designed to express real or ideal attributes of the animals deified,
while the associated regalia and insignia, including apparel and the paint applied
to faces, bodies, and extremities, are symbolic of similar or related concepts. All
of the symbols are conventionized in greater or less degree, vet the accompaniments
of voice and gesture, and even the terms of the ritual, are designed to emphasize
the symbolism, i. e., to concentrate attention on the idea symbolized and divert
attention from the conventionism.

Primarily the ceremonies and regalia are dramaturgic, and the use of the more
important regalia is limited to the ceremonial representation; yet to some extent
the mystical or sacred characteristics are supposed to cling to the actors in the mys-
tical drama, and in some measure affect their everyday life; sometimes the actors are
thereby strengthened in their positions as shamans, and they, as well as others, may
continue to wear the less important regalia, or carry about their persons miniature
symbols of the specially deific objects. In this way the devotional sentiment and
the symbolism in which it is crystallized are expressed in everyday life and common-
place manners; and the devotion and symboli-m find some expression in ordinary
handiwork and still clearer expression in the more unusual handiwork involved in
making and decorating the many articles connected with ceremonial rites. The
observations are highly significant, in that they indicate the characteristics and the
dominant influence of devotional sentiment among primitive peoples; they are
especially useful, too, in that they aid in interpreting the symbolism depicted on
prehistoric relics and corroborate the interpretations already rendered. 7

In 1877 Mr. E. W. Nelson, an acute observer and trained naturalist, was commis-
sioned to make collections for the United States National Museum in Alaska and
adjacent territory in North America and Asia. In connection with other duties,
he was authorized to make ethnologic studies and collections among the Eskimo
and other Indians at the cost of the Bureau soon after its institution. He spent

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

some years among the tribes, obtaining vocabularies and other linguistic mate-
rial and making large collections of esthetic and industrial handiwork. He also
prepared a preliminary draft of a report on the ethnology of the region covered by
his operations. On his return to Washington the collections were transferred to the
National Museum, but failure of health prevented him from completing the prepara-
tion of the report, so that the collections have hitherto remained without adequate
explanation. During the present fiscal year he returned to Washington from a pro-
longed absence, chiefly in Mexico, and at once undertook the completion of the long-
delayed report.

Through the courtesy of Museum officials the collection was brought together for
renewed study and the preparation of necessary illustrations. ‘Mr. Nelson’s original
manuscripts were placed in his hands and, before leaving the city in April, he had
practically completed a general report with illustrations of typical objects repre-
senting the handicraft of the hyperborean tribes with whom he came in contact
during his sojourn about the Arctic border. The report is particularly valuable in
its full description and illustration of the decorative designs characterizing Eskimo
art. The Eskimo are distinctive in many respects, but in none more strongly than
in their artistic development; they are clever draftsmen and fairly deft carvers of
wood, bone, and ivory; many of their implements, weapons, and utensils are graved
with artistic devices or sculptured in artistic forms, and the graving and carving
apparently represent a highly conventionized symbolism. Mr. Nelson’s motive is
_ accurate description and faithful illustration of objects rather than analysis and
synthetic arrangement of designs; yet his memoir is a rich repository of material
from which the course of development represented by Eskimo art may be traced.

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY.

While in contact with the Passamaquoddy Indians on the coast of Maine, the
Director and Mr. Cushing had opportunity for studying certain primitive industries
yet retained by this partially accultured people. Conspicuous among these were the
industries connected with the building and furnishing of domiciles. The long per-
sistence of domiciliary industries among these Indians may be explained, at least in
part, by the fact that the birch-bark wigwams are remarkably serviceable and
economic, so that they were only slowly displaced by the little more commodious
and much more expensive houses of civilization. At thesame time, there are strong
indications of ceremonial observances in connection with the erection of habitations,
which doubtless serve to prolong the retention of the aboriginal type.

There is a single model for the dwellings of this branch of the Algonquian Indians.
The structure is rectangular in plan, about 12 by 15 feet, with a narrow doorway in
one end; the end walls stand vertical, while the sides, after rising vertically for 5
or 6 feet, are continued upward to form a curved roof, interrupted by an orifice over
the center of the earthen floor for the exit of smoke. The framework is of light:
arbor-vite poles, neatly cut and shaped by stone implements and fire, the uprights
set in the ground and lashed to the horizontal pieces by means of withes or splints;
the walls and roof are made from large sections of birch-bark, carefully overlapped
shinglewise and skilfully sewn together with slender splints of ash. The door isa
dressed deer skin, attached to a light crossbar, while the smoke hole is provided
with a shifting wind guard which may be so adjusted as to draw out the smoke and
exclude most of the rain or snow in case of storm. The wigwam constructed in this
way is practically wind proof and nearly rain proof, strong enough to resist the force
of storms and the weight of winter’s snow, and is capacious and commodious in
almost the highest possible degree in proportion to the material employed in con-
struction. It lasts five years or more without repairs, and with occasienal repairs as
needed may last a generation. Asa means of studying the house and house building,
two aged Indians were employed to set up a wigwam near the field of work in Maine,
and with a view of extending the study and at the same time perpetuating this form
of aboriginal handicraft, they were afterward engaged to erect and {furnish the
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

structure in Washington. It was at first designed to place it in the National
Museum, but in view of the limitations of space it was afterward decided to locate
the building in the National Zoological Park.

While supervising the work of the Indians on the wigwam, the Director and Mr.
Cushing observed them using a curved knife, held in the hand with the blade pro-
jecting toward the body (the handle being flattened to fit the face of the thumb by
which the attitude of the curved blade is controlled), and drawn toward the body
in use; and the resemblance of the implement to that found among the primitive
peoples of Japan and the similarity in use were at once noted. At the same time -
Mr. Cushing, who was fresh from the tidal marshes of Florida in which curved
knives of shell are entombed, was enabled to interpret more cleariy the Floridian
shell knives and tooth knives, and infer the manner of their use, which must have
been prevailingly centripetal or inward, rather than centrifugal or outward from
the body like the tools of civilization. This simple discovery throws strong light
on the development of primitive industries and removes difficulties hitherto
encountered in the interpretation of primitive implements and workmanship. Then,
on examining the shell mounds and house mounds on the Maine coast, Mr. Cushing
was enabled to explain the occurrence of certain split teeth of the beaver found in
such associations as to suggest habitual use; for he found, on attaching them to
handles similar to those of the curved knives, that they constituted surprisingly
effective implements for shaving and carving wood, for opening the skins and sever-
ing the tissues of animals, and indeed for performing all of the multifarious fune-
tions of the knife. At once it became evident that the beaver-tooth knife was much
more efficient, and among hunters more economic in making and carrying, than the
knife of chipped stone; and on investigating the history of the curved steel knives
made by smiths for the Indians in accordance with their own designs, it became
evident that the beaver-tooth knife was the prototype of that in use by the tribes-
men today. Atthesame time, the connection between the shell knife of the Florida
coast and the beaver-tooth knife of the Maine coast seemed so close as to indicate
similarity in origin, the animal substance used in each case being that possessing at
once the advantages of accessibility and of economy in manufacture and use.

Connected in bearing with the foregoing researches are those conducted during
the year by Mr. W J McGee. During previous years he visited the Seri Indians of
the Gulf of California, and collected various specimens of their handicraft. The
collection comprises a series of stone implements, of which a number were observed
in use, representing a stage in the development of stone art which has hitherto been
obscure. Initially, these implements are natural pebbles picked up from among
the quantities of similar pebbles shingling the beach; yet they are used for break-
ing the shells of crustaceans; for crushing bones of fish, fowl, and animals; for
pounding apart the tough tissues of larger animals, or perchance for crushing and
grinding mesquite beans, cactus seeds, and other vegetal substances. Originally
selected almost at random, the stone is commonly used but once and then thrown
away; but, if the habitation happens to be located near, the fitter stones are used
over and oyer again, perhaps proving so serviceable that when the always temporary
residence is changed they are carried away as a part of the domestic property of
the matron. Eventually the stone becomes battered and worn by use, so that its
shape is changed; then, if rendered less useful by the change, it is thrown away,
while, if made more serviceable, it is retained to become a highly esteemed piece of
property, always carried by the matron in her wanderings and buried with her body
at death.

The series of implements collected, and the much larger series seen in Seriland,
but not collected, show no trace of predetermined design 1 form or finish. The
implements are fairly uniform in size, apparently because the users are fairly uniform
in strength and the uses fairly uniform in force required, and they are fairly uniform
in shape because of similarity in applications; but as a whole, the series is charac-
terized by absence of design, by fortuitous adaptation rather than that complex
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 333)

invention represented by even the simplest chipping or flaking. The culture stage
represented by the series has already been designated protolithic. It is to be noted
that the Seri Indians have no other stone industry, save a little known and appar-
ently accultural custom of chipping stone for the sole purpose of making arrow-
points, and that their knives, scrapers, awls, needles, and ordinary arrow points are
made from shell, bone, wood, and other substances of organic origin. Now, on
assembling the industrial devices of the Florida marshes, the Maine shell mounds,
the Seri Indians, and the more primitive survivors of the Algonquian tribes located
in the Maine woods, and comparing these with the corresponding devices of the
American tribes generally, it is found that the industries involving the use of stone
for implements or weapons fall into a highly significant order, which, despite some
overlapping of phases, seems to represent the normal course of industrial evolution.

The first stage is that in which stone is used in natural or fortuitous condition,
without predetermined design or invention, as among the Seri Indians; this is the
protolithic stage. It is noteworthy that, in the typical case, and presumptively in
others, the prevailing industrial devices of this stage are of organic material and
approach in form and function the biotic armament of lower animals. They are the
readiest substitutes for, and the direct analogues of, teeth and claws. The second
stage is that represented by wrought stone, shaped largely or wholly in accordance
with predetermined design, whether by battering (undoubtedly the original method)
or by flaking and chipping; it may be called the technolithic stage. This stage is
represented by most of the American tribes. It is clearly to be noted that this
arrangement of stages in the development of primitive industry is based wholly on
research among the American Indians and among the relics of their prehistoric
ancestors. It is not designed to supplant or discredit classifications based on the
industrial devices of other countries. It is constructive and not destructive, and is
formulated merely as a contribution to scientific knowledge concerning the abo-
rigines of the Western hemisphere.

Another line of research in technology, conducted chiefly during the year, though
the results were incorporated in a paper accompanying the preceding report, relates
to primitive surgery and medicine. The work, which was based on a collection of
Peruvian crania, was conducted by Mr. McGee. Its details are significant, in that
the interpretations are based on the primitive sophiology known to have prevailed
among the aborigines up to the time of Caucasian invasion, rather than on the more
realistic philosophy by which civilized practitioners are guided The stages of
development of curative surgical treatment, as traced in the course of the researches,
need not be repeated; suffice it to say that the investigation appears to illumine the
previously obscure origin of surgery, and at the same time to throw much light on
the origin and development of medical treatment in general.

In earlier paragraphs, summarizing the results of researches concerning the origin
and development of the arts, incidental allusion is made to the intimate relation
between the esthetic and the industrial. The relation is double—indeed, manifold—
and reciprocal: In the first place, the industrial device is usually a medium for
esthetic devices, graved or carved or painted upon it, usually as symbolic invoca-
tions to mystical powers whereby the efficiency of the implement or utensil may be
augmented; while, in the second place, the execution of the esthetic devices consti-
tutes an important and, in some lands, apparently a preponderant part, of the cccu-
pation of primitive people. Accordingly, the researches in esthetology, carried
forward during the year by various collaborators, including Messrs. Cushing, Fewkes,
and Nelson, and Mrs. Stevenson, have thrown light on the motives and other causes
underlying industrial development.

WORK IN SOCIOLOGY.

In continuing the examination and digestion of material collected during the
eighteen years of the existence of the Bureau, the Director has given special atten-
tion to the principles underlying the social organization of the American aborigines,
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A portion of the results are summarized in a chapter on regimentation incorporated -

in a preceding report. The researches are still in progress.

Mr. W J McGee has continued the comparative study of social organization with
special reference to the Seri and Papago Indians. In the former tribe the social
organization appears to rest wholly on kinship traced through the female line; and
one of the consequences of this organization and of the peculiar isolation of the
people is found in a singular marriage custom which has been noted in previous
reports. The Papago Indians, on the other hand, have an organization based pri-
marily on kinship traced in the male line, but displaying also certain indications of
transition into some such artificial system as that which, on further development,
matures in civilization, i. e., sometimes the gentes are united in such manner that
a single kinship group combines two totems; the kinship terminology is incomplete
in such way as to suggest curtailment through disuse; through seasonal migrations
and other causes there is a constant breaking up of.family groups, followed by inter-
mingling in new combinations in the form of colonies of patriarchal or even feudal-
istic character; there is clear recognition of patriarchal property right in the waters
in which the material values of their arid territory inhere; while the governmental
control, though nominally vested in patriarchal shamans, is really regulated by an
officer selected through popular approval, who may be designated the people’s
attorney.

It is noteworthy that the Spanish invaders of the Western Hemisphere assimilated
the aboriginal much more completely than the Anglo-Saxon invaders of more north-
erly regions, so that in many instances the social institutions prevailing in Mexico
today have sprung from aboriginal germs. ‘This is especially true of the patriarchal
organization characteristic of the Mexican provinces remote from the greater cities
and railways, which differs in no essential particular from the organization still
found among the Papago Indians and recorded in their time-honored traditions.
Now, the comparative studies of the Seri and Papago social organizations, with the
analogue of the Jatter among the modern Mexicans, gives opportunity for clearing
up certain misapprehensions concerning primitive society. In barbaric culture, in
which descent is reckoned in the male line, the governmental control is vested in an
elder man (whose seniority may be either real or assumed), so that the organization
is patriarchal; and it has been inferred, without adequate observation and with
undue influence growing out of the convenience of antithetic terms, that in savage
culture, in which descent is reckoned in the female line, the social organization is
matriarchal.

The case of the Seri Indians is perhaps the most striking among many examples,
indicating that, even when descent is traced exclusively through the female line.to
the extent that the father has no control over his wife’s property or his own chil-
dren, the tribal control is, nevertheless, vested in male rulers, who may be either
shamans of exceptional shrewdness or warriors of exceptional valor and cunning.
Accordingly the term “‘ matriarchal” can only be regarded as erroneous and mislead-
ing when applied to this culture stage. This becomes especially clear in the light
of the observations among the Papago Indians and the mixed-blood Mexicans, in
which the rule is patriarchal, but in which there is an associated matriarchy, for
the wife of the patriarch occupies a position among the women and children of the
group corresponding to that of her spouse, primarily among the men, but secondarily
among all, so that patriarchy and matriarchy are in reality complementary aspects
of that culture stage in which descent is traced in the male line. Confusion is
avoided by designating the more primitive organization as maternal and the more
advanced as paternal, and by restricting the terms patriarchal and matriarchal to
their legitimate functions, as indicated by the usage of southwestern peoples. The
details of the researches on this subject are too extended for summary statement;
but the principles developed through the study are important as a means of inter-
preting observation and thus guiding special research and contributing to scientific
knowledge of the aborigines. The work is still in progress.

WORK IN PHILOLOGY.

Linguistic studies were pushed forward energetically during the earlier years of
the existence of the Bureau, partly as a means of classifying the Indians in such
manner as to guide grouping on reservations. A considerable portion of the material
collected was, after the immediate practical use, placed on file for comparison and
study with a view to the discovery of the principles of linguistic development.
During the fiscal year the Director has reviewed these records in conjunction with
those pertaining to sociology and sophiology, and has made progress in developing
the principles of philology and applying them to the ethnic problems presented by
the American aborigines. In primitive society language grows in two ways: Onthe
one hand there is a steady enrichment and differentiation due to the coining of
expressions for new ideas; on the other hand there is a spasmodic enrichment and
modification, both in terms and in grammatic structure, produced by the shock of
contact (whether peaceful or bloody) with other peoples—the changes consequent
on conquest being especially important, as has been shown by different philologists.
At the same time both the lexic and the structural forms—i. e., both words and sen-
tences—are simplified through the natural tendency toward economy in expression.
These and other processes connected with the growth of language have been indi-
cated in some detail in earlier reports.

Now, on examining the aboriginal languages of America, it is found that many of
them are interrelated in such manner as to indicate specific courses of development,
and in all such cases the dominant process has been the union or blending of more
or less diverse elements, both lexie and structural. This blending can be explained
only as a record of intertribal contact, and the cases are so numerous—indeed, they
are characteristic of all of the aboriginal tongues—as to indicate that practically all
of the native languages have been built up and shaped chiefly by the combination
and blending of antecedently distinct and presumptively discrete tongues. This
conclusion as to the development of oral speech in America is corroborated by the
simpler history of the development of the so-called gesture speech, which was widely
used by the Indians as a partial substitute for, and convenient supplement to, oral
speech as an intertribal language. When the course of development ascertained by
these comparisons is so extended as to apply to the entire assemblage of native Amer-
ican peoples, it at once becomes evident that the sixty linguistic stocks and five
hundred dialects extant at the time of the discovery (themselves the product of long-
continued combination and blending of distinct tongues, as the researches have
shown) are indubitable records of still more numerous and still.more widely distinct
languages of an earlier time, and the more carefully the record is scanned the more
numerous and the more distinct do the original components appear.

It is accordingly a necessary inference that a vast number of distinct, albeit sim-
ple if not inchoate, tongues originally existed in North America, and that the sub-
sequent history has been chiefly one of linguistic integration. - It is a corollary of
this proposition, which is but the generalization of all known facts relating to the
aboriginal languages of America, that the Western Hemisphere must have been peo-
pled by the ancestors of the modern Indian tribes before the birth of language
among them. Both the main proposition and the corollary run counter to earlier
opinions entertained in this and other countries; yet they are not only sustained by
the u precedentedly rich collection of linguistic facts preserved in the Bureau
archi 1s or published in the reports, but by the cumulative evidence obtained through
the researches concerning the arts, industries, institutions, and beliefs of the Ameri-
can aborigines. A more detailed report on this subject is in an advanced stage of
preparation.

Dr. Albert 8S. Gatschet has continued the collection of linguistic material pertain
ing to the Algonquian Indians, and has made progress in the preparation of the
comparative dictionary of Algonquian terms. The new material collected during
the year was obtained chiefly among the Passamaquoddy Indians living in the woods
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of Maine and adjacent parts of New Brunswick. Advantage was taken of an
opportunity to obtain a Nez Percé vocabulary, representing the Shahaptian stock,
from Lewis D. Williams, an educated member of the tribe, who spent some months
in Washington during the earlier part of the fiscal year. This record is deemed of
special value, not only in that it is more complete than those representing the same
stock already on file, but in that it affords means of checking and clearing up doubt-
ful points in the earlier records.

In addition to collecting a rich body of material relating to the languages and
beliefs of several Iroquoian tribes, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt made considerable progress
in the systematic arrangement of material collected during preceding years. One
of the more important lines of his work was a study of the pronoun with special
reference to its function in primitive language and its relation to other parts of
speech. His researches indicate with greater clearness than others hitherto con-
ducted that the pronoun occupies a much more prominent position in primitive
speech than in the highly developed languages of cultured peoples. The prepara-
tion of a special paper on the subject was commenced by Mr. Hewitt toward the
end of the year. Another line of work by Mr. Hewitt, originating in the collection
of mythologic texts, was a comparative study of the creation myths of different
Troquoian and Algonquian tribes.. The preliminary results of this study are espe-
cially significant in their bearing on conclusions derived from the study of lan-
guage. On comparing half a dozen versions of the Indian cosmogony, he was able
to detect unmistakable indications of interchange of such sort as to prove that
originally independent myths have undergone considerable coalescence and blending,
so that the myth, like the speech in which it is crystallized, is a composite of many
elements. Coupled with the features indicating coalescence there are, indeed, cer-
tain features indicating differentiation, chiefly in the direction required to adjust
the mythic personages to the local fauna; but the indications of differentiation are
far subordinate to the evidence of coalescence or integration. A number of typical
myths representing the aborigines of the northeastern United States have been
brought together with a view to publication so soon as the general discussion is

completed.
WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY.

The scope and extent of the researches in sophiology during the fiscal year are in
some measure set forth in the foreguing paragraphs, for the various demotic activities
are interdependent, and neither arts, industries, institutions, nor languages can be
developed without the concomitant development of opinions, whether mythic or
rational. Important additions to the material representing the symbolism and cere-
monies of the Indians have been made through the labors of Mr. Cushing in Florida,
Dr. Fewkes and Mrs. Stevenson in Arizona and New Mexico, Dr. Gatschet in Maine,
and Mr. Hewitt in New York and Ontario, as already noted. Mr. James Mooney con-
tinued his researches relating to the Kiowa Indians, giving special attention to their
heraldic and calendric systems, and to the use of the peyote or mescal in their cere-
monies. It is well known that dreams and visions, commonly induced by fasting,
play an important réle in connection with the beliefs and religious usages of primi-
tive peoples; it is known also that among some peoples drugs are used to intensify
the abnormal condition attended by visions; but there is probably no better
example of this custom than that afforded by the Kiowa and some neighboring tribes
in their use of the peyote. The mental effects of the drug are something like those
produced by hashish; its influence is so strong and so certain that the Indians using
it have come to rely on it for the production of the eestatic state regarded as essential
to the proper performance of their ceremonial rites, while, in turn, the rites have
been so adjusted to the effects produced by the drug that they are, in Mr. Mooney’s
opinion, completely dependent on it for their existence. Although the researches
concerning the subject are not complete, preliminary announcements have been made
concerning the results of scientific examination of the peyote and concerning its
influence on the religious practices of the tribe.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

In connection with his work on this subject, Mr. Mooney completed during the
year a memoir on the Kiowa calendar system, which has been incorporated in the
seventeenth annual report. This memoir is deemed noteworthy as a remarkably
exhaustive rendering of what may be called the autobiographic history of an
important tribe.

In his comparative studies of the Seri, Papago, and other tribes, Mr. McGee was
led to consider the course of development of myth or of the explanation of phe-
nomena in terms of the supernatural. It is significant that, so far as can be ascer-
tained, supernaturalism is a more potent factor in determining conduct among the
warlike Seri than among the peaceful Papage, and the examination of other tribes
indicates that the relation is general, i. e., that the tendency toward supernatural
explanation, with its concomitant effect on conduct, is gradually rectified by inter-
tribal contact in a manner akin to that in which myths and languages are blended.
The studies are still in progress.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

The preparation of material for the Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes was continued
during the year under the immediate supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge. As other
duties permitted, Mr. Hodge continued extracting and placing on cards material
relating to the Pueblo Indians and other southwestern tribes. The greater part of
the work on the cyclopedia performed (during the year was that of Dr. Thomas, who
continued and nearly completed the revision, extension, and final arrangement of the
voluminous body of material relating to the Algonquian Indians, the largest and
most diversified of the aboriginal stocks of the territory of the United States. In his
detailed report Dr. Thomas acknowledges gratefully the facilities afforded by several
libraries of the national capital, especially the Congressional Library, whose rich store
of rare literature has been most courteously made accessible by Librarian Ainsworth
R. Spofford. Some additions to the cyclopedia were made also by other collabora-
tors, particularly Mr. Mooney.

BIBLIOGRAPITY.

The bibliographic work of the Bureau was interrupted in 1895 by the death of
James C. Pilling, who had prepared a series of reports on the literature relating to
the languages of several aboriginal stocks (which were issued as bulletins during
preceding years), and who had partially completed a similar report concerning the
aboriginal languages of Mexico. During the last fiscal year an arrangement was
made whereby this portion, at least, of the bibliographic work may be completed.
The task was generously undertaken by Mr. George Parker Winship, librarian of the
John Carter Brown Library, in Providence, already a contributor of valuable material
to the Bureau. Mr. Winship began operations toward the end of the year. The
material pertaining to Mexico, brought together by Mr. Pilling, was transferred to
his custody, and by the end of the year he was able to report substantial progress in
the work.

COLLECTING.

The chief work of the year in this department was that of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes
conducted under the more immediate direction of the Secretary. Already in the
field at the beginning of the fiscal year, Dr. Fewkes proceeded to the extensive ruin
of Chevlon, on Little Colorado River, early in July. Later he excavated another
ruin of imposing dimensions near Chavez Pass. His work was successful beyond
precedent, yielding by far the finest and most extensive collection of aboriginal
fictile ware and associated artifacts ever made in the United States. As noted in
earlier paragraphs, the material is especially rich in symbolic painting and other
expressions of the remarkable religious beliefs of the pueblo peoples during prehis-
toric times.
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A noteworthy collection of ceremonial masks was made at Zuni and Sia by Mrs. -
Matilda Coxe Stevenson, and has been duly installed in the National Museum. In
the course of his field operations, Mr. Mooney obtained additional material illustrating
the handiwork and ideas of the Kiowa Indians; and toward the close of the fiscal
year, while temporarily detailed to make and arrange collections for the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition at Nashville, he brought together and, with the aid of the
Indians, constructed an exhibitshowing in miniature the characteristics of the Kiowa
camp-circle, the significance of which is not generally understood. Toward the
end of the year Mr. Hatcher reported the transmission of a small collection repre-
senting the primitive industries of the aborigines of southern Patagonia. In April
Mr. McGee obtained a small but interesting collection of aboriginal matting and
wooden ware from the Muskwaki Indians, near Tama, lowa. The greater part of the
collection has been transferred to the Museum. Among the articles is a carved
wooden dish corresponding in form, dimensions, and ornamentation with an earthen-
ware type frequently found in the mounds; the specimen is of peculiar interest in
that its form was determined by the curved beaver-tooth knife with which it was
fashioned and in that its esoteric and essentially prescriptorial symbolism was ascer-
tained, so that it explains one of the most persistent forms of aboriginal ware.
Several other collaborators made minor collections, and a few others were acquired
from correspondents. One of these is a series of iron tomahawk pipes, made for the
Indian trade by the French pioneers and long used by the tribesmen in lieu of the
aboriginal weapons of stone, shell, wood, and copper; another was a particularly fine
collection, obtained from the mounds of Missouri and the adjoining part of Illinois
by Col. F. F. Hilder; still another was a series of stone implements from the mounds
of northern Ohio, which are regarded as especially desirable for purposes of compara-
tive study in the National Museum.

PUBLICATION.

Mr. Hodge has remained in charge of the details of publication, and it is gratify-
ing to be able to report activity, almost beyond precedent in the history of the Bureau
in this branch of the work. At the beginning of the year the Fourteenth Annual
Report was partly in type, the Fifteenth was in the printer’s hands, and proofs of
illustrations had been received. The Sixteenth Report was in nearly the same con-
dition. The editorial work was pushed forward successfully. About the end of the
calendar year the Fourteenth Report was issued, in two volumes, and the distribu-
tion was at once commenced. The demand for the document was unprecedented, so
that the edition was practically exhausted within three months. It may be observed
that this report was more extensively noticed and reviewed, both in scientific jour-
nals and the ephemeral press, than any preceding publication by the Bureau, and
that the tone of the reviews has been favorable or still more highly commendatory,
without exception so far as known. Meantime the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Reports
received constant attention, and both were completed and published about the end
of the fiscal year. The demand for these documents also is pressing, and they, too,
are being favorably received by the reviewers.

The manuscript of the Seventeenth Annual Report was transmitted for publica-_
tion on June 18, 1897. The accompanying papers comprise ‘‘ The Seri Indians,” by
W J McGee; “The Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians,” by James Mooney;
‘Navajo Houses,” by Cosmos Mindeleff; together with a fully illustrated account of
the “Archeological Expedition in Arizona in 1895,” by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes.

The material for the Eighteenth Report also was brought together, and the edito-
rial work was well advanced before the end of the year. It is accompanied by two
memoirs, each of considerable magnitude, so that it will be necessary to issue it in
two volumes; the first of these is ‘‘The Eskimo of Bering Strait,” by E. W. Nelson,
and the other is the memoir on ‘‘Indian Land Cessions,” by C. C. Royce and Cyrus
Thomas, which has been described in earlier reports; the former is fully illustrated.

by photographs and drawings, representing the people and the extensive collections
made by Mr. Nelson; the latter is accompanied by numerous maps.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Library.—The additions to the working library of the Bureau were unprecedented
jn number and value, particularly in respect to standard works of reference: mean-
time the normal growth due to accessions through exchange has continued. At the
close of the fiscal year the contents of the library comprised 7,138 volumes, in addi-
tion to several thousand pamphlets and periodicals. :

Illustrations.—During the earlier part of the year the preparation of illustrations
for reports was continued under the direction of Mr. De Lancey W. Gill, the photo-
graphic work being executed by Mr. William Dinwiddie. Toward the end of the
calendar year Mr. Dinwiddie retired from the Bureau, and on January 1 Mr. Wells
M. Sawyer, formerly of the Geological Survey, was placed in charge of the illustra-
tive work, including photography. This arrangement has been found satisfactory,
and the illustrative work is now carried forward acceptably in all of its phases. Mr.
Henry Walther has aided Mr. Sawyer efficiently in cataloguing and classifying nega-
tives and prints, as well as in photographic printing.

Exhibits.—As noted incidentally in earlier paragraphs, an exhibit was prepared for
the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in Nashville. It comprises half of a Kiowa
camp-circle, represented in miniature, occupying a semicircular area with a radius
of about 20 feet in a central portion of the Government Building. The installa-
tion of the material was completed in time for the formal opening, and before the
end of the fiscal year it became evident that the display will be generally regarded
as attractive and successful.

APPENDIX III.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL
EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the operations of the
Bureau of International Exchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897:

The number of packages received from all sources for distribution during the year
was 81,162, or 7,716 less than during the preceding year, although the territory
reached by exchanges emanating from the Smithsonian Institution was increased by
the addition of 2,527 names of institutions, libraries, and individuals in other coun-
tries than the United States, while the domestic list was increased by 567. The
ageregate weight of packages handled was 247,444 pounds.

By reference to previous reports it will be noticed that three or four boxes of
United States Congressional publications have been forwarded to each of the foreign
national libraries every year, while but two boxes were forwarded during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1897. One more box to each of the fifty recipients would have
made the total number of packages transmitted by the Institution equal to that of
the previous year. It is also worthy of note that while the number of packages was
less than during the preceding year, the number of boxes shipped abroad was nearly
one-fourth greater than during the previous year. The difference is accounted for
by the fact that the number of exchange packages reported as having been received
during the fiscal year were those that had been delivered to the Institution between
July 1, 1896, and June 30, 1897, while the cases shipped during the same period con-
tained many tons of exchanges that had been delivered principally from United
States Government Departments and Bureaus during the last week of the previous
fiscal year, and which could not be forwarded during the same year in which they
were received.

The comparison of exchanges during past years shows that transmissions are
exceedingly variable, especially those from abroad, and while during one year
thousands of parcels may be received from a single society for distribution in the
United States, no more may come from the same society for two or three years, and
when there may be several such instances in a single year it is easy to understand
that the annual statistical tables must vary to a marked degree.

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is provided for in part by direct appropria-
tion by Congress to the Smithsonian Institution, and in part by the various Executive
Departments of the United States Government, which in most instances pay 5 cents
per pound for the transportation of their exchanges, both outgoing and incoming.
This charge was exacted by the Regents before the United States Government made
any appropriation whatever for exchanges, and since appropriations have been made
the exchange system has been taxed to such an extent that it has never been possible
to relinquish the practice of making this charge, which, during the past year, has
realized an income amounting to $3,334.33

The Congressional appropriation made to the Institution in support of the exchange
system for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, read as follows:

“Wor expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, nineteen thousand dollars.”

The following statement represents the receipts and expenditures on account of
the system of international exchanges for the year preceding July 1, 1897.

On account of the inadequacy of available resources with which to bear the expense
necessary to the forwarding of all exchanges by the most expeditious routes, it has
at all times been necessary to obtain free ocean freight when practicable, and while
some of the steamship companies have forwarded exchanges as promptly as other
freight on which the full rates were paid, several of the lines have only been willing
to take exchange cases when there was ample room.

To provide more adequate means with which to defray the expense of forwarding
exchanges promptly and by the fastest steamers, $2,000 was added to the appropria-
tion for 1896-97. Of this amount $1,283.53 was directly expended in the improvement
of freight facilities and the balance for the necessary increase in the cost of packing

boxes and postage.
CORRESPONDENTS.

The publication of a revised foreign exchange list authorized by the Secretary in
March, 1895, has been accomplished, and the book is now being sent to societies and
libraries in the United States, to which it will be of assistance in locating the names
of all institutions outside of the United States which have received packages through
the exchange system. This list, corrected to July 1, 1897, contains the liames of
9,414 institutions, libraries, and societies, but owing to the frequent change in the
addresses of individuals, the names of persons, with few exceptions, have not been
included in this list, although the same minute ledger account of the interchange of
publications is kept with individuals as with institutions.

There are now a total of 28,008 names on the records of the exchange bureau, an
excess of 3,094 over the preceding year; 21,427 of this number being foreign and
6,581 domestic.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

The following table shows that during the past year 10,694 parcels have been
received through the exchange service and delivered to the various Departments of
the United States Government, while 30,008 packages have been received from Gov-

RELATIVE INTERCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

Since July 1, 1896, a new feature has been adopted in the system of records of the
Exchange Bureau, showing the number of packages exchanged between the United
States and each of the other countries, thus supplying information that has not here-
tofore been obtainable without a tedious tabulation of each year’s transactions.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

From.

During the past year the exchange of parliamentary documents with Mexico has
been resumed, and twenty cases that had accumulated were forwarded on Decem-

ber 29, 1896. Hereafter each case as completed will be transmitted promptly.

The exchange of public documents with Japan has also been renewed during the

past year, but, although several attempts have been made through the Japanese
minister to induce his Government to assume the distribution of miscellaneous pub-
lications, the effort has not yet met with success.

The only countries with which exchange relations are at present entirely sus-
pended are those disturbed by strife, viz, Turkey, Greece, and Cuba. The exchange
of public documents with Turkey, however, has been reestablished, but, on account
of the difficulties in delivering consignments at Constantinople, the steamship com-
panies for the moment have declined to accept freight for that port.

The efficiency of the force of the Exchange Bureau, as well as its agents, Messrs.
William Wesley & Son, London, and Dr. Felix Fliigel, at Leipsic, is well established.
On account, however, of the increasing duties of the Leipsic agency, covering as it
does the territory of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Balkan countries, and Switzer-
land, I would respectfully recommend that the territory so covered be subdivided
and that other agents be appointed, in order to avoid too much pressure at Leipsic,
which condition is liable to exist where so much is expected of a single agency.

The following list represents the names of companies and other mediums of trans-
portation that continue to contribute free freight on exchanges or lend their aid in
the transportation and delivery of such consignments.

APPENDIX IV.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: Ihave the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897:

The close of the last year found the system of roadways in the park, authorized
by acts of Congress, still in an unfinished condition. This state of affairs has been
markedly improved by the completion of the Adams Mill road, by making the road
from Woodley practicable for carriages, and by completing the macadamization of
the main driveway through the park.

The Adams Mill road, laid out with a width of about 20 feet, has been fully mac-
adamized, the base used being broken quartz rock and the surface layer pulverized
blue limestone. It makes a very pleasant winding driveway, affording an excellent
view of the valley of Rock Creek, and while the grades upon it are steeper than is
desirable for easy driving, they are not more so than most of the roads that approach
the valley in this region.

In order to connect the roadway from Woodley with the main system of the park,
it was necessary to construct a bridge at a point considerably below the one at the
Quarry road entrance. By boring it was found that solid rock could be reached at
a short distance below the surface, and it was accordingly decided that it would not
be necessary to build a masonry foundation. By excavating the sand and gravel
sufficiently to denude this rock, and by blasting enough to obtain a good bearing
surface, a suitable bed was formed upon which to lay concrete, forming a massive
block of sufficient size to afford a solid support for the flat stones upon which could
rest the beams of an arch forming a single span of 70 feet, made as low and flat as
practicable.

The main driveway through the park, which was laid out so as to make the grades
as light as possible, proved upon practical trial to be too tortuous for the safety of
the numerous carriages that frequent it in ever increasing numbers. Some of the
more abrupt curves were accordingly modified, and its macadamization, which was
commenced last year, was then completed. Broken quartzite was used for the base
of this road, the surface being of fine gravel mixed with a small quantity of clay.
As far as can be judged by the experience of one winter, the result is satisfactory.
It is hoped that the coming year may see the entire road system of the park in such
condition that it will be possible to reach all the principal exhibits over good roads
during any season or weather.

The walks of the park have also been improved to some extent during the year.
About the principal animal house there has been constructed a granolithic footway
of ample width leading along the outer or summer cages. This walk will be prop-
erly shaded, and is a much needed improvement. From the animal house to the
main driveway there has been laid a pathway of pulverized bluestone, which is
found to be much better than the board walk formerly in use. As fast as the avail-
able funds permit, foot walks of this kind should be constructed in all parts of the
park. Although the first cost is somewhat more, their much greater durability
makes them really more economical than the unsightly board walks that now disfigure
the roadsides.

A well graded and macadamized carriage road from the street-car line of the Capi-

tal Traction Company, upon Cincinnati street, to the entrance of the park near the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

Holt house, communicating there with the Adams Mill road, would be a very desira-
ble improvement, as it would allow a much better approach than is now obtained by
the steep grade upon the Quarry road. Another carriage road should be constructed
from Connecticut avenue extended to the park, a distance of only about 180 feet,
but almost impassable during wet winter weather because of deepmud. The atten-
tion of the Commissioners of the District has been called to this matter, and I am
informed that Congress has already appropriated funds that can next year be applied
to remedying these defects.

The only permanent house that it has been possible to build during the year is one
for the zebus, or East Indian cattle. This has been placed on a hillside opposite the
buffalo house, a location not wholly desirable, yet one that brings the animals fully
to the notice of the public. It is, properly speaking, a shelter barn, made of
concrete mixed with large pebbles, the roof of tile supported upon wooden beams.
An illustration showing this house is appended hereto. About it there have been
inclosed paddocks of sufficient size for the accommodation of the animals.

Some effort has been made during the year to procure a satisfactory exhibit of the
varieties of the domesticated dog, both for the purpose of showing the amount of
variation that occurs in a single species, as well as to display typical specimens of
each breed for the information of those unacquainted with their characteristic
appearances. A similar exhibit is made at the Jardin d’Acclimatation, near Paris,
forming one of the principal features of the collection there. By corresponding
_ with breeders and dog fanciers a number of typical specimens were secured, and a
temporary wooden structure to be used as a kennel was erected not far from the
principal animal house. The exhibit has excited considerable public interest, but
the dogs being very noisy, so much so as to greatly disturb the residents on the
eastern side of the park, the principal kennel was finally removed to a more distant
and secluded situation on the western side.

An unfortunate accident has greatly retarded the growth of this collection.
Lieutenant Peary, U.S. N., temporarily withdrew from the park, for purposes of
exhibition, two of the Eskimo dogs deposited by him. After these were returned,
one of them almost immediately developed a case of distemper which, in spite of
all that could be done in the way of isolation and disinfection, ran entirely through
the kennels, affecting not only the dogs but also the wolves and foxes. Many ani-
mals, particularly the younger ones, died from it. The Eskimo dogs suffered with
especial severity, the fine group possessed by the park last year being now reduced
to a single specimen,

An extension of the paddocks for the wapiti or American elk was made impera-
tively necessary by the increase in growth of the young males received from the
Yellowstone National Park. Accordingly, there was selected for this purpose a large
tract, comprising some 9 acres, situated between Rock Creek and the fence on
the eastern side of the park, and still covered with primitive forest. This was
inclosed by means of the Page wire fence, and within it, at a short distance from
the fence, was built a small shelter for holding feed. Access to this is by an ele-
vated walk, a precaution rendered necessary by the ferocity of the males during the
fall and winter season, which makes it dangerous to enter the inclosure at that
time. The animals have made themselves entirely at home within this precinct, and
appear very much as they do in their native haunts.

It has been necessary to replace the fence for the inclosure situated on one of the
little tributaries of Rock Creek within the park where the beavers have built quite
extensively and also brought forth young. The fence, already used for some years to
confine these animals, was of strong wire mesh, but proved insufficient to withstand
their powerful teeth. Severing it in several places, they went outside their inclo-
sure and felled small trees, which they endeavored to drag into their dams. On
several occasions, notwithstanding the repeated repair of the fence, they escaped at
night, returning to the inclosure during the day, and finally one of them established
himself permanently outside and has not as yet been recovered. It being necessary
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to construct a new fence of sufficient strength to withstand the attacks of their
teeth, one was built of vertical steel rods, ;; inch in diameter, curved inward at the
top, 80 as to prevent any possibility of climbing over. This is believed to be per-
fectly effective in preventing their escape.

During the year the scope of the operations of these animals has been greatly
increased, and they have now constructed three large dams, one of which is at least
4 feet high. Each of these has been built wholly by the beavers themselves, either
from trees felled by them within the inclosure or from branches furnished them for
food. They cut this material into suitable lengths, which they drag to the water,
float to the dam, and there combine with mud and twigs to form a compact structure.
In connection with each dam they have built houses, together with several smaller
burrows in the bank. The entrance to the houses is always under water and can
only be reached by diving.

The animals have become quite accustomed to the presence of man, and it is
believed that under proper restrictions the public may be allowed to see them at
work. The paddock in which they are inclosed should be somewhat enlarged, as it
is now so small that the different families interfere with each other, and the weaker
ones can not escape from their pursuers.

On September 29, 1896, the city of Washington was pane” by one of the severest
storms that ever occurred in this region. The velocity of the wind reached for a
short time 80 miles per hour, and its force was terrific, unroofing and blowing down

‘houses and uprooting trees, so that the whole vicinity was a scene of wreck and dev-
astation. Within the park hundreds of trees were laid prostrate, and a portion of the
root of the Holt house, where the office is situated, was blown off. The roads wereso
blocked with fallen trees as to be impassable, and the fences of the elk and buffalo.
inclosures were, by the same cause, crushed in, so that for a short time there was
considerable danger that the animals might escape. Fortunately, this did not occur;
none of the animals were seriously injured, and no very serious damage was done to
‘any of the buildings. The cost of clearing away the wreckage from this storm was
over $500, and the repairing of the roof of the Holt house cost $100, sums that could
ill be spared from the limited appropriation at the disposal of the park.

The accessions to the collection during the year have not been very numerous. As
no purchase of animals was allowed, all additions must be by gift, by births, by col-
lections from the Yellowstone National Park, or by exchange.

A list of all the animals donated is appended hereto. Especially valuable and
welcome additions from this source were four harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), presented
by Mr. J. H. Starin, already well-known for his generosity; a mule deer (Cariacus
macrotis), presented by Mr. Frank Maumey, of Telluride, Colorado, and a brush-
tailed rock kangaroo (Petrogale penicillata), presented by Mr. M. J. Flood, of Sydney, -
Australia. Other valuable animals presented by Mr. Flood unfortunately died en
route. is

The most important births have been those of two sea lions (Zalophus californianus),
a buffalo (Bison americanus), a zebu (Bos indicus), and two beaver (Castor fiber).

From the Yellowstone Park there has been received during the year one consign-
ment, comprising, among other animals, six young prong-horn antelopes (dntilocapra
americana). These beautiful creatures were captured when very young, and fed by
hand until sufficiently well-grown to endure transportation. They are quite accus-
tomed to the sight of men, horses, and even dogs. They have been placed in a small
paddock at the western side of the park, and have thriven well since their arrival,
a fact of considerable interest when it is remembered that much difficulty has been
experienced by others in rearing them in captivity.

As surplus stock of any particular species accumulates in the park, effort is made
to exchange it for other animals, and thus produce a greater variety of exhibits.
By this means several most important accessions have been obtained. Among these
were an African ostrich (Siruthio camelus), an Indian antelope (Antilope cervicapra),
and two of the exceedingly rare West Indian seals (Monachus tropicalis). Unfortu-

nately there has been great difficulty in inducing these latter animals to eat, for
they do not seem to relish any of the fish or other sea products procurable in the
markets of Washington. These seals are among the most important acquisitions
ever made by the National Zoological Park. The species has been known for more
than two centuries past to exist in the Caribbean Sea, but it has been exceedingly dif-
ficult to get specimens, even the extensive zoological garden at Lon¢ on never having
possessed one. Those in the possession of the park were obtained on a small island
in the Gulf of Campeche.

I am informed by Dr. J. Eugene Jarnigan, United States consul at Utilla, Hon-
duras, that the species is Os aie seen among the reefs about 70 miles north of
Cape Gracios-a-Dios.

In concluding my report I wish to call attention to the fact that since the estab-
lishment of the National Zoological Park there have been many other enterprises of
a similar character projected and established in various parts of the country, and
that these are, as a rule, supported by far greater resources than are allowed for the
national collection. Among these I will mention the following:

The Blue Mountain Forest Park, established by the late Mr. Austin Corbin, is a
large tract of forest and abandoned farm land, situated in the western part of New
Hampshire, comprising an inclosed area of 26,000 acres. Within this inclosure are
kept about 4,000 wild animals, including 74 bison, 200 moose, 1,500 elk, 1,700 deer of
different species, and 150 wild boars. These animals are rapidly multiplying, and,
with the exception of the bison, which are sheltered and fed during the winter, live
in perfect freedom.

In the Adirondack region of New York a game preserve of 9,000 acres has been
stocked with elk, Virginia deer, mule deer, rabbits, pheasants, etc., and Mr. W. C.
Whitney has established a preserve of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire hills, near Lenox,
Mass., where he maintains not only the species of animals above mentioned, but also
bison and antelope. Other preserves are Ne-ha-sa-ne Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000
acres; Tranquillity Park, near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve,
near Tacoma, Wash., 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St. Paul, Minn., 400 acres, and
Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, New York, 600 acres. These are all fenced inclos-
ures, well stocked with animals.

At Pittsburg, Pa., certain public-spirited citizens have undertaken, iu one of the
public parks, the construction of a number of buildings intended for the exhibition
of animals. These are already nearing completion and will cost more than $200,000,
exclusive of the animals they are to contain. A further collection of buildings and
inclosures intended for American animals only is also projected for that city.

In 1895 certair gentlemen interested in natural history organized the New York
Zoological Society, whose objects are stated to be as follows:

“ First.—The establishment of a free zoological park containing collections of
North American and exotic animals, for the benefit and enjoyment of the general
public, the zoologist, the sportsman, ‘and every lover of nature.

“ Second.—The “systematic encouragement of interest in animal life or zoology
among all classes of the people and the promotion of zoological science in general.

“ Third.—Cooperation with other organizations in the preservation of the native

animals of North America and encouragement of the growing sentiment against
their wanton destruction.”

To carry out this plan these gentlemen obtained from the city of New York a
grant of some 261 acres in the southern portion of Bronx Park, near that city, for
the purpose of establishing there a zoological garden, which is to be free to the pub-
lic for at least five daysin each week. Plans are now being prepared for the deveiop-
ment of a collection on the most generous and attractive scale. The bulletin issued
by the society states that it is expected that there will be at once spent $125,000 for
preparing the ground and $250,000 for buildings and inclosures.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Str: The work of the observatory during the past year has consisted largely in
preparing for publication an account of the research on the positions of absorption
bands in the infra-red solar spectrum.

In this report, which was completed in May, 1897, but which, owing to unavoid-
able delay, has not yet appeared in type, the positions of about 225 absorption lines
and bands are determined in deviation and refractive index for a 60° rock-salt prism
at the temperature of 20° centigrade. These lines are distributed in the salt spec-
trum between deviations of 40° 25’ and 38° 45’, corresponding to wave lengths 0.76
and 5.20 4, respectively. The average error probable in the absolute angular devia-
tions of these lines is about 4 seconds of arc, but in their relative deviations meas-
ured from the A line in the visible spectrum the probable error averages only about
0.5 seconds of arc, a degree of accuracy even exceeding the anticipations held forth
in last year’s report. The bolographs from which these results were obtained were
taken on exceptionally favorable occasions between October 26, 1896, and January 9,
1897. These bolographs, 13 in number, were selected from among many more, of
all degrees of excellence, taken during the same interval.

The forthcoming report contains, in addition to the results above mentioned, an
account of the investigations leading up to this research on the infra-red absorption
lines; a description of the successive improvements in the instrumental conditions
which have rendered possible the present results; a description of the present appa-
ratus and its adjustment; and a discussion of present sources of error and the pos-
sibility of future progress. The results of several subsidiary investigations are
given, among others being the change of deviation of rock salt with change of tem-
perature, the heat conductivity of rock salt, the effect of diffraction in decreasing
the intensity of energy in the spectrum with narrowing slit widths. The report is
illustrated with reproductions of photographs and drawings of apparatus, platted
curves explanatory of various matters, bolographic curves, and line spectra similar to
that here given. With the illustrations, the report is expected to cover about 175
quarto pages.

DETAILS OF THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

There have been taken during the year 83 bolographs (none were taken after Jan-
uary 20, 1897), of which about one-third are notably superior to any of previous
years in freedom from ‘‘drift” and accidental inflections, in genuine detail, and in
accuracy of position. On 6 bolographs covering the region 0.76 y to 2 , and 7 con-
tinuing from 1.8 « to 5.5 uw, all the lines determined to be “real,” after the manner
described in the report of last year, have been measured in position upon a compara-
tor, both to determine the deviation in the spectrum and the relative intensity of
energy at the various points. Each curve was twice independently measured.

These measurements were reduced and tables prepared of deviations, indices of
refraction, approximate wave lengths, and giving the relative importance of the
lines discovered (about 225 in number), and the relative intensities of energy at the
corresponding points in the solar spectrum. A composite linear photograph has
been prepared from three curves, for purposes of illustration after the manner here-
tofore described.

INFRA-RED SOLAR SPECTRUM OF A 60° ROCK-SALT PRISM, 6.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

A determination has been made of the change in deviation of the A line with
change of temperature of the salt prism. The value obtained was —12.0| 0.4” for
the change in deviation, corresponding to 1° rise in the temperature of the prism.

Interesting results were obtained, experimentally, showing that for slit widths less
than 0.15 millimeter the increase in the loss of energy by diffraction is very rapid.
An investigation was begun, and bids fair to end successfully, with the design of
constructing a galvanometer far more sensitive than the one in present use, which
may enable a considerable gain to be made in the number of lines to be discovered
by the bolographic method of spectrum analysis.

ACQUISITIONS AND ALTERATIONS OF APPARATUS.

1. A concave mirror 26 centimeters in diameter and of 230 centimeters principal
focal length was obtained for use in the system of collimation by two mirrors, as
proposed in last year’s report, and actually installed with advantage in August, 1896.
The metal work required in the mirror mountings was done at the Observatory shop.

2. Three very accurate optical flats, 12 centimeters in diameter, were procured for
testing the faces of the salt prism during its occasional polishings, and for use as
plane mirrors when required.

3. A train of totally reflecting prisms, so adjusted as to invert an image, was
obtained for use with the 6-inch telescope as an erecting eyepiece.

4. A number of large blocks of sait were received through the courtesy of the
Russian Government, and from one of the blocks, which promised good optical qual-
ity, there was cut a large prism. On polishing, however, the quality of the interior
was found to be so far below the exterior appearance that the prism has not been
made use of. The optical work on the pieces of apparatus above mentioned was
done by Mr. J. A. Brashear.

5. A Zeiss anastigmatic wide-angle photographic lens was procured for use in
photographing interior rooms.

6. A Nachet compound microscope with mechanical stage and various accessories
was obtained and is frequently used for measurements of bolometer threads and
other small objects.

7. There have been made at the Observatory shop during the year, in addition to
such repairs as were required, the following pieces of apparatus:

- a. Bearing for circle shaft to insure greater accuracy of motion.

b, A mounting for oblong plane mirror and prism to form an auxiliary fixed-arm
spectroscope. This piece of apparatus was used in the determination of the change
of deviation of rock salt with change of temperature.

c. A special rheostat for balancing the bolometer, provided with a slide wire oper-
ated mechanically from without, and all inclosed by a water jacket. —

8. It was shown that the circle of the spectrometer moved less accurately than was
desired, and that the error arose in the action of the worm-and-wheel mechanism,
which connects it with the clock. Messrs. Warner and Swasey undertook the task of
replacing the worm and wheel-segment in use, by others of the desired degree of
accuracy. In this they were successful, and the degree of accuracy attained may be
inferred when it is said that it is required that the position of the circle shall not be
inerror by more that 0.5 second of arc, which corresponds to a linear distance of
0.00003 inch on the circumference where the worm and wheel-segment is applied.

9. A comparator for the measurement of bolographs in ordinates and abscissa was
procured of Warner & Swasey. The specifications were prepared at the Observa-
tory with a provisional design which was elaborated and modified by the makers.

10. The large Zeiss photographic lens has been fitted with a Prosch rapid shutter.

11. A new motor and a set of small taps and dies have been added to the shop
equipment. ;

12. On the recommendation of Dr. Kayser, of the University of Bonn, who inspected
the Observatory during a visit to this country, sulphuric acid has been used to dry the
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

spectrometer chamber in the place of lime, as heretofore. A lead tank about 6 feet
long and 15 inches wide is supplied with about a gallon ata time of crude sulphuric
acid. This acid will abstract more than an equal volume of water from the air
before requiring changing, and its use has been attended with very satisfactory
results in preserving the faces-of the rock-salt optical apparatus.

GENERAL ALTERATIONS.

The Observatory has received necessary repairs, and has beenrepainted. Its color
is now a light drab, and the roof is white in place of the previous brown. Itis
found that the difference of the temperature maxima of thermometers within and
without the Observatory has become nearly 4° C. greater since the repainting. This
greatly ameliorates the condition of the observers.

It is proposed to introduce a system of cooling by ammonia gas, to be regulated
automatically, so that the apparatus can be maintained through the months of
April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, as in the winter, at a
standard, constant temperature. As much of the clear observing weather comes in
these months, much is hoped from this change.

PERSONNEL.

Mr. L. E. Emerson closed his period of service at the Observatory July 1, 1897.

SUMMARY.

I may sum up the result of the year’s work by saying that the positions of between
200 and 300 lines in the infra-red solar spectrum have been accurately established ;
that an account of the researches of the observatory has been prepared for publica-
tion; and that the instrumental equipment has reached a state of excellence never
before equaled.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Sir: I have the honor to present herewith a report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1897.

The entry numbers of accessions to the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Con-
gress extend from 339,340 to 364,972.

The following table gives an analysis, in volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets,
and charts, during the year:

In addition to this there have been added to the Secretary’s library, office library,
and the library of the Astrophysical Observatory, 332 volumes and pamphlets, and
2,044 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,376, and a grand total of accessions for
the year of 35,912 volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts.

These accessions show a gain of 992 in volumes, parts of volumes, and charts
over the previous year, and in the number of entries, 793.

The following universities have sent complete sets of their academic publications,
including inaugural dissertations:

Basel. Freiberg. Kiel. Pennsylvania.
Berlin. Giessen. Konigsberg. Strassburg.
Bern. Griefswald. Leipzig. Tubingen.
Bonn. Halle-am-Saale. Louvain. Utrecht.
Breslau. Heidelberg. Lund. Wurzburg.
Cornell. Helsingfors. Marburg. Zurich.
Dorpat. 3 Jena. Montevideo.

Erlanger. Johns Hopkins. Montreal.

While it is not possible to specify the large number of academies, learned societies,
editors of periodicals, and private persons who have sent their publications to the
Institution, one gift is deserving of especial notice, that of Mr. 8. Patcanof, of St.
Petersburg. Mr. Patcanof presented over 300 volumes, including manuscripts,
printed books, and pamphlets, relating to oriental and Russian philology, archzeology,
geography, and folklore, and more especially works relating to Armenian literature.
The collection includes quite a number of rare works.

Several months were spent in revising the list of foreign establishments to which
Smithsonian publications were being sent. It was found that many of them were
not sending an adequate return, and a systematic correspondence has been begun

with a view to remedying this state of affairs.
69
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A check list of scientific periodicals in the Smithsonian library is being prepared
for the new edition of Dr. Bolton’s Bibliography of Scientific Periodicals, to be issued
by the Institution. In view of the very large number of publications of this charac-
ter belonging to the Institution, the preparation of this list entails much labor and
is not yet completed. :

In accordance with the plan of the Secretary for increasing the library exchanges,
673 letters were written for new exchanges and for completing series already in the
library, with the result that 104 new exchanges were added to the list and 101 defec-
tive series were either completed or added to as far as the publishers could supply
the missing parts.

I have little doubt but that much more could be done in this direction if more
assistance could be had. The preparation and revision of lists and the examination
of the library records for the ascertainment of missing parts requires much and
careful labor, and must necessarily proceed slowly. The time occupied in writing
the letters is but trifling, compared with that required for the preliminary work.

During the year I attended two meetings of the American Library Association—one
at Cleveland, in August, 1896, at which I presented a paper entitled ‘‘ Fifty years of
library promotion at the Smithsonian Institution,” and at the meeting of the same
association held at Philadelphia in June, 1897, a paper on the proposed ‘‘Interna-
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature.”

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX VII.
REPORT OF THE EDITOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1897.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the publications of the
Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1897:

I. CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

Two memoirs of the Contributions have been issued this year, each of them hay-
ing been submitted in the Hodgkins fund prize competition.

No. 1033. Argon; a New Constituent of the Atmosphere; by Lord Rayleigh and
Prof. William Ramsay. (Part of Vol. XXIX of Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.) Quarto pamphlet of 43 pages, illustrated with 5 text figures.

This memoir was submitted in competition for one of the Hodgkins Fund prizes
offered by the Smithsonian Institution, and the first prize of $10,000, for a treatise
embodying some new and important discovery in regard to the nature or properties
of atmospheric air, was awarded to Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay for their
discovery of ‘‘Argon,”’ anew element of the atmosphere. The authors give a detailed
description of the apparatus and methods of their investigation.

No. 1034. Atmospheric Actinometry and the Actinic Constitution of the Atmos-
phere; by E. Duclaux, professor of physics in the Agronomical Institute at Paris.
(Part of Vol. XXIX of Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.) Quarto pamphlet
of 48 pages.

Professor Duclaux summarizes his work as follows:

“1. The oxidation of oxalic acid in a weak solution takes place mainly, and almost
exclusively, under the influence of the chemical rays of solar light; it can therefore
be used as an actinometric measure.

“<2. It depends on the concentration of the liquid, which for the best results should
not exceed about 3 grams per liter.

“3. With an equal volume of solution combustion decreases as depth increases.
There is an absorption of chemical rays, although the liquid is and remains very
transparent.

“4. For equal depths of liquid, combustion is proportional to the surface, and con-
sequently also to the volume.

“5. It depends on the age of the solution—that is to say, of the time which has
elapsed since preparation. As it grows older an oxalic solution becomes more sensi-
tive and attains a certain maximum which is quite stable and quite regular. it is
well to wait till this state of sensitiveness has been produced.

“6. The daily combustion, such as is measured with sterilized liquids, varies from
one day to another much more than any other meteorological phenomenon, and, while
subject to the influence of what we call ‘fine weather’ and ‘overcast weather,’ it
manifests very clearly other influences which are less visible.

“7, It shows also the influence of the seasons, and manifestly exhibits a maximum
in spring.

aR. It is but feebly subject to the influence of altitude.

“9. On the other hand, it betrays so strongly the presence of divers oxidizable
essences or substances in the air that we must consider local and daily variations
as due to the presence in the atmosphere of actinic clouds, which are discoverable
only by the reduction and absorption which they produce in the chemical radiations
of sunlight.

“10. The atmosphere of extreme northern regions is less absorbent than that of
our temperate zones, and, consequently, at the same hours of the day actinic radia-
tion is more powerful, at the level of the soil, in the north than at the center of
Europe.

71
a2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

“11. Northern countries add to this cause of superiority, which they owe to the
constitution of their atmosphere, another, which is due to their geographical posi-
tion, namely, that the actinic effect of the sun increases more ra)idly than the
duration of its presence above the horizon. The very long days of the north dur-
ing the period of vegetation are, therefore, in their actinic effect more active than
an equal number of days in our temperate regions, and we can thus explain the par-
ticularly intense rate of the progress which vegetation makes in the vicinity of the
polar circle. e

‘12. This increase of sensitiveness which oxalic acid experiences in the sun does
not cease when the light begins to fade, and may continue several days. Hence fol-
lows a conclusion which may also be applied to our temperate regions. This is that
the actinic effect of a number of fine days in succession increases more rapidly than
its duration, and also that the effect of a fine morning is not lost by a dark and
cloudy evening.

“13. We must therefore give up the hope of finding, in the duration of a day or
of solar action, a measure of its effects, and meteorological instruments which
accept such a proportionality are to be rejected.

“14. The importance of these actinic phenomena in the general economy of the
world is great enough to make it necessary that we should approach the investiga-
tion by appropriate means.”

II. SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

The series of Miscellaneous Collections now includes 36 completed volumes,
embracing 173 distinct papers, besides parts of 4 additional volumes. The following
were published during the past fiscal year:

No. 1035. Mountain Observatories in America and Europe, by Edward S. Holden,
director of the Lick Observatory. (Part of Vol. XXX VII of Smithsonian Miscella-
neous Collections.) Octavo pamphlet of v1, 77 pages, with 24 full page illustrations.

In this paper Professor Holden describes the conditions of good vision at moun-
tain stations all over the globe, and makes a short study of the high-level observa-
tories in this country and Europe. The main scientific and practical conclusions to
be drawn from the facts presented are stated by Professor Holden as follows:

“‘Briefly they show the necessity for a careful examination of the sites proposed
for an astronomical (or meteorological) observatory before a final choice is made.
They prove that while some mountain stations present great advantages for astro-
nomical and astrophysical observatories, this is by no means the case for all. And
they point out that the more frequent use of balloons, etc., in meteorology is likely
to result in a rapid advance in our knowledge of the physics of the atmosphere, and
to do away, in a great degree, with the need for permanent meteorological stations
at high levels.

“Tt appears that different researches require different conditions. All would be
best done at a station where both steadiness and transparency were absolute. But
some can be very well performed under less perfect conditions. If one is searching
for the site for a new observatory, both conditions should be insisted upon; if one
is planning work at a station already established, the work should be chosen so that
it can be well done under existing conditions.

“None of these (and other) obvious conclusions are new. The mass of evidence
will, however, bring new conviction even to those most familiar with it; and it may
serve as a check on the wasteful expenditure of public and private endowments.
The subsidies to science, great as they are, thanks to the generosity of governments
and of individuals, must be carefully husbanded if we are to exploit its entire
domain, which is enlarging day by day.”

No. 1037. Methods for the Determination of Organic Matter in Air, by David
Hendricks Bergey, B. S., M. D., of the University of Pennsylvania. (Part of Vol.
XXXIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo pamphlet of 1, 28 pages,
with 3 text figures.

The difficulties that were encountered in estimating the quantity of organic mat-
ter in expired air, while conducting the research on the Composition of Expired Air
and its Effects upon Animal Life, are said by Dr. Bergey to have demonstrated the
fact that some of the methods in use were unsatisfactory. He reviews various
forms of apparatus used by foreign and American investigators, and concludes as
follows:

“J. The quantity of organic matter bears an intimate relation to the amount of

dust floating in the air. It is probable that the gaseous organic matter forms but
an exceedingly small proportion of the total organic matter.

cs Del EI
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

“<2. The attachment of a dust filter of asbestus to the absorption apparatus pro-
duces results that are constantly lower than those obtained without the dust filter.

“The most reliable method for the estimation of organic matter in air is that
known as Remsen’s method, and is called Method IIa in this research.!. The pum-
ice stone seems to be the best form of absorbent material, because it can be thor-
oghly cleansed by heat without changing its condition or usefulness.

“‘4. Those methods which determine the or ganic matter from its reducing action
on permanganate do not seem to afford as satisfactory results as those in which
the organic matter is estimated as ammonia.”

No. 1038. Smithsonian Physical Tables, prepared by Thomas Gray. (Part of Vol.
XXXV of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo volume of xxxiv, 301
pages.

“Tn connection with the system of meteorological observations established by the
Smithsonian Institution about 1850, a series of “meteorolog ical tables was compiled
by Dr. Arnold Guyot, at the request "of Seer etary Henry, and was published in 1852.
A second edition was issued in 1857, and a third edition, with further amendments,
in 1859. Though primarily designed for meteorological observers reporting to the
Smithsonian Institution, the tables were so widely, used. by physicists that, after
twenty-five years of valuable service, the work was again revised and a fourth edi-
tion was published in 1884. In a few years the demand for the tables exhausted the
edition, and it appeared to Secretary Langley desirable to recast the work entirely,
rather than to undertake its revision again. It was decided to publish a new work
in three parts—Meteorological Tables, Geographical Tables, and Physical Tables—
each representative of the latest knowledge in its field, and independent of the
others, but the three forming a homogeneous series. Althou gh thus historically
related to Dr. Guyot’s tables, “the present work is so entirely changed with respect
to material, arranevement, and presentation that it is not a fifth edition of the older
tables, but "essentially a new publication.”

The first volume of the new series, the Meteorological Tables, appeared in 1893, and
a second edition was published in 1896. The second volume, the Geographical Tables,
prepared by Prof. R. 8. Woodward, was published in 1894. The volume of Physical
Tables, forming the third of the series, was published during this year. It was pre-
pared by Prof. Thomas Gray, of the Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terre Haute, Ind.
In the preface to the tables Professor Gray says:

“In the space assigned to this book it was impossible to include, even approxi-
mately, allthe physical data available. The object has been to make the tables easy
of reference and to contain the data most frequently required. In the subjects
included it has been necessary in many cases to make brief selections from a large
number of more or less discordant results obtained by different experimenters.
I have endeavored, as far as possible, to compile the tables from papers which are
vouched for by well-known autborities, or which, from the method of experiment
and the apparent care taken in the investigation, seem likely to give reliable results.

“‘Such matter as is commonly found in books of mathematical tables has not been
included, as it seemed better to utilize the space for physical data. Some tables of
a mathematical character which are useful to the physicist, and which are less easily
found, have been given. Many of these have been calculated for this book, and
where they have not been so calculated their source is given.

“The authorities from which the physical data have been derived are quoted on
the same page with the table, and this is the case also with regard to explanations
of the meaning or use of the tabular numbers. In many cases the actual numbers
given in the tables are not to be found in the memoirs quoted. In such cases the
tabular numbers have been obtained by interpolation or calculation from the pub-
lished results. The reason for this is the desirability of uniform change of argument
in the tables, in order to save space and to facilitate comparison of results. Where
it seemed desirable the tables contain values both in metric and in British units, but
as a rule the centimeter, gram, and second have been used as fundamental units.
In the comparison of British and metric units, and quantities expressed in them, the
meter has been taken as equal to 39.37 inches, which is the legal ratio in the U nited
States. It is hardly possible that a series of tables, such as those here given, involy-~

it is hoped that these are not so numerous as to seriously detract from the use of the
book.”

No. 1039. Virginia Cartography: A Bibliographical Description, by P. Lee Phil-
lips. (Part of Vol. XXXVII, Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 85 pages.

Mr. Phillips’s work is a bibliographical description of all known maps of Virginia
since the year 1585. Special mention is made of the John With, or John White, map
of 1585, the Capt. John Smiu. — > 9f1608, and the map made by Augustine Herman
in 1670, now exceedingly rare. These three maps were copied by nearly all map
makers up to 1751, when the Fry and Jefferson map appeared. The list comprises in
all about 300 maps.

No. 1071. Air and Life, by Henry De Varigny, of the Paris Museum of Natural
History. (Part of Vol. XX XIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 69 pages.

Dr. Varigny’s essay was awarded the Hodgkins prize of $1,000 for the best popular
essay on atmospheric air. In order to give this work, as also those of Mr. Russell
and Dr. Cohen, as wide a circulation as possible they have been printed both in the
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections and in the Annual Report, separate editions
from the report being also issued in pamphlet form. Dr. Varigny in a popular
manner discusses air from the physical and from the chemical point of view, and after
explaining the biological réle of the chemical constituents of the air concludes
with a chapter on the biological réle of air physically considered.

No. 1072. The Atmosphere in Relation to Human Life and Health, by Francis
Albert Rollo Russell, vice-president of the Royal Meteorological Society. (Part of
Vol. XXXIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octayo pamphlet of 148
pages.

This essay by Mr. Russell which was awarded a silver medal in the Hodgkins prize
competition, is a discussion of the principal functions of the various elements and
substances of which the atmosphere is composed, with special reference to their
influence upon human life and welfare. It also discusses the influence of climate
upon national health and shows in what manner the spreading of infectious or
epidemic diseases in the animal world and in mankind depends, in a very great degree,
upon aerial influences. In conclusion the author indicates lines of research in the
study of atmospheric air that may be beneficial to mankind.

No. 1073. The Air of Towns, by Dr. J. B. Cohen, of Yorkshire College, Leeds, Eng-
land. (Part of Vol. XXXIX of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 41 pages, with 2 text figures and 21 full-page illustrations.

Dr. Cohen’s paper was also entered in the Hodgkins prize competition, and was
granted honorable mention by the committee of award and recommended for publi-
cation by the Institution. The author treats the subject in the form of four lectures
on “Close rooms,” “Smoke,” ‘‘Town fog,” and “The germs of the air.” In the
discussion of the several topics Dr. Cohen indicates the many impurities in the air
of cities, especially where there is much smoke from factory chimneys, and suggests
various remedies for exterminating the impurities or for alleviating the danger
therefrom. The paper is accompanied by a number of illustrations of atmospheric
microbes and of apparatus used in his investigation of the atmosphere of cities.

No. 1075. The Constants of Nature. Part V. A Recalculation of the Atomic
Weights, by Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, chief chemist of the United States Geo-
logical Survey. New edition, revised and enlarged. (Part of Vol. XXXVIII,
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo pamphlet of v1, 370 pages.

“This work is one of a series devoted to the discussion and more precise determi-
nation of various ‘constants of nature,’ and forms the fifth contribution to that
subject published by this Institution.

“The first number of the series, embracing tables of ‘Specific gravities’ and of

‘Melting and boiling points of bodies,’ prepared by the same author, Prof. F. W.
Clarke, was ) ublished in 1873. The fourth part of the series, comprising a com-

plete digest of the various ‘Atomic weight’ determinations of the chemical ele-
ments published since 1814, commencing with the well-known “Table of equivalents,’
by Wollaston (given in the Philosophical Transactions for that year), compiled by
Mr. George F. Becker, was published by the Institution in 1880. The present work
comprises a very full discussion and recalculation of the ‘Atomic weights’ from all
the existing data and the assignment of the most probable value to each of the
elements. ,

“The first edition of this work was published in 1882, and this new edition, revised
and enlarged by Professor Clarke, contains new information accumulated during the
past fifteen years.”

No. 1077. Equipment and Work of an Aero-physical Observatory, by Alexander
MeAdie. (Part of Vol. XXXIX, Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.) Octavo
pamphlet of 30 pages. Mr. McAdie’s essay was submitted in the Hodgkins fund
prize competition and was awarded honorable mention with a bronze medal.

GENERAL APPENDIX

SMEPHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1897,

sm 97—_6
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers -as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent’ collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1897.

ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. !

By Smwon NEwcome.

The University of Chicago yesterday accepted one of the most
munificent gifts ever made for the promotion of any single science, and
with appropriate ceremonies dedicated it to the increase of our knowl-
edge of the heavenly bodies.

The president of your university has done me the honor of inviting
me to supplement what was said on that occasion by some remarks of
a more general nature suggested by the celebration. One is naturally
disposed to say first what is uppermost in his mind. At the present
moment this will naturally be the general impression made by what has
been seen and heard. The ceremonies were attended, not only by a
remarkable delegation of citizens, but by a number of visiting astrono-
mers which seems large when we consider that the profession itself is
not at all numerous in any country. As one of these, your guests, I am
sure that I give expression only to their unanimous sentiment in say-
ing that we have been extremely gratified in many ways by all that we
have seen and heard. The mere fact of so munificent a gift to science
can not but excite universal admiration. We knew well enough that
it was nothing more than might have been expected from the public
spirit of this great West; but the first view of a towering snow peak is
none the less impressive because you have learned in your geography
how many feet high it is, and great acts are none the less admirable
because they correspond to what you have heard and read, and might
therefore be led to expect.

The next gratifying feature is the great public interest excited by the
occasion. That the opening of a purely scientific institution should
have led so large an assemblage of citizens to devote an entire day,
including a long journey by rail, to the celebration of yesterday is
something most suggestive from its unfamiliarity. A great many Sci-
entific establishments have been inaugurated during the last half cen-
tury, but if on any such occasion so large a body of citizens has gone so

great a distance to take part in the inauguration the fact has at the
moment escaped my mind. :

That the interest thus shown is not confined to the hundreds of
attendants, but must be shared by your great public, is shown by the
unfailing barometer of journalism. Here we have a field in which the
nonsurvival of the unfit is the rule in its most ruthless form. The
journals that we see and read are merely the fortunate few of a count-
less number, dead and forgotten, that did not know what the public
wanted to read about. The eagerness shown by the representatives of
your press in recording everything your guests would say was accom-
plished by an enterprise in making known everything that occurred,
and, in case of an emergency requiring a heroic measure, what did not
occur, showing that smart journalists of the Hast must have learned
their trade, or at least breathed their inspiration, in these regions. ~ I
think it was some twenty years since I told a European friend that the
eighth wonder of the world was a Chicago daily newspaper. Since
that time the course of journalistic enterprise has been in the reverse
direction to that of the course of empire, eastward instead of westward.

It has been sometimes said—wrongfully, I think—that scientific men
form a mutual admiration society. One feature of the occasion made
me feel that we, your guests, ought then and there to have organized
such a society and forthwith proceeded to business. This feature con-
sisted in the conferences on almost every branch of astronomy by
which the celebration of yesterday was preceded. The fact that beyond
the acceptance of a graceful compliment I contributed nothing to these
conferences relieves me from the charge of bias or self-assertion in
saying that they gave me a new and most inspiring view of the energy
now being expended in research by the younger generation of astrono-
mers. All the experience of the past leads us to believe that this
energy will reap the reward which nature always bestows upon those
who seek her acquaintance from unselfish motives. In one way it
might appear that little was to be learned from a meeting lke that of
the present week. Each astronomer may know by publications per-
taining to the science what all the others are doing. But knowledge
obtained in this way has a sort of abstractness about it a little like our
knowledge .of the progress of civilization in Japan, or of the great
extent of the Australian continent. It was, therefore, a most happy
thought on the part of your authorities to bring together the largest
‘possible number of visiting astronomers from Europe, as well as
America, in order that each might see, through the attrition of personal
contact, what progress the others were making in their researches. To
the visitors at least I am sure that the result of this meeting has been
extremely gratifying. They earnestly hope, one and all, that the callers
of the conference will not themselves be more disappointed in its
results; that however little they may have actually to learn of methods
and results, they will feel stimulated to well-directed efforts and find
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 87

themselves inspired by thoughts which, however familiar, will now be
more easily worked out.

We may pass from the aspects of the case as seen by the strictly pro-
fessional class to those general aspects fitted to excite the attention of
the great public. From the point of view of the latter it may well
appear that the most striking feature of the celebration is the great
amount of effort which is shown to be devoted to the cultivation of a
‘field quite outside the ordinary range of human interests.

A little more than two centuries ago Huyghens prefaced an account
of his discoveries on the planet Saturn with the remark that many,
even among the learned, might think he had been devoting to things
too distant to interest mankind an amount of study which would
better have been devoted to subjects of more immediate concern. It
must be admitted that this fear has not deterred succeeding astrono-
mers from pursuing their studies. The enthusiastic students whom we
see around us are only a detachment from an army of investigators
who, in many parts of the world, are seeking to explore the mysteries
of creation. Why so great an expenditure of energy? Certainly not to
gain wealth, for astronomy is perhaps the one field of scientific work
which, in our expressive modern phrase, “has no money in it.” It is true
that the great practical use of astronomical science to the country and
the world in affording us the means of determining positions on land and
at sea is frequently pointed out. It is said that an Astronomer Royal
of England once calculated that every meridian observation of the
moon made at Greenwich was worth a pound sterling on account of
the help it would afford to the navigation of the ocean. An accurate
map of the United States can not be constructed without astronomical
observations at numerous points scattered over the whole country,
aided by data which great observatories have been accumulating for
more than a century, and must continue to accumulate in the future.

But neither the measurement of the Earth, the making of maps, nor
the aid of the navigator is the main object which the astronomers of
today have in view. If they do not quite share the sentiment of that
eminent mathematician, who is said to have thanked God that his sei-
ence was one which could not be prostituted to any useful purpose,
they still know well that to keep utilitarian objects in view would only
prove a handicap on their efforts. Consequently they never ask in
what way their science is going to benefit mankind.

As the great captain of industry is moved by the love of wealth, and
the politician by the love of power, so the astronomer is moved by the
love of knowledge for its own sake, and not for the sake of its applica-
tion. Yet he is proud to know that his science has been worth more to
mankind than it has cost. He does not value its results merely as a
means of crossing the ocean or mapping the country, for he feels that
man does not live by bread alone. If it is not more than bread to know
the place we occupy in the universe, it is certainly something which
88 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

we should place not far behind the means ot subsistence. That we now
look upon a comet as something very interesting, of which the sight
affords us a pleasure unmixed with fear of war, pestilence, or other
calamity, and of which we therefore wish the return, is a gain we can
not measure by money. In all ages astronomy has been an index to
the civilization of the people who cultivated it. It has been crude or
exact, enlightened or mingled with superstition, according to the cur-
rent mode of thought. When once men understand the relation of the’
planet on which they dwell to the universe at large, superstition is
doomed to speedy extinction. This alone is an object worth more than
money.

Astronomy may fairly claim to be that science which transcends all
others in its demands upon the practical application of our reasoning
powers. Look at the stars that stud the heavens on a clear evening.
What more hopeless problem to one confined to earth than that of
determining their varying distances, their motions, and their physical
constitution? Everything on earth we can handle and investigate.
But how investigate that which is ever beyond our reach, on which we
can never make an experiment? On certain occasions we see the moon
pass in front of the sun and hide it from our eyes. To an observer a
few miles away the sun was not entirely hidden, for the shadow of the
moon in a total eclipse is rarely 100 miles wide. On another continent
no eclipse at all may have been visible. Who shall take a map of the
world and mark upon it the line on which the moon’s shadow will
travel during some eclipse a hundred years hence? Who shall map
out the orbits of the heavenly bodies as they are going to appear in a
hundred thousand years? How shall we ever know of what chemical
elements the sun and the stars are made? All this has been done, but
not by the intellect of any one man. The road to the stars has been
opened only by the efforts of many generations of mathematicians and
observers, each of whom began where his predecessor had left off.

We have reached a stage where we know much of the heavenly bodies.
We have mapped out our solar system with great precision. But
how with that great universe of millions of stars in which our solar
system is only a speck of star dust, a speck which a traveler through
the wilds of space might pass a hundred times without notice? We
have learned much about this universe, though our knowledge of it is
still dim. We see it as a traveler on a mountain top sees a distant
city in a cloud of mist, by a few specks of glimmering light from
steeples or roofs. We want to know more about it, its origin and its
destiny; its limits in time and space, if it has any; what function it
serves in the universal economy. The journey is long, yet we want, in
knowledge at least, to reach the stars. Hence we build observatories
and train. observers and investigators. Slow indeed is progress in the
solution of the greatest of problems, when measured by what we want
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 89

to know. Some questions may require centuries, others thousands of
years for their answer. And yet never was progress more rapid than
during our time. In some directions our astronomers of to-day are
out of sight of those of fifty years ago; we are even gaining heights
which tweuty years ago looked hopeless. Never before had the astron-
omer so much work—good, hard, yet hopeful work—before him as to-day.
He who is leaving the stage feels that he has only begun, and must
leave his successors with more to do than his predecessors left him.

To us an interesting feature of this progress is the part taken in
it by our own country. The science of our day, it is true, is of no
country. Yet we very appropriately speak of American science from
the fact that our traditional reputation has not been that of a people
deeply interested in the higher branches of intellectual work. Men
yet living can remember when in the eyes of the universal church
of learning all cisatlantic countries, our own included, were partes
infidelium.

Yet American astronomy is not entirely of our generation. In the
middle of the last century Professor Winthrop, of Harvard, was an
industrious observer of eclipses and kindred phenomena, whose work
was recorded in the transactions of learned societies. But the greatest
astronomical activity during our colonial period was that called out
by the transit of Venus in 1769, which was visible in this country. A
committee of the American Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia,
organized an excellent systems of observations, which we now know
to have been fully as successful, perhaps more so, than the majority of
those made on other continents, owing mainly to the advantages of air
and climate. Among the observers was the celebrated Rittenhouse,
to whom is due the distinction of having been the first American
astronomer whose work has an important place in the history of the
science. In addition to the observations which he has left us, he was
the first inventor or proposer of the collimating telescope, an instru-
ment which has become almost a necessity wherever accurate observa-
tions are made. The fact that the subsequent invention by Bessel was
quite independent does not detract from the merits of either.

Shortly after the transit of Venus, which I have mentioned, the war
of the Revolution commenced. The generation which carried on that
war and the following one, which framed our Constitution and laid the
bases of our political institutions, were naturally too much oceupied
with these great problems to pay much attention to pure science.
While the great mathematical astronomers of Europe were laying the
foundation of celestial mechanics their writings were a sealed book
to everyone on this side of the Atlantic, and so remained until Bow-
ditch appeared, early in the present century. His translation of the
Mécanique Céleste made an epoch in American science by bringing
the great work of Laplace down to the reach of the best American
students of his time.
90) ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

American astronomers must always honor the names of Rittenhouse
and Bowditch. And yet in one respect their work was disappointing
of results. Neither of them was the founder of a school. Rittenhouse
left no successor to carry on his work. The help which Bowditch
afforded his generation was invaluable to isolated students who, here
and there, dived alone and unaided into the mysteries of the celestial
motions. His work was not mainly in the field of observational astron-
omy, and therefore did not materially influence that branch of science.
In 1832 Professor Airy, afterwards astronomer royal of England, made a
report to the British Association on the condition of practical astronomy
in various countries. In this report he remarked that he was unable to
say anything about American astronomy because, so far as he knew,
no public observatory existed in the United States.

William C. Bond, afterwards famous as the first director of Harvard
Observatory, was at that time making observations with a small tele-
scope, first near Boston and afterwards at Cambridge. But with so
meager an outfit his establishment could scarcely lay claim to being
an astronomical observatory, and it was not surprising if Airy did not
know anything of his modest efforts.

If at this time Professor Airy had extended his investigations into
yet another field, with a view of determining the prospects for a great
city at the site of Fort Dearborn, on the southern shore of Lake
Michigan, he would have seen as little prospect of civic growth in that
region as of a great development of astronomy in the United States at
large. <A plat of the proposed town of Chicago had been prepared
two years before, when the place contained perhaps half a dozen fami-
lies. Inthe same month in which Professor Airy made his report,
August, 1832, the people of the place, then numbering 28 voters,
decided to become incorporated, and selected five trustees to carry on
their government.

In 1837 a city charter was obtained from the legislature of Illinois.
The growth of this infant city, then small even for an infant, into the
great commercial metropolis of the West has been the just pride of
its people and the wonder of the world. I mention it now because of
a remarkable coincidence. With this civic growth has quietly gone on
another, little noted by the great world, and yet in its way equally
wonderful and equally gratifying to the pride of those who measure
greatness by intellectual progress. If it be true that—

In Nature nothing is great but man; in man nothing is great but mind—

then may knowledge of the universe be regarded as the true measure
of progress. I therefore invite attention to the fact that American
astronomy began with your city and has slowly but surely kept pace
with it until to-day our country stands second only to Germany in the
number of researches being prosecuted and second to none in the num-
ber of men who have gained the highest recognition by their labors.
In 1836 Prof. Albert Hopkins, of Williams College, and Prof. Elias
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 91

Loomis, of Western Reserve College, Ohio, both commenced little
observatories. Professor Loomis went to Europe for all his instruments,
but Hopkins was able even then to get some of his in this country.
Shortly afterwards a little wooden structure was erected by Captain
Gilliss on Capitol Hill, at Washington, and supplied with a transit
instrument for observing moon culminations, in conjunction with Cap-
tain Wilkes, who was then setting out on his exploring expedition to
the Southern Hemisphere. The date of these observatories was prac-
tically the same as that on which a charter for the city of Chicago was
obtained from the legislature. With their establishment the popula-
tion of your city had increased to 703.

The next decade, 1840 to 1850, was that in which our practical
astronomy seriously commenced. The little observatory of Captain
Gilliss was replaced by the Naval Observatory, erected at Washington
during the years 1843-44 and fitted out with what were then the most
approved instruments. About the same time the appearance of the
great comet of 1843 led the citizens of Boston to erect the observatory
of Harvard College. Thus it is little more than a half century since
the two principal observatories in the United States were established.
But we must not for a moment suppose that the mere erection of an
observatory can mark an epoch in scientific history. What must make
the decade of which I speak ever memorable in American astronomy
was not merely the erection of buildings, but the character of the work
done by astronomers away from them as well as in them.

The Naval Observatory very soon became famous by two remarkable
steps which raised our country to an important position among those
applying modern science to practical uses. One of these consisted of
the researches of Sears Cook Walker on the motion of the newly dis-
covered planet Neptune. He was the first astronomer to determine
fairly good elements of the orbit of that planet, and, what is yet more
remarkable, he was able to trace back the movement of the planet in
the heavens for half a century and to show that it had been observed
as a fixed star by Lalande in 1795, without the observer having any
suspicion of the true character of the object.

The other work to which I refer was the application to astronomy
and to the determination of longitudes of the chronographic method
of registering transits of stars or other phenomena requiring an exact
record of the instant of their occurrence. It is to be regretted that
the history of this application has not been fully written. In some
points there seems to be as much obscurity as with the discovery of
ether as an anesthetic, which took place about the same time. Hap-
pily no such contest has been fought over the astronomical as over the
surgical discovery, the fact being that all who were engaged in the
application of the new method were more anxious to perfect it than
they were to get credit for themselves. We know that Saxton, of the
Coast Survey; Mitchell and Locke, of Cincinnati; Bond, at Cambridge,
92 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

as well as Walker and other astronomers at the Naval Observatory, all
worked at the apparatus; that Maury seconded their efforts with untir-
ing zeal; that it was used to determine the longitude of Baltimore as
early as 1844 by Captain Wilkes, and thatit was put into practical use
in recordin ¢ observations at the Naval Observatory as early as 1846.

At the Cambridge Observatory the two Bonds, father and son,
speedily began to show the stuff of which the astronomer is made. <A
well-devised system of observations was put in operation. The discoy-
ery of the dark ring of Saturn and of a new satellite to that planet
gave additional fame to the establishment.

Nor was activity confined to the cbservational side of the science.
The same decade of which I speak was marked by the beginning of
Professor Pierce’s mathematical work, especially his determination of
the perturbations of Uranus and Neptune. At this time commenced
the work of Dr. B. A. Gould, who soon became the leading figure in
American astronomy. Immediately on graduating at Harvard in 1845,
he determined to devote all the energies of his life to the prosecution
of his favorite science. He studied in Europe for three years, took the
doctor’s degree at Gottingen, came home, founded the Astronomical
Journal, and took an active part in that branch of the work of the
Coast Survey which included the determination of longitudes by astro-
nomical methods.

An episode which may not belong to the history of astronomy must
be acknowledged to have had a powerful influence in exciting public
interest in that science. Prof. O. M. Mitchell, the founder and first
director of the Cincinnati Observatory, made the masses of our intelli-
gent people acquainted with the leading facts of astronomy by courses
of lectures which, in lucidity and eloquence, have never been excelled.
Theimmediate object of the lectures was toraise funds for establishing his
observatory and fitting it out with a fine telescope. The popular interest
thus excited in the science had an important effect in leading the public
to support astronomical research. If public support, based on pub-
lic interest, is what has made the present fabric of American astronomy
possible, then should we honor the name of a man whose enthusiasm
leavened the masses of his countrymen with interest in our science.

The civil war naturally exerted a depressing influence upon our sci- ©
entific activity. The cultivator of knowledge is no less patriotic than
his fellow citizens, and vies with them in devotion to the public-welfare.
The active interest which such cultivators took, first in the prosecution
of the war and then in the restoration of the union, naturally distracted
their attention from their favorite pursuits. But no sooner was politi-
cal stability reached than a wave of intellectual activity set in, which has
gone on increasing up to the present time. If it be true that never
before in our history has so much attention been given to education as
now; that never before did so many men devote themselves to the dif-
fusion of knowledge, it is no less true that never was astronomical work
so energetically pursued among us as now.
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 93

One deplorable result of the civil war was that Gould’s Astronomical
Journal had to be suspended. Shortly after the restoration of peace,
instead of reestablishing the journal, its founder conceived the project
of exploring the southern heavens. The northern hemisphere being
the seat of civilization, that portion of the sky which could not be
seen from our latitudes was comparatively neglected. What had been
done in the southern hemisphere was mostly the occasional work of
individuals and of one or two permanent observatories. The latter
were so few in number and so meager in their outfit that a splendid
field was open to the inquirer. Gould found the patron which he
desired in the government of the Argentine Republic, on whose terri-
tory he erected what must rank in the future as one of the memorable
astronomical establishments of the world. His work affords a most
striking example of the principle that the astronomer is more impor-
tant than his instruments. Not only were the means at the command of
the Argentine Observatory slender in the extreme when compared with
those of the favored institutions of the North, but, from the very
nature of the case, the Argentine Republic could not supply trained
astronomers. The difficulties thus growing out of the administration
can not be overestimated. And yet the sixteen great volumes in
which the work of the institution has been published will rank in the
future among the classics of astronomy.

Another wonderful focus of activity, in which one hardly knows
whether he ought most to admire the exhaustless energy or the admir-
able ingenuity which he finds displayed, is the Harvard Observatory.
Its work has been aided by gifts which have no parallel in the liberal-
ity that prompted them. Yet without energy and skill such gifts
would have been useless. The activity of the establishment includes
both hemispheres. Time would fail to tell how it has not only mapped
out important regions of the heavens from the north to the south pole,
but analyzed the rays of light which come from hundreds of thousands
of stars by recording their spectra in permanence on photographic
plates.

The work of the establishment is so organized that a new star can
‘not appear in any part of the heavens nor a known star undergo any
noteworthy change without immediate detection by the photographic
eye of one or more little telescopes, all-seeing and never sleeping police-
men that scan the heavens unceasingly while the astronomer may
Sleep, and report in the morning every case of irregularity in the pro-
ceedings of the heavenly bodies.

Yet another example, showing what great results may be obtained
with limited means, is afforded by the Lick Observatory, on Mount
Hamilton, Cal. During the ten years of its activity its astronomers
have made it known the world over by works and discoveries too varied
and numerous to be even mentioned at the present time.

The astronomical work of which I have thus far spoken has been
almost entirely that done at observatories. I fear that I may in this
94 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

way have strengthened an erroneous impression that the seat of impor-
tant astronomical work is necessarily connected with an observatory. —
It must be admitted that an institution which has a local habitation
and a magnificent building commands public attention so strongly that
valuable work done elsewhere may be overlooked. A very important
part of astronomical work is done away from telescopes and meridian
circles and requires nothing but a good library for its prosecution.
One who is devoted to this side of the subject may often feel that the
public does not appreciate his work at its true relative value from the
very fact that he has no great buildings or fine instruments to show. I
may therefore be allowed to claim as an important factor in the Ameri-
can astronomy of the last half century an institution of which few have
heard and which has been overlooked because there was nothing about
it to excite attention.

In 1849 the American Nautical Almanae office was established by a
Congressional appropriation. The title of this publication is somewhat
misleading in suggesting a simple enlargement of the family almanac
which the sailor is to hang up in his cabin for daily use. The fact is
that what started more than a century ago as a nautical almanac has
since grown into an astronomical ephemeris for the publication of
everything pertaining to times, seasons, eclipses, and the motions of
the heavenly bodies. It is the work in which astronomical observa-
tions made in all the great observatories of the world are ultimately
utilized for scientific and public purposes. Each of the leading nations
of western Europe issues such a publication. When the preparation
and publication of the American ephemeris was decided upon the office
was first established in Cambridge, the seat of Harvard University,
because there could most readily be secured the technical knowledge
of mathematics and theoretical astronomy necessary for the work.

A field of activity was thus opened, of which a number of able young
men who have since earned distinction in various walks of life availed
themselves. ‘The head of the office, Commander Davis, adopted a policy
well fitted to promote their development: He translated the classic
work of Gauss, Theoria Motus Corporum Crelestium, and made the
office a sort of informal school, not, indeed, of the modern type, but
rather more like the classic grove of Hellas, where philosophers con-
ducted their discussions and profited by mutual attrition. When, after
a few years of experience, methods were well established and a routine
adopted, the office was removed to Washington, where it has since
remained. The work of preparing the ephemeris has, with experience,
been reduced to a matter of routine which may be continued indefi-
nitely, with occasional changes in methods and data and improvements
to meet the increasing wants of investigators.

The mere preparation of the ephemeris includes but a small part
of the work of mathematical calculation and investigation required
in astronomy. One of the great wants of the science to-day is the
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. e)

rereduction of the observations made during the first half of the present
century, and even during the last half of the preceding one. The labor
which could profitably be devoted to this work would be more than that
required in any one astronomical observatory. It is unfortunate for this
work that a great building is not required for its prosecution because
its needfulness is thus very generally overlooked by that portion of the
public interested in the progress of science. An organization especially
devoted to it is one of the scientific needs of our time.

In such an epoch-making age as the present it is dangerous to cite
any one step as making a new epoch. Yet it may be that when the
historian of the future reviews the science of our day he will find the
most remarkable feature of the astronomy of the last twenty years of
our century to be the discovery that this steadfast earth of which the
poets have told us is not after all quite steadfast; that the north and
south poles move about a very little, describing curves so complicated
that they have not yet been fully marked out. The periodic variations
of latitude thus brought about were first suspected about 1880, and
announced with some modest assurance by Kiistner, of Berlin, a few
years later. The progress of the views of astronomical opinion from
incredulity to confidence was extremely slow until, about 1890, Chan-
dler, of the United States, by an exhaustive discussion of innumerable
results of observations, showed that the latitude of every point on the
earth was subject to a double oscillation, one having a period of a year,
the other of four hundred and twenty-seven days.

Notwithstanding the remarkable parallel between the growth of
American astronomy and that of your city, one can not but fear that
if a foreign observer had been asked only half a dozen years ago at
what point in the United States a great school of theoretical and praec-
tical astronomy. aided by an establishment for the exploration of the
heavens, was likely to be established by the munificence of private
citizens, he would have been wiser than most foreigners had he guessed
Chicago. Had this place been suggested to him, I fear he would have
replied that were it possible to utilize celestial knowledge in acquir-
ing earthly wealth, here would be the most promising seat for such
a school. But he would need to have been a little wiser than his
generation to reflect that wealth is at the base of all progress in knowl-
edge and the liberal arts; that it is only when men are relieved from
the necessity of devoting all their energies to the immediate wants of
life that they can lead intellectual lives, and that we should therefore
look to the most enterprising commercial center as the likeliest seat
for a great scientific institution. :

Now we have the school, and we have the observatory, which we hope
will in the near future do work that will cast luster on the name of its
founder as well as on the astronomers who may be associated with it.
You will, I am sure, pardon me if I make some suggestions on the subject
of the future needs of the establishment. We want this newly founded
96 ASPECTS OF AMERICAN AS'TRONOMY.

institution to be a great success, to do work which shall show that
the intellectual productiveness of your community will not be allowed
to lag behind its material growth. The public is very apt to feel that
when some munificent patron of science has mounted a great telescope
under a suitable dome, and supplied all the apparatus which the
astronomer wants to use, success is assured. But such is not the case.
The most important requisite, one more difficult to command than tele-
scopes or observatories, may still be wanting. <A great telescope is of
no use without a man at the end of it, and what the telescope may do
depends more upon this appendage than upon the instrument itself.
The place which telescopes and observatories have taken in astronom-
ical history are by no means proportional to their dimensions. Many a
great instrument has been a mere toy in the hands of its owner. Many
a small one has become famous.

Twenty years ago there was here in your own city a modest little
instrument which, judged by its size, could not hold up its head with
the great ones even of that day. It was the private property of a
young man holding no scientific position and scarcely known to the
public. And yet that little telescope is to-day among the famous ones
of the world, having made memorable advances in the astronomy of
double stars, and shown its owner to be a worthy successor of the
Herschels and Struves in that line of work.

A hundred observers might have used the appliances of the Lick
Observatory for a whole generation without finding the fifth satellite of
Jupiter; without successfully photographing the cloud forms of the
Milky Way; without discovering the extraordinary patches of nebu-
lous light, nearly or quite invisible to the human eye, which fill some
regions of the heavens. :

When I was in Zurich last year I paid a visit to the little but not
unknown observatory of its famous polytechnic school. The professor
of astronomy was especially interested in the observations of the sun
with the aid of the spectroscope, and among the ingenious devices
which he described, not the least interesting was the method of photo-
graphing the sun by special rays of the spectrum, which had been
worked out at the Kenwood Observatory in Chicago. The Kenwood
Observatory is not, I believe, in the eye of the public one of the note-
worthy institutions of your city which every visitor is taken to see, and
yet this invention has given it an important place in the science of our
day.

Should you ask me what are the most hopeful features in the great
establishment which you are now dedicating, I would say that they are
not alone to be found in the size of your unequaled telescope, nor in
the cost of the outfit, but in the fact that your authorities have shown
their appreciation of the requirements of success by adding to the
material outfit of the establishment the three men whose works I have
described.

Gentlemen of the Trustees, allow me to commend to your fostering
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. Di,

eare the men at the end of the telescope. The constitution of the
astronomer shows curious and interesting features. If he is destined
to advance the science by works of real genius, he must, like the poet,
be born, not made. The born astronomer, when placed in command
of a telescope, goes about using it as naturally and effectively as the
babe avails itself of its mother’s breast. He sees intuitively what less
gifted men have to learn by long study and tedious experiment. He is
moved to celestial knowledge by a passion which dominates his nature.
He can no more avoid doing astronomical work, whether in the line of
observations or research, than a poet can chain his Pegasus to earth.
I donot mean by this that education and training will be no use to
him. They will certainly accelerate his early progress. If he is to
become great on the mathematical side, not only must his genius have
a bend in that direction, but he must have the means of pursuing his
studies. And yet I have seen so many failures of men who had the
best instruction, and so many successes of men who scarcely learned
anything of their teachers, that I sometimes ask whether the great
American celestial mechanician of the twentieth century will be a
graduate of a university or of the back woods.

Is the man thus moved to the exploration of nature by an uncon-
querable passion more to be envied or pitied? In no other pursuit
does success come with such certainty to him who deserves it. No life

is So enjoyable as that whose energies are devoted to following out the
inborn impulses of one’s nature. The investigator of truth is little
subject to the disappointments which await the ambitious man in other
fields of activity. It is pleasant to be one of a brotherhood extending
over the world, in which no rivalry exists except that which comes out
of trying to do better work than anyone else, while mutual admiration
stifles jealousy. And yet, with all these advantages, the experience of
the astronomer may have its dark side. As he sees his field widening
faster than he can advance he is impressed with the littleness of all
that can be done in one short life. He feels the same want of succes-
sors to pursue his work that the founder of a dynasty may feel for
heirs to occupy his throne. He has no desire to figure in history as a
Napoleon of science whose conquests must terminate with his life.
Even during his active career his work may be of such a kind as to
require the cooperation of others and the active support of the public.
If he is disappointed in commanding these requirements, if he finds
neither cooperation nor support, if some great scheme to which he may
have devoted much of his life thus proves to be only a castle in the
air, he may feel that nature has dealt hardly with him in not enduwing
him with passions like to those of other men. ;

In treating a theme of perennial interest one naturally tries to fancy
what the future may have in store. If the traveler, contemplating the
ruins of some ancient city which in the long ago teemed with the life
and activities of generations of men, sees every stone instinct with

emotion and the dust alive with memories of the past, may he not be
similarly impressed when he feels that he is looking around upon a
seat of future empire—a region where generations yet unborn may take
a leading part in molding the history of the world? What may we
not expect of that energy which in sixty years has transformed a
straggling village into one of the world’s great centers of commerce?
May it not exercise a powerful influence on the destiny not only of the
country but of the world? If so, shall the power thus to be exercised
prove an agent of beneficence, diffusing light and life among nations,
or shall it be the opposite?

The time must come ere long when wealth shall outgrow the field in
which it can be profitably employed. In what direction shall its
possessors then look? Shail they train a posterity which will so use
its power as to make the world better that it has lived in it? Will the
future heir to great wealth prefer the intellectual life to the life of
pleasure?

We can have no more hopeful answer to these questions than the
establishment of this great university in the very focus of the commer-
cial activity of the West. Its connection with the institution we have
been dedicating suggests some thoughts on science as a factor in that
scheme of education best adapted to make the power of a wealthy
community a benefit to the race at large. When we see what a factor
science has been in our present civilization, how it has transformed
the world and increased the means of human enjoyment by enabling
men to apply the powers of nature to their own uses, it is not wonderful
that it should claim the place in education hitherto held by classical
studies. In the contest which has thus arisen I take no part but that
of a peacemaker, holding that it is as important to us to keep in touch
with the traditions of our race, and to cherish the thoughts which have
come down to us through the centuries, as it is to enjoy and utilize
what the present has to offer us. Speaking from this point of view, I
would point out the error of making the utilitarian applications of
knowledge the main object in its pursuit. It is an historic fact that
abstract science—science pursued without any utilitarian end—has been
at the base of our progress in the utilization of knowledge. If in the
last century such men as Galvani and Volta had been moved by any
other motive than love of penetrating the secrets of nature they would
never have pursued the seemingly useless experiments they did, and
the foundation of electrical science would not have been laid. Our
present applications of electricity did not become possible until Ohm’s
mathematical laws of the electric current, which when first made
known seemed little more than mathematical curiosities, had become
the common property of inventors. Professional pride on the part of
our own Henry led him, after making the discoveries which rendered
the telegraph possible, to go no further in their application, and to live
and die without receiving a dollar of the millions which the country
has won through his agency.
ASPECTS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 99

In the spirit of scientific progress thus shown we have patriotism in
its highest form—a sentiment which does not seek to benefit the coun-
try at the expense of the world, but to benefit the world by means of
one’s country. Science has its competition, as keen as that which is
the life of commerce. But its rivalries are over the question who shall
contribute the most and the best to the sum total of knowledge; who
shall give the most, not who shall take the most. Its animating spirit
is love of truth. Its pride is to do the greatest good to the greatest
number. It embraces not only the whole human race but all nature
in its scope. The public spirit of which this city is the focus has made
the desert blossom as the rose, and benefited humanity by the diffusion
of the material products of the earth. Should you ask me how it is in
the future to use its influence for the benefit of humanity at large, I
would say, look at the work now going on in these precincts, and study
its spirit. Here are the agencies which will make ‘the voice of law
the harmony of the world.” Here is the love of country blended with
love of the race. Here the love of knowledge is as unconfined as your
commercial enterprise. Let not your youth come hither merely to
learn the forms of vertebrates and the properties of oxides, but rather
to imbibe that catholic spirit which, animating their growing energies,
shall make the power they are to wield an agent of beneficence to all
mankind.
THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY!

By EDWARD S. HOLDEN.

It is impossible, even in the briefest sketch, not to emphasize the
debt of American science and learning to the intelligent interest and
patronage of our early Presidents— Washington, John Adams, Jeffer-
son, Madison, Monroe, John Quincy Adams. The powerful impetus
given by them and through them has shaped the liberal policy of our
governments, National and State, toward education and toward science.
Sir Lyon Playfair, in his address to the British Association for the
Advancement of Science (1885) has recognized this influence in the
truest and most graceful way. He said: ‘“‘In the United Kingdom we
are just beginning to understand the wisdom of Washington’s Farewell
Address to his countrymen (1796) when he said: ‘Promote then, as an
object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives
force to publie opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be
enlightened.’ ”

Until the Revolution (1776) American science was but English science
transplanted, and it looked to the Royal Society of London as its cen-
sor and patron. Winthrop, Franklin, and Rittenhouse were, more or
less, English astronomers. Franklin was the sturdiest American of
the three. As early as 1743 he suggested the formation of the Ameri-
ean Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. John Adams founded the |
American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston in 1780. These
two societies, together with Harvard College (founded in 1636), Yale
College (1701), the University of Virginia (founded by Jefferson in
1825), and the United States Military Academy at West Point (1801),
were the chief foci from which the light of learning spread. Other
colleves were formed or forming all over the Eastern and Middle States
during the early years of the century.

The leading school of pure science was the Military Academy at
West Point, and it continued to hold this place until the civil war of
1861. From its corps of professors and students it gave two chiefs to
the United States Coast Survey; and the Army, particularly the Corps
of Engineers, provided many observers to that scientific establishinent,

besides furnishing a large number of professors and teachers of science
to the colleges of the country. The observatory of the academy was
founded by Bartlett in 1841, and much work was done there, only a
small part of which is published. The Coast Survey was a school of
practice for army officers, and their experience was utilized in numer-
ous boundary surveys during the period 1830-1850. Col. J. D. Graham,
for example, was astronomer of the survey of the boundary between
Texas and the United States in 1839-40; commissioner of the Northeast
boundary survey, 1840-1843; astronomer of the Northwest boundary
survey, 1843-1847; of the boundary between the United States and
Canada, 1848-1850; of the survey of the boundary between Pennsyl-
vania and Virginia, 1849-50; of the boundary survey between Mexico
and the United States, 1850-51. The names of Bonneville, Talcott,
Cram, Emory, and other army officers are familiar in this connection,
and their work was generally of a high order. It was in such service
that Talcott invented or reinvented the zenith telescope, now univer-
sally employed for all delicate determinations of latitude. The me-
chanical taet of Americans has served astronomy well. The sextant
was invented by Thomas Godfray, of Philadelphia, in 1730, a year
before Hadley brought forward his proposal for such an instrument.!
The chronograph of the Bonds, the zenith telescope of Talcott, and
the break-cireuit chronometer of Winlock are universally used to-day.
The diffraction gratings of Rutherfurd were the best to be had in the
world till they were replaced by those of Rowland. The use of a tele-
scope as a collimator was first proposed by Rittenhouse. The pioneer
opticians of the United States were Holcomb (1826), Fitz (1846 or
earlier), Clark (1845), Spencer (1851). Only the Clarks have a world-
wide reputation. Wiirdemann, instrument maker to the United States
Coast Survey (1834), had a decided influence on observers and instru-
ment makers throughout the United States, as he introduced extreme
German methods and models among us, where extreme English methods
had previously prevailed. The system of rectangular land surveys,
which proved to be so convenient for the public lands east of the Rocky
Mountains, was devised and executed by Mansfield, a graduate of the
Military Academy.

The list of army officers who became distinguished in civil life as
professors in the colleges of the country is a very long one. Courtenay
(class of 1821 at West Point) was professor of mathematics at the
University of Pennsylvania, 1834-1836; at the University of Virginia,
1842-43, and was the author of admirable text-books. Norton (class
of 1831) became professor at New Haven, and wrote a very useful text-
book of astronomy in 1839; and the list could be much extended. The
excellent training in mathematics at West Point (chiefly in French

‘In 1700 Sir Isaac Newton sent drawings and descriptions of a reflecting sextant
to Hadley for his advice. At Hadley’s: death these were found among his papers.
Hadley’s device (1731) was undoubtedly derived from Newton’s MSS. The Royal
Society of London granted £200 to Godfray for his invention, which his brother,
Captain Godfray, had previously put into practical use in the West Indies.
THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 103

methods) early made itself felt throughout the whole country. The
mathematical text-books of Peirce, of Harvard, and of Chauvenet, of
the Naval Academy, brought the latest learning of Europe to American
students. Mitchell (class of 1829 at West Point) was the only gradu-
ate who became a professional astronomer (1842-1861). His direct
service to practical observing astronomy is small, but his lectures
(1842-1848), the conduct of the Cincinnati observatory (1845-1859), and
his publication of the Sidereal Messenger (1546-1848), together with
his popular books, excited an intense and widespread public interest
in the science, and indirectly led to the foundation of many observa-
tories. He was early concerned in the matter of using the electric
current for longitude determinations, and his apparatus was only dis-
placed because of the superior excellence of the chrouograph devised
by the Bonds. His work was done under immense disadvantages, in a
new community (Ohio), but the endowment of astronomical research in
America owes a large debt to his energy and efforts.

The Navy and the United States Naval Academy (founded by Ban-
croft in 1845, at the suggestion of Chauvenet) were very active in astro-
nomical work. Chauvenet (Yale College, 1840) published a text-book
of trigonometry in 1850, which had an important share in directing
attention to rigid, elegant, and general methods of research. His
astronomy (1863) is a handbook for all students. Walker, Gilliss,
Coffin, Hubbard, Ferguson, Keith, Yarnall, Winlock, Maury, Wilkes,
were all connected with the Navy, more or less intimately. Walker’s
career was especially brilliant; he graduated at Harvard College in
1825, and established the observatory of the Philadelphia High School
in 1840. He was the leading spirit in the United States Naval Observ-
atory at Washington (1845-1847) and introduced modern methods into
its practice at the beginning. From the observatory he went to the
Coast Survey to take charge of its longitude operations, and he contin-
ued to direct and expand this department until his death, in 1855. To
him, more than to any single person, is due the idea of the telegraphic
method (“the American method”) of determining differences of longi-
tude. His assistant in this work was Gould, who succeeded to the
charge of it in 1853. His researches extended to the field of mathe-
matical astronomy also, and his theory of the planet Neptune (then
newly discovered) marks an important step forward. His investiga-
tions and those of Peirce were conducted in concert and attracted gen-
eral and deserved attention.

The exploring expedition of Wilkes required corresponding observa-
tions to be made in America, and during the period 1838-1842 William
Bond, at Dorchester, and Lieutenant Gilliss, at Washington, main-
- tained such a series with infinite assiduity and with success. The
results of Gilliss’ astronomical expedition to the southern hemisphere
(Chile, 1849-1852) were most creditable to him and to the Navy, though
his immediate object—the determination of the solar parallax—was not
attained.
104 THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

The Coast Survey began its work in 1817 under Hassler, a professor
from West Point, who impressed upon the establishment a thoroughly
scientific direction. Bache, his successor (a grandson of Benjamin
Franklin), was a graduate of West Point in the class of 1825, and took
charge of the Survey in 1843. He is the true father of the institution,
and gave it the practical efficiency and high standard which character-
ized its work. He called around him the flower of the Army and Navy,
and was ably seconded by the permanent corps of civilian assistants—
Walker, Saxton, Gould, Dean, Blunt, Pourtales, Boutelle, Hilgard,
Schott, Goodfellow, Cutts, Davidson, and others.

Silliman’s (and Dana’s) American Journal of Science had been
founded at New Haven in 1818, and served as a medium of communica-
tion among scientific men. A great step forward was made in the
establishment of the Astronomical Journal by Dr. Gould on his return
from Europe at the close of 1849.1 Silliman’s Journal was chiefly con-
cerned in the nonmathematical sciences, though it has always con-
tained valuable papers on mathematics, astronomy, and physics,
especially from the observers of Yale College—OlImsted, Herrick, Brad-
ley, Norton, Newton, Lyman, and others. In Mason, who died in 1840
at the age of 21, the country lost a practical astronomer of the highest
promise.’ Gould’s Journal was an organ devoted to a special science.
It not only gave a convenient means of prompt publication, but it
immediately quickened research and helped to enforce standards
already established and to form new ones. The Astronomical Notices
of Briinnow (1858-1862) might have been an exceedingly useful
journal with an editor who was willing to give more attention to
details, but, in spite of Briinnow’s charming personality and great
ability, it had comparatively little influence on the progress of the
science.

The translation of the Mécanique Céleste of Laplace by Nathaniel
Bowditch, the superecargo of a Boston ship (1815-1817), marks the
beginning of an independent mathematical school in America. The
first volume of the translation appeared in 1829. At that time there
were not more than two or three persons in the country who could read
it critically. The works of the great mathematicians and astronomers
of France and Germany—Laplace, Lagrange, Legendre, Olbers, Gauss,
W. Struve, Bessel—were almost entirely unknown.

Bowditch’s translation of the Mécanique Céleste, and, still more, his
extended commentary, brought this monumental work to the attention
of students and within their grasp. His Practical Navigator" contained

*First edition, 1802. Sumner’s method in navigation (1843)—a very original and
valuable contribution from a Boston sea captain—and Maury’s Wind and Current
Charts, begun in 1844, are two other notable contributions from a young country to
an art as old as commerce.

THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 105

the latest and best methods for determining the position of a ship at
sea, expressed in simple rules. American navigators had no superiors
in the first half of this century. Nantucket whalers covered the
Pacific, Salem ships swarmed in the Indies, and the clipper ships made
passages round the Horn to San Francisco, which are a wonder to-day.
Part of their success is due to the bold enterprise of their captains
(who were said to carry deck loads of studding-sail booms to replace
those carried away!), but an important part depended on their skill as
observers with the sextant. One of the sister ships to the one of which
Bowditch was supercargo was visited at Genoa by a European astron-
omer of note (Baron de Zach), who found that the latest methods of
working lunar distances to determine the longitude were known to all
on board, sailors as well as officers. His bewilderment reached its
climax when the navigator called the negro cook from tbe galley and
bade him expound the methods of determining the longitude to the
distinguished visitor.

On Bowditch’s own ship there was ‘a crew of twelve men, every one
of whom could take and work a lunar observation as well, for all prae-
tical purposes, as Sir Isaac Newton himself.” Such crews were only to
be found on American ships in the palmy days of democracy. All were
cousins or neighbors and each had a “venture” in the voyage. But
these anecdotes may serve as illustrations of the intellectual awakening
which came about as soon as our young country was relieved from the
pressure of the two wars of 1776 and 1812. An early visitor, Baron
Hyde de Neuville (1805) felt ‘an unknown something in the air,” “a
new wind blowing.” This new spirit, born of freedom, entered first
into practical life, as was but natural; science next felt its impulse,
and, last of all, literature was born. Emerson hailed it (in 1837) ‘as the
sign of an indestructible instinct.” ‘Perhaps the time has already
come,” he says, ‘ when the sluggard intellect of this country will look
from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectation of the world
with something better than the exertions of mechanical skill. Our day
of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands,
draws toa close. The millions that around us are rushing into life
can not always be fed with the sere remains of foreign harvests.” —°

Benjamin Peirce, a graduate of Harvard in the elass of 1829, had
been concerned with the translation of the Mécanique Céleste, and was
early familiar with the best mathematical thought of HKurope. He
became professor in Harvard College in 1835, and, after the death of
Bowditch in 1838, he was easily the first mathematical astronomer in
the country. His instruction was precisely fitted to develop superior
intelligences, and this was his prime usefulness. Just such a man was
needed at that time. Besides his theoretical researches on the orbits
of the planets (specially Uranus and Neptune) and of the moon, his
study of the theory of perturbations, and his works on pure mathe-
matics and mechanics, he concerned himself with questions of practical
106 THR BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

astronomy, although the observations upon which he depended were
the work of others. He was the consulting astronomer of the American
Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac from its foundation in 1849, and its
plans were shaped by him to an important degree. His relative, Lieu-
tenant Davis, United States Navy (the translator of Gauss’s Theoria
Motus Corporum Coelestium (1857) ), was placed in charge of the
Ephemeris, and the members of its staff—Runkle, Ferrel, Wright,
Newcomb, Winlock, and others—most effectively spread its exact
methods by example and precept. Professor Peirce undertook the eal-
culations relating to the sun, Mars, and Uranus in the early volumes of
the Ephemeris. As a compliment to her sex, Miss Maria Mitchell was
charged with those of Venus; Mercury was computed by Winlock,
Jupiter by Kendall, Saturn by Downes, Neptune by Sears Walker.

The Smithsonian Institution was founded in 1846, and Joseph Henry
was called from Princeton College to direct it. There never was a
wiser choice. His term of service (1846-1878) was so long that his
ideals became firmly fixed within the establishment and were impressed
upon his contemporaries and upon a host of younger men. The interests
of astronomy were served by the encouragement of original research
through subsidies and otherwise, by the purchase of instruments for
scientific expeditions, by the free exchange of scientific books between
America and Europe, and by the publication of the results of recondite
investigations. It is by these and like services that the Institution is
known and valued among the wide community of scientific men through-
out the world.

But this enumeration of specific benefits does not convey an adequate
idea of the immense influence exercised by the Institution upon the
scientific ideals of the country. It was of the first importance that
the beginnings of independent investigation among Americans should
be directed toward right ends and by high and unselfish aims. In the
formation of a scientific and, as it were, a moral standard a few names
will ever be remembered among us, and no one will stand higher than
that of Henry. His wise, broad, and generous policy and his hign per-
sonal ideals were of immense service to his colleagues and to the
country.

The establishment of a National Observatory in Washington was
proposed by John Quincy Adams in 1825, but it was not until 1544
that the United States Naval Observatory was built by Lieutenant
Gilliss, of the Navy, from plans which he had prepared. By what seems
to have been an injustice Gilliss was not appointed to be its first
director.! This place fell to Lieut. M. F. Maury. Gilliss had been on
detached service for some years, and a rigid construction of rules
required that he should be sent to sea, and not remain to Jaunch the
institution which he had built and equipped.

The first Gusts of observers at Washington Se contained men of

THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY. 107

first-class ability—Walker, Hubbard, Coffin. Gilliss’s work as astron-
omer to Wilkes Exploring Expedition (1838-1842) at his little observa-
tory on Capitol Hill had shown him to be one of the best of observers,
as well as one of the most assiduous. His study and experience in
planning and building the Naval Observatory had broadened his mind,
To the men just named, with Peirce, Gould, and Chauvenet, and to
their coadjutors and pupils, we owe the introduction of the methods of
Gauss, Bessel, and Struve into the United States, and it is for this
reason that American astronomy is the child of German and not of
English science.

The most natural evolution might seem to have been for Americans
to follow the English practice of Maskelyne and Pond. But the break
caused by the War of Independence, by the War of 1812, and by the
years necessary for our youthful governments to consolidate (1776-1836)
allowed our young men of science to make a perfectly unbiased choice
of masters. The elder Bond (William Cranch Bond, born 1789, director
of Harvard College Observatory, 1840-1859) was one of the older school
and received his impetus from British sources during a visit to England
in 1815.

In estimating the place of the elder Bond among scientific men it is
necessary to take into account the circumstances which surrounded
him. He was born in the first year of the French Revolution (1789) ;
he was absolutely self-taught; practically no astronomical work was
done in America before 1833. When Admiral Wilkes was seeking for
coadjutors to prosecute observations in the United States during the
absence of his exploring expedition he was indeed fortunate in finding
two such men as Bond and Gilliss. Their assiduity was beyond praise
and it led each of them to important duties. Bond became the founder
and director of the Observatory of Harvard College, while Gilliss is
the father of the United States Naval Observatory at Washington, as
well as that of Santiago de Chile, the oldest observatory in South
America. Cambridge, though the seat of the most ancient university
in America, was but a village in 1839. The college could afford no
salary to Bond, but only the distinction of a title, ‘‘ Astronomical
Observer to the University,” and the occupancy of the Dana house, in
which his first observatory was established. His work there, as else-
where, was well and faithfully done, and it led the college authorities
to employ him as the astronomer of the splendid observatory which
was opened for work in 1847. At that time the two largest telescopes
in the world were those of the Imperial Observatory of Russia (Poul-
kova) and its companion at Cambridge. Hach of these instruments
has a long and honorable history. Their work has been very different.
Who shall say that one has surpassed the other? We owe to Bond
and his son the discovery of an eighth satellite to Saturn, of the dusky
ring to that planet, the introduction of stellar photography, the inven-
tion of the chronograph by which the electric current is employed in
108 THE BEGINNINGS OF AMERICAN ASTRONOMY.

the registry of observations, the conduct of several chronometrice expe-
ditions between Liverpool and Boston to determine the trans-Atlantic
longitude, and a host of minor discoveries and observations.

Gilliss visited France for study in 1835, before he took up his duties
at Washington. The text-books of Bond and Gilliss were the Astron-
omies of Vince (1797-1808) and of Pearson (1824-1829). The younger
Bond (George Phillips Bond, born 1825, Harvard College 1844, direc-
tor of the Harvard College Observatory 1859-1865) and his contempo-
raries, on the other hand, were firmly grounded in the German methods,
then, as now, the most philosophical and thorough.

It was not until 1850, or later, that it was indispensable for an Ameri-
can astronomer to read the German language and to make use of the
memoirs of Bessel, Encke, and Struve and the text-books of Sawitsch
and Briinnow.! This general acquaintance with the German language
and methods came nearly a generation later in England. The tradi-
tions of Piazzi and Oriani came to America with the Jesuit Fathers of
Georgetown College (1844), of whom Secchi and Sestini are the best
known.

The dates of the foundation of a few observatories of the United
States may be set down here. Those utilized for the observation of
the transit of Venus in 1769 were temporary stations merely. The
first college observatory was that of Chapel Hill, N. C. (1831); Wil-
liams College followed (1836); Hudson Observatory (Ohio) (1838); the
Philadelphia High School (1840); the Dana House Observatory of Har-
vard College (1840); West Point (1841); the United States baval
Observatory (1844); the Georgetown College Observatory (1844); the
Cincinnati Observatory (1845); the new observatory of Harvard Colleg :
(1846); the private observatory of Dr. Lewis M. Rutherfurd in New
York City (1848); the observatory at Ann Arbor (1854); the Dudley
Observatory at Albany (1856); and that of Hamilton College (1856).

These dates and the summary history just given will serve to indicate
the situation of astronomy in the United States during the first half of
the present century. A little attention to the dates will enable the
reader to place an individual or an institution on its proper background.
It must constantly be kept in mind that the whole country was very
young and that public interest in astronomical matters was neither edu-
cated nor very general. The data here set down will have a distinct
value as a contribution to the history of astronomy in America. The
developments of later years have been so amazing that we forget that
the first working observatories were founded so late as 1845.

American science is scarcely more than half a century old. The day
will soon come—it is now here—when we shall look back with wonder
and gratitude to ask who were the men who laid the wide and deep
foundations which already maintain so noble an edifice.

THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES!

By G. H. DARWIN.

ik

The Atlantic Monthly for October, 1897, contains an interesting
paper by Mr. See on ‘“‘ Recent discoveries respecting the origin of the
universe.” In the present article I propose to explain, in greater
detail than the necessary limitations of space permitted him, the
theory which forms the point of departure for his speculations.
Although the natural sequence is thus inverted, it may be hoped that
the postponement of explanation to application will be condoned. In
any case, this article owes its origin to the former one, and it might not
otherwise have been justifiable to expound a theory which was laid
before the scientific world some fifteen years ago in the pages of the
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.’

After the explanation of this theory I have added some comments on
Mr. See’s views. 2

If familiarity does not always breed contempt, yet at least it gener-
ally breeds indifference. This is the case with most of us in regard to
the rise and fall of the tide by the seashore, and so the problem as to
whether the tide will serve conveniently to allow the children to dig
in the sand or search for seaweed looms larger than that presented by
the gigantic forces which now produce only these somewhat insignifi-
cant pulsations of the sea. Yet the tides should call forth in us a
deeper interest—I might almost say an emotion—for, as I shall show,

they are the feeble residue of influences which have probably exercised
‘a predominant control over the history of the earth and the moon since
an indeterminate but remote epoch in the past, and will continue that
control into the distant future.

Newton was the first to prove that the tides are caused by the attrac-
tions of the moon and the sun. It would need much space to explain
fully the manner in which those attractions operate, yet it is possible
to give in a few words a rough sketch of the mode in which the tide-
generating forces arise. It will suffice for this purpose to confine our
attention to the more important of the two bodies, the moon, since the
action of the sun will then follow by parity of reasoning. According to—
the law of universal gravitation, the moon attracts matter which stands
near to her more strongly than that which is more remote. It follows
that the attraction on the ocean, at the side of the earth which is near-
est to the moon must be greater than that exercised on the solid earth
itself. Hence there is a tendency for the sea to depart from its natural
spherical shape, and to bulge outward toward the moon. So far the
matter is simple, but it is perplexing to many that the moon should
apparently repel the water lying on the farther side of the earth. This
action, however, is not due to any ideal repulsion from the moon, but
results from the fact that on the farther side the moon must attract the
solid earth more strongly than she does the water. On the nearer side
the moon pulls the water away from the earth, and on the farther side
she pulls the earth away from the water, thus producing an apparent
repulsion of the water to an extent equal to the attraction on the other
side. In this way there arises a tendency for the ocean to bulge equally
toward and away from the moon, and to assume an egg-like shape, with
the length of the egg pointed toward the moon.

If the whole planet were fluid, instead of being partly fluid and
partly solid, the same tendency would still exist, but the tide-generat-
ing force would have the whole mass of the planet as its field of opera-
tion, instead of merely the superficial ocean. The fact that the earth,
the moon, and the planets are all nearly spherical proves that in early
times they were molten and plastic, and that they assumed their pres-
ent round shape under the influence of gravitation. When the material
of which any planet is formed was semiliquid through heat, its satel-
lites, or at any rate the sun, must have produced tidal oscillations in the
molten rock, just as the sun and the moon now raise tides in our oceans.

Molten rock and molten iron are rather sticky or viscous substances,
and any movement which agitates them must be subject to much fric-
tion. Hven water, which is a very good lubricant, is not entirely free
from friction, and so our present oceanic tides must be influenced by
fluid friction, although to a far less extent than the molten solid just
referred to. Now, all moving systems which are subject to friction
gradually come to rest. <A train will run a long way when the steam is
turned off, but it stops at last, and a fly wheel will continue to spin for
only a limited time. This general law renders it certain that the fric-
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. etalk

tion of the tide, whether it consists in the swaying of molten lava or of
an ocean, must be stopping the rotation of the planet, or at any rate
stopping the motion of the system in some way. .

It is the friction upon its bearings which brings a fly wheel to rest;
but as the earth has no bearings, it is not easy to see how the friction
of the tidal wave, whether corporeal or oceanic, can tend to stop its
rate of rotation. The result must clearly be brought about, in some
way, by the interaction between the moon and the earth. Action and
reaction must be equal and opposite, and if we are correct in supposing
that the friction of the tides is stopping the earth’s rotation, there must
be a reaction upon the moon tending to hurry her onward. To give a
homely illustration of the effects of reaction, I may recall to mind how
aman riding a high bicycle, on applying the brake too suddenly, was
shot over the handles. The desired action was to stop the front wheel,
but this could not be done without a reaction on the rider, which some-
times led to unpleasant consequences.

The general conclusion as to the action: and reaction due to tidal
friction is of so vague a character that it is desirable to consider in
detail how they operate. The circle
in the figure is supposed to represent
the undisturbed shape of the planet, -
which rotates in the direction of the
curved arrow. A portion of the orbit
of the satellite is indicated by part of
a larger circle, and the direction of its
motion is shown by an arrow. I will
first suppose that the water lying on the planet, or the molten rock of
which it is formed, is a perfect lubricant, devoid of friction; and that at
the moment represented in the figure the satellite is at M’. The fluid
will then be distorted by the tidal force until it assumes the egg-like
shape marked by the ellipse, projecting on both sides beyond the circle.
When there is no friction, the long axis of the egg is always directed
straight toward the satellite M’, and the fluid maintains a continuous
rhythmical movement, so that as the planet rotates and the satellite
revolves, it always preserves the same shape and attitude toward the
satellite.

But when, as in reality, the fluid is subject to friction, it gets belated
in its rhythmical rise and fall, and the protuberance is carried onward
by the rotation of the planet beyond its proper place. In order to
make the same figure serve for this condition of affairs, I set the satel-
lite backward to M; for this amounts to just the same thing, and is less
confusing than redrawing the protuberance in its more advanced posi-
tion. The planet then constantly maintains this shape and attitude
with regard to the satellite, and the interaction between the two will
be the same as though the planet were solid, but continually altering
its Shape.

1 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

We have now to examine what effects must follow from the attrac-
tion of the satellite on an egg-shaped planet, when the two bodies con-
stantly maintain the same attitude relatively to each other. It will
make the matter somewhat easier of comprehension if we replace the
tidal protuberances by two particles of equal masses, one at P, and the
other at P’. If the masses of these particles be properly chosen, so as
to represent the amount of matter in the protuberances, the proposed
change will make no material difference in the result.

The gravitational attraction of the satellite is greater on bodies
which are near than on those which are far, and accordingly it attracts
the particle P more strongly than the particle P’.. It is obvious from
the figure that the pull on P must tend to stop the planet’s rotation,
while the pull on P’ must tend to accelerate it. If a man pushes
equally on the two pedals of a bicycle, the crank has no tendency to
turn; and besides, there are dead points in the revolution of the crank
where pushing and pulling have no effect. So also in the astronomical
problem, if the two attractions were exactly equal, or if the protuber-
ances were at a dead point, there would be no resultant effect on the
rotation of the planet. But it is obvious that here the retarding pull
is stronger than the accelerating pull, and that the set of the protuber-
ances is such that we have passed the dead point. It follows from this
that the primary eifect of fluid friction is to throw the tidal protuber-
ance forward, and the secondary effect is to retard the planet’s rotation.

Action and reaction are equal and opposite, and if the satellite pulls
at the protuberances, they pull in return at the satellite. The figure
shows that the attraction of the protuberance P tends in some measure
to hurry the satellite onward in its orbit, while that of P’ tends to
retard it. But the attraction of P is stronger than that of P’, and
therefore the resultant of the two is a force tending to carry the satel-
lite forward more rapidly in the direction of the arrow. When the
satellite is thus influenced, it ust move in aspiral curve, ever inecreas-
ing its distance from the planet. Besides this, the satellite has a longer
path to travel in its circuit, and takes longer to get round the planet,
than was the case before tidal friction began to operate.! 3

Now, let us apply these ideas to the case of the earth and the moon.
A man standing on the planet, as it rotates, is carried past places
where the fluid is deeper and shallower alternately; at the deep places
he says that it is high tide, and at the shallow places that it is low tide.
In the figure it is high tide when the observer is carried past P. Now,

'It is somewhat paradoxical that the effect of attempting to hurry the satellite is
to make it actually move slower. It would be useless to attempt an explanation of
this in such an article as the present one, but the converse case, where a retarding
force acts on the body, may be more intelligible. When a meteorite rushes through
the atmosphere it moves faster and faster, because it gains more velocity by the
direct action of the earth’s gravity on it than it loses by the friction of the air. And
yet it is the friction of the air which allows gravity to have play; so that we have
the paradox of friction accelerating the motion.

THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 113

it was pointed out that when there is no fluid friction we must put the
moon at M’, but when thereis friction she must be at M. Accordingly,
if there is no friction it is high tide when the moon is over the observer’s
head, but when there is fluid friction the moon has passed his zenith
before he reaches high tide. Hence he would remark that fluid friction
retards the time of high water.!

A day is the name for the time in which the earth rotates once, and
a month for the time in which the moon revolves once. Then, since
tidal friction retards the earth’s rotation and the moon’s revolution, we
may state that both the day and the month are being lengthened, and
that these results follow from the retardation in the time of high tide.
It must also be noted that the spiral in which the moon moves is an
increasing one, so that her distance from the earth increases. These
are absolutely certain and inevitable results of the mechanical inter-
action of the two bodies.

At the present time the rates of increase of the day and month are
excessively small, so that it has not been found possible to determine
them with any approach to accuracy. It may be well to notice in
passing that if the rate of change of either element were determinable
that of the other would be deducible by calculation.

The extreme slowness of the changes within historical times is estab-
lished by the records in early Greek and Assyrian history of eclipses
of the sun which occurred on certain days and at certain places. Not-
withstanding the changes in the calendar, it is possible to identify the
day according to our modern reckoning, and the identification of the
place presents no difficulty. Astronomy affords the means of calculat-
ing the exact time and place of the occurrence of an eclipse even three
thousand years ago, on the supposition that the earth spun at the same
rate then as now, and that the complex laws governing the moon’s
motion are unchanged. ‘The particular eclipse referred to in history is
known, but any considerable change in the earth’s rotation and in the
moow’s motion would have shifted the position of visibility on the earth
from the situation to which modern computation would assign it. Most
astronomical observations would be worthless if the exact time of the
occurrence were uncertain, but in the case of eclipses the place of
observation aftords just that element of precision which is otherwise
wanting. As, then, the situations of the ancient eclipses agree fairly
well with modern computations, we are sure that there has been no
great change within the last three thousand years either in the earth’s
rotation or in the moon’s motion. There is, however, a small outstand-
ing discrepancy which indicates that there has been some change. But
the exact amount involves elements of uncertainty, because our knowl-

'This must not be considered as a fair statement of the case when the oceans are
as shallow as inactuality. The reader must accept the assurance that the friction of
the tides of shallow seas also causes retardation of the planet’s rotation, although in
a somewhat different manner from that explained above.

sm 97 8

114 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

edge of the laws of the moon’s motion is not yet quite accurate enough
for the absolutely perfect calculation of eclipses which occurred many
centuries ago. In this way it is known that within historical times the
retardation of the earth’s rotation and the recession of the moon have
been, at any rate, very slight.

It does not follow from this that the changes have always been
equally slow, and indeed it may be shown by mathematical arguments
that the efficiency of tidal friction increases with enormous rapidity as
we bring the tide raising satellite nearer to the planet. The law of tidal
friction is that it varies according to the inverse sixth power of the
distance; so that with the moon at half her present distance, the rate
of retardation of the earth’s rotation would be sixty-four times as great
as it now is. Thus, although the action may now be almost insensibly
slow, yet it must have proceeded with much greater rapidity when the
moon was nearer to us.

There are many problems in which it would be very difficult to follow
the changes in the system according to the times of their occurrence,
but where it is possible to banish time, and to trace the changes them-
selves in due order, without reference to time. In the sphere of com-
mon life, we know the succession of stations which a train must pass
between New York and Boston, although we may have no time-table.
This is the case with our astronomical problem; for although we have
no time-table, yet the sequence of the changes in the systein may be
traced accurately.

Let us then banish time, and look forward to the ultimate outcome of
the tidal interaction of the moon and the earth. The day and the
month are now lengthening at relative rates which are calculable,
although the absolute rates in time are unknown. It will suffice for a
general comprehension of the problem to know that the present rate of
increase of the day is much more rapid than that of the month, and
that this will hold good in the future. Thus, the number of rotations
of the earth in the interval comprised in one revolution of the moon
diminishes; or, in other words, the number of days in the month dimin-
ishes, although the length of each day increases so rapidly that the
month itself is longer than at present. For example, when the day
Shall be equal in length to two of our actual days, the month may be
as long as thirty-seven of our days, and then the earth will spin round
only about eighteen times in the month.

This gradual change in the day and the month proceeds continuously
until the duration of a rotation of the earth is prolonged to fifty-five of
our present days. At the same time, the month, or the time of a revo-
lution of the moon around the earth, will also occupy fifty-five of our
days. Since the month here means the period of the return of the moon
to the same place among the stars, and since the day is to be estimated
in the same way, the moon must then always face the same part of the
earth’s surface, and the two bodies must move as though they were
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 115

united by a bar. The outcome of the lunar tidal friction will therefore
be that the moon and the earth will go round as though locked together
in a period of fifty-five of our present days, with day and month identi-
cal in length.

Now, looking backward in time, we find the day and the month short-
ening, but the day changing more rapidly than the month. The earth
was therefore able to complete more revolutions in the month, although
that month was itself shorter than it is now. We get back, in fact, to
a time when there were twenty-nine rotations of the earth in the time
of the moon’s revolution, instead of twenty-seven and one-third, as at
present. This epoch is a sort of crisis in the history of the moon and
the earth, for it may: be proved that there never could have been more
than twenty-nine days in the month. Earlier than this epoch, the
days were fewer than twenty-nine; and later, fewer also. Although
measured in years this epoch in the earth’s history must be very
remote, yet when we contemplate the whole series of changes it must
be considered as a comparatively recent event. In a sense, indeed, we
may be said to have passed recently through the middle stage of our
history.

Now, pursuing the series of changes farther back than the epoch
when there was the maximum number of days in the month, we find
the earth still rotating faster and faster and the moon drawing nearer
and nearer to the earth and revolving in shorter and shorter periods.
But a change has supervened, so that the rate at which the month is
shortening is more rapid than the rate of change in the day. Conse-
quently, the moon now gains, as it were, on the earth, which can not
get round so frequently in the month as it did before. In other words,
the number of days in the month declines from the maximum of twenty-
nine, and is finally reduced to one. When there is only one day in the
month the earth and the moon go round at the same rate, so that the
moon always looks at the same side of the earth, and as far as concerns
the motion they might be fastened together by iron bands.

This is the same conclusion at which we arrived with respect to the
remote future. But the two cases differ widely; for whereas in the
future the period of the common rotation will be fifty-five of our pres-
ent days, in the past we find the two bodies going round each other in
between three and five of our present hours. A satellite revolving
round the earth in so short a period must almost touch the earth’s sur-
face. The system is therefore traced until the moon nearly touches the
earth, and the two go round each other like a single solid body in
about three to five hours.

The series of changes has been traced forward and backward from
the present time, but it will make the whole process more intelligible,
and the opportunity will be afforded for certain further considerations,
if I sketch the history again in the form of a continuous narrative.

Let us imagine a planet attended by a satellite which revolves ina
116 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

circular orbit so as nearly to touch its surface and continuously to face
the same side of the planet. If now, for some cause, the satellite’s
month comes to differ very slightly from the planet’s day, the satellite
will no longer continuously face the same side of the planet, but will
pass over every part of the planet’s equator in turn. This is the con-
dition necessary for the generation of tidal oscillations in the planet,
and as the molten lava, of which we suppose the planet to be formed,
is a Sticky or viscous fluid, the tides must be subject to friction. Tidal
friction will then begin to do its work, but the result will be very dif-
erent according as the satellite revolves a little faster or a little slower
than the planet. If it revolves a little faster, so that the month is
shorter than the day, we have a condition not contemplated in the
figure above. It is easy to see, however, that as the satellite is always
leaving the planet behind it, the apex of the tidal protuberance must
be directed to a point behind the satellite in its orbit. In this case the
rotation of the planet must be accelerated by the tidal friction, and the
satellite must be drawn inward toward the planet, into which it must
ultimately fall. In the application of this theory to the earth and the
moon, it is obvious that the very existence of the moon negatives the
hypothesis that the initial month was even infinitesimally shorter than
the day. We must then suppose that the moon revolved a little more
slowly than the earth rotated. In this case the tidal friction would
retard the earth’s rotation, and force the moon to recede from the earth,
and so perform her orbit more slowly. Accordingly, the primitive day
and the primitive month lengthen, but the month increases much more
rapidly than the day, so that the number of days in the month becomes
greater. This proceeds until that number reaches a maximum, which
in the case of our planet is about twenty-nine.

After the epoch of maximum number of days in the month, the rate
of change in the length of the day becomes less rapid than that in the
length of the month; and although both periods increase, the number
of days in the month begins to diminish. The series of changes then
proceeds until the two periods come again to an identity, when we have
the earth and the moon, as they were at the beginning, revolving in the
same period, with the moon always facing the same side of the planet.
But in her final condition the moon will be a long way off from the
earth, instead of being quite close to it.

Although the initial and final states resemble each other, yet they
differ in one respect, which is of much importance; for in the initial
condition the motion is unstable, while finally it is stable. The mean-
ing of this is that if the moon were even infinitesimally disturbed from
the initial mode of motion, she would necessarily either fall into the
planet or recede therefrom, and it would be impossible for her to con-
tinue to move in that neighborhood. She is unstable in the same sense
in which an egg balanced on its point is unstable, the smallest mote of
dust will upset it, and practically it can not stay in that position. But
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 117

the final condition resembles the case of an egg lying on its side, which
only rocks a little when we disturb it. So if the moon were slightly
disturbed from her final condition, she would continue to deseribe very
nearly the same path round the earth, and would not assume some
entirely new form of orbit.

It is by methods of rigorous argument that the moon is traced back
to the initial unstable condition when she revolved close to the earth.
But the argument here breaks down, and calculation is incompetent to
tell us what occurred before, and how she attained that unstable mode
of motion. We can only speculate as to the preceding history, but
there is some basis for our speculation, for I say that if a planet, such
as the earth, made each rotation in a period of three hours, it would
very nearly fly to pieces. The attraction of gravity would be barely
strong enough to hold it together, just as the cohesive strength of iron
is insufficient to hold a fly wheel together if it is spun too fast. There
is, of course, an important distinction between the case of the ruptured
fly wheel and the supposed break-up of the earth, for when the fly
wheel breaks the pieces are hurled apart as soon as the force of
cohesion fails, whereas when a planet breaks up, through too rapid
rotation, gravity must continue to hold the pieces together after they
have ceased to form parts of a single body.

Hence, we have grounds for conjecturing that the moon is composed
of fragments of the primitive planet which we now call the earth, which
detached themselves when the planet spun very swiftly, and afterwards
became consolidated. It surpasses the powers of mathematical caleu-
lation to trace the details of the process of this rupture and subsequent
consolidation, but we can hardly doubt that the system would pass
through a period of turbulence before order was reestablished in the
formation of a satellite.

I have said that rapid rotation was probably the cause of the birth
of the moon, but this statement needs qualification. There are certain
considerations which prevent us from ascertaining the common period
of revolution of the moon and the earth with accuracy. It may lie
between three and five hours. I think that such a speed might not,
perhaps, be quite sufficient to cause the planet to break up. Is it pos-
sible, then, to suggest any other cause which might have cooperated
with the tendency to instability of the rotating planet? I think that
there is such a cause, and though we are here déaling with guesswork,
I will hazard the suggestion.

The primitive planet, before the birth of the moon, was rotating
rapidly with reference to the sun, and it must, therefore, have been
agitated by tidal oscillations due to the sun’s attraction. Now, the
magnitude of these solar tides is much influenced by the speed of rota-
tion of the planet, and mathematical reasoning appears to show that.
when the day was about three or four hours in length the oscillations
must have been very great, although the sun stood no nearer to the

SY
118 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

earth fhen than it does now. May we not conjecture that the oscilla-
tion of the molten planet became so violent that, in cooperation with
the rapid rotation, it shook the planet to pieces, Ieiaghtne huge frag-
ments, which ultimately were consolidated into the moon? There is
nothing to tell us whether this theory affords the true explanation of
the birth of the moon, and I say that it is only a wild speculation,
incapable of verification.

But the truth or falsity of this speculation does not militate against
the acceptance of the general theory of tidal friction, which, standing
on the firm basis of mechanical necessity, throws much light on the
history of the earth and the moon, and correlates the lengths of our
present day and month.

I have said above that the sequence of events has been stated with-
out reference to the scale of time. It is of the utmost importance, how-
ever, to gain some idea of the time requisite for all the changes in the
system. If millions of millions of years were necessary, the applica-
bility of the theory to the moon and the earth would have to be
rejected, because it is known from other lines of argument that there
is not an unlimited bank of time on which to draw. The uncertainty
as to the duration of the solar system is wide, yet we are sure that it
has not existed for an almost infinite past.

Now, although the actual time scale is indeterminate, it is possible to
find the minimum time adequate for the transformation of the moon’s
orbit from its supposed initial condition to its present shape. It may
be proved, in fact, that if tidal friction had always operated under the
conditions most favorable for producing rapid change, the sequence of
events from the beginning’ until to-day would have occupied a period of
between fifty and sixty millions of years. The actual period, of course,
must have been much greater. Various lines of argument as to the age
of the solar system have led to results which differ widely among them-
selves, yet I can not think that the applicability of the theory of tidal
friction is negatived by the magnitude of the period demanded. It may
be that science will have to reject the theory in its full extent, but it
seems improbable that the ultimate verdict will be adverse to the pre-
ponderating influence of the tide on the evolution of our planet.

III.

If this history be true of the earth and the moon, it should throw
light on many peculiarities of the solar system. In the first place, a
corresponding series of changes must have taken place in the moon
herself. Once on a time she must have been molten, and the great
extinct volcanoes revealed by the telescope are evidences of her primi-
tive heat. The molten mass must have been semifluid, and the earth
must have raised in it enormous tides of molten lava. Doubtless the
moon once rotated rapidly on her axis, and the frictional resistance to
her tides must have impeded her rotation. She rotated then more and
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 119

more slowly until the tide solidified, and thenceforward and to the
present day she has shown the same face to the earth. Helmholtz
was, I believe, among the first in modern times to suggest this as the
explanation of the fact that the moon always shows us the same face.!
Our theory, then, receives a striking confirmation from the moon; for,
having ceased to rotate relatively to us, she has actually advanced to
that condition which may be foreseen as the fate of the earth.

Thus far I have referred in only one passage to the influence of solar
tides, but these are of considerable importance, being large enough to
cause the conspicuous phenomena of spring and neap tides. Now,
while the moon is retarding the earth’s rotation, the sun is doing so
also. But these solar tides react only on the earth’s motion around the
sun, leaving the moon’s motion around the earth unaffected. It might
perhaps be expected that parallel changes in the earth’s orbit would
have proceeded step by step, and that the earth might be traced to an
origin close to the sun. But the smaliness of the earth’s mass com-
pared with that of the sun here prohibits the application of the theory
of tidal friction, and it is improbable that our year is now longer, from
this cause at any rate, by more than a few seconds than it was at the
very birth of the solar system.

Although the solar tides can have had no perceptible influence upon
the earth’s movement in its orbit, they will have affected the rotation
of the earth to a considerable extent. Let us imagine ourselves trans-
ported to the indefinite future, when the moon and the earth shall be
revolving together in fifty-five of our days. The lunar tide in the
earth will then be unchanging, just as the earth tide in the moon is
now fixed; but the earth will be rotating with reference to the sun,
and, if there are unfrozen oceans, its rotation will still be subject to
retardation in consequence of the solar tidal friction. The day will
then become longer than the month, which for a very long time will
continue to occupy about fifty-five of our present days. It is known
that there are neither oceans nor atmosphere on the moon; but if
there were, she would have been subject to solar tidal friction, and
would have undergone a parallel series of changes.

Up to recent times it might have been asserted plausibly that the
absence of any such mode of motion in the solar system afforded a
reason for rejecting the actual efficiency of tidal friction in celestial
evolution. But in 1877 Prof. Asaph Hall discovered in the system of
the planet Mars a case of the kind of motion which we have reason to
foresee as the future fate of the earth and the moon; for he found two
satellites, one of which has a month shorter than the planet’s day.

In his paper on the discovery of these satellites Professor Hall gives

1Kant, in the middle of the last century, drew attention to the importance of
tidal friction in celestial dynamics; butas he did not clothe his argument in mathe-
matical form, he was unable to deduce most of the results which are explained in
this paper.
120 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

an interesting account of what had been conjectured, partly in jest
and partly in earnest, as to the existence of satellites attending that
planet. He quotes Kepler as writing, after the discovery of the satel-
lites of Jupiter, “I am so far from disbelieving the existence of the
four cireumjovial planets” (that is, satellites) “that I long for a_tele-
scope to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering two around Mars,
six or eight around Saturn, as the proportion seems to require, and
perhaps one each around Mercury and Venus.” This was, of course,
serious, although based on fantastic considerations. At a later date
Swift poured contempt on men of science in his account of the inhab-
itants of Laputa, whom he describes as dexterous enough on a piece
of paper and in the management of the rule, the pencil, and the
dividers, but as a clumsy, awkward, and unhandy people, and _ per-
plexed in their conceptions upon all subjects except mathematics and
music. He writes, however, of the Laputans, ‘‘They have likewise
discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about Mars,
whereof the innermost is distant from the center of the primary
exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost five.” In one of his
satires Voltaire also represents an imaginary traveler from Sirius as
making a similar discovery.

These curious prognostications were at length verified by Prof.
Asaph Hall in the discovery of two satellites, which he named Phobos
and Deimos—Fear and Panic, the dogs of war. The period of Deimos
is about thirty hours, and that of Phobos about eight hours, while the
Martian day is of nearly the same length as our own. ‘The month of
the inner minute satellite is thus less than a third of the planet’s day;
it rises to the Martians in the west, and passes through all its phases
in afew hours. Sometimes it must even rise twice in a single Martian
night. As we here find an illustration of the condition foreseen for
our own planet and satellite, it seems legitimate to suppose that solar
tidal friction has slowed down the planet’s rotation. The ultimate fate
of Phobos must almost certainly be absorption by the planet.

Several of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn present faint inequal-
ities of coloring, and telescopic examination has led astronomers to
believe that they always present the same face to their planets. The
theory of tidal friction would certainly lead us to expect that these
enormous planets would have worked out the same result for these
relatively small satellites that the earth has effected in the moon.

The efficiency of solar tidal friction must be far greater in its action
on the planets Mercury and Venus than on the earth. The determina-
tion of the periods of rotation of these planets thus becomes a matter of
much interest. But the markings on their disks are so obscure that
their rates of rotation have remained under discussion for many years.
Until recently the prevailing opinion was that in each case the day
was of nearly the same length as ourown; but a few years ago Schiap-
arelli, of Milan, an observer endowed with extraordinary acuteness of
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. 121

vision, announced as the result of his observation that both Mercury
and Venus rotate only once in their respective years, and that each of
them always presents the same face to the sun. These conclusions
have recently been confirmed by Mr. Percival Lowell from observations
made in Arizona, and are exactly conformable to our theoretical expec-
tation. While it is not easy to see how these astronomers can have
been mistaken, yet it is proper to note that others possessing appar-
ently equal advantages have failed to detect the markings on the
planets. Accepting, however, this conclusion, we have the planets
Mereury and Venus, the satellites of the earth, and Jupiter and Saturn
presenting evidence favorable to the theory of tidal friction, while the
case of the Martian system is yet more striking as an instance of an
advanced stage in evolution.

It would need another article to discuss the various aspects of this
theory in relation to the histories of the planets and of their satellites.
I may say, however, that it serves in great measure to explain the fact
that the earth is tilted over with reference to its orbit round the sun,
and that it throws light on the fact that the plane of the moon’s orbit
is not coincident with that of the earth. The same cause may also be
proved to tend toward making the orbit of a satellite eccentric, and it is
this effect of tidal friction to which Mr. See has appealed. I shall not
here repeat his arguments, but in Section IV I will make some coin-
ments on his theories. .

With respect to the efficacy of tidal friction as a factor in the evolu-
tion of the earth, it is not too much to say that if we postulate a planet
consisting partly or wholly of molten lava, and rapidly rotating about
an axis at right angles to its orbit around the sun, and if that planet
have a single satellite, revolving nearly as rapidly as the planet rotates,
then a system will necessarily be evolved in time closely resembling
our own.

A theory reposing on true causation, which brings into quantitative
correlation the lengths of the present day and month, the obliquity of
the ecliptic, and the eccentricity and inclination of the moon’s orbit,
must, I think, have strong claims to acceptance.

VE

There are in the heavens many pairs of closely neighboring stars
which revolve about each other under the influence of their mutual
gravitation. The fact that both members of a pair are visible seems to
indicate that they do not differ widely in mass, and it is also a striking
peculiarity of these binary systems that the orbit is commonly very
eccentric. The distinction is great between our solar system, with its
large central mass and infinitesimal planets moving in nearly circular
_ orbits, and these binary systems, aud hence there is abundant reason
for supposing that the course of evolution has been very different in
the two cases.
122 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

Mr. See explains the high degree of eccentricity in these binary orbits
by the influence of tidal friction. The tide undoubtedly operates under
conditions which give it a wide scope, when two large masses are
revolving about one another; and tidal friction is the only known cause
capable of converting a nearly circular orbit into a very eccentric one.
But this does not afford quite sufficient reason for the acceptance of
the theory, for the assumption is involved that orbits now very eccen-
tric were formerly nearly circular. Mr. See accordingly also puts for-
ward a theory of the method by which double stars originated, and to
this I shall return later.

At first it may not be easy to see how the truth of this theory of the
origin of the eccentricity is to be tested; it may be worth while, there-
fore, to point out the direction which to me, at least, seems the most
promising in the search for confirmation or refutation.

It is thought by some spectroscopists that the ages of the stars are
already determinable by the nature of their spectra, and although the
theories which have been advanced do not meet with universal accept-
ance, yet they foreshadow views which may some day be universally
accepted. It has been plausibly contended that stars which are young
in their evolution must consist of incandescent gas, and must there-
fore have spectra furrowed by bright lines; later in their histories they
are supposed to become more condensed and to give continuous spectra.
Now, if from theories of this kind we could ascertain the stage of evo-
lution of a binary system, we should be able to form a judgment of the
truth of the tidal theory; for the younger systems should present
smaller eccentricity or orbit than the older ones, and the periodic times
in the young systems should be shorter on the whole than those in the
old ones. Delicate spectroscopic measurements make it theoretically
possible to determine the relative masses of a binary pair, but hitherto
the measurements have been carried to a Successful issue in only a very
few cases. It is to be expected, however, that the number of known
masses will be largely multiplied in the future. A small star must cool
more rapidly than a large one, and should present the appearance of
greater age. We may hope, then, in time, not only to attain to crucial
tests of spectroscopic theories of age, but also to be furnished with the
materials for judging of the truth of the tidal theory of evolution of
stellar systems.

The second and yet more speculative branch of Mr. See’s theory is
that which concerns the mode of origin of binary systems. Man must
ultimately be brought. face to face with the incomprehensibility of the
origin of matter and motion, but this consideration will never prevent
him from peering into the past to the utmost of his powers. It is
certain that the stars are continually undergoing change, and it seems
impossible to accept their existence as an ultimate fact not susceptible
of explanation. Thus we feel bound to trace their histories back
to a past so remote that their preceding course of evolution becomes
inscrutable.
THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES. Dz

The fact that two stars are now found to be revolving about each
other leads to the conviction that their relationship is not a casual one,
but that they have been connected from an early epoch, which for
convenience we may call the origin of the system. It appears almost
beyond question that this starting point must have been at a time
when the two stars were united in a single rotating mass. As the basis
of his explanation of the manner in which a single mass may split into
two, Mr. See takes certain theoretical investigations as to the shapes
which a mass of gravitating and rotating fluid is capable of main-
taining. I will not recapitulate his theories, but I wish to emphasize
the uncertainties with which we are here brought face to face.

Many years ago Sir John Herschel drew a number of twin nebule
as they appear through a powerful telescope. The drawings probably
possess the highest degree of accuracy attainable by this method of
delineation, and the shapes present evidence confirmatory of Mr. See’s
theory of the fission of nebule. But since Herschel’s time it has been
discovered that many details, to which our eyes must remain forever
blind, are revealed by celestial photography. The photographie film
is, In fact, sensitive to those photographic rays which we may eall
invisible light, and many nebul are now found to be hardly recogniz-
able, when photographs of them are compared with drawings. <A
conspicuous example of this is furnished by the great nebula in Andro-
meda; for whereas the drawing exhibits a cloud with a few dark
streaks in it, the photograph shows a flattened disk surrounding a
central condensation; moreover, the disk is seen to be divided into
rings, so that the whole system might have been drawn by Laplace to
illustrate his celebrated nebular hypothesis of the origin of the solar
System.

Photographs, however, do not always aid interpretation, for there
are some which serve only to increase the chaos visible with the tele-
scope. We may suspect, in fact, that the complete system of a nebula
often contains masses of cool and photographically invisible gas, and
in such cases it would seem that the true nature of the whole will be
forever concealed from us.

Another group of strange celestial objects is that of the spiral neb-
ule, whose forms irresistibly suggest violent whirlpools of incandescent
gas. Although in all probability the motion of the gas is very rapid,
yet no change of form has been detected. We are here reminded of a
rapid stream rushing past a post, where the form of the surface
remains constant whilst the water itself is in rapid movement, and it
seems reasonable to suppose that in these nebule it is only the lines of
flow of the gas which are visible. Again, there are other cases in
which the telescopic view may be almost deceptive in its physical sug-
gestions. Thus, the Dumb-Bell Nebula (27 Messier Vulpecule), as
viewed telescopically, might be taken as a good illustration of a nebula
almost ready to split into two stars. If this were so, the rotation
would be about an axis at right angles to the length of the nebula.
124 THE EVOLUTION OF SATELLITES.

But a photograph of this object shows that the system really consists
of a luminous globe surrounded by a thick and less luminous ring, and
that the opacity of the sides of the ring takes a bite, as it were, out of
each side of the disk, and so gives it the apparent form of a dumb bell.
In this case the rotation must be about an axis at right angles to the
ring, and therefore along the length of the dumb-bell.'

From what I have said it must be obvious that the subject is sur-
rounded by difficulties and uncertainties. Mr. See is therefore to be
congratulated on having laid before the world an hypothesis which
appears to explain the facts as far as we know them. ‘The subject is
necessarily a speculative one, and we must look forward to future
spectroscopic and photographic researches for the confirmation or refu-
tation of his theories.

1Tt is proper to state that Mr. See does not refer to this nebula as confirmatory of
his theory.
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.!

By Eviau THomson,

The variety of service to which electricity has already contributed
can not fail to impress every one. We communicate by telegraph over
the land and under the seas. Our electric signals may bring into
almost instantaneous action the machinery of a modern fire depart-
ment, or simply note the flight of time in a clock system.

The stock ticker records the changing values; the police telegraph
anticipates the criminal in his flight. The same agent, which in the
telephone carries the inexpressibly feeble overtones of the voice to
great distances with the speed of light, conveys energy equal to thou-
sands of horsepower and distributes it for lighting our streets, our
factories, our shops, and our homes. The electric search light may
rival the sun in the brillianey of its beams, or a tiny incandescent
lamp may not equal one-tenth of a candle light. Electric motors ven-
tilate our buildings, drive our machinery, and run our elevators. We
travel swiftly on electric cars, propelled by current from wires which
also furnish the means for lighting and heating the cars.

In mills and factories the power is carried to the different buildings
oftentimes by electricity, and electric railways distribute the raw mate-
rials and deliver the finished products for shipment. In mines, coal is
cut and transported to the pit’s mouth by electric power, and the same
power works the ventilating fans. Metals are welded and forged by
electric heat, and some are smelted from their ores by electricity. The
electrolytic bath either refines crude metals or coats and protects them,
as in nickel plating.

Power is now transmitted over great distances by wire, and the
energy of waterfalls is made available for innumerable uses far from
its source. New and valuable products arise from the high heats of
the electric furnace. That paragon of nature, the diamond, can now
be fashioned in an electric crucible from plain black soot.

Nearly all the larger electrical work has been the result of the past
twenty years of progress. Before directing our attention to the great
work of advance in recent years, we may recall some of the more

lishing Company.
125
LAG ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

notable events in applied electricity which occurred in the late seventies
and immediately thereafter. It was then that the commercial begin-
nings of are lighting took place. The incandescent lamp or burner and
the electric main for supply of current soon followed. The telephone
itself, considered as a practically working speech transmitter, belongs
to the period referred to. Its birth was first made known at the Cen-
tennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. The almost ideal power
of electric motors was applied in a limited way. The fruits of the
pioneer work of that period have ripened in recent years. The experi-
mental work in electric railways, begun in the early eighties, resulted
in the enormous electric traction development of to-day, when almost
all our street railways are operated by electricity.

In this connection, it is very interesting to note that, at a convention
of street-railway men held so recently as 1887, a discussion of electric
traction as applied to horse railways was vigorously criticised as a waste
of time which, it was urged, might have been better applied to practi-
cal subjects, instead of to such a fanciful or theoretical one. In fact,
the contention was that the care and feeding of horses should take pre-
cedence of so unimportant a subject as electricity, considered as the
motive power of a car system. Yet, in less than five years from that
time, the horse question had everywhere become an exploded one. A
convention of the same association in the present year assumed in its
papers and discussions the universal application of electricity to street
car propulsion. Had the advent of the electric railway marked the only
great advance within the ten years just past, that period might still
be well characterized as one of great technical progress in electricity.
Had the decadence of horse traction occupied a much longer period than
it did, the advance could justly be deemed rapid.

Many of the largest street-railway systems were transformed in a
few months’ or in a year’s time. The advance still goes on by exten-
sions of existing lines, by the establishment of additional interurban
and suburban traffic facilities, by the increase of equipment, and by the
steady improvement in the quality of that equipment.

To appreciate the real progress of the past ten years demands a wider
view. We must consider many other branches of ‘electrical work
besides electric traction.

What, then, was the condition of the art ten years ago? By com-
parison with the present status, we may, generally speaking, get some:
idea of the growth during the past ten years. In thus looking back-
ward, we find that there were telephone-exchange systems, but prac-
tically no long-distance extensions. We also find that in the larger
cities and towns are-lighting circuits for street and store service were
in use, employing only the constant-current or series system; while to-
day are lights of various kinds are worked on several plans, or with
different kinds of current supply. There were, in addition, a moderate
number of electric stations, supplying incandescent lamps, together
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 127

with a few electric motors. Here and there, isolated lighting plants in
mills and other large buildings were in operation; but the alternating
current, so large a factor in electrical enterprises nowadays, had scarcely
become known or applied practically. There were perhaps not more
than twenty trolley cars in actual service in 1887, and these were of
doubtful success. There were no regularly constituted electric rail-
ways worthy of the name. The telephone and electric lighting wires
were largely overhead, and frequently the construction was of the most
imperfect and temporary character. Among some notable exceptions
stood prominent the Edison three-wire underground system, which had
the elements of permanence. ‘The extensive underground mains and
wires in use in cities to-day testify to the great progress which has
taken place in the means of distributing electric energy. They repre-
sent a very large investment of capital, but they also confer that reli-
ability and permanence which was before lacking.

Within the past eight or ten years much has been done in the perfec-
tion of thoroughly practical forms of meters and other instruments for
the measurement of electric forces and quantities. While such work
resembles in its delicacy that demanded by watch mechanism, on the
other hand the large station dynamos are examples of the heaviest
machine construction. Some of them demand steel castings more than
30,000 pounds in weight. Indeed, in the same electric factory we may
find watchmaking tools turning out the fine pieces of electric meters,
which may not weigh more than a few grains, and electric cranes han-
dling masses of metal of many tons—parts of the larger dynamos under
construction. A few years ago a dynamo was large if it demanded 100
or 200 horsepower to drive it, while now such machines are diminutive
when compared with those of 2,000 horsepower commonly constructed.

Dynamos are in use at Niagara of 5,000 horsepower capacity. A
single one of these would supply more than 50,000 incandescent lights
such as are ordinarily used, or would give motion to 500 trolley cars.

The period since 1887 has been marked by great extension in electric
lighting by both are and incandescent lamps. Prior to that year only
the largest cities, broadly speaking, possessed any electric-lighting
service. Now, however, even the smaller towns have their electric sta-
tions, their are lamps for street lighting, and the smaller incandescents
for general use. The same wires or mains frequently supply both kinds
of lights. The incandescent lamps in use in the United States are num-
bered by millions, and there are several hundred thousand are lamps
beside. There are in operation nearly 3,000 electric-light-supply sta-
tions, and these, together with isolated electric plants, represent a
capital of about $500,000,000.

One of the chief factors in this great extension has been the applica-
tion of alternating electric currents, or currents of wave-like nature,
reversing their direction many times in each second. The direct or
continuous current had previously occupied the field alone. But the
128 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

alternating current possessed the advantage of readily permitting the
sending out over a long distance of a high-pressure current with but
little loss and by means of comparatively small and inexpensive lines.
This current, relatively dangerous, could then be exchanged for a safe
low-pressure current on the house mains for working the lights.

The device which makes the exchange is called a transformer. It
is in reality a modified induction coil—a simple structure of copper
wire, sheet iron, and insulating materials, with no moving parts to need
attention or to get out of order. The properties and use of the trans-
former in an alternating-current system were comparatively unknown
before 1887, but since that time it has played a part in electric develop-
ment the importance of which can not easily be overestimated. It has
been, furthermore, brought to a high degree of perfection by the per-
sistent and painstaking effort of numerous workers.

In transforming a current of high pressure to one of lower pressure,
or the reverse, only a very slight loss of power or energy is suffered.
On a large scale, this loss is barely 3 per cent of the energy of the
transformed current. The larger sizes of transformers now in use
have capacities equivalent to considerably over 1,000 horsepower.
Some of these structures are employed at Niagara and others at
Buffalo.

As in the case of the apparatus just mentioned, the effort spent in
the perfection of the huge dynamo-electric generators used in lighting
aud power stations has resulted in machines so perfect as to leave but
little chance of further increase of effectiveness. They waste only a
small percentage in converting mechanical power into electrical energy,
and run for years with but little attention or need of repairs.

Along with all this improvement has gone a like betterment in the
thousand and one details and minor devices which go to make up an
electric system. Both incandescent lamps and are lamps are not only
much improved, but, also, their cost is greatly reduced by the use of
special machinery and processes of manufacture. Wires, insulating
materials, switches, ete., are all far in advance of what they were a few
years ago. Safety is secured by many ingenious devices, and the
methods of operating have been made far more effective.

It can not, with truth, be said that electrical arts or industries are
still in their infancy, if we are to judge by the perfection of electric
manufactures. It has been many years since electrical work could in
any sense be regarded as empirical, except by the uninformed. Few of
the older arts have possessed or do possess the means for such exact
measurement or research; few, indeed, are based upon simpler laws of
action. Had it been otherwise, the rapid progress which has character-
ized the past twenty years would have been impossible.

A striking feature of electrical energy is that it may be readily
applied to widely varied work.

A few instances of this may be given: The large electric-lighting
ELECTRICAL ADVANGE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 129

stations in our cities not only supply from the same mains, at the same
time, electric current which lights both are and incandescent lamps
indiscriminately, but the system carries also a large load. in electric
motors employed for such service as running elevators, driving venti-
lating fans, supplying power for pumping, and driving machinery in
shops of all kinds. The same mains supply current for charging stor-
age batteries, for heating metals for welding or working, for warming
rooms by electric heat, or for cooking by electric heaters. The physician
or surgeon draws upon the same system for current for the treatment
of disease, for galvano cautery, for electrolysis, and for the generation
of Kontgen rays.

Another example is found in a modern war ship, which may embody
an electric plant for working its incandescent lights. ‘The same machin-
ery supplies the search light, which is essentially an are light of great
power. There are also electric cranes and hoists, turret-turning and
gun-training apparatus, motors for ventilating fans or for forced draft
in the boiler furnaces, all depending on the same supply.

Perhaps, however, no better example of the varied application of
electric energy exists than at Niagara. Certainly no grander exempli-
fication of the way in which electric forces may be called into play, to
replace other and unlike agencies, can be cited. Here at Niagara we
may forcibly realize the importance of cheap and unfailing power devel-
oped from water in its fall. We find the power of huge water wheels
delivered to the massive dynamos for giving out electric energy. This
energy is variously employed. The electric lighting of the city of Niag-
ara and surroundings and the electric railways naturally depend upon
the water power. Besides these, which may be termed the ordinary
applications of electricity, there are clustered at Niagara a number of
unique industrial establishments, the importance of which will undoubt-
edly increase rapidly. In the carborundum factory we find huge
furnaces heated by the passage of electric current, and attaining temper-
atures far beyond those of the ordinary combustion of fuel. These elee-
tric furnaces produce carborundum, a new abrasive nearly as hard as the
diamond, which is a combination of carbon and silicon, unknown before
the electric furnace gaveit birth. Sand and coke are the raw substances
for its production, and these are acted upon by the excessively high
heat necessary to form the new product, already in extensive use for
grinding hard materials.

The metal aluminum, which not many years ago cost $2 an ounce, is
now produced on a large scale at Niagara, and sold at a price which
makes it, bulk for bulk, cheaper than brass. Here, again, electricity
is the agent; but in this case its power of electrolyzing or breaking up
strong chemical unions is employed. Great vats containing fused com-
pounds, such as fluorides of certain metals in which the aluminum ore
is dissolved, are arranged so that a powerful electric current sent
through the fused mass separates out the metallic aluminum. The

SM 97 9

130 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

metal is then collected and cast into ingots for shipment, or is rolled
into sheets or rods, or drawn into tubes or wire.

Works for the production of metallic sodium and other metals sim-
ilarly depend upon the decompositions effected by the electric current.

Solutions of ordinary salt or brine are electrolyzed on a large scale
in extensive works established for the purpose. The chlorine of the
salt is used with lime to make bleaching powder, so important an agent
in paper making and textile industries. The sodium of the decomposed
salt goes to form caustic soda, which is the base of soap, and is employed
in many manufactures.

The very high temperature which exists in an electric are, or between
the carbons of an are lamp, has in recent years found application in
the manufacture of another important compound, which was formerly
but slightly known as a chemical difficult to prepare. Carbide of cal-
cium is the compound referred to, and large works for its production
exist at Niagara. Here again, as in the carborundum works, raw
materials of the simplest and cheapest kind are acted upon in what
may be termed an electric-arc furnace. Coke, or carbon, and lime are
mixed and charged into a furnace in which an enormous electric are is
kept going. The carbons in an ordinary are lamp are usually less than
one-half inch in diameter, or they have a section of less than one-fifth
of a square inch, while in the carbide of calcium furnaces the section
of the carbon may be upward of half a square foot. The light of the
enormous are produced is, however, smothered, so to speak, in pow-
dered lime and coke—the raw materials mentioned above. The
importance of carbide of calcium rests in the fact that, by contact with
water, it produces acetylene gas. The illuminating power of this gas,
when burned, is its remarkable property.

It will be seen that the metallurgical and chemical developments at
Niagara are the direct outgrowth of electrical utilization of water
power. With many water powers, however, the outlet for the applica-
tion of the electrical energy exists many miles away from the place at
which the water power is found. Even at Niagara there is an example
of the beginning of long-distance transmission, by a high-pressure line
extending to Buffalo and delivering electric energy to an electric station
there.

In this case “step-up” transformers, as they are called, are employed
at the Niagara power plant to step up or raise the electrical pressure or
potential from that given by the dynamos to that required for the traus-
mission to Buffalo. This transformation is from about 2,500 up to
10,000 volts. At the Buffalo end the reverse process is carried on by
“step-down” transformers, and the energy is delivered to the trolley
hines at about 500 volts. At Buffalo the “step down” in pressure is
accompanied by a conversion of the alternating current into a contin-
uous current in one direction, or adirect current. It would require too
much space to explain the meaning of these technical designations of
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 131

the kinds of current; and they are referred to here solely to illustrate
the extreme flexibility of electrical work as lately developed. The
whole Niagara plant has grown into existence within the past five
years, and as a consequence of the technical advances within the
period of the past ten years. There are, however, in active operation,
besides the Niagara power plant, several other water-power transmis-
sions, some of them far exceeding in distance that between Niagara
and Buffalo, and some in which the amount of power conveyed, as well
as the pressure of the current used upon the line, is much greater than
is yet to be found at Niagara.

Hlectric transmissions are in particular favor in regions where the
cost of steam power, owing to dear fuel, is a stimulus to the utilization
of water powers which already exist or which are capable of develop-
ment. It is not surprising, therefore, that the far West should furnish
some of the most notable examples.

No limit can as yet be definitely set as to the distance which can be
covered in an electrical transmission. The higher the voltage or elec-
trical pressure which may be found practicable, the greater the distance
which may exist between the transmitting and receiving machinery. So,
also, the higher the cost of fuel in a locality, the greater the distance
over which it is feasible to make the transmission. It may be said that
at present the range of distances is between 30 and 100 miles.

It is interesting to compare the conditions in long-distance telephony
with those of a power transmission. With the former an exceedingly
feeble current is sent out; and though only a small percentage reach
the receiving telephone, still it may be sufficient to produce the sounds
of the voice with such distinctness as to enable them to be recognized.
To secure this result the long-distance telephone lines are made of heavy
copper wires, and the longer the distance to be covered the thicker
must be the line wire.

The cost of the copper in the line becomes very heavy for great dis-
tances, over 1,000,000 pounds of copper being required for a single cir-
cuit from Boston to Chicago. Ina power transmission, on the other
hand, the currents are of great pressure and sometimes represent thou-
sands of horsepower, and it is essential that in the transmission not
more than a certain percentage of the energy be lost. Thus in some
cases a 20 per cent loss would be too much to allow and in others a 25
to 30 per cent loss might not be inordinate.

In this case, again, heavy copper wires are used for the lines, insu-
lated as well as possible; and the cost of the copper for obtaining con-
ducting power sufficient to prevent undue loss, other things being equal,
sets the limit of distance. In the telephonic transmission the percent-
age of loss is not important, provided the characteristics which represent
speech in the receiver are not lost, while in the power transmission the
percentage of loss is vital, as the object of the plant is simply to trans-
mit energy under economical conditions.
aye ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

In the large work of to-day the general practice is to build the dynamo
directly upon the shaft of the engine which drives it or upon the water-
wheel shaft, as the case may be. This avoids loss in belts or other forms
of gearing.

Indeed, these large machines for producing electricity from power
have in late years reached a perfection far beyond that of the steam
engine itself. The steam engine, in fact, has been forced to a higher
development in response to the demands of the electrical engineer.

No service demanded of electricity has taxed the resources of elec-
trical and mechanical engineering so much as that of railway work.
The electric motors must work under the most varied conditions, stand
the hardest service, and run in the presence of water, slush, mud, and
dirt. They must run at all speeds, and be, so to speak, mechanically
and electricallyeinvulnerable.

In the same way the engines and dynamos, together with other
parts of the system, must be of the most robust character. Inventive
and engineering talent was required to provide for the new and urgent
conditions. In the early days of electric-railway work the prospect
was not always bright or promising; and one of the chief setbacks
was the enormous wear and tear of certain parts of the machinery—
chiefly those known as commutators. This difficulty was solved by the
invention and application of carbon blocks in place of metal “brushes”
used with the offending commutators. The “carbon brush” thence-
forth became almost as essential to the railway-motor machinery as the
carbon stick is to an are lamp and did more than anything else to
change the prospect of failure into inevitable success. These technical
matters make along story which would be out of place here. They
are merely alluded to for the purpose of emphasizing the fact that pio-
neer work in these advance movements has not been without its trials
and that a glinpse behind the scenes might have disclosed at times a
none too rosy aspect.

In spite of the difficulties to be overcome, the electric railway has,
in a very few years, put an end to horse traction on city railways, the
cruelties of which—not always to be avoided, perhaps—remain now
only as a fading memory. Electric traction has given greater speed,
better cars, which are lighted and heated electrically, and a resulting
cleanliness and comfort not otherwise attainable.

But facts so evident call for no comment. Meanwhile it has been
shown that single cars may be propelled at high train speeds with com-
parative safety. Even 60 miles an hour has been exceeded. It has
also been proved, by the construction of several huge electric locomo-
tives for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, expressly for tunnel service,
that such electric machinery can haul the heaviest train loads and can
more than equal in power locomotives worked by steam.

Klectric traction is now generally regarded as the ideal method for
elevated railways and as practically indispensable to underground or
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 133

tunnel traffic in cities. A new underground road is now being con-
structed in London, which, when completed, will be a splendid example
of the latest methods of the distribution and application of electricity
to train service.

Indeed, electricity seems destined at no distant day to play an impor-

tant part in revolutionizing passenger traffic between large centers of
population. The facility with which electric service may be superposed
on ordinary steam roads will greatly further this development. The
- work with the third-rail system, undertaken by one of our prominent
railway organizations, has abundantly demonstrated the practicability
of such superposition. The future will witness the growing substitu-
tion of either single motor cars or two or three coupled cars for long,
heavy trains drawn by locomotives, and a more frequent service will
result. There is an eventual possibility of higher average speeds, since
stops will not consume much time, and the time required to recover the
speed after a stop will be much less than at present. There will be no
annoyance due to escaping steam, smoke, or cinders; no sparks to cause
forest or brush fires; no stopping to change engines nor for taking up
water or coal. The locomotive will be supplanted by electric motors
driving the axles of the cars as in street-railway service. Cheap fuel
can be used to generate the power in the electric stations and the best
conditions for economy of fuel maintained. Where water power is
available within 30 or 40 miles it may be transmitted to the railway
line and used instead of power obtained from coal.

The present outlook, then, is most encouraging, so far as electric-
railway extension is concerned; and, just as in electric lighting the
foundations of present practice were laid fifteen or twenty years ago,
so it may be said that the foundations of the railway practice of twenty
years hence can be found in the work of to-day. In fact, great enter-
prises are now being planned and undertaken which will mean much to
the future of the electric railroad.

Besides the work which is thus going on, and in which the electrical
forces may be publicly witnessed in full operation, there are now other
forms of industry in which the part played by electricity is not dis-
tinctly evident. Thus enormous amounts of crude copper are annually .
refined by electrolysis, with the result that a nearly pure metal is
obtained, where formerly impurities lessened the value of the copper.
Not only is this the case, but in some instances amounts of the precious
metals, gold and silver, have been separated in the refining sufficient
to pay the cost of the process. This work is all comparatively recent
in its development.

The heating power of the electric current is now also utilized in a
variety of ways. Hlectric welding machinery has been put into service
either for accomplishing results which were not possible to be obtained
before its development, or to improve the work and lessen the cost.

Here again the part played by the electric current sometimes leaves
134 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

little indication in the finished product. As an instance, it may be
mentioned that the solid rubber tires of carriages are held in place by
wires welded into bands by electric welding machines built for the pur-
pose. Similarly, carriage hardware, axles, wheel tires, parts of bicy-
cles, parts of machines, tools, and innumerable other articles are made.
Metal bands for pails, tubs, and barrels are now largely made by electric _
welding. Even steel tubes for bicycles and vehicle frames are formed
by the same means; and new industries are based upon it. A curious
and instructive instanee of the adaptability of electric methods to new
uses is seen in the annealing of armor for war vessels. A serious diffi-
culty arose in the application of armor plate having a hardened face and
known as harveyized armor. It was found almost impossible to drill
or cut holes in the face—an operation frequently rendered necessary
in the construction of an armored ship. Various methods of anneal-
ing or softening the spots where the plate was to be drilled were tried,
with indifferent results. The construction of some of our battle ships
was delayed on account of this difficulty. It was overcome by a special
electric method, with appropriate machinery somewhat resembling that
used for electric welding, capable of heating to redness the desired
spots in the face of the heaviest armor plate, and of automatically redue-
ing the heat of the spots so as to anneal them. The heating and con-
trol of the cooling is perfectly brought about, in spite of the enormous
mass of cold metal surrounding the portion under treatment. Together
with electric welding work, this armor annealing is a striking instance
of the extreme localization of heating in metal, possible only by the
delivery of electrical energy and its conversion into heat at the desired
point. In electric welding, the electric heat is sharply localized at the
weld itself, softening and uniting the pieces; the operation being under
the same perfect control as in the armor annealing referred to. Before
the advent of the electric process, iron and platinum only were known
as the weldable metals. Afterwards, all metals became capable of
welding under electric treatment.

Hlectric heating is now also applied in many other ways. There are
to be found electric cooking utensils, electric sad irons, electric solder-
ing tools, and similar devices; while many street cars are provided with
electric heat in winter.

Vhe chief bar to the employment of electricity for general heating
lies in the fact that in using coal to develop power by steam engines—
which power in turn is sent out as electrical energy—85 to 90 per cent
of the heating value is lost in the boiler and engine. This loss is so
great as to make it undesirable, from the standpoint of cost, to recon-
vert the electric energy back into low heat, which can be more ecouom-
ically obtained from the direct use of burning fuel.

Besides the technical and industrial development which has gone
on so rapidly in the electrical field, the science of electricity, considered
simply as a department of physics, has advanced very rapidly. It is
ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. 135

but a few years since the late Dr. Hertz gave to the world his experi-
mental demonstrations of the fact that light of all kinds and from all
sources is really an electrical phenomenon, differing from ordinary
alternate-current waves only in the rate or frequency of vibrations. We
produce electric waves of about one hundred vibrations per second for
alternating-current work; and in the waves of red light the rapidity is
as high as four hundred millions of millions of vibrations per second.
Hertz and others used waves of some millions per second, and showed
how they could transmit signals to distances without wires; these
invisible waves being recognized by suitable receivers. The recently
announced Marconi wireless telegraph is much the same thing, with
certain improvements in detail. It may be of limited use, but will not
replace telegraph lines and submarine cables.

Our store of scientific facts has been greatly increased and our elec-
trical theories have been made more precise in late years; while the
enormous industrial expansion has furnished the means for researches
otherwise difficult to carry on.

Hardly had the work of Hertz and others who followed in his foot-
steps been assimilated, before the truly remarkable, not to say astound-
ing, discovery by Professor Rontgen of what he called the X-rays pro-
duced a profound impression not only in the scientific world, but upon
the general public as well. The interest of the scientist had a different
basis from the popular one of disclosure of objects hidden in opaque
structures; for he saw in the discovery a new weapon of attack upon
the secrets of nature. This weapon has already proved to be so serv-
iceable as to show that his anticipations were not unfounded. The
X-rays, which became at once indispensable to surgery, are the result
of electrical actions in certain vacuum bulbs; and the discovery is
properly an electrical one.

The rapid extension of electrical application must naturally be of
importance in social and economic questions. Changes in our methods
give rise to extension of possibilities in the lives of our people. The
effect of electric railways alone must be an important study for the
economist and social scientist. Fresh questions of law and equity arise
out of the conflict of the new and the old.

The increasing importance of electrical work has had a powerful
effect upon the development of many other arts. It has stimulated
workers in other than electrical fields to the attainment of higher stand-
ards, to the improvement of materials and construction, to the bringing
out of new products and processes in response to the demands of elec-
tric engineering. As a consequence, we have better and more econom-
ical engines, improved methods in the casting, forging, and working of
iron, brass, copper, and other metals. We have new alloys with special
properties, special grades and kinds of steel, improved methods of
working such substances as glass, porcelain, rubber, asbestos, mica,
etc. In street railways we have far better rails and rolling stock.
136 ELECTRICAL ADVANCE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS.

No existing industry employs a greater range of materials, from the
rarest to the most common, than does electric work. None requires or
employs such a variety, in character, kind, and quality, of materials, or
of treatment of them, tosupply daily needs. Nature has been ransacked
to discover whatever may possess qualities desirable in electrical con-
struction; and the resources of art and ingenuity have been called to
supply whatever might be lacking.

This material progress, coupled with the civilizing and educative
influences naturally accompanying it, as well as the many other ad-
vances in the application of science to the needs of mankind, will ever
remain the crowning glory of the latter half of the nineteenth century.
THE X-RAYS.

By W. C. RONTGEN.

I.—UPON A NEW KIND OF RAYs.!

1. If the discharge of a great Ruhmkorff induction coil be passed
through a Hittorf vacuum tube, or’a Lenard’s, Crooke’s, or similar appa-
ratus containing a sufficiently high vacuum, then, the tube being covered
with a close layer of thin black pasteboard and the room darkened, a
paper screen covered on one side with barium-platinum cyanide and
brought near the apparatus will be seen to glow brightly and fluoresce
at each discharge whichever side of the screen is toward the vacum tube.
The fluorescence is visible even when the screen is removed to a distance
of 2 meters from the apparatus.

The observer may easily satisfy himself that the cause of the fluores-
cence is to be found at the vacuum tube and at no other part of the
electrical circuit.

2. It is thus apparent that there is here an agency which is able to
pass through the black pasteboard impenetrable to visible or ultra
violet rays from the sun or the electric arc, and having passed through
is capable of exciting a lively fluorescence, and it is natural to inquire
whether other substances can be thus penetrated.

It is found that all substances transmit this agency, but in very dif-
ferent degree. I will mention some examples. Paper is very trans-
missible.?

I observed fluorescence very distinctly behind a bound book of about
1,000 pages. The ink presented no appreciable obstacle. Similarly
fluorescence was seen behind a double whist pack. A single card held
between the fluorescent screen and the apparatus produced no visible
effect. A single sheet of tin foil, too, produces hardly any obstacle, and
it is only when several sheets are super weston that their shadow appears

2 By the transmissibility of a substance I designate the ratio between the bright-
ness of a fluorescent screen held behind the body and that which the screen would
have under the same conditions in the absence of the interposed substance.

distinctly on the screen. Thick wooden blocks are transmissible. Slabs
of pine 2 or 3 centimeters thick absorb only very little. A plate of
aluminum about 15 millimeters thick diminished the effect very con-
siderably, but did not cause the fluorescence to entirely disappear.
Blocks of hard rubber several centimeters thick still transmitted the
rays.’

Glass plates of equal thickness behave very differently according to
whether they contain lead (flint glass) or not. ‘The first class are much
less transmissible than the second.

If the hand is held between the vacuum tube and the screen, the
dark shadow of the bones is seen upon the much lighter shadow out-
line of the hand. Water, carbon bisulphide, and various other liquids
investigated proved very transmissible. I could not find that hydrogen
was more transmissible than air. The fluoresence was visible behind
plates of copper, silver, lead, gold, and platinum, when the thickness
of the plate was not too great. Platinum 0.2 millimeter thick is still
transmissible, and silver and copper plates may be still thicker. Lead
1.5 millimeters thick is practically impenetrable, and advantage was
frequently taken of this characteristic. A wooden stick of 20 imilli-
meters square cross section, having one side covered with white lead,
behaved differently when interposed between the vacuum tube and the
screen according as the X-rays traversed the block parallel to the
painted side or were compelled to pass through it. In the first case
there was no 2ffect appreciable, while in the second a dark shadow was
thrown on the screen. Salts of the metals, whether solid or in solution,
are to be ranged in almost the same order as the metals themselves for
transmissibility.

3. These observations and others lead to the conclusion that the
transmissibility of equal thicknesses of different substances depends
on their density. At least no other characteristic exerts so marked an
influence as this.

The following experiment shows, however, that the density is not the
sole factor. I compared the transmissibility of nearly equally thick
plates of glass, aluminum, calespar, and quartz. The density of these
substances is substantially the same, and yet it was quite evident that
the calespar was considerably less transmissible than the others, which
are about alike in this respect.

4, All bodies became less transmissible with increasing thickness.
For the purpose of finding a relation between transmissibility and
thickness I have made photographic exposures, in which the photo-
graphic plate was partly covered with a layer of tin foil consisting of a
progressively increasing number of sheets. I shall make a photometric
measurement when I am in possession of a suitable photometer.

5. Sheets were rolled from platinum, lead, zinc, and aluminum of such

? For brevity’s sake I employ the word ‘“‘rays,” and in distinction from others make
use of the expression ‘‘ X-rays.”
THE X-RAYS. 139

thickness that all appeared to be equally transmissible. The following
table gives the measured thickness in millimeters, the relative thickness
compared with platinum, and the specific gravity:

From these values it may be seen that the transmissibility of plates
of different metals so chosen that the product of the thickness and
density is constant would not be equal. The transmissibility increases
much faster than this product falls off.

6. The fluoresence of barium-platinum-cyanide is not the only action
by which X-rays may be recognized. It should be remarked that they
cause other substances to fluoresce, as for example the photophores-
cent calcium compounds, uranium glass, common glass, calespar, rock
salt, ete.

Jt is of particular importance from many points of view that photo-
graphic dry plates are sensitive to X-rays. It thus becomes possible
to fix many phenomena so that deceptions are more easily avoided; and
J have where practicable checked all important observations made with
a fluorescent screen by photographic exposures.

It appears questionable whether the chemical action upon the silver
salts of the photographic plate is produced directly by the X-rays. It
is possible that this action depends upon the fluorescent light which, as
is mentioned above, may be excited in the glass plate, or perhaps in
the gelatine film. ‘“ Films” may indeed be made use of as well as glass
plates.

I have not as yet obtained experimental evidence that the X-rays are
capable of giving heat. This characteristic might, however, be assumed
as present, since in the excitation of fluorescent phenomena the capacity
of the energy of the X-rays for transformation is proved, and since it
is certain that of the X-rays falling upon a body not all are given up.

The retina of the eye is not sensitive to these rays. Nothing is to be
noticed by bringing the eye near the vacuum tube, although according
to the preceding observations the media of the eye must be sufficiently
transmissible to the rays in question.

7. After I had discovered the transmissibility of various bodies of
relatively great thickness I hastened to investigate whether or not the
X-rays were refracted in passing through a prism. Experiments with
water and carbon bisulphide in mica prisms of 30 degrees refracting
angle showed no deviation either when observations were made with the
fluorescent screen or with the photographic plate. For comparison, the
deviation of light rays was observed under the same conditions. The
140 THE X-RAYS.

refracted portion lay from 10 to 20 centimeters distant from that not
refracted. With prisms of hard rubber and aluminum of about 30
degrees refracting angle I obtained exposures on a photographic plate
which perhaps indicated a slight refraction. This is, however, very
doubtful and the deviation is, if present, so small that the index of
refraction for X-rays in these substances can not exceed 1.05. I could
not observe with the fluorescent screen any deviation in these cases.
Experiments with prisms of the denser metals have so far yielded no
certain results on account of the slight transmissibility and the conse-
quent decrease of the intensity of the transmitted ray.

In consideration of these results on the one hand, and on the other
of the importance of the question whether or not the X-rays in passing
from one medium to another undergo refraction, it is very gratifying
that this question may be investigated by other means than by the help
of prisms. Finely pulverized bodies in suitable layers allow but little
light to pass, in consequence of refraction and reflection. If now the
X-rays are transmitted equally well through powder as through the
coherent substance, equal masses being presupposed, it is proved that
neither refraction nor regular reflection is present in any marked
degree. This experiment was performed using finely pulverized rock-
salt, finely divided silver, obtained by electrolysis, and the zinc dust
so frequently utilized in chemical processes. In no case was any differ-
ence in transmissibility between the powder and the coherent sub-
stance detected either by the use of the fluorescent screen or the pho-
tographie plate.

It follows of course from the results thus obtained that the X-rays
can not be concentrated by the use of lenses; and, indeed, a great hard
rubber lens and a glass lens actually proved without effect. The
shadow of a round rod is darker in the middle than at the edges, while
that of a tube which is filled with some substance more transmissible
than the material of which the tube is composed is darker at the edges
than at the center.

8. The question as to the reflection of X-rays is so far settled by the
experiments already described that no marked regular reflection was
to be found with any of the substances examined. Other experiments
which [ will here pass over lead to the same results.

Nevertheless an observation should be mentioned which indicated at
first glance an opposite result. A photographic plate shielded from the
action of light rays by a black paper was exposed to X-rays so that the
glass side was toward the discharge tube. The sensitive film was par-
tially covered with bright plates of platinum, lead, zinc, and aluminum,
arranged in a star-shaped figure. Upon development it was observed
that the darkening of the film under the platinum, the lead, and espe-
cially the zine, was distinctly greater than in the other parts. No such
effect was produced by the aluminum. Thus it seemed as if the three
metals mentioned reflected. However, there were other causes to be
THE X-RAYS. 141

conceived which might have produced the increased darkening, and in
order to be sure I performed a second experiment, interposing a thin
sheet of aluminum foil (very transmissible to X-rays, but not to those
of the ultraviolet) between the metals and the sensitive film. Since in
this case again practically the same result was obtained, the fact of
reflection of X-rays by the metals above mentioned is established.

Taking this result together with the observation that powder is as
transmissible as coherent substance, and further, that bodies with
rough surfaces behave in the transmission of X-rays and also in the
experiments just described exactly like polished bodies, the conclusion
is reached that there is, as before remarked, no regular reflection, but
that the bodies behave toward X-rays in the same manner as a turbid
medium with reference to light.

As I have not been able to discover any refraction in the passage
from one medium to another, it appears as if the X-rays travel with
equal velocity in all bodies, and hence in a medium which is every-
where present and in which the particles of the bodies are embedded.
These latter act as a hindrance to the propagation of the X-rays,
which is in general greater the greater the density of the body in
question.

9. In accordance with this supposition it might be possible that the
arrangement of the molecules of the body would exert an intlueice on
its transmissibility, and that, for example, a piece of calespar would
be unequally transmissible for equal thicknesses when the rays passed
along or at right angles to the axis. Experiments with calespar and
quartz gave, however, a negative result.

10. It will be recalled that Lenard, in his beautiful experiments on
the transmission of the Hittorf cathode rays through thin aluminum
foil, obtained the result that these rays are disturbances in the ether,
and that they diffuse themselves in all bodies. We may make a similar
statement with regard to our rays.

In his last research Lenard has determined the relative absorption of
different substances for the cathode rays, and in determining the same
for air at atmospheric pressure has given the values 4.10, 3.40, 3.10 as
referred to 1 centimeter thickness according to the density of the gas
in the discharge tube. Judging from the length of spark observed, I
have, in my researches, generally employed tubes of about equal exhaus-
tion and only seldom those of much greater or less density. Using the
photometer of L. Weber, the best at my command, I compared the
intensity of fluorescence on the screen in two positions distant 100 and
200 millimeters, respectively, from the discharge tube. From the results
of these experiments, agreeing well with each other, it appeared that
the intensity varies inversely as the square of the distance. Hence the
air absorbs a much smaller portion of the X-rays passing through it
than of cathode rays. This result is in accord with the observation
above mentioned, that it is possible to distinguish fluorescence at 2
meters distance trom the discharge tube.
142 THE X-RAYS.

Most other substances are, like the air, more transmissible for X-rays
than for the cathode rays.

11. Another very noteworthy difference between the behavior of the
cathode rays and the X-rays was exhibited in that I was unable to pro-
duce any deviation of the latter by the action of the most powerful
magnetic fields. The property of being subject to deviation by mag-
nets is, on the other hand, very characteristic of the cathode rays.
Hertz and Lenard have observed various kinds of cathode rays which
‘are to be distinguished by their differences in their capacities for
exciting phosphorescence in their absorptibility and in their deviation
by the magnet,” but a considerable magnetic deviation was to be observed
with all of them, and I do not believe that this characteristic would be
given up except for the most urgent reasons.

12. According to the results of experiments particularly directed to
discover the source of the X-rays, it is certain that the part of the wall
of the discharge tube which most strongly fluoresces is the principal
starting point. The X-rays therefore radiate from the place where,
according to various observers, the cathode rays meet the glass wall.
If one Crates the cathode rays within the tube by a magnet, the source
of the X-ray is also seen to change its position so that these radiations
still proceed from the end points of the cathode rays. The X-rays
being undeviated by magnets can not, however, be simply cathode rays
passing unchanged through the glass wall. The greater density of the
gas outside the discharge tube can not, according to Lenard, be made
answerable for the great difference of the deviation.

I come therefore to the results that the X-rays are not identical with
the cathode rays, but that they are excited by the cathode rays in the
glass wall of the vacuum tube.

13. This generating action takes place not only in glass, but as I
observed it in apparatus with aluminum walls 2 millimeters thick, exists
also for this metal. Other substances will be investigated.

14. The warrant for giving the title “rays” to the agent which pro-
ceeds from the wall of the discharge tube arose in part from the quite
regular formation of shadows appearing when more or less transmissible
substances are interposed between the generating apparatus and a
phoshorescent screen or photographic plate. I have many times
observed and sometimes photographed such shadow forms, in whose
production there lies a particular charm. I have, for example, photo-
graphs of the shadow of the profile of a door which separates the two
rooms, in one of which was the discharge apparatus, in the other the
photographic plate; of the shadow of the hand bones; of the shadow
of a wooden spool wound with wire; of a set of weights in a box; of a
compass in which the magnetic needle is quite inclosed in metal; of
a piece of metal which is shown to lack homogeneity by the use of
X-rays, ete.

The propagation of ile X-rays in right lines is shown by pin-hole
photography, which I have been able to do with the discharge appara-

tus covered with black paper. The picture is weak, but unmistakably
correct.

15. I have much sought to obtain interference phenomena with
X-rays, but unfortunately—perhaps on account of their slight intensit y—
without result.

16. Experiments have been begun to see if electrostatic forces can
in any way influence X-rays, but these are not yet finished.

17. If the question is asked what the X-rays—which certainly are
not cathode rays—really are, one might at first, on account of their
lively fluorescent and chemical action, compare them to ultra-violet
light. But here one falls upon serious difficulties. Thus, if the X-rays
were ultra-violet light, then this light must possess the following
characteristics:

(a) That in passing from air into water, carbon bisulphide, aluminum,
rock salt, glass, zine, ete., it experiences no notable refraction.

(b) That it is not regularly reflected by these substances.

(c) That it can not be polarized by the usual materials.

(d) That its absorption by substances is influenced by nothing so
much as by their density.

In other words, one must assume that these ultra-violet radiations
comport themselves quite differently from all previously known infra-
red, visible, and ultra-violet rays.

I have not been able to admit this, and have sought some other
explanations.

A kind of relation seems to subsist between the new radiation and
light radiation, or at least the shadow formation, the fluorescence, and
the chemical action, which are common phenomena of these two kinds
of radiation, point in this direction. It has been long known that
longitudinal as well as transverse vibrations are possible in the ether,
and according to various physicists must exist. To be sure, their
existence has not, up to the present time, been proved, and hence their
characteristics have not thus far been experimentally investigated.

Should not the new radiations be ascribed to longitudinal vibrations
in the ether? I may say that in the course of the investigation this
hypothesis has impressed itself more and more favorably with me, and
I venture to propose it, although well aware that it requires much
further examination.

II.—UPON A NEW KIND OF RAYS (ABSTRACT)!

As my work must be interrupted for several weeks, I take the oppor-
tunity of presenting in the following some new results:
18. At the time of my first publication I was aware that the X-rays

der Physik und Chemie, 64, p. 12, 1898.
144 THE X-RAYS.

have the property of discharging electrified bodies, and I intimated
that it was the X-rays and not the cathode rays passing unchanged
through the aluminum window of his apparatus which produced the
effect described by Lenard on electrified bodies at a distance. I have,
however, delayed publication of my experiments until I could present
conclusive results.

These can be obtained only when the observations are carried on in a
room which is not only completely insulated from the electrostatic
forces emanating from the vacuum tube, the conducting wires, the
induction apparatus, etc., but is also closed to the air which comes in
the neighborhood of the discharge apparatus.

For this purpose I had a box constructed by soldering together
zine sheets, and this box was large enough to contain me and the
necessary apparatus, and was air-tight with the exception of an open-
ing which could be closed by a zine door. The side opposite to the door
was mostly lined with lead, and immediately adjacent to the discharge
tube an opening 4 centimeters wide was cut in the lead and zine wall,
and its place filled up air-tight with aluminum foil. Through this
window passed the X-rays to be investigated. I have with this appa-
ratus verified the following results:

(a) Positively or negatively electritied bodies placed in air are dis-
charged when immersed in X-rays, and the action is the more rapid
the more intense the radiations. The intensity of the rays is deter-
mined by their action upon a fluorescent screen or a photographic
plate. °

It is in general immaterial whether the electrified substance is a con-
ductor or nonconductor. Thus far I have discovered no difference in
the behavior of different bodies relative to the rapidity of their dis-
charge, or between positive or negative charges. These points are,
however, open to further investigation.

(b) When an electrified conductor is surrounded by a solid insulator,
as for example, paraffine, the radiation produces the same effect as
would the flashing of the insulating shell by a flame placed in contact
with the ground. Q

(c) If this insulator be in its turn closely surrounded by a grounded
conductor and both itself and this outer conductor be transmissible to
X-rays, the action of the X-radiations upon the inner conductor is
unnoticeable with the apparatus at my command.

(d) The observations recorded under (a), (b), and (¢) indicate that
the air through which X-rays pass possesses the property of dischare-
ing any electrified bodies with which it comes in contact.

(¢) If this be indeed the case, and if the air retains for some con-
siderable time this property imparted to it by the X-rays, it must be
possible to discharge electrified bodies not themselves under the influ-
ence of X-rays by bringing to them air which has been subject to these
radiations.
THE X-RAYS. 145

One may satisfy himself in various ways that this is the case. The
following, though perhaps not the simplest method, may be mentioned:

I employed a brass tube 3 centimeters wide and 45 centimeters long.
At 1 centimeter’s distance from one end a portion of the tube was cut
away and replaced by a thin sheet of aluminum. At the other end
there was introduced a brass ball, which was supported by a metal
support, and this end was closed air-tight. Between the brass ball
and the closed end of the tube a side tube was soldered in, which was
connected with an air-pump. By this means a current of air was
made to flow by the brass ball, after having passed the aluminum
window. The distance from the ball to the window was 20 centimeters.

I mounted this tube in the zine box in such a manner that the
X-rays entered the tube at right angles to its axis, and the insulated
ball lay outside the reach of these rays, in the shadow. The tube and
zine box were placed: in contact and the ball was connected with a
Hankel electroscope. ;

It was shown that a charge on the ball, whether positive or negative,
was not influenced by X-rays so long as the air remained quiet in the
tube, but that a marked diminution of the charge was produced by
sucking a strong current of air through. If the ball was kept at con-
stant potential by connecting it with accumulators, and a continuous
eurrent of air was kept flowing in the tube, an electrical current was
set up just as if the ball was connected with the walls of the tube by
a conductor of high resistance. * * *

20. In section 13 of my first article it was stated that the X-rays may
be generated not only in glass butin aluminum. In conducting experi-
ments in this direction no solid bodies were found which were not capa-
ble of producing X-rays when under the influence of cathode rays. I
know no reason to suppose that liquids and gases also do not act
similarly.

Different substances, however, possess this property in different
degrees. For example, if cathode rays are caused to fall upon a plate
of which one-half is composed of platinum foil 0.5 millimeter thick and
the other half of aluminum 1 millimeter thick, one may observe in the
photographic image taken with the pinhole camera that the platinum
foil sends out many more X-rays from the side bombarded by the
cathode rays than does the aluminum on the same side. But from the
back side of the plate there go out almost no X-rays from the platinum,
while the aluminum sends out a relatively largenumber. ‘These latter
rays are generated at the front layers of the aluminum and pass through
the plate.

It should be remarked that these observations have a practical sig-
nificance. For the generation of X-rays of the greatest possible inten-
sity my experience recommends the employment of platinum. I have —
used for some weeks with advantage a discharge apparatus having a
concave mirror of aluminum as cathode, and as annode a platinum

plate placed in the center of curvature, and at an angle of 45 degrees
with the axis.

21, The X-rays proceed from the annode with this apparatus. As I
have concluded from experiments with apparatus with various forms,
it is immaterial with regard to the intensity of the X-rays whether they
proceed from the annode or not. * * *

IIl.—FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROPERTIES OF X-RAYS
(ABSTRACT).!

1. If between a discharge tube sending out intense X-rays? and a
fluorescent screen one interposes an untransmissible plate so placed
that it shades the whole screen, one can still observe a luminosity of
the barium-platinum cyanite. This luminescence is still visible when
the screen is close up to the plate, and one is at first inclined to regard
the plate as transmissible. When, however, one
covers the fluorescent plate with a thick glass slide
the fluorescence becomes much weaker, and it com-
pletely disappears when instead of using the glass
plate one covers the screen with a lead cylinder -
1 millimeter thick, which passes entirely over the
head of the observer and is closed by the untrans-
missible plate.

The phenomena described might be due to the
diffraction of rays of great wave length or to the
sending out of X-rays by the objects surrounding
the discharge tube, such, for example, as the air
through which the rays pass.

The Jatter explanation is the true one, as may be easily shown by the
use of the following apparatus. The figure shows a thick-walled glass
bell jar 20 centimeters high and 10 centimeters in diameter, which is
closed by a thick zine plate inserted with cement.

At a and / are lead shelves of the form of segments of a circle, each
of an area somewhat greater than half the cross section of the jar. At
the end of the glass jar is a zine plate with a central opening covered
with a collodium film, and the two plates above mentioned prevent
X-rays which have passed through this opening from reaching the part
of the jar which lies above the lead plate b. Upon the upper side of

2 All the discharge tubes mentioned in the following communication are constructed
according to the principle given under section 20 of my second communication. A
great part have been obtained from the firm of Greiner & Friedrichs, in Stiitzerbach
i. Th., fo whom I wish to express my thanks for the great quantity of material which
they have supplied to me without cost.
THE X-RAYS. 147

this plate is a fluorescent screen which fills almost the whole cross sec-
tion of the jar. This screen can receive neither the direct rays nor
those a single time diffusely reflected from solid substances, as, for
example, the glass walls. Before each experiment the jar is filled with
dust-free air. When X-rays are allowed to enter in such a way that
they are all received by the lead plate a there is no fluorescence to be
observed at b. When the jar is inclined so that the rays can pass
through the space between a and / the fluorescent screen is illuminated
over that portion not covered by the plate b. When the jar is con-
nected with an air pump the fluorescence becomes weaker the further
the exhaustion proceeds, and when air is admitted the intensity again
increases. .

I found that no noticeable fluorescence was excited by simple contact
with air through which X-rays had shortly before passed, so that. it
follows that the air while it is receiving X-rays also sends them out
in all directions.

If our eyes were as sensitive for X-rays as they are for light rays, an
actively operating discharge tube would appear to us like a light burn-
ing in a room uniformly filled with tobacco smoke. It might perhaps
be that the colors of the rays coming direct would be different from
those sent out by the air particles.

The question whether the rays sent out by bodies are the same as
those they receive, or, in other words, whether this phenomena is due
to diffused reflection or to an action similar to fluorescence, I have not
thus far been able to decide. It may be readily shown that the rays
coming from air particles are photographically active, and this char-
acteristic makes itself manifest in a most unwelcome manner. In order
to guard against this effect it is necessary in long exposures to protect
the plate by appropriate lead screens.

2. In order to compare the intensity of the radiation from the dis.
charge tubes, and for various purposes, I have made use of a contriv-
ance which is constructed similarly to the Bouguer photometer, and
which, for the sake of simplicity, I will call a photometer. <A rectan-
gular piece of sheet lead 35 centimeters high, 150 centimeters long, and
0.15 millimeter thick is supported vertically on a piece of board in the
center of along table. On each side of this sheet and movable upon
the table stands a discharge tube. At one end of the lead strip isa
fluorescent screen! so arranged that each half is vertically radiated
upon. In the measurements the arrangements were adjusted until the
two parts were equally bright.

Some remarks made upon the use of this instrument may not be out

‘In this and other experiments the Edison fluorescent screen has proved very
useful. This consists of a stereoscopic case which can be secured light-tight to the
head of the observer, and whose pasteboard bottom is covered with barium-platinum
cyanide. Edison employs Scheelite in place of barium-platinum cyanide; but for
many reasons I prefer the latter.
148 THE X-RAYS.

of place. First of all it should be noted that the determinations are
rendered much more difficult because of the unsteadiness of the sources
of radiation. The tubes are sensitive to each irregularity of the inter-
ruption of the primary current; and such frequently occur with the
Dupret and especially with the Foucault form of interrupter. Many
repetitions of each measurement are therefore necessary. Second, [
may indicate upon what factors the brightness of a given fluorescent
screen depends which is acted upon by a shower of X-rays so rapid
that the observer’s eye can not detect the intermittent character of
the illumination. This brightness depends (1) upon the intensity of
the radiation proceeding from the platinum plate of the discharge
tube; (2) very probably upon the nature of the rays falling on the
screen, for, as will be shown, different kinds of radiation are not
equally active in exciting fluorescence; (3) upon the distance of the
screen from the source of the rays; (4) upon the absorption which the
rays experience in their journey to the fluorescent screen; (5) upon
the number of discharges per second; (6) upon the duration of each
separate discharge; (7) upon the duration and the strength of the after
light of the barium-platinum cyanide, and (8) upon the radiation to the
screen from the surrounding bodies. In order to avoid errors, one
must bear in mind that he has to do with a matter which is as if he
were conducting experiments to compare by the aid of fluorescence two
intermittent light sources of different colors and was obliged to carry
on his experiments within an absorbing shell and in a turbid or fluor-
escing medium.

3. According to section 12 of my first communication, the source of
the X-rays is the place where the cathode rays meet the discharge
tube and the X-rays radiate outward in all directions. It is now of
interest to investigate how the intensity of the rays varies with the
direction.

For this investigation the spherical form of discharge apparatus with
a well-polished platinum plate inclined at an angle of 45 degrees to
the direction of the cathode rays is best adapted. Without other aid,
there appears evidence in the uniformly bright fluorescence which is
visible in the hemispherical glass wall above the platinum plate that
there are no great differences in the intensity of the illumination, so
that Lambert’s law can not hold. However, this fluorescence may be
largely excited by the cathode rays.

For the purpose of more exact investigation experiments were made
with the photometer upon the intensity of the rays emanating from
Several tubes in various directions, and I have besides exposed photo-
graphic films which were bent in a half circle to a radius of 25 centi-
meters about the platinum plate as a center. In both experiments the
varying thickness of the glass at different parts of the tube walls
entered as a serious disturbing factor, because the X-rays were thus
unequally absorbed in the various directions. It was, however, pos-

sible to make the thickness of the glass approximately uniform by the
interposition of thin plates.
THE X-RAYS. 149

The result of these experiments is that the radiation upon an imagi-
nary hemisphere constructed upon the platinum plate as a center is
nearly uniform almost to the borders of this hemisphere. I could detect
a Slight diminution of intensity at an emanation angle of 80 degrees,
but this diminution is relatively small, so that the principal part of the
change in intensity oceurs between 89 and 90 degrees. I was not able
to detect any difference in kind between rays emitted at different
angles.

In consequence of the distribution of intensity of X-rays, just
described, it follows that images of the platinum plate formed in the
pinhole camera, whether upon the photographie plate or the fluorescent
screen, will be more intense the greater the angle which is made by the
platinum plate with the screen or photographie film, providing this
angle does not exceed 80 degrees. By appropriate arrangements which
enabled me to make a comparison between images formed simultane-
ously by radiations from the same tube on screens at various angles
this result was confirmed. <A similar case of intensity distribution is
-found in optics in connection with fluorescence. If a few drops of a
solution of fluorescein be allowed to fall into a square trough of water,
and the trough be illuminated by white or violet light, it will be noticed
that the brightest fluorescent light goes out from the edges of the
slowly sinking column of fluorescein, or, in other words, from the places
where the angle of emanation of the fluorescent light is the greatest.
As Stokes has remarked, referring to a similar experiment, this appear-
ance depends upon the fact that the light exciting the fluorescence is
considerably more absorbed by the fluorescein solution than is the fluo-
rescent light. It is worth mentioning that the cathode rays which
generate the X-rays are much more strongly absorbed by platinum
than the X-rays, and it may therefore be surmised that there-exists a
similarity between these two processes, the conversion of light into
fluorescent. light and the conversion of cathode rays into X-rays.
There is as yet, however, no firm ground on which to rest such a
conclusion.

With reference to practical applications, the observation of the dis-
tribution of intensity of the rays proceeding from the platinum plate
has some value in connection with the formation of shadow pictures
by means of X-rays. In accordance with the observations above
recorded it is to be recommended that the discharge tube be so arranged
that the rays employed for formation of pictures be those making
a large angle, though not much exceeding 80 degrees, with the plati-
num plate. In this way the sharpest possible delineation will be
obtained, and if the platinum plate is flat and the construction of the
tube such that the rays proceeding obliquely pass through not much
greater thickness of glass than those going out at right angles to the
platinum plate, then no material loss in intensity will be experienced
in this arrangement.

4, In my first communication I designated as the transmissibility of
150 THE X-RAYS.

a body the ratio of a brightness which a fluorescent screen held behind
the body at right angles to the rays bears to its brightness in the abseiee
of the interposed body, but nnder conditions otherwise identical.
Referring the transmissibility to unit thickness we obtain what may
be called the specific transmissibility. This will be the dth root of the
transmissibility where d is the thickness of the transmitting layer
measured along the direction of the rays. In order to determine the
transmissibility I have since my first communication made use princi-
pally of the photometer described above. The two parts of the fluores-
cent screen having been brought to equal brightness, the plate of the
substance to be investigated, as for instance, aluminum, tin, glass, etc.,
was interposed before one of the tubes, and the distance of one or
other of the discharge tubes was altered so that the screen became
again uniformly illuminated. The ratio between the squares of the dis-
tances of the platinum plates from the screen before and after the inter-
position of the body under investigation gives the value of the
transmissibility sought. By interposing a second plate its transmissi-
bility may be found for rays which have already passed through one.
plate of the same kind.

In this procedure it is assumed that the brightness of a fluorescent
screen is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the
source of the rays, and this can only be the case on condition, first, that
the air absorbs or emits no X-rays, and, second, that the brightness of
the fluorescent light is proportional to the intensity of the radiation
falling upon it. The first condition is certainly not fulfilled, and itis
questionable whether the second is or not. I have therefore first satis-
fied myself, as already set forth in section 10 of my first communieation,
that the deviations from strict proportionality are so slight as to be
negligible for the purposes of experiment in the case at hand. Again,
with reference to the fact that X-rays are secondarily radiated from
bodies under their influence, it may be remarked, first, that no differ-
ence was to be detected with the photometer between the transmissi-
bility of a single plate of aluminum 0.925 millimeter thick, and of 31
superposed plates each of 0.0299 millimeter thickness, giving a total
thickness of 0.927 millimeter; and, second, that the brightness of the
fluorescent screen was not appreciably different whether the piate was
placed close up to the screen or at a considerable distance from it.

The results of these experiments on transmissibility are for aluminum

THE X-RAYS. 151

From these and similar experiments with glass and tin we may draw
the following result: if a body be imagined to be made up of successive
layers with their faces perpendicular to the direction of the X-rays,
each of these layers will be more transmissible than the one next pre-
ceding. In other words, the specific transmissibility of a body is greater
the thicker the body. This result is completely in accord with obser-
vations which may be made by photography of a tin scale as described
in section 4 of my first communication, and also with the fact that
oceasionally in photographic shadow pictures, the shadows of thin lay-
ers, aS for example the paper used in wrapping the plate, came out
relatively strongly.

5. If two plates of different substances are equally transmissible
this equality will not in general be retained for another pair of plates
of the same substances with thicknesses altered in the same ratio.
This fact may be shown very easily by the use of thin sheets, as, for
example, of platinum and aluminum. I used for this purpose platinum
foil 0.0026 millimeter thick and aluminum foil 0.0299 millimeter thick.
I found in one instance that one sheet of platinum was equally trans-
missible with six sheets of aluminum; but the transmissibility of two
sheets of platinum was less than that of twelve sheets of aluminum
and about equal to that of sixteen sheets of the latter metal. Using
another discharge tube, I found 1 platinum equal 8 aluminum but 8
platinum equal 90 aluminum. From these experiments it follows that
the ratio of thicknesses of platinum and aluminum of equal trans-
missibility is less the thicker the sheets under examination.

6. The ratio of the thicknesses of two equally transmissible plates of
different material is dependent on the thickness and the material of
the body, as, for instance, the glass wall of the discharge tube, through
which the rays have to pass betore they reach the plates investigated.
x * *

7. The experiments described in sections 4, 5, and 6 relate to the
alterations which the X-rays proveeding from a discharge tube experi-
ence in their transmission through different substances. It will now
be shown that one and the same body may for the same thickness be
unequally transmissible for rays emitted from different discharge
tubes.

In the following table are given the values of the transmissibility of
an aluminum plate 2 millimeters thick for the rays given out by
different tubes:

millimeter thick aluminum plate ..........---.---. 0. 0044 0. 22 0. 30 0.39

The discharge tubes were not materially different in their construction
or in the thickness of their glass wall, but varied in the density of the
152 THE X-RAYS.

gas within them, and hence in the potential required to produce dis-
charge. Tube 1 required the least and tube 5 the greatest potential,
or, as we Inay say for short, the tube 1 is the “softest” and tube 5 the
a mantles.” The same ai korff in direct connection with the tubes,
the same circuit breaker, and the same current strength in the primary
circuit were used in all cases.

Various other substances which I have investigated behaved simi-
larly to aluminum. All are more transmissible to rays from harder
tubes. ‘This fact seemed to me particularly worthy of attention.

The relative transmissibility of plates of different substances proved
also to be dependent on the hardness of the discharge tube employed.
The ratio of the thickness of platinum and aluminum plates of equal
transmissibility becomes less the harder the tubes from which the rays
proceed, or, referring to the results just given, the less the rays are
absorbed.

The different behavior of rays excited in tubes of different hardness
is also made apparent in the well-known shadow picturing of hands, ete.
With a soft tube a dark shadow is obtained in which the bones are little
prominent; when a harder tube is used the bones are very distinct and
visible in all their details, whereas the softer portions are less marked,
and with very hard tubes even the bones themselves become only weak
shadows. From these considerations it appears that the choice of the
tube must be governed by the character of the objects which it is desired
to portray.

5. It remains to remark that the quality of rays proceeding from one
and the same tube depends on various conditions. Of these the most
important are the following: (1) The action of the interrupter,’ or, in
other words, the course of the primary current. In this connection
should be mentioned the phenomena frequently observed that particular
ones of the rapidly sueceeding discharges excite X-rays which are not
only more intense, but which also differ from the others in their absorp-
tion. (2) The character of the sparks which appear in the secondary
circuit of the apparatus. (3) The employment of a Tesla transformer.
(4) The degree of evacuation of the discharge tube (as already stated).
(0) The varying, but as yet not satisfactorily known, procedure within
the discharge tube. Separate ones among these conditions require
_ further comment. * eS hea

The hardness of a tube had been considered to be brought about
solely by the continuation of the evacuation by means of the pump;
but this characteristic is affected in other ways. Thus a sealed tube
of medium hardness becomes gradually harder by itself—unfortunately
to the shortening of the period of its usefulness when used in a suitable
manuer for the production of X-rays, that is to say when discharges
which do not cause the platinum to glow or at least to glow only weakly
are assed through. <A gradual self-evacuation is thus effected.

WON oat Damier Fntionampter FOES 4 more reg ellos hem a Heupel oe ine:
the latter, however, conserves the primary current better.
THE X-RAYS. 153

With a tube thus become very hard I took a very fine photograph of
a double-barreled gun with inserted cartridges, which showed all the
details of the cartridges, the inner faults of the Damascus barrels, etc.,
very sharply and distinctly. The distance from the platinum plate of
the discharge tube to the photographic plate was 15 centimeters and
the exposure twelve minutes—comparatively long in consequence of
the small photographic action of the very slightly absorbable rays (see
below). The Duprez interrupter had to be replaced by the Foucault
form. It would be of interest to construct tubes which would make it
possible to use still higher potentials than before.

Self-evacuation has been above assigned as the cause of the growing
hardness of sealed tubes, but this is not the only cause. There are
changes in the electrodes which produce this effect. I donot know the
nature of these changes. * * *

The observations recorded in these paragraphs and others not given
have led me to the view that the composition of the rays proceeding
from a platinum anode of a discharge tube depends upon the frequency
and form of the discharge current. The degree of tenuity, the hard-
ness, is important only because the form of the discharge is thereby
influenced. If it were possible to produce the proper form of discharge
for the generation of X-rays in any other way, the X-rays might be
obtained with relatively high pressures.

9. The results appearing in the five preceding paragraphs have been
those most evidently to be derived from the accompanying experiments.
Summing up these separate results, and being guided in part by the
analogy which holds between the behavior of the visible radiations and
X-rays, one arrives at the following conclusions:

(a) The radiations emitted by a discharge tube consist of a mixture
of rays of different absorbability and intensity.

(b) The composition of this mixture is in a marked degree dependent
on the frequency and form of the discharge current.

(c) The rays receiving preference in absorption vary with different
bodies.

(d) Since the X-rays are generated by the cathode rays and have in
common with them various characteristics—as the exciting of fluores-
cence, photographic and electrical actions, an absorbability depending
in a marked degree on the density of the medium traversed, etc.—the
conjecture 1s prompted that both phenomena are processes of the same
nature. Without committing myself unconditionally to this view, I
‘may remark that the results of the last paragraphs are calculated to
raise a difficulty in the way of this hypothesis. This difficulty consists
in the great difference between the absorption of the cathode rays
imvestigated by Lenard and the X-rays, and second that the transmissi-
bility of bodies for the cathode rays is related to their density by other
laws than those which govern their transmissibility for X-rays.

With regard to the first point, considerations present themselves
under two heads: (1) As we have seen in section 7, there are X-rays of
154 THE X-RAYS.

different absorbability, and the investigations of Hertz and Lenard
show that the cathode rays are similarly to be discriminated. While
the “softest” tubes investigated generated rays much less subject to
absorption than any cathode rays investigated by Lenard, yet there ts
no reason to doubt the possibility of X-rays of greater absorbability,
and cathode rays of less. It therefore appears probable that in future
investigations rays will be found bridging over the gap between X-rays
and cathode rays, so far as their absorption is concerned. (2) We
found in section 4 that the specific transmissibility of a body becomes
less the thinner the plate passed through. Consequently, had we made
use in our experiments of plates as thin as those employed by Lenard
it would have been found that the X-rays were more nearly like those
of Lenard in their absorbability.

10. Besides the fluorescent phenomena, there may be excited by
X-rays photographic, electric, and other actions, and it is of interest to
know how far these various manifestations vary in similar ratio when
the source of the rays is altered. I must restrict myself to a compari-
son of the first two phenomena. * * *

A hard and a soft tube were so adjusted as to give equally bright
fluorescence as compared by means of the photometer described in sec- :
tion 2. Upon substituting a photographic plate in the place of the
fluorescent screen it was found, on development, that the portion sub-
ject to the rays from the hard tube was blackened to a less degree than
the other. The rays, though producing equal fluorescence, were thus
for photographie purposes unequally active. * * *

The great sensitiveness of a photographic plate even for rays from
tubes of medium hardness is illustrated by an experiment in which 96
films were superposed, placed at a distance of 25 centimeters from the
discharge tube, and exposed five minutes with due precautions to pro-
tect the films from the radiations of the air. A photographic action
was apparent on the last film, although the first was scarcely over-
CxMosedi es yaaa

If the intensity of the radiations is augmented by increasing the
strength of the primary current, the photographic action increases in
the same measure as the intensity of the fluorescence. In this case, as
in the case where the intensity of the radiation was increased by an
alteration of the (distance of the fluorescent screen, the brightness of
the fluorescence is at least approximately proportional to the intensity
of the radiation. This rule should not, however, be too generally
applied.

11. In conclusion, mention should be made of the following particu-
lars:

With a discharge tube of proper construction, and not too soft, the
X-rays are chiefly generated in a spot of not more than 1 or 2 milli-
meters diameter where the cathode rays meet the platinum plate. This,
however, is not the sole source. The whole plate and a part of the tube
THE X-RAYS. 155

walls emit X-rays, though in less intensity. Cathode rays proceed in
all directions, but their intensity is considerable only near the axis of
the concave cathode mirror, and, consequently, the X-rays are strongly
emitted only near the point where this axis meets the platinum plate.
When the tube is very hard and the platinum thin, many rays proceed
also from the rear surface of the platinum plate, but, as may be shown
by the pinhole camera, chiefly from the spot lying on the axis of the
MMNMUG TOT: sey et ps

I can confirm the observation of G. Brandes that the X-rays are able
to produce a sensation of light upon the retina of the eye. In my record
book appears a notice entered in the early part of November, 1895, to
the effect that when in a darkened chamber near a wooden door I per-
ceived a weak appearance of light when a Hittorf tube upon the other
side of the door was put in operation. Since this appearance was only
once observed, I regarded it as a subjective, and the reason that it was
not then repeatedly observed lay in the fact that other tubes were sub-
stituted for the Hittorf tube which were less completely evacuated
and not provided with platinum anodes. The Hittorf tube furnishes
rays of slight absorbability on account of its high vacuum, and, at the
same time, of great intensity on account of the employment of a platinum
anode for the reception of the cathode rays. * * *

With the tubes now in use I can easily repeat the Brandes experi-
DAMS

Since the beginning of my investigation of X-rays I have repeatedly
endeavored to produce diffraction phenomena with them. I obtained
at various times, when using narrow slits, appearances similar to
diffraction effects, but when modifications were made in the conditions
for the purpose of thoroughly proving the accuracy of this explanation
of the phenomena it was found in each case that the appearances were
produced in other ways than by diffraction. I know of no experiment
which gives satisfactory evidence of the existence of diffraction with
the X-rays.

CATHODE RAYS.!
By Prof. J. J. THomson, I. R. 8.

The first observer to leave any record of what are now known as
the cathode rays seems to have been Pliicker, who in 1859 observed
the now well-known green phosphorescence on the glass in the neigh-
borhood of the negative electrode. Pliicker was the first physicist to
make experiments on the discharge through a tube in a state anything
approaching what we should now call a high vacuum. He owed the
opportunity to do this to his fellow-townsman Giessler, who first made
such vacua attainable. Pliicker, who had made a very minute study
of the effect of a magnetic field on the ordinary discharge which
stretches from one terminal to the other, distinguished the discharge
which produced the green phosphorescence from the ordinary dis-
charge by the difference in its behavior when in a magnetic field.
Pliicker ascribed these phosphorescent patches to currents of elec:
tricity which went from the cathode to the walls of the tube and then
for some reason or other retraced their steps.

The subject was next taken up by Pliicker’s pupil, Hittorf, who
greatly extended our knowledge of the subject, and to whom we owe
the observation that a solid body placed between a pointed cathode
and the walls of the tube cast a well-defined shadow. This observa-
tion was extended by Goldstein, who found that a well marked, though
not very sharply defined, shadow was cast by a small body placed
near a cathode of considerable area. This was a very important obser-
vation, for it showed that the rays casting the shadow came in a defi-
nite direction from the cathode. If the eathode were replaced by a
luminous disk of the same size, this disk would not cast a shadow of
a small object placed near it, for though the object might intercept the
rays which came out normally from the disk, yet enough light would be
given out sideways from other parts of the disk to prevent the shadow
being at all well marked. Goldstein seems to have been the first to
advance the theory, which has attained a good deal of prevalence in

158 CATHODE RAYS.

The physicist, however, who did more than any one else to direct
attention to these rays was Mr. Crookes, whose experiments, by their
beauty and importance, attracted the attention of all physicists to this
subject, and who not only greatly increased our knowledge of the
properties of the rays, but by his application of them to radiant matter
spectroscopy has rendered them most important agents in chemical
research.

Recently a great renewal of interest in these rays has taken place,
owing to the remarkable properties possessed by an offsprings of theirs,
for the cathode rays are the parents of the Rontgen rays.

I shall confine myself this evening to endeavoring to give an account
of some of the more recent investigations which have been made on the
cathode rays. In the first place, when these rays fall on a substance
they produce changes physical or chemical in the nature of the sub-
stance. In some cases this change is marked by a change in the color
of the substance, as in the case of the chlorides of the alkaline metals.
Goldstein found that these, when exposed to the cathode rays, changed
color, the change, according to HK. Wiedemann and Ebert, being due to
the formation of a subchloride. Elster and Geitel have recently shown
that these substances become photo-electric—i. e., acquire the power of
discharging negative electricity under the action of light after expo-
sure to the cathode rays. But though it is only in comparatively few
eases that the change produced by the cathode rays shows itself in
such a conspicuous way as by a change of color, there is a much more
widely spread phenomenon, which shows the permanence of the effect
produced by the impact of these rays. This is the phenomenon called
by its discoverer, Prof. E. Wiedemann, thermoluminescence. Professor
Wiedemann finds that if bodies are exposed to the cathode rays for
some time, when the bombardment stops the substance resumes to all
appearance its original condition. When, however, we heat the sub-
stance, we find that a change has taken place; for the substance now,
when heated, becomes luminous at a comparatively low temperature, one
far below that of incandescence. The substance retains this property
for months after the exposure to the rays has ceased. The phenom-
enon of thermoluminescence is especially marked in bodies which are
called by Van t’Hoff solid solutions. These are formed when two salts,
one greatly in excess of the other, are simultanoously precipitated from
a solution. Under these circumstances the connection between the
salts seems of a more intimate character than that existing in a mechan-
ical mixture. I have here a solid solution of CaSo, with trace of
MnSo,, and you will see that after exposure to the cathode rays it
becomes luminous when heated. Another proof of the alteration pro-
duced by these rays is the fact, discovered by Crookes, that after glass
has been exposed for a long time to the impact of these rays, the
intensity of its phosphorescence is less than when the rays first began
to fall upon it. This alteration lasts for a long time, certainly for
months, and Mr. Crookes has shown that it is able to survive the heat-

ing up of the glass to allow of the remaking of the bulb. I will now
leave the chemical effects produced by these rays and pass on to con-
sider their behavior when in a magnetie field.

First, let us consider for a moment the effect of magnetic force on
the ordinary discharge between terminals at a pressure much higher
than that at which the cathode rays begin to come off. I have here
photographs (see figs. 1 and 2, Pl. I) of the spark in a magnetic field.
You see that when the discharge, which passes as a thin bright line
between the terminals, is acted upon by the magnetic field it is-pulled
aside as a stretched string would be if acted upon by a force at right
angles to its length. The curve is quite continuous, and though there
may be gaps in the luminosity of the discharge, yet there are no breaks
at such points in the curve, into which the discharge is bent by a mag-
net. Again, if the discharge, instead of taking place between points
passes between flat discs, the effect of the magnetic force is to move
the sparks as a whole, the sparks keeping straight until their termina-
tions reach the edges of the dises. The fine thread-like discharge is
not much spread out by the action of the magnetic field. The appear-
ance of the discharge indicates that when the discharge passes through
the gas it manufactures out of the gas something stretching from ter-
minal to terminal, which, unlike a gas, is capable of sustaining a ten-
sion. The amount of deflection produced, other circumstances being
the same, depends on the nature of the gas. As the photographs (figs.
3 and 4, Pl. 1) show, the defiection is very small in the case of hydrogen
and very considerable in the case of carbonic acid. As a general rule
if seems smaller in elementary than in compound gases.

Let us contrast the behavior of this kind of discharge under the
action of a magnetic tield with that of the cathode rays. I have here
some photographs (PI. IT) taken of a narrow beam formed by sending
the cathode rays through a tube in which there was a plug with a slit
in it, the plug being used as an anode and connected with the earth,
these rays traversing a uniform magnetic field. The narrow beam
spreads out under the action of the magnetic force into a broad fan-
Shaped luminosity in the gas. The luminosity in this fan is not
uniformly distributed, but is condensed along certain lines. The
phosphorescence produced when the rays reach the glass is also not
uniformly distributed. It is much spread out, showing that the beam
consists of rays which are not all deflected to the same extent by the
magnet. The luminous patch on the glass is crossed by bands along
which the luminosity is very much greater than in the adjacent parts.
These bright and dark bands are called by Birkeland, who first observed
them, ‘“‘the magnetic spectrum.” The brightest places on the glass
are by no means always the terminations of the brightest streaks of
luminosity in the gas; in fact, in some cases a very bright spot on the
glass is not connected with the cathode by any appreciable luminosity,
though there is plenty of luminosity in other parts of the gas.

One very interesting point brought out by the photographs is that
160 CATHODE RAYS.

in a given magnetic field, with a given mean potential difference between
the terminals, the path of the rays is independent of the nature of the
gas. Photographs. were taken of the discharge in hydrogen, air, car-
bonic acid, methyl iodide, i. e., in gases whose densities range from
1 to 70, and yet not only were the paths of the most deflected rays the
same in all cases, but even the details, such as the distribution of the
bright and dark spaces, were the same; in fact, the photographs could
hardly be distinguished from one another. It is to be noted that the
pressures were not the same; the pressures were adjusted until the mean
potential difference was the same. When the pressure of the gas is
lowered, the potential difference between the terminals increases, and the
deflection of the rays produced by a magnet diminishes, or at any rate
the deflection of the rays where the phosphorescence is a maximum
diminishes. If an air break is inserted in the circuit an effect of the same
kind is produced. In all the photographs of the cathode rays one sees
indications of rays which stretch far into the bulb, but which are not
deflected at all by a magnet. Though they stretch for some 2 or 3
miles, yet in none ot these photographs do they actually reach the glass.
In some experiments, however, I placed inside the tube a screen, near
to the slit through which the cathode rays came, and found that no
appreciable phosphorescence was produced when the non deflected
rays struck the screen, while there was vivid phosphorescence at the
places where the deflected rays struck the screen. ‘These non deflected
rays do not seem to exhibit any of the characteristics of cathode rays,
and it seems possible that they are merely jets of uncharged luminous
gas shot out through the slit from the neighborhood of the cathode by
a kind of explosion when the discharge passes.

The curves described by the cathode rays in a uniform magnetic field
are, very approximately at any rate, circular for a large part of their
course. This is the path which would be described if the cathode rays
marked the path of negatively electrified particles projected with great
velocities from the neighborhood of the negative electrode. Indeed, all
the effects produced by a magnet on these rays, and some of these are
complicated, as, for example, when the rays are curled up into spirals
under the action of a magnetic force, are in exact agreement with the
consequences of this view.

We can, moreover, show by direct: experiment that a charge of nega-
tive electricity follows the course of the cathode rays. One way in
which this has been done is by an experiment due to Perrin, the details
of which are shown in the accompanying illustration. In this exper-
iment the rays are allowed to pass inside a metallic cylinder through a
small hole, and the cylinder, when these rays enter it, gets a negative
charge, while if the rays are deflected by a magnet, so as to escape the
hole, the cylinder remains without charge. It seems to me that to the
experiment in this form it might be objected that, though the experi-
ment shows that negatively electrified bodies are projected normally

from the cathode and are deflected by a magnet, it does not show that
when the cathode rays are deflected by a magnet the path of the elec-
trified particles coincides with the path of the cathode rays. The sup-
porters of the theory that these rays are waves in the ether might say,
and indeed have said, that while they did not deny that electrified
particles might be shot off from the cathode, these particles were, in
their opinion, merely accidental accompaniments of the rays, and had
no more to do with the rays than the bullet has with the flash of a rifle.
The following modification of Perrin’s experiment is not, however, open
to this objection: Two coaxial cylinders with slits cut in them, the
outer cylinder being connected with earth, the inner with the elec-
trometer, are placed in the discharge tube, but in such a position that
the cathode rays do not fall upon them unless deflected by a magnet.
By means of a magnet, however, we can deflect the cathode rays until
they fall on the slit in the cylinder. If under these circumstances the
cylinder gets a negative charge when the cathode rays fall on the slit,
and remains uncharged unless they do so, we may conclude, I think,
the stream of negatively electrified particles is an invariable accom-
paniment of the cathode rays. I will now try the experiment. You
notice that when there is no magnetic force, though the rays do not fall
on the cylinder, there is a slight deflection of the electrometer, showing
that it has acquired a smail negative charge. This is, I think, due to
the plug getting negatively charged under the torrent of negatively
electrified particles from the cathode, and getting out cathode rays on
its own account which have not come through the slit. I will now
deflect the rays by a magnet, and you will see that at first there is little
or no change in the deflection of the electrometer, but that when the
rays reach the cylinder there is at once a great increase in the deflection,
showing that the rays are pouring a charge of negative electricity into
the cylinder. The deflection of the electrometer reaches a certain
value and then stops and remains constant, though the rays continue
to pour into the cylinder. This is due to the fact that the gas traversed
by the cathode rays becomes a conductor of electricity, and thus, though
the inner cylinder is perfectly insulated when the rays are not passing,
yet as soon as the rays pass through the bulb the air between the inner
cylinder and the outer one, which is connected with the earth, becomes
a conductor, and the electricity escapes from the inner cylinder to the
earth. For this reason the charge within the inner cylinder does not
go on continually increasing. The cylinder settles into a state of equi-
librium in which the rate at which it gains negative electricity from the
rays is equal to the rate at which it loses it by conduction through the
air. If we charge up the cylinder positively it rapidly loses its positive
charge and acquires a negative one, whileif we chargeit up negatively it
will leak if its initial negative potential is greater than its equilibrium
value.

I have lately made some experiments which are interesting from the

sm 97——11
162 CATHODE RAYS.

bearing they have on the charges carried by the cathode rays, as well ©
as on the production of cathode rays outside the tube. The experi-
ments are of the following kind: In the tube (see fig.) A and B are
terminals. C is a long side tube into which a closed metallic cylinder
fits lightly. This cylinder is made entirely of metal, except the end
farthest from the terminals, which is stopped by an ebonite plug, per-
forated by a small hole so as to make the pressure inside the cylinder
equal to that in the discharge tube. Inside the cylinder there is a
metal disk supported by a metal rod which passes through the ebonite
plug and is connected with an electrometer, the wires making this con-
nection being surrounded by tubes connected with the earth so as to
screen off electrostatic induction. If the end of the cylinder is made
of thin aluminum about one-twentieth of a millimeter thick, and a dis- —
charge sent between the terminals, A being the cathode, then at pres-
sures far higher than those at which the cathode rays come off, the disk
inside the cylinder acquires a positive charge; and if it is charged up
independently the charge leaks away, and it leaks more rapidly when
the disk is charged negatively than when it is charged positively. There
is, however, a leak in both cases, showing that conduction has taken
place through the gas between the cylinder and the disk. As the pres-
sure in the tube is diminished the positive charge on the disk diminishes
until it becomes unappreciable. The leak from the disk, when it is
charged still continues, and is now equally rapid, whether the original
charge on the disk is positive or negative. When the pressure falls so
low that cathode rays begin to fall on the end of the cylinder, then the
disk acquires a negative charge, and the leak from the disk is more
rapid when it is charged positively than when it is charged negatively.
If the cathode rays are pulled off the end of the cylinder by a magnet,
then the negative charge on the disk and the rate of leak from the disk
when it is positively charged is very much diminished. A very inter-
esting point is that these effects, due to the cathode rays, are observed
behind comparatively thick walls. I have here a cylinder whose base
is brass about 1 millimeter thick, and yet when this is exposed to the
cathode rays the disk behind it gets a negative charge, and leaks if
charged positively. The effect is small, compared with that in the
cylinder with the thin aluminum base, but is quite appreciable. With
the cylinder with the thick end I have never been able to observe any
effect at the higher pressure when no cathode rays were coming -off.
The effect with the cylinder with the thin end was observed when the
discharge was produced by a large number of small storage cells, as
well as when it was produced by an induction coil.

It would seem from this experiment that the incidence of the cathode
rays on a brass plate as much as 1 millimeter thick and connected with
the earth can put a rarefied gas shielded by the plate into a condition
in which it can conduct electricity, and that a body placed behind
this screen gets a negative charge, so that the side of the brass away

from the cathode rays acts itself like a cathode, though kept perma-
nently to earth. In the case of the thick brass the effect seems much
more likely to be due to a sudden change in the potential of the outer
cylinder at the places where the rays strike rather than to the penetra-
tion of any kinds of waves or rays. If the discharge in the tube was
perfectly continuous the potential of the outer cylinder would be con-
stant, and since it is connected to earth by a wire through which no
considerable current flows, the potential must be approximately that of
the earth. The discharge there can not be continuous; the negative
charge must come in gusts against the ends of the cylinder, coming so
suddenly that the electricity has no time to distribute itself over the
cylinder so as to shield off the inside from the electrostatic action of
the cathode rays; this force penetrates the cylinder and produces a
discharge of electricity from the far side of the brass.

Another effect which I believe is due to the negative electrification
carried by the rays is the following: In a very highly exhausted tube
provided with a metal plug I have sometimes observed, after the coil
has been turned off, bright patches on the glass. These are deflected
by a magnet and seem to be caused by the plug getting such a large
negative charge that the negative electricity continues to stream from
it after the coil is stopped.

An objection sometimes urged against the view that these cathode
rays consist of charged particles is that they are not deflected by an
electrostatic force. If, for example, we make, as Hertz did, the rays
pass between plates connected with a battery, so that an electrostatic
force acts between these plates, the cathode ray is able to traverse this
space without being deflected one way or the other. We must remem-
ber, however, that the cathode rays when they pass through a gas make
it a conductor, so that the gas, acting like a conductor, screens off the
electric force from the charged particle, and when the plates are
immersed in the gas, and a definite potential difference established be-
tween the plates, the conductivity of the gas close to the cathode rays
is probably enormously greater than the average conductivity of the
gas between the plates, and the potential gradient on the cathode rays
is therefore very small compared with the average potential gradient.
We can, however, produce electrostatic results if we put the conductors
which are to deflect the rays in the dark space next the cathode. I
have here a tube in which, inside the dark space next the cathode, two
conductors are inserted; the cathode rays start from the cathode, and
have to pass between these conductors; if, now, [ connect one of these
conductors to earth there is a decided deflection of the cathode rays,
while if I connect the other electrode to earth there is a deflection in
the opposite direction. I ascribe this deflection to the gas in the dark
space either not being a conductor at all, or if a conductor, a poor
one compared to the gas in the main body of the tube.

Goldstein has shown that if a tube is furnished with two cathodes,
164 CATHODE RAYS.

when the rays from one cathode pass near the other they are repelled
from it. This is just what wouid happen if the dark space round the
electrode were an insulator, and so able to transmit electrostatic
attractions or repulsions. To show that the gas in the dark space
differs in its properties from the rest of the gas, I will try the follow-
ing experiment. I have here two spherical bulbs connected together
by a glass tube; one of these bulbs is small, the other large; they
each contain a cathode, and the pressure of the gas is such that the
dark space round the cathode in the small bulb completely fills the
bulb, while that round the one in the larger bulb does not extend
to the walls of the bulb. The two bulbs are wound with wire, which
connects the outsides of two Leyden jars; the insides of these jars
are connected with the terminals of a Wimshurst machine. When
sparks pass between these terminals currents pass through the wire
which induce currents in the bulbs, and cause a ring discharge to
pass through them. Things are so arranged that the ring is faint in
the larger bulb, bright in the smaller one. On making the wires in
these bulbs cathodes, however, the discharge in the small bulb, which
is filled by the dark space, is completely stopped, while that in the
larger one becomes brighter. Thus the gas in the dark space is
changed, and in the opposite way from that in the rest of the tube.
It is remarkable that when the coil is stopped the ring discharge on
both bulbs stops, and it is some time before it starts again.

The deflection excited on each other by two cathodic streams would
seem to have a great deal to do with the beautiful phosphorescent fig-
ures which Goldstein obtained by using cathodes of different shapes.
I have here two bulbs containing cathodes shaped like a cross. They
are curved and of the same radius as the bulb, so thatif the rays came
off these cathodes normally the phosphorescent picture ought to be a
cross of the same size as the cathode. You see that in one of the bulbs
the image of the cross consists of two large sectors at right angles to
each other, bounded by bright lines, and in the other, which is at a
lower pressure, the geometrical image of the cross instead of being
bright is dark, while the luminosity occupies the space between the
arms of the cross.

So far I have only considered the behavior of the cathode rays inside
the bulb, but Lenard has been able to get these rays outside the tube.
To do this he let the rays fall on a window in the tube, made of thin alu-
minum about one one-hundredth of a millimeter thick, and he found that
from this window there proceeded in all directions rays which were
deflected by a magnet, and which produced phosphorescence when
they fell upon certain substances, notably upon tissue paper soaked in
a solution of pentadekaparalolylketon. The very thin aluminum is
difficult to get, and Mr. McClelland has found that if itis not neces-
sary to maintain the vacuum for a long time oiled silk answers admi-
rably for a window. As the window is small, the phosphorescent patch

CATHODE RAYS. 165

produced by it is not bright, so that I will show instead the other prop-

erty of the cathode rays—that of carrying with them a negative charge.
I will place this cylinder in front of the hole, connect it with the elec-
trometer, turn on the rays, and you will see the cylinder gets a nega-
tive charge. Indeed, this charge is large enough to produce the well-
known negative figures when the rays fall on a piece of ebonite which
is afterwards dusted with a mixture of red lead and sulphur.

From the experiments with the closed eylinder we have seen that
when the negative rays come up to a surface even as thick as a milli-
meter the opposite side of that surface acts like a cathode and gives
off the cathodic rays, and from this point of view we can understand
the very interesting result of Lenard that the magnetic deflection of
the rays outside the tube is independent of the density and chemical
composition of the gas outside the tube, though it varies very much
with the pressure of the gas inside the tube. The cathode rays could
be started by an electric impulse, which would depend entirely on what
was going on inside the tube. Since the impulse is the same, the
momentum acquired by the particles outside would be the same, and,
as the curvature of the path only depends on the momentum, the
path of these particles outside the tube would only depend on the state
of affairs inside the tube.

The investigation by Lenard on the absorption of these rays shows
that there is more in his experiment than is covered by this considera-
tion. Lenard measured the distance these rays would have to travel
before the intensity of the rays fell to one-half their original value.
The results are given in the following table:

We see that though the densities and the coefficient of absorption
vary enormously, yet the ratio of the two varies very little, and the
results justify, I think, Lenard’s conclusion that the distance through
which these rays travel only depends on the density of the substance—
that is, the mass of matter per unit volume—and not upon the nature
of the matter.

These numbers raise a question which I have not yet touched upon,
and that is the size of the carriers of the electric charge. Are they or
are they not the dimensions of ordinary matter?
166 CATHODE RAYS.

We see from Lenard’s table that a cathode ray can travel through
air at atmospheric pressure a distance of about half a centimeter
before the brightness of the phosphorescence falls to about one-half of
its original value. Now the mean free path of the molecule of air at
this pressure is about 10~° centimeters, and if a molecule of air were pro-
jected it would lose half its momentuin in a space comparable with the
mean free path. Even if we suppose that it is not the same molecule
that is carried, the effect of the obliquity of the collisions would reduce
the momentum to one-half in a short multiple of that path.

Thus, from Lenard’s experiments on the absorption of the rays out-
side the tube, it follows, on the hypothesis that the cathode rays are
charged particles, moving with high velocities, that the size of the
carriers must be small compared with the dimensions of ordinary
atoms or molecules. The assumption of a state of matter more finely
subdivided than the atom of an element is a somewhat startling one;
but an hypothesis that would involve somewhat similar consequences,
viz, that the so-called elements are compounds of some primordial
element, has been put forward from time to time by various chemists.
Thus, Prout believed that the atoms of all the elements were built up
of atoms of hydrogen, and Mr. Norman Lockyer has advanced weighty
arguments, founded on spectroscopic consideration, in favor of the
composite nature of the elements.

Let us trace the consequence of supposing that the atoms of the
elements are aggregations of very small particles, all similar to each
other. We shall call such particles corpuscles, so that the atoms of
the ordinary elements are made up of corpuscles and holes, the holes
being predominant. Let us suppose that at the cathode some of the
molecules of the gas get split up into these corpuscles, and that these,
charged with negative electricity and moving at a high velocity, form
the cathode rays. The distance these rays would travel before losing
a given fraction of their momentum would be proportional to the
mean free path of the corpuscles. Now, the things these corpuscles
strike against are other corpuscles, and not against the molecules as
a whole; they are supposed to be able to thread their way between
the interstices in the molecule. Thus the mean free path would be
proportional to the number of these corpuscles; and, therefore, since
each corpuscle has the same mass to the mass of unit volume—that
is, to the density of the substance, whatever be its chemical nature
or physical state, the mean free path, and therefore the coefficient
of absorption, would depend only on the density. This is precisely
Lenard’s result.

We see, too, on this hypothesis, why the magnetic deflection is the
same inside the tube, whatever be the nature of the gas, for the carriers
_ of the charge are the corpuscles, and these are the same whatever gas
be used. All the carriers may not be reduced to their lowest dimen-
sions; some may be aggregates of two or more corpuscles; these would
field we get

CATHODE RAYS. 167

be differently deflected from the single corpuscle; thus we should get
the magnetic spectrum.

I have endeavored by the following method to get a measurement of
the ratio of the mass of these corpuscles to the charge carried by them.
A double cylinder with slits in it, such as that used in a former experi-
ment, was placed in front of a cathode which was curved so as to
focus to some extent the cathode rays on the slit; behind the slit, in
the inner cylinder, a thermal junction was placed which covered the
opening so that all the rays which entered the slit struck against the
junction, the junction got heated, and knowing the thermal capacity of
the junction, we could get the mechanical equivalent of the heat com-
municated to it. The deflection of the electrometer gave the charge
which entered the cylinder. Thus, if there are N particles entering
the cylinder each with a charge e, and Q is the charge inside the cyl-
inder,

In an experiment made at a very low pressure, when the rays were
kept on for about one second, the charge was sufficient to raise a
capacity of 1-5 microfarads to a potential of 16 volts. Thus

The temperature of the thermo junction, whose thermal capacity was

stood by itself we might think that it was probable that e was greater —
than the atomic charge of atom rather than that m was less than the
mass of a hydrogen atom. ‘Taken, however, in conjunction with
Lenard’s results for the absorption of the cathode rays, these numbers
seem to favor the hypothesis that the carriers of the charges are
smaller than the atoms of hydrogen.

It is interesting to notice the value of e/m, which we have found
from the cathode rays, is of the same order as the value of 10~ deduced
by Zeeman from his experiments on the effect of a magnetic field on
the period of the sodium light.
STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGAT.!

By SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY.

The editor of The Annual has asked me to give matter of a somewhat
personal nature for a narrative account of my work in aerodromics.

The subject of flight interested me as long ago as I can remember
anything, but it was a communication from Mr. Lancaster, read at the
Buffalo meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, in 1886, which aroused my then dormant attention to the sub-
ject. What he said contained some remarkable but apparently mainly
veracious observations on the soaring bird, and some more or less para-
doxical assertions, which caused his communication to be treated with
less consideration than it might otherwise have deserved. Among
these latter was a statement that a model, somewhat resembling a soar-
ing bird, wholly inert, and without any internal power, could, neverthe-
less, under some circumstances, advance against the wind without
falling; which seemed to me then, as it did to members of the associa-
tion, an utter impossibility, but which I have since seen reason to
believe is, within limited conditions, theoretically possible.
- I was then engaged in the study of astrophysics at the Observatory
in Allegheny, Pa. The subject of mechanical flight could not be said
at that time to possess any literature, unless it were the publications of
the French and English aeronautical societies, but in these, as in every-
thing then accessible, fact had not yet always been discriminated from
fancy. Outside of these, almost everything was even less trustworthy ;
but though, after I had experimentally demonstrated certain facts,
anticipations of them were found by others on historical research, and
though we can now distinguish in retrospective examination what
would have been useful to the investigator if he had known it to be
true, there was no test of the kind to apply at the time. I went to
work, then, to find out for myself, and in my own way, what amount of
mechanical power was requisite to sustain a given weight in the air
and make it advance at a given speed, for this seemed to be an inquiry
which must necessarily precede any attempt at mechanical flight, which
was the very remote aim of my efforts.

170 STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

The work was commenced in the beginning of 1887 by the construc-
tion, at Allegheny, of a turntable of exceptional size, driven by asteam
engine, and this was used during three years in making the “ Experi-
ments in Aerodynamics,” which were published by the Smithsonian
Institution under that title in 1891. Nearly all the conclusions reached
were the result of direct experiment in an investigation which aimed to
take nothing on trust. Few of them were then familiar, though they
have since become so, and in this respect knowledge has advanced so
rapidly, that statements which were treated as paradoxical on my first
enunciation of them are now admitted truisms.

It has taken me, indeed, but a few years to pass through the period
when the observer hears that his alleged observation was a mistake;
the period when he is told that if it were true, it would be useless;
and the period when he is told that it is undoubtedly true, but that it
has always been known.

May I quote from the introduction to this book what was said in 1891?

‘“‘T have now been engaged since the beginning of .the year 1887 in
experiments on an extended scale for determining the possibilities of,
and the conditions for, transporting in the air a body whose specific
gravity is greater than that of the air, and I desire to repeat my con-
viction that the obstacles in its way are not such as have been thought;
that they lie more in such apparently secondary difficulties, as those of
guiding the body so that it may move in the direction desired and
ascend or descend with safety, than in what may appear to be primary
difficulties,due to the air itself,” and, 1 added, that in this field of
research I thought that we were, at that time (only six years since),
“in a relatively less advanced condition than the study of steam was
before the time of Newcomen.” It was also stated that the most import-
ant inference from those experiments as a whole was that mechanical
flight was possible with engines we could then build, as one horsepower
rightly applied could sustain over 200 pounds in the air at a horizontal
velocity of somewhat over 60 feet a second.

As this statement has been misconstrued, let me point out that it
refers to surfaces, used without guys or other adjuncts, which would
create friction; that the horsepower in question is that actually ex-
pended in the thrust, and that it is predicated only on a rigorously
horizontal flight. This implies a large deduction from the power in the
actual machine, where the brake horsepower of the engine, after a
requisite allowance for loss in transmission to the propellers and for
their slip on the air, will probably be reduced to from one-half to one-
quarter of its nominal amount; where there is great friction from the
enforced use of guys and other adjuncts; but, above all, where there is
no way to insure absolutely horizontal flight in free air. All these
things allowed for, however, since it seemed to me possible to provide
an engine which should give a horsepower for something like 10 pounds
of weight, there was still enough to justify the statement that we
STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT. 171

possessed in the steam engine, as then constructed or in other heat
engines, more than the indispensable power, though it was added that
this was not asserting that a system of supporting surfaces could be
securely guided through the air or safely brought to the ground,
and that these and like considerations were of quite another order,
and belonged to some inchoate art which I might provisionally call
aerdromics.

These important conclusions were reached before the actual publica-
tion of the volume, and a littie later others on the nature of the move-
ments of air, which were published under the title of “The internal
work of the wind” (Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, Volume
XX VII, 1893, No. 884). The latter were founded on experiments inde-
pendent of the former, and which led to certain theoretical conclusions
unverified in practice. Among the most striking, and perhaps para-
doxical of these, was that a suitably disposed free body might, under
certain conditions, be sustained in an ordinary wind, and even advance
against it without the expenditure of any energy from within.

The first stage of the investigation was now over, so far as that I
had satisfied myself that mechanical flight was possible with the power
we could hope to command, if only the art of directing that power
could be acquired.

The second stage (that of the acquisition of this art) I now decided
to take up. It may not be out of place to recall that at this time, only
Six years ago, a great many Scientific men treated the whole subject
with entire indifference, as unworthy of attention, or as outsideof legiti-
mate research, the proper field of the charlatan, and one on which it
was scarcely prudent for a man with a reputation to lose to enter.

The record of my attempts to acquire the art of flight may commence
with the year 1889, when I procured a stuffed frigate bird, a California
condor, and an albatross, and attempted to move them upon the whirl-
ing table at Allegheny. The experiments were very imperfect and the
records are unfortunately lost, but the important conclusion to which
they led was that a stuffed bird could not be made to soar except at
speeds which were unquestionably very much greater than what served
to sustain the living one, and the earliest experiments and ali subse-
quent ones with actually flying models have shown that thus far we
can not carry nearly the weights which Nature does to a given sustain-
ing surface without a power much greater than she employs. At the
time these experiments were begun, Penaud’s ingenious but toy-like
model was the only thing which could sustain itself in the air for even
a few seconds, and calculations founded upon its performance sustained
the conclusion that the amount of power required in actual free flight
was far greater than that demanded by the theoretical enunciation.
In order to learn under what conditions the aerodrome should be bal-
anced for horizontal flight, 1 constructed over thirty modifications of
the rubber-driven model, and spent many months in endeavoring from
172 STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

these to ascertain the laws of “balancing; ” that is, of stability leading ~
to horizontal flight. Most of these models had two propellers, and it
was extremely difficult to build them light and strong enough. Some
of them had superposed wings; some of them curved and some plane
wings; in some the propellers were side by side; in others one propeller
was at the front and the other at the rear, and so every variety of treat-
ment was employed, but all were at first too heavy, and only those flew
successfully which had from 3 to 4 feet of sustaining surface to a pound
of weight, a proportion which is far greater than Nature employs in
the soaring bird, where in some cases less than half a foot of sustain-
ing surface is used toa pound. It had been shown in the ‘“ Experi-
ments in aerodynamics” that the center of pressure on an inclined
plane advancing was not at the center of figure, but much in front of
it, and this knowledge was at first nearly all I possessed in balancing
these early aerodromes. Even in the beginning, also, I met remarkable
difficulty in throwing them into the air, and devised numerous forms
of launching apparatus which were all failures, and it was necessary to
keep the construction on so small a scale that they could be cast from
the hand.

The earliest actual flights with these were extremely irregular and
brief, lasting only from three to four seconds. They were made at
Allegheny in March, 1891, but these and all subsequent ones were so
erratic and so short that it was possible to learn very little from them.
Penaud states that he once obtained a flight of thirteen seconds. I
never got as much as this, but ordinarily little more than half as
much, and came to the conclusion that in order to learn the art of
mechanical flight it was necessary to have a model which would keep
in the air for at any rate a longer period than these, and move more
steadily. Itubber twisted in the way that Penaud used it will practi-
cally give about 300 foot-pounds to a pound of weight, and at least as
much must be allowed for the weight of the frame on which the rubber
is strained. Twenty pounds of rubber and frame, then, would give
3,000 foot-pounds, or 1 horsepower for less than six seconds. A steam
engine haviig apparatus for condensing its steam, weighing in all 10
pounds, and carrying 10 pounds of fuel, would possess in this fuel, _
supposing that but one-tenth of its theoretical capacity is utilized,
many thousand times the power of an equal weight of rubber, or at
least 1 horsepower for some hours. Provided the steam could be con-
densed and the water reused, then the advantage of the steam over
the spring motor was enormous, even in a model constructed only for
the purpose of study. But the construction of a steam-driven aero-
drome was too formidable a task to be undertaken lightly, and I exam-
ined the capacities of condensed air, carbonic-acid gas, of various
applications of electricity, whether in the primary or storage battery,
of hot-water engines, of inertia motors, of the gas engine, and of still
other material. The gas engine promised best of all in theory, but it
was not yet developed in a suitable form. The steam engine, as being
STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT. 173

an apparently familiar construction, promised best in practice, but in
taking it up, I, to my cost, learned that in the special application to be
made of it, little was really familiar and everything had to be learned
by experiment. I had myself no previous knowledge of steam engi-
neering, nor any assistants other than the very capable workmen
employed. I well remember my difficulties over the first aerodrome
(No. 0), when everything, not only the engine, but the boilers which
were to supply it, the furnaces which were to heat it, the propellers
which were to advance it, the hull which was to hold all these—were
all things to be originated, in a construction which, as far as I knew,
had never yet been undertaken by anyone.

It was necessary to make a beginning, however, and a compound
engine was planned which, when completed, weighed about 4 pounds,
and which could develop rather over a horsepower with 60 pounds of
steam, which it was expected could be furnished by a series of tubular
boilers arranged in ‘“‘bee-hive” form and the whole was to be contained
in a hull about 5 feet in length and 10 inches in diameter. This hull
was, as in the construction of a ship, to carry all adjuncts. In front of
it projected a steel rod, or bowsprit, about its own length, and one still
longer behind. The engines rotated two propellers, each about 30
inches in diameter, which were on the end of long shafts disposed at
an acute angle to each other and actuated by a single gear driven from
the engine. A single pair of large wings contained about 50 square
feet, and a smaller one in the rear about half as much, or in all some
75 feet, of sustaining surface, for a weight which it was expected would
not exceed 25 pounds.

Although this aerodrome was in every way a disappointment, its
failure taught a great many useful lessons. It had been built on the
large scale described, with very little knowledge of how it was to be
launched into the air, but the construction developed the fact that it
was not likely to be launched at all, since there was a constant gain in
weight over the estimate at each step, and when the boilers were com-
pleted it was found that they gave less than one-half the necessary
steam, owing chiefly to the inability to keep up a proper fire. The
wings yielded so as to be entirely deformed under a slight pressure of
the air, and it was impossible to make them stronger without making
them heavier, where the weight was already prohibitory. The engines
could not transmit even what feeble power they furnished, without
dangerous tremor in the long shafts, and there were other difficulties.
When the whole approached completion, it was found to weigh nearer
50 pounds than 25, to develop only about one-half the estimated horse-
power at the brake, to be radically weak in construction, owing to the
yielding of the hull, and to be, in short, clearly a hopeless case.

The first steam-driven aerodrome had, then, proved a failure, and I
reverted during the remainder of the year to simpler plans, among them
one of an elementary gasoline engine.

J may mention that I was favored with an invitation from Mr. Maxim
174 STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

to see his great flying machine at Bexley, in Kent, where I was greatly
impressed with the engineering skill shown in its construction, but I
foand the general design incompatible with the conclusions that I had
reached by experiments with small models, particularly as to what
seemed to me advisable in the carrying of the center of gravity as high
as was possible with safety.

Tn 1892 another aerodrome (No. 1), which was to be used with car-
bonic acid gas, or with compressed air, was commenced. The weight
of this aerodrome was a little over 45 pounds, and the area of the
supporting surfaces 64 square feet. The engines developed but a
small fraction of a horsepower, and they were able to give a dead lift
of only about one-tenth of the weight of the aerodrome, giving rela-
tively less power to weight than that obtained in the large aerodrome
already condemned.

Toward the close of this year was taken up the more careful study of
the position of the center of gravity with reference to the line of thrust
from the propellers, and to the center of pressure. The center of gray-
ity was carried as high as was consistent with safety, the propellers
being placed so high, with reference to the supporting wings, that the
intake of air was partly from above and partly from below these latter.
The lifting power (i. e., the dead lift) of the aerodromes was determined
in the shop by a very useful contrivance which I have called the “ pen-
dulum,” which consists of a large pendulum which rests on knife edges,
but is prolonged above the points of support, and counterbalanced so
as to present a condition of indifferent equilibrium. Near the lower
end of this pendulum the aerodrome is suspended, and when power is
applied to it, the reaction of the propellers lifts the pendulum through
a certain angle. If the line of thrust passes through the center of
gravity, it will be seen that the sine of this angle will be the fraction
of the weight lifted, and thus the dead-lift power of the engines
becomes known. Another aerodrome was built, but both, however
constructed, were shown by this pendulum test to have insufficient
power, and the year closed with disappointment.

Aerodrome No.3 was of stronger and better construction, and the
propellers, which before this had been mounted on shafts inclined to
each other in a V-like form, were replaced by parallel ones. Boilers of
the Serpolet type (that is, composed of tubes of nearly capillary section)
were experimented with at great cost of labor and no results; and they
were replaced with coil boilers. For these I introduced, in April, 1893,
a modification of the elopile blast, which enormously increased the
heat-giving power of the fuel (which was then still alcohol), and with
this blast for the first time the boilers began to give steam enough for
the engines. It had been very difficult to introduce force pumps which
would work effectively on the small scale involved, and after many
attempts to dispense with their use by other devices, the acquisition of
a sufficiently strong pump was found to be necessary in spite of its
STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT. 175

weight, but was only secured after long experiment. It may be added
that all the aerodromes from the very nature of their construction were
wasteful of heat, the industrial efficiency little exceeding half of 1 per
cent, or from one-tenth to one-twentieth that of a stationary engine
constructed under favorable conditions, This last aerodome lifted
nearly 30 per cent of its weight upon the pendulum, which implied that
it could lift much more than its weight when running on a horizontal
track, and its engines were capable of running its 50-centimeter pro-
pellers at something over 700 turns per minute. There was, however,
so much that was unsatisfactory about it, that it was deemed best to
proceed to another construction before an actual trial was made in the
field, and a new aerodrome, designated as No. 4. was begun. This last
was an attempt, guided by the weary experience of preceding failures,
to construct one whose engines should run at a much higher pressure
than heretofore, and be much more economical in weight. The experi-
ments with the Serpolet boilers having been discontinued, the boiler
was made with a continuous helix of copper tubing, which, as first
employed, was about three millimeters internal diameter; and it may
be here observed that a great deal of time was subsequently lost in
attempts to construct a more advantageous form of boiler for the actual
purposes than this simple one, which, with a larger coil tube, eventually
proved to be the best; so that later constructions have gone back to
this earlier type. A great deal of time was lost in these experiments
from my own unfamiliarity with steam engineering, but it may also be
said that there was little help either from books or from counsel, for
everything was here sui generis, and had to be worked out from the
beginning. In the construction which had been reached by the middle
of the third year of experiment, and which has not been greatly differed
from since, the boiler was composed of a coil of copper in the shape of
a hollow helix, through the center of which the blast from the elopile
was driven, the steam and water passing into a vessel I called the
‘“‘separator,” whence the steam was led into the engines at a pressure
of from 70 to 100 pounds (a pressure which has since been considerably
exceeded).

Frem the very commencement of this long investigation the great
difficulty was in keeping down the weight, for any of the aerodromes
could probably have flown had they been built light enough, and in
every case before the construction was completed the weight had so
increased beyond the estimate, that the aerodrome was too heavy to
fiy, and nothing but the most persistent resolution kept me in continu-
ing attempts to reduce it after further reduction seemed impossible.
Toward the close of the year (1893) I had, however, finally obtained an
aerodrome with mechanical power, as it seemed to me, to fly, and I pro-
cured, after much thought as to where this flight should take place, a
small house boat, to be moored somewhere in the Potomac; but the
vicinity of Washington was out of the question, and no desirable place
176 STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

was found nearer than 30 miles below the city. It was because it was
known that the aerodrome might have to be set off in the face of a
wind, which might blow in any direction, and because it evidently was
at first desirable that it should light in the water rather than on the
land, that the house boat was selected as the place for the launch.
The aerodrome (No. 4) weighed between 9 and 10 pounds, and lifted 40
per cent of this on the pendulum with 60 pounds of steam pressure, a
much more considerable amount than was theoretically necessary for
horizontal flight. And now the construction of a launching apparatus,
dismissed for some years, was resumed. Nearly every form seemed to
have been experimented with unsuccessfully in the smaller aerodromes.
Most of the difficulties were connected with the fact that it is neces-
sary for an aerodrome, as it is for a soaring bird, to have a certain con-
siderable initial velocity before it can advantageously use its own
mechanism for flight, and the difficulties of imparting this initial
velocity with safety are surprisingly great, and in the open air are
beyond all anticipation:

Here, then, commences, another long story of delay and disappoint-
ment in these efforts to obtain a successful launch. To convey to the
reader an idea of its difficulties a few extracts from the diary of the
period are given. (It will be remembered that each attempt involved
a journey of 30 miles each way.)

November 18, 1893. Having gone down to the house boat, prepara-
tory to the first launch, in which the aerodrome was to be east from a
springing piece beneath, it was found impossible to hold it in place on
this before launching without its being prematurely torn from its sup-
port, although there was no wind except a moderate breeze; and the
party returned after a day’s fruitless effort.

Two days later a relative calm occurred in the afternoon of a second
visit, when the aerodrome was mounted again, but, though the wind was
almost imperceptible, it was sufficient to wrench it about so that at first
nothing could be done, and when steam was gotten up the burning alco-
hol blew about so as to seriously injure the inflammable parts. Finally,
the engines being under full steam, the launch was attempted, but,
owing to the difficulties alluded to and to a failure in the construction
of the launching piece, the aerodrome was thrown down upon the boat,
fortunately with little damage.

Whatever form of launch was used, it became evident at this time
that the aerodrome must at any rate be firmly held up to the very
instant of release, and a device was arranged for clamping it to the
launching apparatus.

On November 24 another attempt was made to launch, which was .
rendered impossible by a very moderate wind indeed.

On November 27 a new apparatus was arranged, to merely drop the
aerodrome over the water, with the hope that it would get up sufficient
speed before reaching the surface to soar, but it was found that a very
STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT. ecg

gentle intermittent breeze (probably not more than 3 or 4 miles an
hour) was sufficient to make it impossible even to prepare to drop the
aerodrome toward the water with safety.

It is difficult to give an idea in few words of the nature of the
trouble, but unless one stands with the machine in the open air he can
form no conception of what the difficulties are, which are peculiar to
practice in the open, and which do not present themselves to the con-
structor in the shop, nor probably to the mind of the reader.

- December 1, another failure; December 7, another; December 11,
another; December 20, another; December 21,another. These do not all
involve a separate journey, but five separate trips were made of a round
distance of 60 miles each before the close of the season. It may be
remembered that these attempts were in a site far from the conveniences
of the workshop and under circumstances which took up a good deal
of time, for some hours were spent on mounting the aerodrome on each
occasion, and the year closed without a single cast of it into the air.
It was not known how it would have behaved there, for there had not
been a launch even in nine trials, each one representing an amount of
trouble and difficulty which this narrative gives no adequate idea of.

I pass over a long period of subsequent baffled effort, with the state-
ment that numerous devices for launching were tried in vain and that
nearly a year passed before one was effected.

Six trips and trials were made in the first six months of 1894 with-
out securing a launch. On the 24th of October a new launching piece
was tried for the first time, which embodied all the requisites whose
necessity was taught by previous experience, and, saving occasional
accidents, the launching was from this time forward accomplished with
comparatively little difficulty.

The aerodromes were now for the first time put fairly in the air, and
a new class of difficulties arose, due to a cause which was at first
obscure—for two successive launches of the same aerodrome, under
conditions as near alike as possible, would be followed by entirely dif-
ferent results. For example, in the first case it might be found rush-
ing, not falling, forward and downward into the water under the
impulse of its own engines; in the second case, with every condition
from observation apparently the same, it might be found soaring upward
until its wings made an angle of 60 degrees with the horizon, and,
unable to sustain itself at such a slope, shding backward into the
water.

After much embarrassment the trouble was discovered to be due to
the fact that the wings, though originally set at precisely the same
angle in the two cases, were irregularly deflected by the upward pres-
sure of the air, so that they no longer had the ‘orm which they appeared
to possess but a moment before they were upborne by it, and so that a
very minute difference, too small to be certainly noted, exaggerated by
this pressure, might cause the wind of advance to strike either below

SM 97——12
178 STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

or above the wing and to produce the salient difference alluded to.
When this was noticed all aerodromes were inverted, and sand was
dredged uniformly over the wings until its weight represented that of
the machine. The flexure of the wings under those circumstances
must be nearly that in free air, and it was found to distort them beyond
all anticipation. Here commences another series of trials, in which the
wings were strengthened in various ways, but in none of which, with-
out incurring a prohibitive weight, was it possible to make them strong
enough. Various methods of guying them were tried, and they were
rebuilt on different designs—a slow and expensive process. Finally, it
may be said, in anticipation (and largely through the skill of Mr. Reed,
the foreman of the work), the wings were rendered strong enough with-
out excessive weight, but a year or more passed in these and other
experiments.

In the latter part of 1894 two steel aerodromes had already been
built, which sustained from 40 to 50 per cent of their dead-lift weight
on the pendulum, and each of which was apparently supplied with
much more than sufficient power for horizontal flight (the engine and
all the moving parts furnishing over one horsepower at the brake
weighed in one of these but 26 ounces); but it may be remarked that
- the boilers and engines in lifting this per cent of the weight did so
only at the best performance in the shop, and that nothing like this
could be counted upon for regular performance in the open. Every
experiment with the launch, when the aerodrome descended into the
water, not gently, but impelled by the misdirected power of its own
engines, resulted at this stage in severe strains and local injury, so that
repairing, which was almost rebuilding, constantly went on; a hard but
necessary condition attendant on the necessity of trial in the free air.
It was gradually found that it was indispensable to make the frame
stronger than had hitherto been done, though the absolute limit of
strength consistent with weight seemed to have been already reached,
and the year 1895 was chiefly devoted to the labor on the wings and
what seemed at first the hopeless task of improving the construction
so that it might be stronger without additional weight, when every
gram of weight had already been scrupulously economized. With
this went on attempts to carry the effective power of the burners,
boilers, and engines further, and modification of the internal arrange-
ment and a general disposition of the parts such that the wings could
be placed further forward or backward at pleasure, to more readily
meet the conditions necessary for bringing the center of gravity under
the center of pressure. So little had even now been learned about the
system of balancing in the open air, that at this late day recourse was
again had to rubber models, of a different character, however, from
those previously used; for in the latter the rubber was strained, not
twisted. These experiments took up an inordinate time, though the
flight obtained from the models thus made was somewhat longer and
much steadier than that obtained with the Penaud form, and from
STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT. 179

them a good deal of valuable information was gained as to the number
and position of the wings and as to the effectiveness of different forms
and dispositions of them. By the middle of the year a launch took
place with a brief flight, where the aerodrome shot down into the
water after a little over 50 yards. It wasimmediately followed by one
in which the same aerodrome rose at a considerable incline and fell
backward with scarcely any advance after sustaining itself rather less
than 10 seconds, and these and subsequent attempts showed that the
problem of disposing of the wings so that they would not yield and of
obtaining a proper “balance” was not yet solved.

Briefly it may be said that the year 1895 gave small results for the
labor with which it was filled, and that at its close the outlook for
further substantial improvement seemed to be almost hopeless, but it
was at this time that final success was drawing near. Shortly after its
close I became convinced that substantial rigidity had been secured for
the wings; that the frame had been made stronger without prohibitive
weight, and that a degree of accuracy in the balance had been obtained
which had not been hoped for. Still there had been such a long succes-
sion of disasters and accidents in the launching that hope was low
when success finally came.

I have not spoken here of the aid which I received from others, and
particularly from Dr. Carl Barus and Mr. J. E. Watkins, who have been
at different times associated with me in the work. Mr. R. L. Reed’s
mechanical skill has helped me everywhere, and the lightness and effi-
ciency of the engines are in a large part due to Mr. L. C. Maltby.

THE AERODROMES IN FLIGHT!

The successful flights of Dr. Langley’s aerodrome were witnessed by
Dr. Bell, and described by him as follows: ?

“Through the courtesy of Dr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, I have had, on various occasions, the privilege of
witnessing his experiments with aerodromes, and especially the remark-
able success attained by him in experiments made upon the Potomac
River on Wednesday, May 6, 1896, which led me to urge him to make
public some of these results.

“‘T had the pleasure of witnessing the successful flight of some of
these aerodromes more than a year ago, but Dr. Langley’s reluctance to
make the results public at that time prevented me from asking him, as
I have done since, to let me give an account of what | saw.

“On the date named two ascensions were made by the aerodrome, or
so-called ‘flying machine,’ which I will not describe here further than to
Say that it appeared to me to be built almost entirely of metal, and
driven by a steam engine which I have understood was carrying fuel
and a water supply for a very brief period, and which was of extraor-
dinary lightness.

“The absolute weight of the aerodrome, including that of the engine
and all appurtenances, was, as I was told, about 25 pounds, and the

Annual, 1897. :

180 STORY OF EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

distance from tip to tip of the supporting surfaces was, as I observed,
about 12 or 14 feet. The method of propulsion was by aerial screw
propellers, and there was no gas or other aid for lifting it in the air
except its own internal energy. :

“On the occasion referred to, the aerodrome, at a given signal,
started from a platform about 20 feet above the water, and rose at first
directly in the face of the wind, moving at all times with remarkable
steadiness, and subsequently swinging around in large curves of, per-
haps, a hundred yards in diameter, and continually ascending until its
steam was exhausted, when, at a lapse of about a minute and a half,
and at a height which I judged to be between 80 and 100 feet in the
air, the wheels ceased turning, and the machine, deprived of the aid of
its propellers, to my surprise did not fall, but settled down so softly
and gently that it touched the water without the least shock, and was
in fact immediately ready for another trial.

‘In the second trial, which followed directly, it repeated in nearly
every respect the actions of the first, except that the direction of its
course was different. It ascended again in the face of the wind, after-
wards moving steadily and continually in large curves accompanied
with a rising motion and a lateral advance. Its motion was, in fact,
so steady, that I think a glass of water on its surface would have
remained unspilled. When the steam gave out again, it repeated for a
second time the experience of the first trial when the steam had ceased,
and settled gently and easily down. What height it reached at this
trial I can not say, as I was not so favorably placed as in the first; but
I had occasion to notice that this time its course took it over a wooded
promontory, and I was relieved of some apprehension in seeing that it
was already so high as to pass the tree tops by 20 or 30 feet. Itreached
the water one minute and thirty-one seconds from the time it started,
at a measured distance of over 900 feet from the point at which it rose.

‘This, however, was by no means the length of its flight. I esti-
mated from the diameter of the curve described, from the number of
turns of the propellers as given by the automatic counter, after due
allowance for slip, and from other measures, that the actual length of
flight on each occasion was slightly over 3,000 feet. It is at least safe
to say that each exceeded half an English mile.

‘‘Hrom the time and distance it will be noticed that the velocity was
between 20 and 25 miles an hour, in a course which was taking it con-
stantly ‘up hill” I may add that on a previous occasion If have seen a
far higher velocity attained by the same aerodrome when its course
was horizontal. ~

““T have no desire to enter into detail further than I have done, but I
can not but add that it seems to me that no one who was present on
this interesting occasion could have failed to recognize that the practi-
eability of mechanical flight had been demonstrated.

Not long after the May experiments Dr. Langley went abroad for
needed rest and recreation, and in the autumn, after his return, further
experiments were tried. On the 28th of November a flight was made
which was more than three-quarters ot a mile in length, the time occu-
pied being precisely one minute and three-quarters. Mr. Frank G.
Carpenter was a fortunate witness of this, the longest flight ever made,
and with Dr. Langley’s approval he wrote a detailed account of it for
the Washington Star of December 12, 1896. His article is interesting
from beginning to end.

Dr. Langley has two successiul aerodromes, No. 5 and No. 6; the
former made the fligits of May 6 and the latter that of November 28.
The Plate gives scale drawings of No. 5. The weight of this, with fuel
and water sufficient for the flights described, is about 30 pounds. The
weight of the engine and boiler together is about 7 pounds. The power
of the engine under full steam is rather more than 1 horsepower.
There are two cylinders, each having a diameter of 14 inches. The
piston stroke is 2 inches. The two screws are 39 inches from tip to tip,
and are made to revolve in opposite directions; the pitch is 14; they
are connected to the engines by bevel gears most carefully made; the
shafts and gears are so arranged that the synchronous movement of
the two screws is secured. The boiler is a coil of copper tubing; the
diameter of the coil externally is 3 inches; the diameter of the tubing
externally is three-eighths of an inch; the pressure of steam when the
aerdrome is in flight varies from 110 to 150 pounds to the square inch.
The flame is produced by the elopile, which is a modification of the
naphtha “blow torch” used by plumbers; the heat of this flame is
about 2,000° F. Four pounds of water are carried at starting, and
about 10 ounces of naphtha. In action the boiler evaporates about 1
pound of water per minute. Flights could be greatly lengthened by
adding a condenser and using the water over and over again, but, as
Dr. Langley says, the time for that will come later.
ON SOARING FLIGHT.

By EK. C. HUFFAKER.

With an introduction by S. P. LANGLEY.

INTRODUCTION.

It is generally known that birds sustain themselves in the air in two
distinct ways:

First. By the direct exercise of mechanical power, as in a large class
of birds that flap their wings. Although the exact motions and power
of the wing have not yet been studied exhaustively, there is nothing
in this method of support, considered as a mechanical contrivance, in
apparent contradiction to known principles.

Second. Another and important class of birds, including the largest,
can fly without flapping the wings, and are able to glide over the land-
scape (sometimes from horizon to horizon), on nearly motionless pinions,
in a manner and with an effect which is not easily explained on known
mechanical principles, and which is in striking contrast with the labored
way of other birds. This manner, which has never yet been completely
accounted for, and which is called “soaring flight,” forms the special
subject of the following article.

In this latter case the bird is in some way held up, as though by an
invisible hand, upon the thin and yielding air, on which it seems to
float almost like a ship, although its specific gravity is nearly a thou-
sand times as great as that of the air, far greater, in proportion, than
that of a ship of solid lead or gold would be to water.

There is no obvious explanation of this soaring flight, nor has any
_ yet been offered which is not open to some objection. Passing by the
childish idea of the support being derived from the lightness of the
birds’ hollow bones, or quills, we find ourselves restricted to a very
few hypotheses indeed.

Perhaps the first of these is that the bird is everywhere upborne by
invisible ascending currents. Without in any way denying that such
currents exist or that the bird may frequently utilize them, it seems
almost superfluous to enter upon a refutation of the idea that these are
* universally present, even if we allow that they can have ascensional
force sufficiently to sustain such masses in the air. ‘What goes up

183
184 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

must come down,” and there must be areas where the currents are
descending to supply the void. But perhaps a better answer lies in
the citation of the simple and most familiar fact of observation; that
the great soaring birds (which are chiefly of the vulture class) are
found uniformly suspended, frequently in large numbers, above the
carrion or other object of their interest, wherever it lies, and it 1s too
grotesque a supposition that an ascending current capable of sustain-
ing them should always emanate from such a source. The hypothesis
of such ascending currents is not, then, irrational as a partial explana-
tion, but wholly insufficient as a complete one.

The next which arises, and which to an observer untrained in mechan-
ics seems extremely plausible, is that the wind holds the bird up as it
bears up a kite. The sight, familiar from childhood, of kites sustained
at great heights in the air without any power emanating from them-
selves is perhaps responsible largely for this delusion; for it is one to
suppose that the bird, not upheld by any string, visible or invisible,
actual or virtual, can sustain itself in a wind, at least if the wind be
what it has until lately been treated as being, a nearly homogeneous
moving mass of air, with occasional little eddies or disturbances which
do not affect its fundamental quality of a current flowing altogether,
like a river or a tide.

It is absolutely contradictory to mechanical principles, however, that
in such a uniformly moving mass of air a kite or any other body with-
out internal power or external support, or any bird onrigidly extended
pinions, can sustain itself except momentarily, any more than in an
absolute calm. The fact, however, that the soaring birds very rarely
indeed perform their special evolutions except in a wind, and do have
to resort to flapping their wings in a calm, is so obvious that many
writers have tried to persuade themselves that in some way or other
well-known laws can be evaded, and that the birds can continuously
soar in such a wind by a power derived in some way from it. I think
it superfluous to do here more than repeat that such action is mechan-
ically impossible.

Next, it is indeed true that if there be two winds, or two strata of a
wind, moving at different velocities, it is in this case mechanically pos-
sible that the evolution can be performed, and this Lord Rayleigh has
pointed out. Though this is a true cause as far as it goes, it seems
hardly necessary to say that it can account but for a very limited por-
tion of the actual phenomena.

Another hypothesis, in accord with mechanical principles, and by
which the work of supporting the bird can be derived from the wind in
which it moves, has been put forth by the writer, after a study of the
internal movements of the wind, which he has shown by much experi-
ment, are incomparably more complex than had been supposed before
attention had been brought to them; movements whose possible effect
may be illustrated in this untechnical article, by saying that if we could
see the wind, it would not appear a smooth-flowing tide like the Gulf
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 185

Stream, but rather seem broken into infinitely varied internal! move-
ments like the rapids below Niagara, some of which are often opposed
to the movement of the main current which bears them on, and by
means of which internal movements it is quite possible in theory that
work may be done sufficient to bear a vessel against the main current
itself.

The attention of the reader who is interested in the matter may be
again called to the fact that the present writer does not conceive this
to be the sole sufficient cause, in the sense that the bird uses it to the
rejection of aid from ascending currents and the like, where they
present themselves; but while there is no doubt that the wind’s internal
horizontal movements are often alone sufficient to sustain a bird, it is
difficult to believe that this cause can account for all the flights we see
performed, either at great altitudes, where we must suppose the wind
relatively uniform, or in wind of such a small velocity that it is hard to
suppose that the bird can support its weight with as little work as
would then be furnished by the still smaller variations.

It is indeed possible that as we further study that most marvelous
structure, the bird’s wing, we may find it capable of utilizing power
latent in these internal movements of the wind, in a different way than
we now fully understand, and in a degree greater than now seems
possible. It remains, nevertheless, true that this hypothesis (of the
internal work of the wind), the last which seems to offer itself, is, if
trustworthy in theory and able to account for much of what we see,
yet apparently insufficient in some instances of the kind we have just
noted.

We seem, then, to have exhausted every suggestion, and yet the
soaring bird still soars, and remains sustained in midair almost with-
out an effort, as anyone may See in the regions it frequents. Under
these circumstances we may feel justified in receiving at least with con-
siderate examination, a new hypothesis which does not necessarily
violate any mechanical principle, and which, though it may at first
have a certain artificial appearance, seems not unsupported by some
facts of observation.

Its author, Mr. Huffaker, is one of the most acute observers of this
class of phenomena whom [I have known, and I put trust in the good
faith with which he reports his observations, and in the conscientious
care with which he has made them. What he has to say about his
actual observations is at any rate, then, worth the attention of those
interested in the subject. I do not make myself responsible for the
validity of his suggested hypothesis, but it seems to me novel, not in
contradiction of any mechanical principle, and deserving of consider-
ation, if only because it appears to apply to some cases where every

other seems to have failed.

186 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

HYPOTHESIS OF UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM IN THE LOWER
ATMOSPHERE.

I wish to offer an explanation of some of the seemingly inexplicable
phenomena referred to by Mr. Langley in his introduction to this paper
under the name of soaring flight, by which term may be included all
sustained flight which is accomplished without flapping. ‘This is the

characteristic flight of the eagles, hawks, vultures, albatrosses, and the
frigate bird, which may daily be seen sweeping through the air on
nearly motionless wings, making long journeys, ascending to great
heights, and in some undiscovered way keeping aloft in apparent defi-
ance of the laws of gravity, for they so seldom flap their wings, and .
move them so little, that the power visibly expended seems wholly inad-
equate to the purpose of keeping their heavy bodies, as it were, afloat
in a fluid so subtle and yielding as the air. No hypothesis has as yet
been suggested which offers a complete and satisfactory explanation of
the problem. The theory of the internal work of the wind, which in
the present state of our knowledge seems to offer the only solution of
the problem of flight in high winds, apparently fails to account for
soaring flight in very light winds, and the theory of ascending currents
as hitherto advocated, while offering a doubtful solution of flight in
light winds, fails completely to explain how the bird soars in high ones.
It does not seem to me likely that any single explanation can be
found which will adequately account for flight in both light and heavy
winds; by which I mean that we may be forced to recognize that one
method must be employed for light winds and another and totally dif-
ferent method for high winds. Our theories must be formed in accord-
ance with facts, but I believe there are two important but not obvious
facts which have hitherto escaped observation and which I shall
endeavor to establish. The first is, as I have just said, that the bird
employs a distinctively different method for soaring in light winds
from that used in heavy ones; and the second, and the more important
fact of the two, is that this method reposes on a widely acting cause,
which has never yet been connected with the observations in question.

Incredible as it may seem to those who have been denied the oppor-
tunity for observing the soaring birds, the stronger the wind blows,
within certain limits, the more readily can the bird penetrate it. Thus
the soaring bird can maintain a steady advance in a direct line into a
wind having a velocity of 40 miles an hour, without flapping and with-
out loss of elevation, and this it may continue to do indefinitely.
Such paradoxical cases however have been considered and explained
by Mr. Langley in his treatise on the “ Internal work of the wind.”

I wish here to point out the fact that if the wind have a velocity of
only 4 or 5 miles an hour it lies wholly beyond the power of the bird to
penetrate the wind at all in the manner just described. When he
attempts to do so—that is, to sail straight ahead—he invariably
descends, and if he continues to do so without flapping he must
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 187

quickly and inevitably come to the earth, and though he may, and
sometimes does, soar continuously for hours in a wind whose velocity
does not exceed 4 miles an hour, and may do so without flapping and
without apparent effort, he can accomplish this only in one way, by
frequently soaring in circles. Whenever he wishes either to maintain
his elevation or to increase it he must resort to circular or spiral flight,
by which maneuver he may rise to incredible heights; but whenever
he wishes to traverse the country in direct flight he is constrained to
do so by descending, the distance to which he may sail depending upon
the height to which he may previously have risen. In high winds, there-
fore, the bird need never soar in spirals, and indeed it seldom does;
whereas in light winds there is no other way in which it can remain
long in the air. Our task will therefore be an easier one if we recog-
nize at the outset that there is a radical difference in the character
of flight in light and strong winds, and that nature does not demand
of us a single method of universal application. In presenting a new
hypothesis as a possible explanation of soaring flight in light winds, I
accordingly wish to state distinctly that it is applicable only to spiral
flight, and does not apply to direct flight in strong winds.

My hypothesis is based upon the fact, as I believe it to be, that when
the surface of the earth is exposed to the heating influence of the sun
the normal condition of the lower atmosphere is one of unstable equi-
librium; by which I mean that the rate of decrease in temperature in
the lower strata is greater than 1 degree Fahrenheit for each 183 feet of
ascent, this being the rate of decrease when the atmosphere is in neu-
tral equilibrium. This unstable equilibrium results from the viscosity
of the air and the diffusion of gases, in consequence of which the warm
air near the surface of the earth does not readily penetrate the colder
strata above, and there is thus a tendency at all times toward an
accumulation of heat in the lower strata.

In order to fix our ideas we may consider a specific, if imaginary,
case, and suppose that on a clear, calm morning a large, level field, sur-
rounded on all sides by woodlands, is exposed to the influence of the
sun’s rays; and further, that during the preceding night the condition
of the atmosphere has become one of stable equilibrium. As the airin
contact with the earth becomes heated it will tend to rise in slender
Streams or bubbles from the irregularities of the surface, and being
lighter than the encompassing colder air, it will be carried upward, the
velocity of its ascent and the height to which it will rise depending in
part upon its temperature and in part upon the resistances to be over-
come, which are due partly to the displacement of the overlying masses
of the air and partly to friction. The frictional resistances, though
readily overcome where large volumes are involved, are greatly increased
when a mass of air is broken up into smaller masses, as seen in the
case of large and small bubbles of air rising through water. ‘The
tendency of a mass of air to disintegration and diffusion when pene-
188 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

trating strata in a state of stable equilibrium is very marked, as seen
in the spreading and disappearance of smoke from locomotives and
furnaces, which, though possessing a very high temperature, rises more
and more slowly as it becomes diffused through the surrounding air.
The extent to which this diffusion is carried by nature we have no
means of ascertaining, but if it extends to the ultimate molecules of
the air the further rise of the heated air must be almost wholly checked.
The air, then, rising from innumerable points of the heated surface
of the field, is diffused through the overlying masses, whose tempera-
ture is thus slowly increased until a layer of constantly increasing
depth is brought to a condition of unstable equilibrium, while the air
above remains in the stable condition. The diffusion of a rising mass
of warm air will, | think, be very much less while passing through
strata whose equilibrium is unstable, for when the air is in the stable
condition it resists any force tending to displace it, and, if displaced
vertically in any manner, tends to return to its original position; whereas
with an unstable equilibrium, if the air is displaced vertically, its
tendency is to continue moving in whatever direction it may be going,
whether up or down, and the displaced air, instead of retarding the
moving mass, tends to move on with it, so that the mass tends all the
while to increase in volume, and, meeting with little resistance, loses
little of its mass by diffusion. We are thus led to the singular conclu-
sion that the rise of a mass of heated air from the earth’s surface is
most rapid while passing through the warmer stratum next the earth,
and that it is checked through diffusion on entering the colder air above.
As the accumulation of heat increases, the equilibrium will become
more and more unstable; bubbles and streams will rise with more vio-
lence, and will penetrate farther and farther into the cold air above ©
before being checked by diffusion, until at length the equilibrium will
be entirely destroyed, the cold air from the woodlands will press in on
all sides, winds will begin blowing in all directions, and the entire
mass of heated air will be drained away through some forced opening
in the cold strata above. Cold air will take its place, and the whole
process will be repeated. The above reasoning, which is based upon
the diffusion and viscosity of gases, is universally-applicable under the
assumed conditions; and if we were to consider the case of a hill slope
instead of a plain the general course of the argument would be the
same. The condition of unstable equilibrium, therefore, is the normal
condition, whereas if the tension thus brought about reach the requi-
site degree of intensity there will result the abnormally unstable con-
dition which itis believed by many meteorologists gives rise to cyclones,
thunderstorms, white squalls, and similar occurrences. Below are
given a number of quotations bearing upon the question under dis-
cussion, but in general having reference to the abnormal condition just
referred to.
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 189

THE ORIGIN OF CYCLONES, THUNDERSTORMS, AND SIMILAR DIS-
TURBANCES, AND THEIR RELATION TO SOARING FLIGHT.

The following account of experiments to determine the permeability
of the air by vapor of water is taken from Espy’s Report on Meteor-
ology, 1849:

“JT next took a glass tube about 2 feet long, with its internal diame-
ter one-third of an inch, bent at one end into the form of a shepherd’s
crook, and hermetically sealed at the short end. ‘The open end was
plugged with chloride of calcium, the outer end of the calcium being
excluded from the atmosphere. A film of air touching the chloride of
calcium would be made perfectly free from vapor at one end of the tube;
at the other a film of air touching the water would be as near satura-
tion aS evaporation could make it; and at a temperature of 80 degrees
the pressure of the vapor at one end of this tube was near half a pound
to the square inch, and at the other nothing at all. With the tube set
vertically, so that the vapor of water would reach the calcium chloride
plug by ascending, the evaporation at the end of three months, with a
daily temperature of about 70 degrees, amounted to but one-eighth of
an inch.” From this and similar experiments Mr. Espy inferred, “‘ con-
- trary to the general belief of scientific men, that vapor permeates air
from a high to a low dew point with extreme slowness, if indeed, it per-
meates it at all; and in meteorology it will hereafter be known that
vapor rises into the regions where clouds are formed only by being ear-
ried up by currents of air containing it.” Incidentally, the experiment
seems to prove that convection also took place very slowly; for the
result would have been the same whether the vapor reached the calcium
chloride by permeation or convection.

The following abstract is from an article on meterology in the New
American Cyclopedia: ‘‘ The explanation, or at least the approximate
cause of the fall of rain and of fitful winds, is found in the unstable
condition of the atmosphere produced by the introduction into the
lower strata of the vapor of water. This, with the accompanying heat,
_ tends to expand the air, and consequently to render it lighter; and
~ when the amount of vapor becomes sufficiently great the order of den-
Sity is reversed and a state of tottering equilibrium is produced, the
lower stratum tends on the least disturbances to break through into
the colder.”

The following statement is taken from Modern Meteorology, by Dr.
Frank Waldo: “Where the addition of heat takes place too rapidly
and the gradient exceeds the theoretical value, then the condition of
unstable equilibrium ensues for a short time; such being the condition
which Reye and others have assigned to tornadoes and thunderstorms.”

In Elementary Meteorology, he says: ‘The principal condition for
the formation of a tornado is the local unstable condition of the air,
due to the abnormal heating of a mass of air either at the earth’s
190 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

surface or at some locality above it. The mass of air, being warmer
than the surrounding air at the same level, is in unstable equilibrium,
and when some slight disturbance frees it from its abnormal position
it is forced upward by the pressure of the air below and around it.”
‘Heat thunderstorms are the result of the local heating of the lower
air, which makes its condition unstable.”

The same author, commenting on the great Paris storm of September
10, 1896, says: “‘ We know that when air is compressed it becomes
warmer, and when it is expanded it becomes cooler, even though no
heat be added or subtracted from the air mass. And the change, called
adiabatic change, proceeds according to a regular law. ‘The air pres-
sure, and consequently the air density, decreases with the increase of
altitude above the earth’s surface, and so when air moves upward it
expands and becomes cooler, at the rate of about 1 degree Fahrenheit
for each 183 feet of ascent; and likewise it becomes warmer 1 degree
for each 183 feet of descent in cases where it moves downward.

“So, then, if the temperature of a mass of air decreases 1° Fahren-
heit for each 183 feet of increase in altitude, then the air is said to be
in indifferent equilibrium, and any air carried upward or downward in
it will remain in its new position, because its adiabatic change of tem-
perature has been just such as to allow the air so moved to accommo-
date itself to the temperature of the surrounding air in its new position.

“Tf a mass of air decreases at a rate of less than 1° Fahrenheit for
each 183 feet of increase in altitude, then the air is in stable equilibrium,
and if any air is forced upward in it, it would gradually become denser
than the air at its level and would sink back again to its starting place
after the force which had caused it to move upward had ceased to act.

“If the mass of air decreases in temperature at a rate greater than
1° Fahrenheit for 183 feet of increase in altitude, then it is in unstable
equilibrium, and if any of the air is started upward or downward it
will continue so to move, as it will become lighter than the surround-
ing air with the upward, and heavier with the downward motion. It
is on this condition of unstable equilibrium that most squalls depend
for their origin and in great part for their maintenance.” a

Dr. Buchan, in the “ Encyclopedia Britannica,” says: ‘* Whirlwinds
occur where for the time the air is unusually calm and moist, and
where, consequently, temperature and humidity diminish with height
at an abnormally rapid rate. Whirlwinds and tornadoes have their
origin in vertical disturbance of atmospheric equilibrium.”

The following extracts are from the writings of Dr. Ferrel, whose
theories of cyclones and tornadoes have perhaps met with more general
acceptance than those of any other writer. Even Dr. Hann, who advo-
cates a different theory of cyclones, seems to accept his theory of the
formation of tornadoes, whirlwinds, and similar smaller disturbances
in the air:

“The principal condition of a tornado is the unstable condition of the
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 191

atmosphere, from which, with any very light disturbance, arises a
bursting up of the air of the lower strata of the atmosphere through
those above.” ;

“The vertical circulation is the initial stage in the formation of a
tornado, and so the tornado can not originate without the condition of
unstable equilibrium which gives rise to a vertical circulation.”

“In very hot, dry climates, where there is a sandy soil, sand spouts
and whirlwinds are of frequent occurrence. The dry air of such cli-
mates, especially over a sandy soil, is often in a state of unstable
equilibrium from the accumulation of heat on the earth’s surface.”

‘“‘Small waterspouts observed on seas and lakes in clear, calm, and
hot weather usually arise from a state of unstable equilibrium in the
lower strata of the atmosphere.”

Mirage is defined by the Century Dictionary as “An optical illusion,
due to the excessive bending of the light rays in traversing adjacent
layers of air of widely different densities. * * * The heated earth
rarifies the air in the lower strata faster than it can escape, so produc-
ing the mirage.”

Professor Tait speaks of the mirage of the desert as formed by the
‘refraction in the hot layer of air near the sand.

Deschanel says: “ Mirage is explained by the heating and consequent
rarefaction of the air in contact with the hot soil. The density within
a certain distance of the ground increases upward, and rays traversing
this portion are bent upward in accordance with the general rule that
the concavity must be turned toward the denser side.”

Guyot says: ‘‘The mirage is most frequent in arid plains where the
soil, exposed to the burning rays of the sun, becomes intensely heated,
and in consequence the strata near the ground are less dense than those
above.”

There thus seems to be abundant authority for the supposition that
the air not infrequently exists in the condition of unstable equilibrium.
And if the superheating of the lower strata of the air and the conse-
quent unstable equilibrium which ensues is at times sufficient to pro-
duce thunderstorms, tornadoes, and mirages, it seems not unreasonable
to suppose that a similar condition of unstable equilibrium, less
intensified, may be of more frequent occurrence when the results are
not so manifest. Weare thus confronted with a question of fact about
which recorded experiments give us but little information. We have
been told so often that heated air will rise that it seems somewhat
incredible to suppose that there are circumstances in which it will not
do so. Laboratory experiments can have but little value in this con-
nection, as it is next to impossible to reproduce the conditions as they
exist in nature, nor have we the instruments for measuring with preci-
sion the small differences in temperature which suffice to produce
unstable equilibrium within the walls of a laboratory. The following
simple experiment, however, appears to indicate that a layer of heated
192 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

air rises with difficulty from a surface. Let a quantity of tobacco
smoke be gently exhaled upon the top of a table; instead of rising, as
it would do if free of the table, it will remain a surprisingly long time
as a dense layer upon the surface, like a fog upon a river, and perhaps
for the same reason. Still, the crucial test must be applied in the
open air, and I shall presently show that when such a test is applied
experiment seems to favor the theory here set forth. Instead of unsta-
ble equilibrium, unstable motion would perhaps be the more accurate
term, but the former will be used as sufficiently exact for our purpose.

My hypothesis is that when the air is in this condition of unstable
equilibrium the soaring bird, by the mere act of moving in circles, so
disturbs the equilibrium as to produce within the circle of its flight a
feeble ascending current of warm air, which grows in magnitude, slowly
at first but with increasing rapidity, through the pressure of outlying
masses of heavier air above, until it attains a sufficient force to bear
the bird up with it. Thus a natural chimney, which gradually enlarges,
is produced, through which the warm air over an extended area finds
the means of escape, the column thus formed often rising to a great
height. The heat of the sun is stored up in vast quantities in the
lower strata of the air on every warm day, and by tapping these nat-
ural reservoirs of energy the bird obtains all the power necessary for
flight in light winds. The process of penetration and permeation in
slender streams must at all times be a slow one, and if the lower strata
receive heat from the sun and the earth more rapidly than it can in
this way be carried off, an accumulation of heat must result and a
correspondingly increased tension throughout the masses involved.
Sooner or later the lower air must burst through the overlying masses,
the violence of the resulting disturbances depending upon the degree
of instability existing at the time of the upheaval. Under such con-
ditions the bird by moving in circles either with or without flapping
easily destroys the equilibrium and produces an ascending current
which it utilizes in ascending along a spiral course, by which means it
keeps within the ascending column.

I carefully examined the records of temperature taken by aeronauts
in balloon ascents, as well as those obtained by means of kites, and
these records all go to show that the normal condition of the atmos-
phere taken as a whole up to a height of several thousand feet is one
of stable equilibrium. But it is to be noted that these temperatures
have usually been recorded at great altitudes and that a stable condi-
tion of the upper air is in nowise incompatible with a condition of
umstable equilibrium in the lower strata, in which the flight of the
birds usually begins.* On several occasions I have found the outer air

*Since the above was written Mr. Eddy and his assistants have made some experi-
ments in the lower atmosphere which showed that at the time the experiments were
made the equilibrium was unstable up to an altitude of 1,500 feet and much more so
up toa height of 400 feet. Thus the average rate of decrease for 1,500 feet was found
to be 1° for 163 feet of ascent, while for 400 feet the average was 1° for 67 feet of
ascent.

at the summit of the Washington Monument 7 degrees colder than
that at its base, 500 feet below, whereas neutral equilibrium would
have required but 2 degrees. The equilibrium was, therefore, unstable
and continued so for more than half an hour.

EXPERIMENTS IN GENERATING ASCENDING CURRENTS.

If the condition of unstable equilibrium is a possible one, and if the
normal condition of the air near the earth’s surface on a warm day is
unstable the fact should be susceptible of verification, and I accord-
ingly made a large number of experiments in the open air, under the
conditions known to be favorable to soaring flight. On a warm day in
August, with light irregular winds and intervals of calms I tried the
effect of producing artificial ascending currents by means of a fan;
reasoning that if the air was in a condition of unstable equilibrium I
should be able, with little difficulty, to generate a current which, once
started, might extend to a considerable height. These experiments
were made in the open park surrounding the Smithsonian Institution
building. In order to detect the presence of ascending currents I pro-
vided strands of white China silk, 1 foot in length, pulled apart so that
they were as light almost as spider’s webs and yet visible by irradia-
tion in the sunlight at a considerable distance. Holding one of these
strands aloft in one hand, I fanned the air upward underneath it; then
liberating the strand I continued to toss the air beneath it until it was
well under way upward. When once started the silk would be borne
up to a height of 20, 30, 50, or 100 feet, and often to much greater
heights. In numerous instances the strands were carried upward
entirely out of sight, and in the bright sunlight they could be followed
to a height of 200 feet, as estimated by comparison with the height of
the adjacent towers of the Smithsonian Institution building. I repeated
these experiments during the extremely hot days of September, 1897,
choosing those localities where the ground was level, and where there
were no buildings or trees near-by which might give rise to ascending
currents. I succeeded in sending the strands of silk upward almost as
often aS I made the attempt, and by changing the locality sought to
eliminate, as much as possible, the probability that the strands were
caught up by currents already in existence. Often a single stroke
of the fan sufficed to produce the necessary current, the silk rising
steadily and often rapidly. When strands ceased to rise beyond a
height of some 25 or 30 feet, I could usually send them on again by
tossing the air upward beneath them with the fan, and frequently when
falling they were sent upward out of sight. On one occasion a strand had
- risen to a height of 75 feet, and immediately afterwards a bit of thistle
down, which chanced to float horizontally to the spot where I stood,
turned upward without help and followed the path of the silk, continu-
ing upward until lost to view. The current produced thus appears to
have had a certain degree of permanence. On cold cloudy days no

SM 97——13
194 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

amount of effort would cause the strands to rise. It seems, therefore,
that very slight disturbances, such as the circling and flapping of the
bird might produce, are sufficient to produce ascending currents under
the conditions which observation shows to be favorable to flight.

THE CONDITIONS RENDERING SOARING FLIGHT POSSIBLE.

We are now in a position to turn to the soaring birds and inquire if
in the manner of their soaring or otherwise they furnish any evidence as
to the correctness of the hypothesis here set forth. And first we shall
consider the conditions of the atmosphere which. as observation shows,
render soaring flight possible.

Of recent years writers upon this subject have almost universally
agreed that winds are necessary to flight. But notwithstanding this
widespread belief among scientific observers I venture to say that while
winds may attain a velocity sufficient to furnish through their internal
movements all the energy necessary for sustained flight without flap-
ping, the birds may yet soar perfectly when the winds are in them-
selves too feeble to support them, and that the condition of the atmos-
phere which gives rise to local winds—that is, an unstable condition of
the lower strata—is also the condition which renders soaring flight pos-
sible in the absence of strong winds. A light wind on this view is
to be regarded not asa cause at all but as an effect, and we may, on this
view, at once dismiss the question as to the power which such a wind
may furnish, and look instead to the condition of the atmosphere which
gives rise to it for the explanation of the flight of the birds, whose abil-
ity to soar seems to be so entirely independent of the strength of the
winds that they may occasionally be found soaring in what appears to
be an absolute calm. I have many times seen the turkey buzzard
soaring in sheltered localities when there was no indication of any
wind whatever. Early one morning, while following the railroad up the
narrow valley of the French Broad River, near the Warm Springs,
N.C., I saw a turkey buzzard fly from the western slope of a high
ridge and begin soaring in circles above a narrow sunlit meadow upon
the banks of the river, alternately beating the air violently with its
wings and sailing. This he continued to do for the space of perhaps
two minutes, after which he entirely ceased flapping, and rose steadily
along a spiral path to a height of 300 feet, before sailing away along a
direct descending course. On this occasion there was not the slightest
breath of wind to be detected. Not a blade of grass moved, not a
tassel of corn, not a leaf upon the trees. I came to the spot where the
bird had been soaring, hemmed in by high ridges and mountains, and
could nowhere detect any sign of motion in the air. On another occasion
I witnessed one of these birds soar, without flapping, 30 feet above the
tops of some cedars in a valley and 75 feet from where I stood on a
railroad embankment, while the smoke from some neighboring chimneys
rose almost vertically and no motion whatever was to be detected in
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 195

the trees immediately below. Again, I frightened one from its perch
upon a tree in the edge of a woodland upon the summit of a hill, at a
moment when no indication of a wind could be detected in the trees.
It at once began soaring, with less than a dozen beats of the wings,
circling round 30 feet overhead and slowly rising. I could easily mul-
tiply similar instances, in which the bird has been seen soaring in winds
so light as to be scarcely discernible and under circumstances which
render it wholly improbable that any strong current of air could have
escaped detection.

On the other hand, I have, on numerous occasions, seen the birds
attempt soaring and fail, both singly and in companies, when light
winds were blowing steadily, especially on dark days and when the
earth was cold; nor do [ remember at any time to have seen them soar
in light winds when the ground was frozen or covered with snow, nor’
to have seen them attempt it.

Observation seems to show that the condition which renders soaring
flight possible in light winds is that the surface of the earth shall be
warmer than the air above it; and this, it will be seen, is the very coun-
dition which gives rise to light, local, irregular winds. It is not sur-
prising, then, that the birds should begin soaring with the rising of
the winds, nor that observers should have sought for an explanation of
their flight in the winds themselves. But it sometimes happens that
they begin soaring before any winds can be detected, and as I have
endeavored to show, it is this condition of a cold atmosphere above a
warm surface resulting in an unstable equilibrium and not the preva-
lence of winds that makes soaring possible under these conditions.
Moreover, as this condition will ensue whenever the earth is exposed
to the heating influence of the sun’s rays, and since, if it prevails at all
it must prevail over vast regions of the earth’s surface, it will be seen
that it is neither an abnormal nor a local condition in those countries
where the birds are known to habitually soar. This, however, is the
condition requisite to flight in light winds only, for observation shows
that while the birds may usually soar in light winds, they may invari-
ably do so in heavy winds. High winds, therefore, also furnish condi-
tions rendering such flight possible.

But, as already pointed out, there is a marked difference in their
manner of soaring under these different circumstances, and it will
accordingly be convenient to consider the subject under two divisions—
spiral flight in light winds; direct flight in heavy winds—and to include
under the latter a supplementary discussion of flight in winds of mod-
erate velocity.

SPIRAL FLIGHT IN LIGHT WINDS.
If when the winds are light a score of vultures, including turkey

buzzards and black vultures, be frightened from a careass they will
immediately take wing, flying near the earth and flapping vigorously.
196 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

They will not, however, disperse, as a covey of partridges would do,
but will range back and forth, covering an area of perhaps from 5 to 10
acres of ground. Flapping flight will alternate with downward-gliding
flight, and whenever in gliding a vulture approaches the earth it will
be seen to rise again by turning upon a curve and flapping. Within a
very few minutes the birds will be found ranging less widely, their
flight will become more circular, stragglers will be drawn in, and the
flock will unite into amore compact mass, covering perhaps an acre of
ground or less, and will move in circles varying from 40 to 200 feet in
diameter. The entire flock will slowly rise to a height of from 100 to
200 feet, the amount of flapping becoming noticeably less. After reach-
ing a certain altitude the flapping will entirely cease, somewhat sud-
denly, and after that, it matters not how high they may rise, not a
bird, as a rule, will flap again. After rising to a height of perhaps
600 to 1,000 feet they will simultaneously disperse in all directions, no
two birds keeping company, and all gliding downward in direct lines
toward the earth, the altitude gained enabling each bird to glide a
distance of a mile or more without effort of any kind.

Following the flight of any one of the birds which have thus become
dispersed it will be found to make its way toward any flock which it
may see soaring. But if none is to be seen it will, on approaching the
earth, select a spot from which to rise again as before, but it will rarely
be seen to flap its wings again. If other birds are in the neighborhood
they will join the one that is soaring and all will rise together. The
spot selected may be a hillside, hilltop, valley, or plain, and the birds
will ascend with equal ease in any case, the selection of a spot from
which to rise being apparently a matter of indifference to them. ° Given
the condition of a warm surface beneath them and they will quickly
begin soaring when frightened from a carcass, usually drifting with the
wind, which is here assumed to be light, and rising within a very few
hundred feet of the spot; and this they will do day after day, wherever
the carcass may be located. But soaring above a carcass forms but a
small fraction of their daily flight, by far the greater part of their time
being spent in searching for food; and since they must be at all times
either rising in circles or descending at the rate of from 1 to 3 feet per
second it will be seen that when they have mounted to a height of from
500 to 1,000 feet, beyond which height the smaller vultures in temper-
ate climates do not habitually rise, it will take them but a few minutes
to reach the earth again if they cease to move in circles. Their descend-
ing flight is usually in a direct line, or in two or three broken lines, and
they will continue to descend until within perhaps 200 or 100 feet of the
earth. Allowing that the rate of descent is but 2 feet per second, a
bird will then have but little more than one minute of time in which to
select a spot from which to rise again, for it is certain that if he con-
tinues to follow a straight course he will within less than two minutes
land upon the earth. Very often he will approach within 50 feet of the
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 197

earth before attempting to rise, and yet with not more than thirty
seconds of time remaining he will seiect a spot and perhaps without a
single beat of the wings once more begin rising. Furthermore, his
object when near the earth is apparently to search for food, not to find
a spot from which he may rise; and if at any time he detects a carcass,
or fancies that one may be concealed beneath him, he will at that spot
turn upon a curve and begin an investigation, circling round and round
and meanwhile maintaining his elevation, so that the same maneuver
which enables him to investigate the locality also enables him to remain
in the air. When we consider that he is under the necessity of finding
a new locality from which to rise on an average of perhaps once in
every ten minutes during several successive hours, and that when he is
near the earth a suitable spot must be found quickly or he must resort
to flapping, and further, that he rarely finds it necessary to flap, it
seems clear that he must in some way be able to rise almost when and
where he will. How this is accomplished is easily explained upon the
hypothesis of rising currents artificially produced when the air is in a
state of unstable equilibrium, and as already stated it seems impossible
to find a satisfactory explanation on any other hypothesis hitherto
advanced.

TENDENCY TO DRIFT INTO ASCENDING CURRENTS.

Early in the morning the fine sands of the Modjave Desert rise in
slender columns to a height of 1,000 feet, being fed doubtless by the
stratum of heated air near the surface, and we have here almost posi-
tive proof of unstable equilibrium long continued, the warm air flowing
underneath the cold air above in order to reach an ascending column,
for if the air near the surface were not warmer than neutral equilibrium
demanded it would not rise at all, and as it appears to rise only in
widely separated localities, as indicated by the columns of sand, at
other points the rate of decrease in temperature must be greater than
that which gives rise to neutral equilibrium; and yet the air does not
rise at those points. It is probable that similar currents of warm air
are constantly being formed in the warmer sections of the country, and
whenever an ascending current exists the surface winds in the vicinity
will be found blowing toward it. This aids to a fuller comprehension of
a difficulty which may seem to attach to the previous explanation—the
difficulty, that is, of explaining how the bird finds the ascending cur-
rents. Let us suppose that on a warm day, when light, local, irregular
winds are succeeded by intervals of calm, on an extended plain, a
number of vultures or a pair of hawks be frightened into the air. They
will soon be found soaring near the spot from which they took wing
and often flapping vigorously. If there be a wind they will drift with
it as they soar, and as all local winds in general blow toward a rising
column of air the birds in soaring will drift toward the rising column,
and if it be not too far distant will drift into it, and the difficulty of
198 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

explaining how the bird finds an ascending current is in a measure
overcome. Let us now apply this hypothesis to a special case, repre-
senting the typical flight of the large squirrel hawks in light local
winds. Onaclear, calm morning I once frightened two of these hawks
from their perches on a dead tree in a level field of perhaps 20 acres in
extent. They at once flew away, alternately flapping and sailing, and
making no effort to keep together. At times they were on opposite
sides of the field, each pursuing its own course, while ranging back and
forth. After numerous preliminary attempts the two at length began
soaring steadily at a distance apart of several hundred feet. While
still circling, and without further flapping, the two gradually approached
until the circles of their flight, which had a diameter of perhaps 75 feet,
coincided. (One will watch in vain to see these hawks rise to any great
height along separated spirals.) After this their flight was steadily
upward until they had attained a height so great that they seemed
but gray specks against the blue sky. At length they ceased circling
and sailed away along separate courses. If we assume that over some
spot a strong, steady current was ascending, fed from the stratum of
warm air near the earth, and that from all quarters it was slowly being
drawn into it, at an average velocity of 2 feet per second, then a period
of eight minutes would have sufficed to draw the birds into the cur-
rent from a distance of 1,000 feet. It might seem, therefore, that upon
this hypothesis we have arrived at a full and satisfactory explanation
of soaring flight in light winds. But such is very far from being the
case, for while the supposed drifting of the birds into ascending cur-
rents doubtless accounts for many of the phenomena of flight, it leaves
others wholly unexplained, for while we know but little in regard to
ascending currents, either as to their number, dimensions, or duration,
itis yet certain that they must be limited in all these respects, and
over extended plains the element of chance must be an important —
factor in their location. Under such circumstances we can not suppose
that ascending currents of large magnitude are to be looked for over
any given spot where vultures may congregate above a carcass or
that such currents are to be found at all hours of the day and for days
in succession. Yet the vultures will soar day after day over such a
spot. Of their ability to do so at will the following example may be
given: Some vultures found the remains of a rabbit which had been
rolled in the dirt by a harrow, and others seeing those upon the ground
came in large numbers and soared directly over the spot for some min-
utes, but, not finding prey, did not come down, and rose instead and
sailed away. An hour later there was a repetition of the same per-
formance. They came a third time during the day and again on the
following day. There was at no time any flapping, there were no wind-
breaks to produce ascending currents, and the birds in each instance
soared immediately above the same spot. Mouillard thus describes
the descent of the Egyptian vultures on the discovery of a carcass:
“These myriads of great birds whirl like a water spout. The descent
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 199

still continues in those enormous circlings, those mad wheelings which
give one the vertigo merely to watch them. Sometimes those nearest,
not quite sure of perfect safety, return upon an upward glide, and
thus a broad, horizontal layer of vultures serves as a base for this
interminable whirling column, This continues until the surrounding
country has been thoroughly examined and the careass is deemed acces-
sible, when the hungriest dart down upon it.” From this it appears
that the birds in the act of descending and when restrained through
fear have it in their power to stop and remain in the air indefinitely
over any given locality. It is a common occurrence for numbers of
vultures to be drawn together through the mere chance of obtaining a
meal. Thus a single vulture, flying low and inspecting every nook
below for prey, pauses to reconnoiter, and begins soaring round and
round above some spot. In an ineredibly short time the air will be
filled with birds, all soaring and intent on finding the supposed ear-
cass. Failing in this, the search is abandoned. Little by little the
birds collect into a close cluster above the spot which chance alone
selected. For a time they scarcely seem to rise at all; then they go
higher, suddenly, rapidly, unexpectedly, as if caught upon a rising
swell of air. For such occurrences the theory of ascending currents
naturally produced fails to satisfactorily account.

BIRDS OFTEN BEGIN CIRCLING WHERE NO ASCENDING CURRENT
EXISTS.

Upon the hypothesis of ascending currents artificially produced by
the bird many such phenomena of flight, not otherwise easily under-
stood, may be readily explained, as for instance the scarcely perceptible
ascent in the early stages of spiral flight, with the subsequent rapid
rise. If the birds availed themselves of ascending currents already
established they should be found rising as soon as they entered the
current; but if the current were produced by their own efforts a cer-
tain time would elapse before it attained its full force, and we should
find as is actually the case, the birds suddenly and rapidly rising, after
a more or less prolonged flight at a fixed elevation. The hypothesis
explains also why the birds so often flap vigorously at the beginning
of their flight, and, what is significant, why their flapping ceases
not gradually but suddenly. It has been suggested that as the bird
risesit encounters winds of greater velocity and consequently of greater
buoyant power. But spiral flight occurs usually when the winds are
either light or absent, and the simultaneous cessation of flapping and
the steady rise which follows is commonly attained at low altitudes,
nor is there any apparent difference in the character of their flight at
the heights of 200 feet and 1,000 feet. Besides high winds enable the
bird to soar without circling at all and seem rather to be unfavorable
to any great ascent by spiral flight. Incidentally it may be stated that
the soaring birds seldom if ever rise to great heights by flapping. But
200 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

aside from these general considerations the birds occasionally furnish
evidence of a much more convineing character. Thus on one of the
calmest mornings I ever knew I saw two vultures make an attempt to
soar in circles at a height of about 100 feet above the earth. In order
to maintain and increase their altitude they continued to flap vigor-
ously for about three minutes, after which, having risen to a height of
200 feet, they ceased flapping and continued rising. <A third vulture
now approached the spot, flapping as it came, and began soaring imme-
diately beneath the other two, over the same spot above which their
flight began, but at a lower elevation. But unlike the other two, it did
not flap at all, but rose steadily from the first. The elevation in this
case evidently had no influence on the character of the flight, and the
fact that the last vulture soared steadily at the exact spot where three
minutes before the two others were unable to soar at all offers strong
presumptive evidence that the first two had effected some change in
the .condition of the atmosphere at that spot before the third one
entered it. On another occasion, in a moderate wind, three vultures
being frightened from a carcass, began soaring in circles near the earth
above a meadow. During the early part of their flight they flapped
vigorously, but after a time ceased flapping entirely, and rose steadily
along a course slanting with the wind. When they had reached a
copsiderable altitude a fourth passed beneath them in direct flight, and
continued on until it reached the identical spot at which the three had
begun their ascent by flapping. It at once began soaring and rising
‘rapidly, but was not under the necessity of flapping as the others had
been. As it ascended it followed direetly in the course the others
had taken.

On another occasion with light winds prevailing I witnessed the
ascent of two flocks of vultures near the Dan River, Virginia. The
first flock, which numbered fourteen birds, rose after some preliminary
flapping from a wide alluvial plain near the banks of the river. The
second flock, numbering fifteen birds, rose from the slope of a hill
about 3,000 feet distant. After each flock had continued soaring for
some minutes, all the birds above the slope of the hill began flapping
and in a very short while began to disperse. And now a singular
thing took place. Each bird on leaving the spot sailed directly toward
the spot from which the first flock had ascended, and each of the fifteen
birds as it reached the spot, at an elevation varying from 75 feet to 200
feet, was seen to rise as if buoyed up by an ascending current, and
each at once turning upon a circle began to follow the course taken by
the birds of the first flock. Only two out of the fifteen flapped their
wings at all and all.rose steadily, and soon, with those of the first
flock, formed a column of vultures, slanting in the direction the wind
was blowing and reaching to a height of perhaps 1,000 feet. Here we
may suppose that the vultures upon the hillside began flapping because
the supply of heated air which buoved them up became exhausted, and
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 201

that being no longer supported at that point, they sought the spot
from whence the first flock was to be seen rising; while the fact that
each bird was successively buoyed up on reaching the spot indicated
the existence of a well-established ascending current which extended
to a height of 1,000 feet or more.

Again on a clear day with light winds a flock of forty vultures was
frightened from a carcass on a Summit of aridge. They flew directly
down a valley in a direct line with much flapping, a distance of a half
mile and with a common impulse stopped and began flying in circles
in a Somewhat compact mass. Not one of the entire flock succeeded
in soaring without flapping although they continued to make the
attempt for two minutes. Evidently there was no rising current at
that point and they did not succeed in making one. But it is signifi-
eant that they should have selected a spot in which to soar where no
current existed, for it weakens the assumption which might be made
that the birds begin soaring in circles only when they encounter rising
currents, and that they have some delicate sense by means of which
they are able to detect them and find their wayinto them. At the end
of two minutes the flock divided into two. The one moved a few hun-
dred feet to the north over an open field and after some preliminary
flapping soon began soaring; the other moved south and attempted to
soar above a wooded slope on a north hillside, but failing in the
attempt a large portion abandoned the spot and sailed away to join
the first flock where they at once began soaring with the others. Those
which remained, not being able to soar, finally alighted on some trees
and remained there. Here again the birds which flew south endeav-
ored to soar over a spot where, as the event proved, no rising current
existed, and this a part of them continued to doin the apparent expec-
tation that one would rise if they continued to circle long enough, their
instincts not teaching them that the cold earth underneath them did
not favor the production of such a current. But the greater part, see-
ing that the other flock had began soaring, set off at once to join them,
and the fact that when they had done so they also at once began soar-
ing shows clearly that, whether the first flock found it or generated it,
they were borne up by a rising current, and that it is the condition of
the air and not the form of the wing only which enables the bird to
soar. That the birds are borne up by ascending currents, either natur-
ally or artificially produced, is indicated by the not unusual sight of a
bird passing in a direct line beneath another soaring in circles, the former
rising and falling precisely as it enters and leaves the current.

Again, I once saw a half dozen vultures try in vain to soar above a
carcass on the summit of a wooded hill. Wearying of the attempt,
three of them deliberately set sail to a spot over a valley a few hundred
feet distant, and with a common impulse began flying in circles. After
a Short time they began rising, but only rose to a height sufficient for
their purpose, when they one after another set sail for the hill again.
202 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

So deliberate seemed to be their purpose, and so well executed, that
for the first time it occurred to me that these birds might be masters
of the situation and able to command the winds almost at their will,
and that nature had stored up for their use in the heated strata near
the earth inexhaustible stores of energy which they might take and
utilize as their needs might require; and that they had learned, what
man had never suspected, that the heated air so situated could make
its escape from the earth with difficulty, and that the simple maneuver
of circling over one spot facilitated its rise and produced an ascending
current at the precise locality and time where it was needed. Obser-
vation thus first suggested the hypothesis that the bird had it in his
power, through the unstable equilibrium of the air, to generate ascend-
ing currents; subsequent observation seemed to confirm my supposi-
tion, and later numerous experiments seemed to indicate that such
currents could be produced artificially. All my observations have gone
to show that the diffusion of heated air through cold air is widespread
and rapid. A column of smoke from a furnace chimney a few square
feet in cross section in an incredibly short time becomes so diffused
as to have a cross section of many hundred square feet. In a strong
wind we may all have seen dense black volumes of smoke from a loco-
motive vanish almost in an instant. A balloon filled with heated air
rises steadily and rapidly, because its mass is kept intact, but the same
air in ascending through a stable atmosphere is disrupted, diffused, and
lost, and can only rise through the slow process of permeation. Fur-
thermore, the more stable the equilibrium of the upper air the more
rapidly will diffusion take place and the more slowly will the heated air
rise, so that an accumulation of heated air is continually taking place
in the lower strata, and the tension is only relieved at intervals with a
certain degree of violence by an upheaval of the masses. For the rest,
there seems to be no serious objection to the supposition that if the
equilibrium is unstable the birds are able to destroy it; for almost any
disturbance, and especially any so violent as vigorous flapping, would
perhaps be sufficient for the purpose.

DIRECT FLIGHT IN HIGH WINDS.

The hypothesis of ascending currents is applicable to spiral flight
only, and can not account for direct flight without loss of elevation, for
the reason that under the actual circumstances of flight currents of the
necessary magnitude and strength can not by any rational supposition
be accounted for. Thus, it is incredible that the albatross, while wander-
ing back and forth for miles across a stormy sea at an elevation seldom
exceeding 100 feet, can be supported by ascending currents like those
which, there is good reason to believe, carry the land birds upward in
light winds. Any ascending current which might exist would of neces-
sity be swept on by the winds which enveloped it, as tornadoes are
known to be, and if the birds were swept on with it it could only be
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 203

kept afloat by moving in circles so as to maintain a high velocity rela-
tive to the current, whereas in reality the bird is able to maintain a
steady course into the wind, and must consequently soon pass out of
any ascending current it may encounter. We of necessity, therefore,
are driven to look to some other hypothesis for an explanation of those
marvelous flights of the albatross and other sea birds whose evolutions
fairly bewilder the beholder; and, having worked out an hypothesis
which seems in harmony with all the phenomena of spiral flight, we
now come face to face with a new class of phenomena and a new kind
of flight under conditions which the present hypothesis does not demand.
A theory has been outlined by Mr. Langley, in his treatise on The Inter-
nal Work of the Wind, which I think supplies us with a key to the
mystery, and my purpose is only to point out in what way that theory
finds its practical application in the flight of such birds as the alba-
tross, which, Il am informed by Professor Ridgway, never rises, as the
vultures do, to great heights in circles, and which rarely, if ever, resorts
to that mode of flight. M. Mouillard states that it can not soar in winds
having a velocity of less than 11 miles an hour, and while Professor Ridg-
way is confident he has seen the smaller species soar in much lighter
winds, the fact is well established that as the winds increase in violence
its power of sustained flight without flapping inereases accordingly. We
have here to look rather to the internal movements of the wind, toits
innumerable slight changes in direction and velocity, rather than to
ascending masses of air, for a solution of the problem. Some experi-
ments which I have made go to show that the changes in direction take
place with astonishing rapidity, amounting usually to many times each
- second and varying several degrees from the general trend of the wind,
and there is reason for believing that they increase in rapidity and vio-
lence with the velocity of the wind. While the bird in light winds may
utilize ascending currents and avoid the descending, it is evident
that in direct flight it has no such choice, and while buoyed up by the
ascending it must deal with a like number which are descending and
which tend to depress it. It is here that the concavo-convex form of
the wing finds its advantage. Given an equal number of ascending
and descending currents, beating incessantly upon the wing, the con-
cave side will prove the more efficient surface, and there will be an
excess of pressure from below upward. We see the operation of the
same principle in the action of the cups of an anemometer and in the
wing of the flapping birds. ‘The effect is in reality the same whether
the bird beats its wings in a still air or holds them rigid while the wind
beats against them. In the first case the necessary energy is supplied
by the bird, in the second by the wind, and in each case the energy
expended becomes effective through the peculiar form of the wing. The
albatross habitually flies low, seldom rising more than 50 feet above the
water, and it might be suggested that the waves act as wind breaks to
produce ascending currents, which serve to sustain the bird. But in

answer we bave only to point to the flight of the vultures, which, unlike
the sea birds, fly high and may maintain their course uninterruptedly
into a high wind at great altitudes. Nor need we, in fact, look away
from the sea birds for an evidence to show that wind breaks, although
often utilized by the bird, offer no satisfactory solution of the problem.
Quite recently I spent some time in watching the flight of two gulls on
the Potomae River. <A stiff breeze was blowing, but the waves which
it produced were scarcely 12 inches high—entirely too small to be ettect-
ive as wind breaks—while the broad expanse of water, the level nature
of the surrounding country, and the direction from which the wind
came precluded any assumption of a general rising current of the air.
Considered in its entire mass, there is every reason to believe that the
wind was horizontal. In this horizontal wind, by rising to a height of
about 40 feet the gulls were able to soar with the utmost ease, sailing
steadily into the wind or across it without loss of elevation and without
flapping. ‘This and similar occurrences go to show that a strong hori-
zontal wind, though not, so far as we have any evidence, a homogeneous
one, suffices for sustained soaring flight. Only the small and rapid
changes in the direction of the actual wind, whose course, in general, is
horizontal, are here supposed to become effective in sustaining the bird.
However, in his work on The Internal Work of the Wind, Mr. Langley,
while including under this title the energy arising from all changes in
the condition of the wind, whether in velocity or direction, applies the
theory more particularly to a consideration of the available power
resulting from changes in the velocity. In addition, then, to the energy
obtained from the winds in the manner just described, there must be
considered that which arises from the latter source, and all these varia-
tions taken together constitute, in their effect upon resisting bodies,
the internal work of the wind.

We have finally to consider flight in winds of moderate velocity.
Looking again to the birds for the facts from which to reason, we find
in such winds they still soar, but in a manner which is neither that
adopted in feeble winds nor in strong ones, but intermediate in char-
acter. In moderate winds the bird avails himself of the power found
in ascending currents and also in the internal movements of the wind.
In light winds it rises only by soaring in circles; in heavy winds this
method may be, and usually is, wholly discarded, the flight becoming
sustained and direct; while in moderate winds it is still under the
necessity of rising in circles, but less frequently than when the winds
are light, and while sustained flight in direct courses is no longer pos-
sible as in the case of high winds, it yet obtains from the winds a cer-
tain amount of uplift which renders its rate of descent less rapid than
it would be in a calm orin light winds. Observation abundantly shows
that in direct flight the rate of descent is indirectly proportional to the
velocity of the wind. Thus if a bird in a calm descends at the rate of
3 feet per second, the rate of descent will be reduced to 2 feet per second
ON SOARING FLIGHT. 205

in a wind of a certain velocity, to 1 foot per second as the velocity
becomes greater, while for a sufficiently high velocity there will be no
descent at all, and as the velocity still further increases the bird may
ascend where before it had been descending. In direct flight in a
calm the black vulture will be found to maintain his elevation only by
flapping its wings one-third of the time; in a light wind it will flap less
frequently; in a moderate wind still less frequently; while in a high
wind it will cease flapping entirely. Thesupporting power of the wind
thus varies not only as its velocity relative to the bird, but also as its
absolute velocity. In moderate winds, therefore, the bird, if it does not
flap, can only increase its altitude by soaring in circles, but in direct
flight itsdescentis less rapid than in light winds, and it can consequently
sail further and need not so frequently resort to spiral flight. But as
an ascending column of air can not maintain a fixed locality, but must
be carried forward with the wind, the bird, if it utilizes such currents,
must also drift with the wind. ‘This it will almost invariably be found
doing when the winds are light or moderate. Thus if it be advancing
into a wind it will turn upon its course and drift with it whenever it
attempts to rise by soaring in circles. The bird may, of course, in
high winds circle without drifting, as there is then no necessity for
utilizing ascending currents, and we find in this fact a complete refu-
tation of the supposition that ascending currents depend for their
minaintenance upon wind-breaks, since wind-breaks can not move.across
the country as ascending currents do.

As some writers have seemingly regarded the effect of wind-breaks
aS an important factor in the problem of flight, I may state on the
authority of Professor Ridgway that on the level, treeless prairies of
the West, where no wind-breaks occur, the birds soar as perfectly as in
regions where wind-breaks are of common occurrence. My own obser-
vation has been that the birds habitually take advantage of existing
wind-breaks, such as hill slopes, ridges, buildings, and railroad embank-
ments, as they may often be seen following the crest of a ridge upon
the windward side for long distances, but that when every allowance
has been made for their possible influence the problem of flight in its
essential features remains unchanged when this factor has been taken
out.

What I have said seems in general to be corroborated by the obser-
vations of M. Mouillard, who says of the great tawny vulture: “If the
wind be feeble he can climb into the air by circling round and.drifting
back somewhat. If the wind be brisk enough to sustain him thor-
oughly he can rise perpendicularly, facing the wind, without wheeling
round, and even advance into the wind while rising. This unlimited
advance against the wind current without beat of wing, without appar-
ent effort, and almost without act of guidance, is performed every day
by myriads of winged creatures; and if the reader doubts the fact he
can thoroughly satisfy himself by a trip to the trade-wind latitudes.”
206 ON SOARING FLIGHT.

Unquestionably the problem presented by the soaring birds is a diffi-
cult one, as the air in which the bird moves is invisible, our knowledge
of its movemeuts is limited, and the bird himself must be studied from
a distance. No solution amounting to ademonstration can at present,
therefore, be looked for. Nevertheless, some sort of a solution is desir-
able if only to give direction to our investigations, and the proposed
solution here given of flight in light winds, if it should prove to be the
correct one, opens up possibilities of artificial flight which can scarcely
be overestimated, for the sources of power which enable the bird to fly
with so little expenditure of its energies are all perhaps equally avail-
able for man in artificial flight, since the maneuver of flying in circles
is very simple and is one which could be easily reproduced.
THE REVIVAL OF ALCHEMY:!

By H. CARRINGTON BoLtToN, Ph. D.

“‘Superfluous rehearsalls I lay asyde,
Intendyng only to give trew informatyon
Both of the theoryke and practicall
operatyon ;
That by my wrytyng who so will
guyded be,
Of hys intente perfyctly speed thall he.”
GEORGE RIPLEY (1471).
' Fraud, folly, and failure have been deeply written into the annals of
alchemy in all ages. It was early characterized as an “ art without art,
beginning with deceit, continued by labor, and ending in poverty,” and
in modern times its extravagant pretensions have been condemned by
an exact and critical science; yet notwithstanding there are to-day
indications of a resuscitation of the captivating theories and of renewed
attempts at their practical application, of great interest to students of
the intellectual vagaries of mankind.

Belief in the possibility of prolonging life by an artificial elixir and
of transmuting base metals into silver and gold was generally enter-
tained in the Middle Ages, not only by the ignorant masses, but even
by serious-minded philosophers imbued with all the learning of the
time; and the popular faith was sustained by the tricks of unprinci-
pled imposters who found it profitable to prey upon the credulity and
avarice of their fellow-men. Those who in modern times have written
of alchemists find in the extravagant views of a Paracelsus, and in the
careers of a Flamel, a Sendivogius, or of a John Dee more entertain-
Ing materials than in the abstract conceptions of sober philosophers,
and consequently most readers are more familiar with the misdeeds of
adventurers than with the honest beliefs of respectable men of science.
Before condemning those who labored day and night to solve the prob-
lems of transmutation and the elixir of life, we should consider their
intellectual environment. Superstitious beliefs of every kind prevailed;
even the sciences were in bondage; astronomy was dominated by

astrology; medicine was intluenced by magic; natural history was sub-
ject to blind belief in authorities, and scientific chemistry was entirely
overwhelmed by the chimeras of alchemy. Kepler and Tycho Brahe,
at the court of Rudolph II did not think it beneath their dignity to
cast horoscopes for gain and to predict the future by consulting the
positions of celestial bodies, even while formulating the laws govern-
ing their motions. European crowned heads retained astrologers and
alchemists as members of their courts. A century later Sir Isaac New-
ton dabbled with furnaces and chemicals in true hermetic style; and
Leibnitz showed the courage of his convictions by acting as secretary
of an alchemical society in Germany. The influence of superstition
on the mental attitude of truly great men decreased with the advance-
ment of learning, and when the foundations of scientific chemistry
were laid by Priestley, Lavoisier, Scheele, and their contemporaries the
doctrines of alchemy were abandoned. And yet not wholly aban-
doned, for there seems to have been a small number of persons in all
countries who have clung to the hope of realizing transmutation, a
hope sustained by the desire to reap the golden reward. This minor-
ity rejected the extravagant belief in a life-prolonging elixir, and in
the divine origin of the profound secrets of the initiated, and sought
to appropriate from the growing sciences such discoveries and theories
as could be interpreted in favor of transmutation.

The printing press has never ceased to issue works devoted to the
subject. Some authors have written of a ‘higher chemistry,” and
others have sought to reconcile the new doctrines of chemists with
the ancient theories of alchemists. As recently as 1832 a German
professor wrote a learned volume with the avowed intent of proving
the verity of transmutation from historical sources (Schmieder’s
Geschichte der Alchemie, Halle, 1832). The number of reprints of the
grotesque writings of reputed adepts which have appeared since
chemistry has become an exact science is surprisingly large, and the
fact that they find purchasers indicates a small but zealous class of
hermetic students. So eminent a chemist as Sir Humphrey Davy did
not hesitate to affirm that some of the doctrines of alchemy are not
unphilosophical.

Recent discoveries in physics, chemistry, and psychology have given
the disciples of Hermes renewed hopes, and the present position of
chemical philosophy has given the fundamental doctrine of alchemy a
substantial impetus. The favorite theory of a prima materia, or primary
matter, the basis of all the elementary bodies, has received new support
by the discoveries of allotropism of the elements, isomerism of organic
compounds, the revelations of the spectroscope, the practical demon-
Strations by Norman Lockyer, the experiments on the specific heat of
gaseous bodies at a high temperature by Mallard and Le Chatelier, the
discoveries of Sir William Crookes (as set forth in his monograph on
Meta-elements), the discovery by Carey Lea of several singular allo-

tropic forms of silver, and, most weighty of all, the mass of related
facts and phenomena which find their ultimate expression in the peri-
odic law of the elements, so that many chemists of the present day are
inclined to believe in the mutual convertibility of elements having
similar chemical properties. Daniel Berthelot, in his notable work
entitled ‘“‘ De V’allotropie des corps simples,” boldly affirms his belief in
the unity of matter. He says: ‘‘ Without seeking to find in any one
of the known elements the generator of the others, can we not invoke
the facts that we have revealed in our study of carbon in favor of the
hypothesis of a unique matter unequally condensed?” And elsewhere
he writes: ‘‘The transmutation of an element is nothing more than the
transformation of the motions which determine the existence of said
element and which gives it special properties into the specific motions
peculiar to the existence of another element.”

Simultaneously with the development of the truly scientific aspect of
alchemical theory, there has arisen an extraordinary revival of the
metaphysical side of the question; this goes hand in hand with the
interest in chiromancy, astrology, theosophy, and occult sciences which
occupy so large a place in modern thought, literature, and polite society
on both sides of the Atlantic. This tendency to cultivate the esoteric
manifests itself in the study of the Kabala, the investigation of the
mysteries of Buddhism, Confucianism, and other oriental philosophies,
in researches into the phenomena of spiritualism, so*called, and in the
foundation of societies to study psychic force and the tenets of the fol-
lowers of Madame Blavatsky; crystal gazing, reading in magie mirrors,
slate writing, planchette, the quasi-scientifie study of apparitions, of
table turnings, of rappings by unseen powers, of telepathy, of sublimi-
nal self, are now regarded as legitimate pursuits in no wise necessarily
associated with the black arts of medieval times, provided only they
are conducted in a spirit of inquiry and for the purpose of discovering
the latent power underlying these phenomena. And this line of research
receives stimulus from the results secured by students of experimental
psychology, of hypnotism, from such discoveries as the phenomena of
the X-rays, and from the transcendental physicists who theorize on the
miraculous consequences of four dimensional matter. Crowded lecture
halls reward exhibitions of trance mediums, speakers on theosophy,
palmistry, and occultism; in lower walks of life fortune tellers and
clairvoyants reap a modest harvest; books treating of occult themes
enjoy great notoriety; writers of fiction find it profitable to introduce
the mysterious into the children of their brains; even secular journals,
especially those of France, give space to the all-absorbing discussions
on hermetism; these are some of the evidences of great popular interest
in the unknowable. Only persons with special intellectual equipment
are able to measure, weigh, sift, and coordinate the novel phenomena
gathered by researches in the field of hypnotism, psychology, and
occultism; those of weaker mental powers fail to perceive the real sig-

nificance of the discoveries and are led away into unprofitable and
dangerous superstitions.

In the Middle Ages alchemy was nurtured by ignorant superstition;
now it is fostered by the prevalent devotion to esoteric studies; for-
merly the popular belief was in part supported by the fraudulent claims
of impostors; now a higher standard of intelligence rejects the trans-
parent tricks of imitators of Cagliostro. There are, indeed, occasional
attempts to swindle the credulous by appeals to avarice. We read in
the daily press of an American confidence man who tried to cheat a
London jeweler by pretending to “multiply” sovereigns; of a vulgar
scheme of fraud among ignorant tradesmen on the east side of New
York City, in which lead, iron scraps, crucibles, and furnaces formed
the properties; and of the larger operations of an educated French
chemist who found dupes in both South and North America; but in
each of these cases the severe logic of law courts intervened and ab-
ruptly discomfited the swindlers.. It is nut by sleight-of-hand that the
revival of alchemy is now being engineered, but by a company of edu-
cated charlatans.

The movement to resuscitate alchemical doctrines and practices has
been particularly successful in France, where there are to-day four
societies and a “university ” claiming to possess occult knowledge of
hermetic mysteries. These secret societies are named ‘‘ Ordre de la
Rose-Croix,” “T’Ordre Martiniste,”‘La Société d’? Homéopathie Her-
métique” and “L’ Association Alchimique de France.”

The first two of these societies seem to work on lines similar to Free
Masonry, and claim that their secret mysteries were bequeathed by the
last sages of Atlantis and by the Lemures to their brethren in Asia and
Egypt, dwellers in sanctuaries whence issued Krishna, Zoroaster, Her-
mes, Moses, Pythagoras, and Plato. The priestly magi who preserved
this lore in the temples of Thebes, Heracleopolis, Aphrodite, Pthah, .
and Serapis were succeeded by secret alchemical societies of the first
centuries of our era; then followed the hermetic lodges of the Arabs,
and these gave rise to the Templars, the Rosicrucians, and the Martin-
ists. -

The third society cultivates especially occult therapeutics, a system
of medicine invented in the sixties by Count Cesar Mattei, of Bologna,
which unites the principles of Hahnemann with those of the ILatro-
chemists, disciples of Paracelsus. This new departure in medicine
publishes four monthly organs and special treatises all its own.

The Alchemical Association of France is successor to the Société
Hermétique which was founded by the late Albert Poisson (+ 1894), also
known by the pen-name Philophotes. Its seatis in Paris. The objects
of the association, as set forth in its constitution, are “the theoretical
and experimental study of evolution and of the transmutation of bodies.
Its members, with this end in view, study the processes of the ancient
alchemists and compare them with the work of modern chemists.” These

objects are to be accomplished as follows: ‘‘The association proposes
to assist in reviving the unitary doctrines of chemistry: First, by group-

ing the efforts of isolated workers by means of ‘L’/Hyperchimie; ;”? second,

by furnishing them the aid of advanced students; third, by supplying
so far as possible books and apparatus to its members. Researches of
the members, when approved by the masters, should be forwarded in
duplicate to the secretary-general; one will be printed in ‘L’Hyper-
chimie,’ and the other will be preserved in the archives of the associa-
tion for the benefit of members, who can secure it on demand.” ‘ Can-
didates for admission must pass an examination in, first, the theory
and history of alchemy, and, second, the elements of physics and of
chemistry (without mathematics). A diploma from a normal, poly-
technic, or industrial school will be accepted in place of No. 2.”

The affairs of the association are controlled by the secretary- general,
F. Jollivet-Castelot (of Douai), assisted by seven councilors, who hold
an annual meeting. There are at present (July, 1897) two honorary
members—Camille Flammarion, the popular writer on astronomy, and
August Strindberg, a Swede residing in Austria, author of several
hermetic essays. There are two other classes of members, masters
(maitres), who are chosen from the ordinary members of the council
after an examination of their writings; and ordinary members (mem-
bres adhérents), of which the number is unlimited. Modest dues entitle
the members to the organ of the association, ‘ L’ Hyperchimie,’ a monthly
review of alchemy and hermetism founded in 1896.

The councilors of the Alechemical Association have combined with
the active members of the other societies named to establish a Univer-
sité Libre des Hautes Etudes. At present this includes three faculties:

1. Faculte des Sciences Hermétiques, of which the Association Alchi-
mique forms a section. The director of this faculty is Dr. G. Encausse,
and the course of instruction embraces the study of the Tarot, alechem-
ical philosophy and practice, occultism, mysticism, Hebrew, ete. The
curriculum leading to the “baccalauréat-en-Kabbale” is under the
supervision of the group of esoteric students, while candidates for the
degrees of master and doctor are under the direction of the Martinist
Order.

2. Faculté des Sciences Magnétiques, represented by the Ecole de
Magnétisme de Paris, and under the direction of M. Durville. It has
branches at Lyons, Bordeaux, and other cities.

3. Faculté Spirite, comprising several sections of spiritism.

Hach faculty preserves complete independence, being “united only
by moral bonds destined to hasten expansion of the rational spiritual-
istic movement.”

The nature of the instruction given at this university will appear in
the review of the philosophy of its promoters.

The leading spirits in these secret societies and in this university are

Association, special delegate to the supreme council of the Martinists,
editor of L’Hyperchimie, and author of ‘‘Comment on devient Alchi-
miste,” “‘ L’Hylozoisme,” and other alchemic treatises; Dr. M. H. E.
Lalande, whose pen name is Mare Haven; F. Ch. Barlet, author of
‘¢Hssai sur Evolution de V’Idée.” Dr. G. Encausse, who generally
conceals his identity under the signature Papus, is president of the
esoteric group,' president of the supreme council of the Martinists,
and the author of sixteen treatises on hermetism and magic, among
which may be named “ Traité élémentaire de magie pratique.” Papus
is also editor of ‘“L’Initiation,” a journal devoted to theosophy, magic,
and occultism, and of ‘Le Voile d’Isis,” a weekly review of spiritual-
ism. Stanislas de Guaita is best known as the author of ‘“‘ Le Temple
de Satan,” “Clef de la Magie Noire,” and ‘“‘ Le Probleme du Mal,”
works dealing with sorcery, the astral light in man, and other mys-
teries. Marius Decrespe’s essay on “ Les Microbes de l’ Astral,” Paul
Sédir’s “Les Incantations,” and Albert de Rocha’s ‘“ Exteriorisation
de la Motricité” are works which indicate the mental attitude of those
engaged in the revival of alchemy and hermetism. A bibliography of
this class of works is here out of place. A single trade catalogue
enumerates one hundred and twenty titles, chiefly of recent date.

One of the oldest workers in the Alchemical Association is the
‘smaster,” Théodore Tiffereau. In 1854-55 he sent to the French Acad-
emy of Sciences six memoirs, in which he claimed to have discovered a
method of converting silver into gold. Tiffereau had made his experi-
ments in Mexico at great expense, supporting himself meanwhile by
taking daguerreotypes. His process was repeated at the mint in Paris
before the assayer, M. Levol, but with little success. The substance of
his memoirs was published in 1855 in a volume entitled ‘‘ Les Métaux
sont des Corps Composés;” of this a new edition was published by
Lermina in 1889. Tiffereau has never abandoned his claim, and as
recently as October, 1896, he addressed another memoir to the acad-
emy, in which he attempts to prove that the metal aluminum is a com-
pound. Briefly stated, his process is as follows: He placed in a stout
glass tube a piece of aluminum foil with pure nitric acid and sealed the
tube hermetically. He then exposed the tube and contents to the sun’s
rays during two months. At the end of this time he opened the tube;
it gave out an odor which he thought was due to ether, and it yielded
a few grams of crystals, which he thought tasted like acetie acid.
Since both ether and acetic acid are compounds of carbon, Tiffereau
concluded that this element was derived from the aluminum. Analyti-
cal chemists would criticize this experiment in several points. They
would say Tiffereau did not demonstrate the absence of carbon in the

metal used, and that he depended upon smell and taste for proofs of the
carbon compounds. The tongue and the nose are incontestably useful
adjuncts to the reagents of a chemical laboratory, but additional tests
for ether and acetic acid would have been more conclusive. In Tiffe-
reau’s recent writings he attributes the transmutation of a base metal
into the most precious one to the action of the “microbe of gold.”

For a student of chemistry to read, digest, and write down in intelli-
gible language, in a limited space, the principles of this new school of
chemical philosophers is a difficult task, even for one somewhat familiar
with the literature of the ancient alchemists; consequently the follow-
ing analysis falls far short of the ideal. It is properly the work of a
kabalist, a theosophist, and a magician, proud designations which the
writer disclaims. The modern alchemists accept all the traditions of
their ancient predecessors, but give them a new significance, and in-
terweave the novel phenomena derived from researches in pure science.
They claim that during the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth cen-
turies the official schools of instruction taught exclusively the physical
part of the sciences, and that the metaphysical part (which is the real
life and soul of the study) has been rejected under the opprobrious
name of occult science. This living aspect of science has, however,
been studied in the secret societies of the initiated, which have pre-
served the traditions of the kabala, the mysteries of hermetism, and
the practice of transmutation. The study of science is as much a reli-
gious question as an intellectual one, and worship at an altar should sus-
tain and enlighten the worker in a laboratory... ‘‘ Chemistry, alchemy,
and hermetic philosophy form three steps of the ladder which leads the
initiated from the laboratory, through artistic realization, to the oratory:
Labora, Opera, Ora et Invenies.”

The modern alchemists also maintain that Darwin and his disciples
appreciated but a small part of the great doctrine of evolution, which
should be applied to the chemical elements as well as to living beings.
The starting point in the evolution of elements is the ether (the uni-
versal astral fluid of the kabalists), the infinitely divisible particles of
which form chemical atoms by agglomeration. This etheris condensed
energy, and hence all matter is resolved into energy.

Energy, matter, and motion form a trinity analogous to the Divine
Trinity, one in substance, three in appearance. Matter is one in kind,
and the diversity of chemical bodies results from differences in group-
ing and in motions of the constituent particles. Intelligence is allied
in a mysterious way with matter and energy, forming another trinity.
Every atom centralizes intelligence, is in itself a living entity, and by
a process of self-evolution yields the diverse natural bodies. ‘ Ether
is the father of hydrogen, from which are derived oxygen, nitrogen,
carbon, etc., combinations due to etheric vortices.” ‘‘ Perhaps helium
Should precede hydrogen.” This view of matter as a living entity is
greatly insisted on, and the doctrine is called Hylozoism. An alchem.

ist who expects to succeed must possess psychic power over the atoms, ~
so that by the action of his will they shall group themselves to form the
metal desired.

Such is the physical philosophy of modern alchemists. The kabalistic
philosophy is by no means so clear, being closely linked to the Tarot,
which signifies the “hieroglyphs and algebraic calculations of the
primordial genesis.”

Students of the mystical philosophy of the Hebrews discover pro-
found occult significance in accidental similarities of widely differing
objects and phenomena. The seven planets, seven days of the week,
seven colors, seven orifices in the head, seven metals known to the
ancients, seven archangels, and seven infernal demons present to the
truly kabalistic mind marvelous and precious analogies. In the Table
of Concordance of Major Arcana these correspondences are given:
Heth-—Justice-Elementary existence-Nizah-—Cancer-—June—Hydrogen-
Fire.

Jollivet-Castelot has written of Kabalistic Alchemy, and a perusal of
his essays leaves in the mind of the uninitiated confused memories of
colors, numbers, signs of the zodiac, alchemical operations as distilla-
tion, fixation and the like, the names of the sons of Jacob, certain
precious stones, geometrical figures, Hebrew characters, Azoth, quin-
tessence, and the devil, all discussed in a language as obscure as the
symbolism portrayed. To conceal esoteric mysteries abbreviations are
often used, but one does not have to be very deeply initiated to recog-
nize in P .-. Ph.-. pierre philosophale, and in G.:. O.:. grand
oeuvre.

Astral light is an important factor in modern hermetism, and is
related very closely to the “radiant matter” of chemists and the
“ether” of physicists. ‘Astral light is the universal agent, the uni-
versal plastic mediator, the common receptacle of vibrations of motion
and of the phantoms of form.” It is also the Od of the Hebrews and
of Baron von Reichenbach; it is the great Thelesma of Hermes Tris-
megistus, and the control of this force constitutes the great arcana of
practical magic. It heats, illuminates, magnetizes, attracts, repels,
vivifies, destroys, coagulates, separates, crushes, and gathers all things
under the stimulus of powerful wills; it isa perpetual and transforma-
ble vibration. Its kabalistic figure, represented by the Serpent of
Theogonies, is:

When the universal light magnetizes the universe it is called astral
light; when it forms metals it is called Azoth, or the Mercury of the
Sages; when it gives light to animals it is called animal magnetism.

izethem. Herein lies the secret of transmutation, and 1¢ becomes the
privilege of the hermetist to acquire the power of controlling this
agent.

The adepts in this phase of hermetism still appeal to the Tabula
Smaragdina of Hermes Trismegistus as the embodiment of alchemic
lore. The ‘‘Father of Alchemy,” who has been identified with Canaan,
Noah’s grandson, invented arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music,
taught writing to the Egyptians, and gave laws and religious rites to
the people. He was perfectly acquainted with the ‘philosophers’
stone,” and, desirous that posterity should inherit the wonderful secret,
he had the whole art of creating gold engraved on an emerald tablet,
which was placed in his sepulcher. Many years later this was removed
by Sarah, Abraham’s wife, and she concealed it in a cave near Hebron.
There it remained until again discovered by Alexander the Great. The
inscription reads in part as follows:

“T speak not of fictitious things, but of that which is most true and
certain. Whatsoever is below is like that which is above, and that which
is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one
thing. Also, since all things were made from one by the help of one, so
all things are made from one thing by conjunction. The Father thereof
is the Sun and the Mother thereof is the Moon; the wind carries it in
his belly, and the nurse thereof is the earth. * * * This thing has
more fortitude than fortitude itself, because it will overcome every sub-
tile thing and penetrate every solid thing. By it this world was formed.
Hence proceed wonderful things which in this wise were established.
For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistus, because I possess
three parts of the philosophy of the whole world. What I had to say
about the work of the sun is completed.”

Writers on modern alchemy discuss the marvels of palingenesis, of
homuneuli, and of gamahes; they write of the materialization of a
metal through the medium (mediumnité) of a metal; they cite the
“Rules of Philalethes,” the works of George Ripley and of the Cos-
mopolite, and refer in the same essay to Berzelius, Berthelot, and
Moissan. We are told that “le diable est le singe de Dieu,” and that
the ‘“‘Cherubim of the Ark of the Covenant symbolizes the male and
female of the Universe, the Alchemical Father and Mother,” by the
very authors who show acquaintance with the most recent advances
in pure chemistry. In liquid fluorin they perceive a realization of the
Alkahest, or universal solvent, long sought by medieval alchemists.

Accustomed to juggle with numbers, the kabalist finds abundant
opportunity in the atomic weights of the elements, and he makes the
most of his opportunity. When the arithmetical sum of the atomic
weights of elements entering into a given compound chances to equal
‘the atomic weight of gold, this accidental correspondence is seized
upon as a pretext for claiming hermetic relationship between the two
substances,
216 THE REVIVAL OF ALCHEMY.

August Strindberg has devoted much study to such correspondence,
and points out the following:

K,Mn0O,= 197 = Au
Cu,Cl,= 196 = Au

Fe;S = 0 = AML

©,H,I + 4 Br=197 = Au

He uses both 196 and 197 as the atomic weight of gold to suit his
purposes, and seems to be very weak in arithmetic, for the hypothetical
body Fe;S has a molecular weight of 200.

The ammonium-ferrous-sulphate crystallized with six molecules of
water, which chances to have a molecular weight equal to that of gold,
is used by Strindberg as basis of the following experiment, which
serves to show his method of reasoning and of operating.

Ammoniacal sulphate of iron = 392 = Au is perhaps the solution of
the enigma. Sulphate of iron (green copperas) precipitates solutions
of gold. To precipitate, according to monist-chemistry, is to enter as
a factor into the reconstitution of the body of a compound. Soak a
strip of paper in a solution of sulphate of iron, and expose to the fumes
of ammonia, the paper will assume a bluish-green color, like that of the
protoxide of gold. Dry the strip of paper over a lighted cigar and the
paper will acquire a chestnut-brown color, like that of the deutoxide of
gold. Little by little metallic flakes of a golden-yellow color appear,
forming a nonsolid (non-fixé) gold, when the sulphate of iron produces
an auto-fecondation by self-precipitation. However, the golden flakes
amalgamate with mercury, which property is not shared byiron. After
showing by appropriate tests that iron is still present, the hermetic
chemist proceeds to explain the reaction by assuming the formation of
the hypothetical Fe,;8S = 196 = Au, or of the imaginary compound

Fe,0;+ 2H,O = 196 = Au,

or of the ferrous-ammonium-sulphate = 392 = Au,; and headds: “The
chloride of gold is reduced by the nicotine of the cigar.” Since, how-
ever, no reagent containing chlorine in any form was used in the experi-
ment, this element must have been created at the same time with the
gold, which, however, is “incomplete” gold, soluble in unmixed acids.

A preacher should never be judged by a single sermon, and to do
justice to these nineteenth century alchemists one more “recipe for
gold” may be transcribed: ‘‘ Put into a crucible layers of sheet iron
and of powdered vitriol; place over it another crucible pierced with a
hole for respiration. Heat in anintense fire. Buta flux must be added
to the crucible to prevent melting, viz, 1 kilo litharge, 1 kilo clean:
white sand, mix and add to the crucible at a red heat. Remove with
an iron spoon the yellow oil and put it aside. The two compounds
have not lost weight. This oil is dry water, a fire, a salamander. * * *
You obtain a metal of a golden yellow, having a density of 24, not
THE REVIVAL OF ALCHEMY 217

capable of being minted. This is changed into ordinary gold.” With
the exception of a few unimportant sentences, this is the entire recipe,
but how the final transformation is to be effected is not given.

To acquire knowledge and power for successful hermetic labors, to
become eligible for initiation in the occult societies, is no easy task.
The aspirant must strive valiantly against the passions that assail
him, casting out of his soul pride, anger, jealousy, hatred, avarice,
hypocrisy, idleness. If the candidate for honors desires to become
worthy of the name hermetic philosopher he must prove himself a
Magian; he must learn to exercise his will on matter in all its forms,
and to acquire this power he should practice crystal-gazing and read-

ing in magic mirrors; to learn to perceive the invisible he must with-

draw from the visible, imposing on himself psychie sleep, called by some
hypnosis. As adjuncts to the attainment of the ideal mental state he
should use perfumes, music, and light; and eventually the astral body,
separated from the physical body, will supply the intellectual, moral,
and material illumination indispensable to the great work.

It is rather discouraging to learn that, even after fulfilling all these
hard conditions, no one can realize the perfection desired until he has
passed through several of our planetary existences. The would-be
alchemist must also follow the percepts of Albertus Magnus; he should
be discreet, silent, and must not reveal the result of his labors; he
must reside in an isolated place, and choose the time and the hours for
his tasks; he must be patient, assiduous, and persevering, and he must
be rich enough to bear the expenses of his pursuit. Besides ordinary
chemical apparatus, he should provide several objects indispensable to
his work, a magic wand, a sword to dissolve the astral coagulations, a

magic mirror, a brazier for perfumes, a wooden altar covered with a
white cloth, and an alchemist’s robe of white linen to be worn with
a girdle embroidered in gold and silver. In all his chemical operations
he must project psychic force into the reagents.

Bright prospects for the future of chemical science are claimed by
this school of philosophers. Inorganic chemistry is destined to follow
the lines in which inorganic chemistry has prospered; the formation,
derivation, or rather the evolution of metalloids (so called) and of
metals will be realized through etheric cyclones, different degrees of
condensation of hydrogen. Chemical bodies are of one kind only, and
they are all organic and living.

There is a growing belief among advanced chemists in the theory
that the elementary bodies as known to us are compounds of a unique
primary matter (protyle), and that transformation of one kind into a
Similar one is not beyond the bounds of possibility, but we do not think
that the modern hermetists are pursuing the right path to accomplish
this end; nor do we believe that the world of science is any nearer the
coveted goal of alchemical avarice.
DIAMONDS.!

By WILLIAM CROOKES, F. BR. S.

It seems but the other day I saw London in a blaze of illumination to
celebrate Her Majesty’s happy accession to the throne. As in a few
days the wbole Empire will be celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of our
Queen, who will then have reigned over her multitudinous subjects for
sixty years, what more suitable topic can I bring before you than that
of diamonds? One often hears the question asked: ‘‘ Why Diamond
Jubilee?” I suppose it is a symbol intended to give a faint notion of
the pure brillianey and durability of the Queen’s reign; and in thus
associating Her Majesty with the precious diamond, to convey an idea
of those noble qualities, public and private, which have earned for her
the love, fealty, and reverence of her subjects.

From the earliest times the diamond has occupied men’s minds. It
has been a perennial puzzle—one of the riddles of creation. The phi-
losopher Steffans is accredited with the dictum that ‘‘ Diamond is
quartz which has arrived at self-consciousness;” and an eminent
geologist has parodied this metaphysical definition, saying, “Quartz is
diamond which has become insane.”

Professor Maskelyne, in a lecture ‘“‘On diamonds,” thirty-seven years
ago, in this very theater, said: ‘“‘The diamond is a substance which
transcends all others in certain properties to which it is indebted for its
usefulness in the arts and its beauty as an ornament. Thus.on the one
hand, it is the hardest substance found in nature or fashioned by art.
Its reflecting power and refractive energy, on the other hand, exceed
those of all other colorless bodies, while it yields to none in the perfec-
tion of its pellucidity;” but he was constrained to add, ‘The formation
oi the diamond is an unsolved problem.” .

Recently the subject has attracted many men of science. The devel-
opment of electricity, with the introduction of the electric furnace, has
facilitated research, and I think I am justified in saying that if the dia-
mond problem is not actually solved, it is certainly no longer insoluble.

GRAPHITE.

Intermediate between soft carbon and diamond come the graphites.
The name graphite is given to a variety of carbon, generally crystal-
line, which in an oxidizing mixture of chlorate of potassium and nitric

220 DIAMONDS.

acid forms graphitic acid easy to recognize. Graphites are of varying
densities, from 2 to 3, and generally of crystalline aspect. Graphite
and diamond pass insensibly into one another. Hard graphite and soft
diamond are near the same specific gravity. 'The difference appears to
be one of pressure at the time of formation.

Some forms of graphite exhibit a remarkable property, by which it is |

possible to ascertain approximately the temperature at which graphites
were formed, or to which they have subsequently been exposed. Graph-
ites are divided into “sprouting” and “nonsprouting.” When obtained
by simple elevation of temperature in the arc or the electric furnace
they do not sprout; but when they are formed by dissolving carbon in
a metal at a high temperature, and then allowing the graphite to sepa-
rate out on cooling, the sprouting variety is formed. One of the best
varieties is that which can be separated from platinum in ebullition in
a carbon crucible. The phenomenon of sprouting is easily shown.
Place a few grains in a test tube and heat it to about 170° C., when it
increases enormously in bulk and fills the tube with a light form of
amorphous carbon.

The resistance of graphite to oxidizing agents is greater the higher
the temperature to which it has previously been exposed. Graphites
which are easily attacked by a mixture of fuming nitric acid and
potassium chlorate are rendered more resistant by strong heat in the
electric furnace.

I will now briefly survey the chief chemical and physical character-
istics of the diamond, showing you, by the way, a few experiments
that bear upon the subject.

COMBUSTION OF THE DIAMOND.

When heated in air or oxygen to a temperature varying from 760°
to 875° C., according to its hardness, the diamond burns with produc
tion of carbonic acid. It leaves an extremely light ash, sometimes
retaining the shape of the crystal, consisting of iron, lime, magnesia,
silica, and titanium. In bort and carbonado the amount of ash some-
times rises to 4 per cent, but in clear crystallized diamonds it is seldom
higher than 0.05 per cent. By far the largest constituent of the ash is
iron.

The following table shows the temperatures of combustion in oxygen
of different kinds of carbon:

At the risk of repeating an experiment shown so well at this table
by Professor Dewar, I will heat a diamond to a high temperature in
the oxyhydrogen blowpipe and then suddenly throw it in a vessel
of liquid oxygen. Notice the brilliant light of its combustion. I want
you more especially to observe the white opaque deposit forming in the
liquid oxygen. This: deposit is solid carbonic acid produced by the
combustion of the carbon. I will lead it through baryta water, and
you will see a white precipitate of barium carbonate. With a little
more care than is possible in a lecture I could perform this experiment
quantitatively, leading the carbonic acid and oxygen, as they assume
the gaseous state, through baryta water, weighing the carbonate so
formed, and showing that 1 gram of diamond would yield 3.666
grams of carbonic acid—the theoretical proportion for pure carbon.

Some crystals of diamonds have their surfaces beautifully marked
with equilateral triangles, interlaced, and of varying sizes. Under the
microscope these markings appear as shallow depressions sharply cut
out of the surrounding surface, and these depressions were supposed
by Gustav Rose to indicate the probability that the diamonds at some
previous time had been exposed to incipient combustion. Rose also —
noted that striations appeared on the surface of diamonds burnt before
the blowpipe. This experiment I have repeated on a clear, smooth
diamond, and have satisfied myself that during combustion in the field
of a microscope, before the blowpipe, the surface becomes etched with
markings very different in character from those naturally inscribed on
crystals. _The artificial striae are cubical and closer massed, looking as
if the diamond during combustion had been dissected into rectangular
flakes, while the markings natural to crystals appear as if produced by
the crystallizing force as they were being built up.

IT exhibit on a diagram a form of graphite from the Kimberley blue
ground (reproduced from M. Moissan’s work), which in its flaky erys-
talline appearance strangely resembles the surface of a diamond whose
internal structure has been partially dissected and bared by combustion.
It looks as if this piece of graphite was ready to separate out of its
solvent as diamond, but owing to some insufficient factor it retained its
graphitic form.

PHYSICS OF THE DIAMOND.
The specific gravity of the diamond is from 3.514 to 3.518. For com-

parison, | give in tabular form the specific gravities of the different
varieties of carbon:

This table shows that,if I throw the whole mixture of minerals into
methylene iodide, the hornblende and all above that mineral will rise
to the surface, while the diamond and all minerals below will sink to
the bottom. If I now take these heavy minerals, and throw them into
thallium lead acetate, they will all sink except the diamond, which
floats, and can be skimmed off.

The diamond belongs to the isometric system of crystallography. It
frequently occurs with curved faces and edges. Twin crystals (macles)
are not unc:mmon. Having no double refraction, it shc uld not act on
polarized light; but, as is well known, if a transparent body which
does not so act is submitted to strain of an irregular character, it
becomes doubly refracting, and in the polariscope reveals the existence
of the-strain by brilliant colors arranged in a more or less defined pat-
tern, according to the state of tension in which the crystal exists.
Under polarized light I have examined many hundred diamond erys-
tals, and, with few exceptions, all show the presence of internal tension.
On rotating the polarizer, the black cross, which is most frequently
seen, revolves round a particular point in the inside of the crystal, and,
on examining this point with a high power, we see sometimes a slight
flaw, more rarely a minute cavity. The cavity is filled with gas at an
enormous pressure, and the strain is set up in the stone by the effort of
the gas to escape.

It is not uncommon for a diamond to explode soon after it reaches
the surface, and some have been known to burst in the pockets of the
miners or when held in the warm hand. Large crystals are more liable
to burst than smaller pieces. Valuable stones have been destroyed in
this way, and it is whispered that cunning dealers are not averse to
allowing responsible clients to handle or carry in their warm pockets
large crystals fresh from the mine. By way of safeguard against
explosion, some dealers embed large diamonds in raw potato to insure
sate transit to England.

DIAMONDS. 223

In the substatice of many diamonds we find inclosed black uncrys-
tallized particles of graphite. There also occur what may be considered
intermediate forms between the well-crystallized diamond and graphite.
These are ‘“‘bort” and ‘“‘carbonado.” Bort is an imperfectly crystal-
lized diamond, having no clear portions; therefore it is useless for gems.
Bort is frequently found in spherical globules, and may be of all colors. »
it is so hard that it is used in rock drilling, and when crushed it is
employed for cutting and polishing other stones. Carbonado is the
Brazilian term for a still less perfectly crystallized form of carbon. It
is equally hard, and occurs in porous masses, and in massive black
pebbles, sometimes weighing two or more ounces.

Diamonds vary considerable in hardness, and even different parts of
the same crystal are decidedly different in their resistance to cutting
and grinding. The famous Koh-i-noor, when cut into its present form,
showed a notable variation in hardness. In cutting one of the facets
near a yellow flaw, the crystal became harder and harder the farther
it was cut into, until, after working the mill for six hours at the usual
speed of 2,400 revolutions a minute, little impression was made. The
speed was accordingly increased to more than 3,000, when the work
slowly proceeded. Other portions of the stone were found to be com-
paratively soft, and became harder as the outside was cut away.

Beautifully white diamonds have been found at Inverel, New South
Wales, and from the rich yield of the mine and the white color of the
stones great things were expected. A parcel of many hundred carats
came to England, when it was found they were so hard as to be prac-
tically unworkable as gems, and I believe they were ultimately sold for
rock-boring purposes.

I will illustrate the intense hardness of the diamond by an. experi-
ment: I place a diamond on the flattened apex of a conical block of
steel, and on the diamond I bring down a second cone of steel. With
the electric lantern I will project an image of the diamond and steel
faces on the screen, and force them together by hydraulic power.
Unless I happen to have selected a diamond with a flaw, I shall squeeze
the stone right into the steel blocks without injuring it in the slightest
degree.

But it is not the hardness of the diamond so much as its optical
qualities that make it so highly prized. It is one of the most refract-
ing substances in nature, and it also has the highest reflecting proper-
ties. In the cutting of diamonds advantage is taken of these qualities.
When cut as a brilliant the facets on the lower side are inclined so
that light falls on them at an angle of 24° 13’, at which angle all the
incident light is totally reflected. A well-cut diamond should appear
opaque by transmitted light, except at a small spot in the middle where
the table and culet are opposite. All the light falling on the front of
the stone is reflected from the facets, and the light passing into the
diamond is reflected from the interior surfaces and refracted into colors

when it passes out into the air, giving rise to the lightnings and corus-
cations for which the diamond is supreme above all other gems.

other bodies:

According to Dr. Gladstone, the specific refractive energy, / a , will

be for the D line 0.404, and the refraction equivalent, P sed will

be 4.82.
After exposure for some time to the sun many diamonds glow in a dark
room. Some diamonds are fluorescent, appearing milky in sunlight.
In a vacuum, exposed to a high-tension current of electricity, diamonds
phosphoresce of different colors, most South African diamonds shining
with a bluish light. Diamonds from other localities emit bright blue,
apricot, pale blue, red, yellowish green, orange, and pale green light.
The most phosphorescent diamonds are those which are fluorescent in
the sun. One beautiful green diamond in my collection, when phos-
phorescing in a good vacuum, gives almost as much light as a candle,
and you can easily read by its rays. The light is pale green, tending
to white.
CONVERSION OF DIAMOND INTO GRAPHITE.

I will now draw your attention to a strange property of the diamond,
_ which at first sight might seem to argue against the great permanence
and unalterability of this stone. It has been ascertained that the cause
of phosphorescence is in some way connected with the hammering of
the gaseous molecules, violently driven from the negative pole, on to
the surface of the body under examination; and so great is the energy
of the bombardment that impinging on a piece of platinum, or even
iridium, the metal will actually melt. When the diamond is thus bom-
barded in a radiant matter tube the result is startling. It not only
phosphoresces, but assumes a brown color, and when the action is long
continued becomes almost black.
DIAMONDS. 225

I will project a diamond on the screen and bombard it with radiant
matter before your eyes. Some diamonds visibly darken ina few min-
utes, while others, more leisurely in their ways, require an hour.

This blackening is only superficial, but no ordinary means of cleaning
will remove the discoloration. Ordinary oxidizing reagents have little
or no effect in restoring the color. The black stain on the diamond is
due to a form of graphite which is very resistant to oxidation. Itis not
necessary to expose the diamond in a vacuum to electrical excitement
in order to produce a change.

I have already signified that there are various degrees of retractori-
ness to chemical reagents among the different forms of graphite. Some
dissolve in strong nitric acid; other forms of graphite require a mixture
of highly concentrated nitric acid and potassium chlorate to attack
them, and even with this intensely powerful agent some graphites resist
longer than others. M. Moissan has shown that the power of resistance
to nitric acid and potassium chlorate is in proportion to the tempera-
ture at which the graphite was formed, and with tolerable certainty we
can estimate this temperature by the resistance of the specimen of
graphite to this reagent.

The superficial dark coating on a diamond after exposure to molecu-
lar bombardment I have proved to be graphite,! and M. Moissan? has
shown that this graphite, on account of its great resistance to oxidiz-
ing reagents, can not have been formed at a lower temperature than
38,6002 C,

It is therefore manifest that the bombarding molecules carrying
with them an electric charge, and striking the diamond with enormous
velocity, raise the superficial layer to the temperature of the electric
are, and turn it into graphite, while the mass of diamond and its con-
ductivity to heat are sufficient to keep down the general temperature
to such a point that the tube appears scarcely more than warm to the
touch.

A similar action occurs with silver, the superficial layers of which
can be raised to a red heat without the whole mass becoming more than
warm. ?

This conversion of diamond into graphite is, I believe, a pure effect
of heat. In 1880+ Professor Dewar, in this theater, placed a crystal of
diamond in a carbon tube, through which a current of hydrogen was
maintained. The tube was heated from the outside by an electric are,
and in a few minutes the diamond was converted into graphite. I will
now show you that a clear crystal of diamond, heated in the electric
are (temperature 3,600° C.),is converted into graphite, and this graphite

is most refractory. B

226 DIAMONDS.

The diamond is remarkable in anotherrespect. Itis extremely trans-
parent to the Rintgen rays, whereas highly refracting glass, used in
imitation diamonds, is almost perfectly opaque to the rays. I exposed
over a photographic plate to the X-rays for a few seconds the large
Delhi diamond, of a fine pink color, weighing 314 carats, a black dia-
mond weighing 23 carats, together with an imitation in glass of the
pink diamond lent me by Mr. Streeter; also a flat triangular crystal of
diamond of pure water, and a piece of glass of the same shape and size.
On development, the impression where the diamond obscured the rays
was found to be strong, showing that most rays passed through, while
the glass was practically opaque. By this means imitation diamonds
and some other false gems can readily be detected and distinguished
- from the true gems. It would take a good observer to distinguish my
pure triangular diamond from the adjacent glass imitation.

GENESIS OF THE DIAMOND.

Speculations as to the probable origin of the diamond have been
greatly forwarded by patient research, and particularly by improved
means of obtaining high temperatures. Thanks to the success of
Professor Moissan, whose name will always be associated with the
artificial production of diamonds, we are able to-day to manufacture
diamonds in our Jaboratories—minutely microscopic, it is true—all the.
same veritable diamonds, with crystalline form and appearance, color,
hardness, and action on light the same as the natural gem.

Until recent years carbon was considered absolutely nonvolatile and
infusible; but the enormous temperatures at the disposal of experi-
mentalists—by the introduction of electricity—-show that instead of
breaking rules, carbon obeys the same laws that govern other bodies.
It volatilizes at the ordinary pressure at a temperature of about 3,600°
C., and passes from the solid to the gaseous state without liquefying.
It has been found that other bodies which volatilize without liquefy-
ing at the ordinary pressure will easily liquefy if pressure is added to
temperature. Thus, arsenic liquefies under the action of heat if the
pressure is increased; it naturally follows that if along with the requi-
site temperature sufficient pressure is applied, liquefaction of carbon
will be likely to take place, when on cooling it will crystallize. But
carbon at high temperatures is a most energetic chemical agent, and if
it can get hold of oxygen from the atmosphere or any compound con-
taining it, it will oxidize and fly off in the form of carbonicacid. Heat
and pressure, therefore, are of no avail unless the carbon can be kept
inert.

It has long been known that iron when melted dissolves carbon, and
on cooling liberates it in the form of graphite. Moissan discovered
that several other metals have similar properties, especially silver; but
- iron is the best solvent for carbon. The quantity of carbon entering
into solution increases with the temperature, and on cooling in ordinary
circumstances it is largely deposited as crystalline graphite.

Professor Dewar has made a calculation as to the critical pressure of
carbon, that is the lowest pressure at which carbon can be got to assume
_ the liquid state at its critical temperature, that is, the highest tempera-
ture at which liquefaction is possible. He starts from the vaporizing
or boiling point of carbon, which, from the experiments of Violle and
others on the electric are, is about 3,600° C., or 3,874° Absolute. The
critical point of a substance on the average is 1.5 times its absolute
boiling point. Therefore the critical point of carbon is 5,811° Ab., or,
say, 5,800° Ab. But the absolute critical temperature divided by the
critical pressure is for elements never less than 2.5. Then—

Dee 2.5 or PCr = ee *, or 2,320 atmospheres.

The result is that the critical pressure of carbon is about 2,300 atmos-
pheres or, say, 15 tons on the square inch. The highest critical pres-
sure recorded is that of water, amounting to 195 atmospheres, and the
lowest that of hydrogen, about 20 atmospheres. In other words, the
critical pressure of water is ten times that of hydrogen, and the criti-
cal pressure of carbon is ten times that of water.

Now, 15 tons on the square inch is not a difficult pressure to obtain
in a closed vessel. In their researches on the gases from fired gun-
powder and cordite, Sir Frederick Abel and Sir Andrew Noble obtained
in closed steel cylinders pressures as great as 95 tons to the square
inch, and temperatures as high as 4,000°C. Here, then, if the obser-
vations are correct, we have sufficient temperature and enough pres-
sure to liquefy carbon; and if the temperature could only be allowed
to act for a sufficient time on the carbon there is little doubt that the
artificial formation of diamonds would soon pass from the microscopic
stage to a scale more likely to satisfy the requirements of science,
industry, and personal decoration.

ARTIFICIAL MANUFACTURE OF THE DIAMOND.

I will now proceed to manufacture a diamond before your eyes. Don’t
think I yet have a talisman that will make me rich beyond the dreams
ot avarice. Hitherto the results have been very microscopic, and are
chiefly of scientific interest in showing us nature’s workshop, and how
we nay ultimately hope to vie with her in the manufacture of diamonds.
Unfortunately, the operations of separating the diamond from the iron
and other bodies with which it is associated are somewhat prolonged,
nearly a fortnight being required to detach it from the iron, graphite,
and other matters in which it is embedded. I can, however, show the
different stages of the operations, and project on the screen diamonds
made in this manner.

In Paris, recently, I saw the operation carried out by M. Moissan,
the discoverer of this method of making carbon separate out in the
transparent crystalline form, and I can show you the operations
228 DIAMONDS.

straight, as it were, from the inventor’s laboratory. Iam also indebted
to the directors of the Notting Hill Electric Lighting Company and to
the general manager, Mr. Schultz, for enabling me to perform several |
operations at their central station, where currents of 500 amperes and
100 volts were placed at my disposal.

The first necessity is to select pure iron—free from sulphur, silicon,
phosphorus, etc.—and to pack it in a carbon crucible with pure charcoal
from sugar. Half a pound of this iron is then put into the body of the
electric furnace, and a powerful are formed close above it between car-
bon poles, utilizing a current of 800 amperes at 40 volts pressure. The
iron rapidly melts and saturates itself with carbon. After a few min-
utes’ heating to a temperature above 4,000° C.—a temperature at which
_the lime of the furnace melts like wax and volatilizes in clouds—the
current is stopped, and the dazzling fiery crucible is plunged beneath
the surface of cold water, where it is held till it sinks below a red heat.
As is well known, iron increases in volume at the moment of passing
from the liquid to the solid state. The sudden cooling solidifies the
outer layer of iron, and holds the inner molten mass in a tight grip.
The expansion of the inner liquid on solidifying produces an enormous
pressure, and under the stress of this pressure the dissolved carbon
separates out in a transparent, dense, crystalline form—in fact, as
diamond.

Now commences the tedious part of the process. The metallic ingot
is attacked with hot nitro-hydrochlorie acid until no more iron is dis-
solved. The bulky residue, consisting chiefly of .graphite, together
with translucent flakes of a chestnut-colored carbon, black opaque car-
bon of a density of from 3 to 3.5, and hard as diamonds—black dia-
monds or carbonado, in fact, and a small portion of transparent colorless
diamonds showing crystalline structure. Besides these, there may be
carbide of silicon and corundum, arising from impurities in the mate-
rials employed.

The residue is first heated for some hours with strong sulphuric acid
at the boiling point, with the cautious addition of powdered niter. It
is then well washed and allowed for two days to soak in strong hydro-
fluoric acid in the cold, then in boiling acid. After this treatment the
soft graphite will disappear, and most, if not all, of the silicon com-
pounds will be destroyed. Hot sulphuric acid is again applied to
destroy the fluorides, and the residue, well washed, is repeatedly
attacked with a mixture of the strongest nitric acid and powdered
potassium chlorate, kept warm, but, to avoid explosions, not above
60° C. This ceremony must be repeated six or eight times, when all
the hard graphite will gradually be dissolved, and little else left but
graphitic oxide, diamond, and the harder carbonado and bort. The
residue is fused for an hour in fluorhydrate of fluoride of potassium,
then boiled out in water, and again heated in sulphuric acid. The
well-washed grains which resist this energetic treatment are dried,
DIAMONDS. 229

carefully deposited on a slide, and examined under the microscope.
Along with numerous pieces of black diamond are seen transparent,
colorless pieces, some amorphous, others with a crystalline appearance,
as I have attempted to reproduce in diagrams. Although many frag-
ments of crystals occur, it is remarkable that I have never seen a com-
plete crystal. All appear broken up, as if on being liberated from the
intense pressure under which they were formed they burst asunder. I
have direct evidence of this phenomenon. A very fine piece of artificial
diamond, carefully mounted by me on a microscopic slide, exploded
during the night and covered my slide with fragments. This bursting
paroxysmn is not unknown at the Kimberley mines.

On the screen I will project fragments. of artificial diamond, some
lent me by Professor Roberts-Austen, others of my own make, while
on the wall you will see drawings of diamonds copied from M. Moissan’s
book on the electric furnace. Unfortunately these specimens are all
microscopic. The largest artificial diamond, so far, is less than 1 milli-
meter across.

Laboratory diamonds burn in the air before the blowpipe to carbonic
acid, and in luster, crystalline form, optical properties, density, and
hardness they are identical with the natural stone.

Many circumstances point to the conclusion that the diamond of the
chemist and the diamond of the mine are strangely akin as to origin. It
is conclusively proved that the diamond has not been formed in situ in
the biue ground. The diamond genesis must have taken place at great
depths under enormous pressure. The explosion of large diamonds on
coming to the surface shows extreme tension. More diamonds are
found in fragments and splinters than in perfect crystals, and it is
noteworthy that although many of these splinters and fragments are
derived from the breaking up of a large crystal, yet in no instance
have pieces been found which could be fitted together. Does not this
fact point to the conclusion that the blue ground is not their true
matrix? Nature does not make fragments of crystals. As the edges
of the crystals are still sharp and unabraded the locus of formation
can not have been very distant from the present sites. There were
probably many sites of crystallization differing in place and time, or
we should not see such distinctive characters in the gems from different
mines, nor, indeed, in the diamonds from different parts of the same
mine.

THE MECHANISM OF THE DIAMANTIFEROUS PIPES.

How the great diamond pipes originally came into existence is not
difficult to understand in the light of the foregoing facts. They cer-
tainly were not burst through in the ordinary manner of volcanic erup-
tion. The surrounding and inclosing walls show no signs of igneous
action, and are not shattered nor broken even when touching the “blue
ground.” ‘These pipes after they were pierced were filled from below,
and the diamonds formed at some previous epoch too remote to imagine
230 DIAMONDS.

were erupted with a mud volcano, together with all kinds of débris
eroded from the adjacent rocks. The direction of flow is seen in the
upturned edges of some of the strata of shale in the walls, although I
was unable at great depths to see any upturning in most parts of the
walls of the De Beers mine.

Let me again refer you to the section through the Kimberley mine.
There are many such pipes in the immediate neighborhood. It may be
that each volcanic pipe is the vent for its own special laboratory—a
laboratory buried at vastly greater depths than we have reached or
are likely to reach—where the temperature is comparable with that
of the electric furnace, where the pressure is fiercer than in our puny
laboratories and the melting point higher, where no oxygen is present,
and where masses of carbon-saturated iron have taken centuries, per-
haps thousands of years, to cool to the solidifying point. Such being
the conditions, the wonder is, not that diamonds are found as big as
one’s fist, but that they are not found as big as one’s head. The chem-
ist arduously manufactures infinitesimal diamonds, valueless as orna-
mental gems; but nature, with unlimited temperature, inconceivable
pressure, and gigantic material, to say nothing of measureless time,
produces without stint the dazzling, radiant, beautiful crystals I am
enabled to show you to-night.

The ferric origin of the diamond is corroborated in many ways. The
country round Kimberley is remarkable for its ferruginous character,
and iron-saturated soil is popularly regarded as one of the indications
of the near presence of diamonds. Certain artificial diamonds present
the appearance of an elongated drop. From Kimberley I have with me
diamonds which have exactly the appearance of drops of liquid sep-
arated in a pasty condition and crystallized on cooling. At Kimberley,
and in other parts of the world, diamonds have been found with little
appearance of crystallization, but with rounded forms similar to those
which a liquid might assume if kept in the midst of another liquid
with which it would not mix. Other drops of liquid carbon retained
above their melting point for sufficient time would coalesce with adja-
cent drops, and on slow cooling would separate in the form of iarge,
perfect crystals. Two drops, joining after incipient crystallization,
would assume the not uncommon form of interpenetrating twin crystals.
Illustrations of these forms from Kimberley are here to-night. Other
modified circumstances would produce diamonds presenting a confused
mass of borty crystals, rounded and amorphous masses, or a hard,
black form of carbonado.

Again, diamond crystals are almost invariably perfect on all sides.
They show no irregular side or face by which they were attached to a
support, as do artificial crystals of chemical salts; another proof that
the diamond must have crystallized from a dense liquid.

When raised the diamond is in a state of enormous strain, as I have
already shown by means of polarized light. Some diamonds exhibit

Rae >
DIAMONDS. — 231

cavities which the same test proves to contain gas at considerable
pressure.

The ash left after burning a diamond invariably contains iron as its
chief constituent; and the most common colors of diamonds, when not
perfectly pellucid, show various shades of brown and yellow, from the
palest “off color” to almost black. These variations accord with the
theory that the diamond has separated from molten iron, and also
explains how it happens that stones from different mines, and even
from different parts of the same mine, differ from each other. Along
with carbon, molten iron dissolves other bodies which possess tinctorial
powers. One batch of iron might contain an impurity coloring the
stones blue, another lot would tend toward the formation of pink
stones, another of green, and soon. ‘Traces of cobalt, nickel, chromium,
and manganese—all metals present in the blue ground—might produce
all these colors.

An hypothesis, however, is of little value if it only elucidates one-
half of a problem. Let us see how far we can follow out the ferric
hypothesis to explain the volcanic pipes. In the first place we must
remember these so-called volcanic vents are admittedly not filled with
eruptive rocks, scoriaceous fragments, etc., constituting the ordinary
contents of volcanic ducts. At Kimberley the pipes are filled with a
geological plum pudding of heterogenous character—agreeing, how-
ever, in one particular. The appearance of shale and fragments of
other rocks shows that the mélange has suffered no great heat in its
present condition, and that it has been erupted from great depths by
the agency of water vapor or some similar gas. How is this to be
accounted for?

It must be borne in mind I start with the reasonable supposition that
at a sufficient depth! there were masses of molten iron at great pressure
and high temperature, holding carbon in solution, ready to crystallize -
out on cooling. In illustration, I may cite the masses of erupted iron
in Greenland. Far back in time the cooling from above caused cracks
in superjacent strata through which water” found its ways. Before
reaching the iron the water would be converted into gas, and this gas
would rapidly disintegrate and erode the channels through which it

passed, grooving a passage more and more vertical in the endeavor
to find the quickest vent to the surface. But steam in the presence of
molten or even red-hot iron rapidly attacks it, oxidizes the metal and
liberates large volumes of hydrogen gas, together with less quantities
of hydrocarbons® of all kinds—liquids, gaseous, and solid. Erosion

, The requisite pressure of 15 tons on the square inch would exist not many miles
beneath the surface of the earth.

“There are abundant signs that a considerable portion of this part of Africa was
once under water, and a fresh-water shell has been found in apparently undisturbed
blue ground at Kimberley.

‘The water sunk in wells close to the Kimberley mine is somtimes impregnated
with paraffin, and Sir H. “Roscoe extracted a solid hydrocarbon from the ‘blue
ground.”

232 DIAMONDS.

commenced by steam would be continued by the other gases, and it
would be no difficult task for pipes, large as any found in South Africa,
to be scored out in this manner. Sir Andrew Noble has shown that
when the screw stopper of his steel cylinders in which gunpowder
explodes under pressure is not absolutely perfect, gas finds its way out
with a rush so overpowering as to score a wide channel in the metal.
Some of these stoppers and vents are on the table. To illustrate my
argument Sir Andrew Noble has been kind enough to try a special
experiment. ‘Through a cylinder of granite is drilled a hole 0.2 inch
diameter, the size of a small vent. This is made the stopper of an
explosion chamber, in which a quantity of cordite is fired, the gases
escaping through the granite vent. The pressureis about 1,500 atmos-
‘pheres, and the whole time of escape is less than half a second. Notice
the erosion produced by the escaping gases and by the heat of friction,
which have scored out a channel over half an inch diameter and melted
the granite along their course. If steel and granite are thus vulnerable
at comparatively moderate gaseous pressure, is it not easy to Imagine
the destructive upburst of hydrogen and water-gas grooving for itself
a channel in the diabase and quartzite, tearing fragments from resist-
ing rocks, covering the country with débris, and finally, at the subsid-
ence of the great rush, filling the self-made pipe with ‘a water-borne
magma in which rocks, minerals, iron oxide, shale, petroleum, and
diamonds are churned together in a veritable witch’s cauldron! As
the heat abated the water vapor would gradually give place to hot
water, which, forced through the magma, would change some of the
mineral fragments into the now existing forms.

Each outbreak would form a dome-shaped hill, but the eroding
agency of water and ice would plane these eminences until all traces
of the original pipes were lost.

Actions, such as I have described, need not have taken place simul-
taneously. As there must have been many molten masses of iron with
variable contents of carbon, different kinds of coloring matter, solidi-
fying with varying degrees of rapidity, and coming in contact with
water at intervals throughout long periods of geological time—so must
there have been many outbursts and upheavals, giving rise to pipes
containing diamonds. And these diamonds, by sparseness of distri-
bution, crystalline character, difference of tint, purity of color, vary-
ing hardness, brittleness, and state of tension, would have impressed
upon them, engraved by natural forces, the story of their origin—a
story which future generations of scientific men may be able to inter-
pret with greater precision than we can to-day.

Who knows but that at unknown depths in the earth’s metallic core
beneath the present pipes there are still masses of iron not yet disin-
tegrated and oxidized by aqueous vapor—masses containing diamonds,
unbroken, and in greater profusion than they exist in the present blue
ground, inasmuch as they are inclosed in the matrix itself, undiluted by
DIAMONDS. Zao

the numerous rock constituents which compose the bulk of the blue
ground. If this be the case a careful magnetic survey of the country
around Kimberley might prove of immense interest, scientific and
practical. Observations, at carefully selected stations, of the three
magnetic elements—the horizontal component of direction, the vertical
component of direction, and the magnetic intensity—would soon show
whether any large masses of iron exist within a certain distance of the
surface. It has been calculated that a mass of iron 500 feet in diam-
eter could be detected were it 10 miles below the surface. A magnetic
survey might also reveal other valuable diamantiferous pipes which,
owing to the absence of surface indications, would otherwise remain
hidden.
METEORIC DIAMONDS.

There is another diamond theory which appeals to the fancy. It is
said that the diamond is a direct gift from heaven, conveyed to earth in
meteoric showers. The suggestion, I believe, was first broached by
A. Meydenbauer,' who says: ‘The diamond can only be of cosmic
origin, having fallen as a meteorite at later periods of the earth’s forma-
tion. The available localities of the diamond contain the residues of
not very compact meteoric masses which may, perhaps, have fallen in
historic ages, and which have penetrated more or less deeply, accord-
ing to the more or less resistant character of the surface where they fell.
Their remains are crumbling away on exposure to the air and sun, and
the rain has long ago washed away all prominent masses. The inclosed
diamonds have remained scattered in the river beds, while the fine,
light matrix has been swept away.”

According to this hypothesis, the so-called volcanic pipes are simply
holes bored in the solid earth by the impact of monstrous meteors—
the larger masses boring the holes, while the smaller masses, disinte-
erating in their fall, distributed diamonds broadcast. Bizarre as such
a theory may appear, I am bound to say there are many circumstances
which show that the notion of the heavens raining diamonds is not
impossible.

In 1846 a meteorite fell in Hungary (the “‘ Ava meteorite”) which
was found to contain graphite in the cubic crystalline system. G. Rose
thought this cubic graphite was produced by the transformation of a
diamond. Long after this prediction was verified by Weinschenk, who
found transparent crystals in the Ava meteorite. Mr. Fletcher has
found in two meteoric irons—one from Youndegin, Kast Australia, and
one from Crosbys Creek, United States—crystals absolutely similar to
those in the Ava meteorite.

In 1886 a meteorite falling in Russia contained, besides other consti-
tuents, about 1 per cent of carbon in light-gray grains, having the
hardness of diamond, and burning in oxygen to carbonic acid.

234 DIAMONDS.

Daubrée says the resemblance is manifest between the diamantiferous
earth of South Africa and the Ava meteorite, of which the stony sub-
stance consists almost entirely of peridot. Peridot being the insepa-
rable companion of meteoric iron, the presence of diamonds in the
meteorites of Ava, of Youndegin, and of Crosbys Creek, bring them
close to the terrestrial diamantiferous rocks.

Hudleston maintains that the bronzite of the Kimberley blue ground
is in a condition much resembling the bronzite grains of meteorites;
whilst Maskelyne says that the bronzite crystals of Dutoitspan resemble
closely those of the bronzite of the meteor of Breitenbach, but are less
rich in crystallographic planes.

But the most striking confirmation of the meteoric theory comes from
Arizona. Here, on a broad open plain, over an area about 5 miles
diameter, were scattered 1,000 or 2,000 masses of metallic iron, the
fragments varying in weight from half a ton to a fraction of an ounce.
There is little doubt these masses formed part of a meteoric shower,
although no record exists as to when the fall took place. Curiously
enough, near the center, where most of the meteorites have been found,
is a crater with raised edges three quarters of a mile in diameter and
about 600 feet deep, bearing exactly the appearance which would be
produced had a mighty mass of iron or falling star struck the ground,
scattering in all directions, and buried itself deep under the surface.
Altogether 10 tons of this iron have already been collected, and speci-
mens of the Canyon Diablo meteorite are in most collectors’ cabinets.

An ardent mineralogist, the late Dr. Foote, in cutting a section of
this neteorite, found the tools were injured by something vastly harder
than metallic iron, and an emery wheel used in grinding the iron had
been ruined. He examined the specimen chemically, and soon after
announced to the scientific world that the Canyon Diablo meteorite
contained black and transparent diamonds. This startling discovery
was afterwards verified by Professors Friedel and Moissan, who found
that the Canyon Diablo meteorite contained the three varieties of
carbou—diamond (transparent and black), graphite, and amorphous
carbon. Since this revelation, the search for diamonds in meteorites
has occupied the attention of chemists all over the world.

I am enabled to show you photographs of true diamonds I haye
myself extracted from pieces of the Canyon Diablo meteorite, 5 pounds
of which I have dissolved in acids for this purpose—an act of vandal-
ism in the cause of science for which I hope mineralogists will forgive
me. <A very fine slab of the meteorite, weighing about 7 pounds, which
has escaped the solvent, is on the table before you.

Here, then, we have absolute proof of the truth of the meteoric
theory. Under atmospheric influences the iron would rapidly oxidize
and rust away, coloring the adjacent soil with red oxide of iron. The
meteoric diamonds would be unaffected, and would be left on the sur-
face to be found by explorers when oxidation had removed the last
DIAMONDS. 235

proof of their celestial origin. That there are still lumps of iron left
in Arizona is merely due to the extreme dryness of the climate and the
comparatively short time that the iron has been on our planet. We
are here witnesses to the course of an event which may have happened
in geologic times anywhere on the earth’s surface.

Although in Arizona diamonds have fallen trom above, confounding
all our usual notions, this descent of precious stones seems what is
called a freak of nature rather than a normal occurrence. To the
modern student of science there is no great difference between the com-
position of our earth and that of extraterrestrial masses. The mineral
peridot is a constant extraterrestrial visitor, present in most meteorites.
And yet no one doubts that peridot is also a true constituent of rocks
formed on this earth. The spectroscope reveals that the elementary
composition of the stars and the earth are pretty much the same; so
does the examination of meteorites. Indeed, not only are the selfsame
elements present in meteorites, but they are combined in the same way
to form the same minerals as in the crust of the earth.

This identity between terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks recalls
the masses of nickeliferous iron of Ovifak. Accompanied with graph-
ite, they form part of the colossal eruptions which have covered a por-
tion of Greenland. ‘They are so like meteorites that at first they were
considered to be meteorites till their terrestrial origin was proved.
They contain as much as 1.1 per cent of free carbon.

It is certain from observations I made at Kimberley, corroborated by
the experience gained in the laboratory, that iron at a high temperature
and under great pressure will act as the long-sought solvent for carbon,
and will allow it to crystallize out in the form of diamond—conditions
existent at great depths below the surface of the earth. But it is also
certain, from the evidence afforded by the Arizona and other meteorites,
that similar conditions have likewise existed among bodies in space,
and that a meteorite, freighted with its rich contents, on more than one
occasion has fallen as a star from the sky. In short, in a physical
sense, heaven is but another name for earth, or earth for heaven.
THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ELEMENTS WITHIN THE LAST
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS!

By CLEMENS WINKLER.

In considering the relative frequency of the substances composing
the crust of the earth, Clarke” admits that down to a depth of 16 kilo-
meters below sea level the composition of that envelope is the same as
that of the superficial strata already examined. The average specific
gravity of these strata is 2.5, which is not much more than half that
of the earth, taken as a whole. Including the ocean and the atmos-
phere, this outer crust is half oxygen and one-fourth silicon, the remain-
ing fourth being made up of the other elements: Aluminum, 7 per cent;
iron, 5.1; calcium, 3.5; magnesium, 2.5; sodium, 2.2, and the same
amount of potassium. Seme elements, whose numerous combinations
have long attracted the attention of the human mind,-are of but slight
importance quantitatively considered; thus, there is found in the crust
of the earth but 0.94 per cent of hydrogen, 0.21 of carbonie acid, 0.09
of phosphorus, and 0.02 of nitrogen. These elements, therefore, which
form immense oceans, and are the very basis of life, furnish but a very
small fraction of the above-mentioned external shell, 16 kilometers
thick, and it seems probable, from soundings hitherto made, that at
the greatest depths they are absent or exist in very small quantities.
Considered with reference to the mass of the whole globe they may be
almost wholly neglected. The amount of chlorine does not exceed 0.15
per cent; yet the amount of chloride of sodium dissolved in the ocean
would suffice to cover the surface of the continents and bury the
highest mountains.

it will be seen from this how little we can judge of the average mass
of the globe, as indicated by its mean density, from an examination of
its external surface. There can not be the least doubt but what the
internal portions of the earth are formed from substances different
from those composing its external strata, and involuntarily the mind
compares our planet with those meteorites whose mass is of iron trav-

238 THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ELEMENTS.

ersed and enveloped by silicates, and which have an amount of phos-
phorus and carbon, as well as of hydrogen and nitrogen, as insignificant
in proportion as is that of the earth, all of which makes it seem prob-
able that they have had a gaseous envelope that has been lost during
their passage through the terrestrial atmosphere.

But if the elements of low specific gravity or great volatility which,
like hydrogen or nitrogen, exist in great quantity around us form but
a very sinall part of the total constituents of our globe, it will be seen
that the elements called rare must compose but an infinitesimal part of
the mass of the earth, especially since, as far as we know at present,
these elements are never found at great depths. I at least am not
aware that the heavy metals—gold, silver, lead, ete.—are found in mate-
rials extracted from great depths or thrown‘out by volcanoes. At the
time of the great eruption of Krakatoa, for example, I sought vainly
for such elements in the cinders ejected by the volcano, which appar-
ently came from great depths. The supposed discovery of a new ele-
ment in the old lavas of Vesuvius has been found to be erroneous.

As we approach the surface of the globe elementary bodies seem to
multiply, and two hypotheses occur for explaining this—displacements
of cosmic matter or the formation of new elements upon the surface of
the globe.

Displacements of cosmic matter are, as is well known, incessant.
The fall of meteorites furnishes a particularly striking example of this,
but it is probable that quantitatively cosmic dust has a greater impor-
tance. Still, neither the meteorites found at various points nor the
dust gathered by Nordenskiéld ! on the ice fields of the polar regions,
and whose extra-terrestrial origin can not be doubted, contain rare ele-
ments. The hypothesis of increase by exterior agency seems, then, to
lack foundation. The new formation of elementary bodies seems, how-
ever, Still less probable. We can, at most, support it by the hypothe-
Sis, suggested but never proven, that bodies now supposed to be sim-
ple may be reduced. Without doubt spectrum analysis reveals to us
transformations that are gradually going on in the matter of the fixed
Stars, but the question is whether known elements transform them-
selves into others equally well kuown. Besides, the conditions of tem-
perature and aggregation of the fixed stars that have been observed
can not be compared with those of the earth.

Kvidently the increase of simple bodies in the exterior strata of the
terrestrial globe is only apparent. It must be recognized that human
science has made great progress and that this progress can not
but have an influence upon the discovery of new elements. The first
electrolytic decompositions of salts and earths attempted at the com-
mencement of this century by Davy by means of a feeble Voltaic pile
demonstrated the existence of metallic radicals that had not been in
the least suspected up to that time; while Moissan, by means of the
powerful currents used to-day, has been able to isolate from its combi-

nations fluorine, hitherto almost unknown. Spectrum analysis has
brought to light the existence of an entire series of elements with char-
acteristic spectra, and it has been possible to demonstrate the presence
of one of these, helium, in the sun, before it was known that it also
entered into the composition of our globe. The conclusions drawn by
D. Mendelejeff from the law of periodicity also led to the discovery of
several elements whose existence was theoretically indicated before the
chemist had isolated them.

I will again recur to the results obtained by Mendelejeff, but I will
now mention scandium discovered in 1879 by Nilson in euxonite, gado-
linite, and yttrotitanite. This metal, of whose oxide only a few grams
exist, and which, perhaps, no one except its discoverer has ever had in
his hands, has a considerable scientific importance, because its atomic
weight of 44, determined by Nilson, is precisely that indicated by
Mendelejeff for ekabor, an element whose existence had been foretold
by the law of periodicity.

As early as 1794 Gadolin had separated from the gadolinite of
Ytterby an earth which he called ytter earth, and which later was
recognized as formed of erbine, terbine, and of ytter properly so called.
These earths were again found in a great number of rare minerals, but
the oxides derived from these minerals appeared to be different in
nature and behavior, seeming rather to be mixtures very difficult to
break up into their constituent parts, their various elements giving no
very characteristic reactions. It was necessary to have recourse to
spectrum analysis and to the determination of their atomic weights,
trying to isolate them by repeated fractionation, either by the action
of the sulphates of potash or ammonium or by the partial decomposition
of the nitrates under the action of heat. We will not enter here into
the details of these operations which are special researches in the strict
sense of the word, and whose results are not yet clearly established as
to certain points. The major part of the work has, however, been
accomplished in the last quarter century; and not only has it given us
more precise ideas concerning scandium and yttrium, but it has also
revealed the existence of numerous other rare elements whose decom-
position does not appear impossible, among which we will cite: Erbium,
holmium,? thulium,*? dysprosium,! terbium,’? gadolinum,® samarium,’
decipium,® ytterbium.® Lucium,’? recently announced by P. Barriere,
has been since contested.

240 THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ELEMENTS.

Cerium, lanthanum, and didymium have recently been the objects of
attentive researches having in view a practical end—the construction
of mantles used in incandescent gaslights. It had been for some time
suspected that didymium was not a simple body, but it was Carl Auer
von Welsbach,' the inventor of this method of illumination, who has
the honor of having succeeded, in 1885, in separating didymium into
its two elements, praseodymium and neodymium. By the use of mona-
zite, as was Shown at the Chicago Exposition in 1893, a greater quantity
of the salts of these remarkable metals was prepared and the practical
application of them assured.

The existence of metacerium announced by M. Brauner’ does not
appear as yet absolutely established, neither does that of russium®
which M. Chruschtschow found associated with thorium in certain
zirconiums and in monazite, and whose atomic weight is said to be 220.
The jargonium of Sorby,‘ the austrium of Linnemann,’ as well as the
norvegium of Dahll,° the actinium of Phipson,’ the idumium of Websky,?
the masrium of Richmond and Off,? and an unknown element which
M. K. J. Bayer thought he had found in French bauxite have vanished
into the void.

We will also mention, as curiosities, kosmium and neokosmium, that
take their names, not from the kosmos but from Kosmanu," who, on
the 16th of November, 1896, took out a patent for the preparation of
their oxides. If it were not for the expense of the patent, it might
have been thought a pleasantry, like that perpetrated a few years ago
by the Chemiker Zeitung,'' that told its readers over the signature of
M. Fried. Much, the marvellous history of the discovery of damarium.

The world of chemical processes is like the stage of a theatre on
which are exhibited the details of the action of the play, but in this
world the characters are represented by elements, each of which plays
its part, whether it be a silent or a speaking one. Among the latter
may be classed two elements discovered during the last twenty-five
years—gallium and germanium.

Gallium was discovered on the 27th of August, 1875, by Lecoq de
Boisbaudran,’” in the blende of Pierrefitte, by means of two quite well-
marked lines that appeared in the violet portion of that spectrum of
that blende, which, however, as was afterwards shown, contains but a

very small proportion of the new metal. This proportion is not, in fact,
more than a ten-thousandth per cent, while the richer blende of Bern-
bryer contains a thousandth. The preparation of any considerable
quantities of gallium was naturally attended with great difficulties
because there was no ore known from which it could be obtained, and
yet the study of the new mineral is of the greatest interest because of
the theoretical speculations of Mendelejeff, already mentioned. Scan-
dium and germanium had not yet been discovered, so that nothing
could either justify or confirm the conclusions derived from the law of
periodicity. As early as 1869, in a communication presented to the
Russian Society of Chemistry at St. Petersburg, ‘‘on the correlations
existing between the properties of elements and their atomic weight,”
Mendelejeff! had, in fact, affirmed the existence of simple bodies not
yet discovered, whose atomic weight, ought, for example, to be between
65and 75. He had even gone further yet, by studying and describing in
all their details the properties of three hypothetical elements,” ekabor,
eka-aluminum, and ekasilicon. It will be seen, then, what interest
attached to the question of ascertaining whether the properties of
gallium agreed with the previsions of the Russian chemist.

At first it seemed that no agreement existed, at least the determina-
tion made on the small quantities of gallium that could be obtained
gave for its specific gravity the unexpected value of 4.7. But as several
of the properties of the new metal, such as precipitation from its solu-
tions by carbonate of baryta, its tendeacy to form basic salts and its
capacity for furnishing alums, denoted a very close relationship with
aluminum, Mendelejeff did not hesitate, in the Mémoires de l’ Academie
des Sciences of France, to declare that the element in question seemed
to correspond to that whose existence he had foretold in 1871 as analo-
gous to aluminum, and which he had provisionally designated under
the name of eka-aluminum. And, in fact, new determinations made

with more considerable quantities of gallium, obtained by the electro-
lytic process, showed that its specific gravity was 59, a value exactly
corresponding to that calculated by Mendelejeff for the hypothetical
eka-aluminum. The same agreement was later shown for its specific
heat (0.08) as well as for its specifie gravity, so that the exactitude of
the previsions of Mendelejeff were confirmed. It was thus well estab-
lished that it is possible to deduce from the properties of known ele-
ments those of elements yet unknown, but whose existence may be
predicted.

Mendelejeff did not hope for such a rapid confirmation of his pre-
visions, but his triumph was still more complete, for to gallium there
was soon added scandium (ekabor), discovered by M. L. I’. Nilson in
1879, and germanium (ekasilicon) by myself in 1886.°

QA2 THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ELEMENTS.

The discovery of germanium, predicted under the name of ekasilicon
by Mendelejeft, recalls the discovery, by Galle, of the planet Neptune,
whose existence had been shown by the calculations of Adams and
Leverrier. This discovery was not due to the concurrence of favorable
circumstances or to a happy accident; it resulted from researches
undertaken because of theoretical previsions, and the agreement be-
tween the predicted and real properties was such that Mendelejeff con-
siders the discovery of germanium the principal justification of the law
of periodicity.'!

On one point only has germanium completely deceived expectations;
that is, with regard to its formations in nature. It might have been
expected that it would rather have been found as an oxide in the rare
minerals of the North, in company with titanium and zirconium, than
as a sulphide in company with analogous combinations of arsenic and
antimony in the vein rock of argentiferous minerals. This cireum-
stance, together with the comparative rarity of its mineral, argyrodite,
has contributed not a little to retard the elucidation of its true char-
acter; I am myself inclined to consider it as eka-antimony, while
Mendelejeft, after my first incomplete communications to him, sup-
posed it to be ekacadmium. At about the same time M. von Richter
expressed his conviction that germanium could be nothing else than
the long-expected ekasilicon; an opinion which he justified by the
agreement of their atomic weights.

Although gallium and germanium keep peace with each other, show-
ing that science is above all national quarrels and political agitations,
the denomination of germanium which I have given to the new element
has aroused some criticism,” and it has been said that I ought to
renounce that name, which has too marked a territorial flavor. I need
not say that this demand seems to me quite unjustifiable, for I have
only followed the example given by the denominations gallium and
scandium, concerning which the same criticism could be made.

The success of the bold speculations of Mendelejeff allows us to affirm
that the elaboration of the periodic system is a great forward step for
science. In the course of only fifteen years all the predictions of the
Russian chemist have been confirmed, new elements have been placed
in the gaps which he left in his table, and there is reason to hope that
it will be the same for those which still remain in the natural system.

Still, the last two elements discovered—argon and helium—seem to

have no relation with the periodic system. After Lord Rayleigh,? in -

1892, had proved that nitrogen obtained from chemical combinations
was about one-half per cent lighter than that obtained from the atmos-
phere, a determination that was again verified in 1894, Lord Rayleigh

and Professor Ramsay! separated from atmospheric nitrogen an elemen-
tary gas of great density which, by reason of its chemical indifference,
they called argon. They proved that this gas formed about 0.8 or C.9 per
cent of the volume of nitrogen, from which it could be separated either
by incandescent magnesium or by the continued action of the electric
spark. Itwas established beyond doubt that Cavendish produced this
gas a hundred years ago by the use of the electric spark.” Argon, either
alone or accompanied by helium, has also been found in natural waters
as well asin minerals. Its discovery in a meteorite of Augusta County,
Virginia, United States of America, may perhaps lead us to ascribe to
it an extraterrestrial origin.

The physical properties of argon are very distinct, and its charac-

teristic spectrum enables us to at once distinguish it with certainty
from any other substance, but from a chemical point of view this gas
is most cxtraordinarily inactive, and we have not yet succeeded in
making it form combinations as the other elements do. This pecul-
jarity, and also the impossibility of finding a place in the periodic
system for a simple body having the molecular weight of argon (39.88),
have given rise to all sorts of hypotheses relative to the nature of this
gas. Should it be considered as a monatomic element having an atomic
weight of 37 and a place in the system between chlorine and potassium,
or a diatomic one with an atomic weight of 20, which would place it
alter fluorine and before sodium? May it not be an allotropic form of
nitrogen, N;, having a molecular weight of 42, or a triatomic element
whose atomie weight would not exceed 13? The question has not as
yet been answered.
_ Another most interesting discovery was that of helium, made by
Professor Ramsay.’ In 1891 Hillebrand showed that uranium ore and
ores of the same family when dissolved in acids or fused with alkaline
carbonates, or even merely heated in a vacuum, may give off as much as
3 per cent of nitrogen. Professor Ramsay‘ obtained this gas from cleve-
ite and by means of spectroscopic examination demonstrated the pres-
ence of argon; and in the course of his experiments—in March, 1895—
he observed beside the spectrum of argon another bright, yellow line
that did not belong to that spectrum, and which Crookes?’ recognized
as identical with the line D* that Lockyer® had already observed in
1868 in the spectrum of the solar chromosphere, and which he had
attributed to an element as yet unknown upon the earth—helium. The
same line had also been distinguished in the spectra of other fixed
stars, particularly in the spectrum of Orion, so that it may be admitted
that helium exists in large quantities extraterrestrially.

244 THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ELEMENTS.

On our planet it appears, on the contrary, to be very rare, and may
be ranked among the rarest of elements. Still, it had been nearly dis-
covered several times; in 1882 Palmieri! actually observed the line of
helium in the’ ourse ef his researches upon the lava of Vesuvius, but
he pursued the matter no further; it was the same with Hillebrand,?
who, in 1891, obtained, in the spectrum of the gas obtained from uran-
ite, lines which were probably those of helium,

Since then helium has been found in a great number of ores, gener-
ally associated with uranium, yttrium, and thorium; in mineral waters,
and in very small quantities in atmospheric air. Helium is the lightest
of all the gases except hydrogen; Stoney’ deduces from this fact an
explanation of the existence of these two elements in but very small
quantities in a free state upon the face of the earth, while they are dis-
tributed in enormous masses throughout the universe. The compara-
tively small force of the earth’s gravitation does not form a sufficient
counterpoise to the velocity of their molecules, which therefore escape
from the terrestrial atmosphere unless restrained by chemical combi-
nation. They then proceed to reunite around great centers of attrac-
tion, such as the fixed stars, in whose atmospheres these elements exist
in large quantities.

The study of the spectrum of helium is of the greatest importance,
because it gives us information concerning the nature of distant celes-
tial bodies. It also, as is Shown by the researches of Itunge and
Paschen,‘ suggests doubts as to the clementary character of the new
body. However that may be,if we admit that helium is composed of
two gases (Mr. Lockyer has already proposed the name of asterium for
the second), one of these gases ought to have a boiling point nearly as
low as the absolute zero, and in any case below 264° C., for the master
in liquefaction of gases, Mons. K. Olszewsky,” has not, so far, sueceeded
in producing a change of state in helium; so that he proposes to use
this gas for filling gas thermometers to be used for measuring very low
temperatures.

Up to the present time helium has shown itself as refractory as argon
to chemical combination, and there is such an uncertainty as to the
position to which it ought to be assigned that I will not discuss the
hypotheses that have been put forward with regard to it.

It is not impossible that the discovery of these two new elements,
argon and helium, may give rise to a remodeling if not a transforma-
tion of the periodic system; a remodeling which will cause the disap-
pearance of some uncertainties, or even contradictions, which now exist.
Thus, for example, the atomic weight of tellurium, recently determined ©

by Bb. Brauner! and Ludwig Staudenmaier,’ does not fit at all into the
periodic system; on the other hand the existence in this substance of
a foreign element, such as austriacum, suggested by B. Brauner, does
not appear to be established. As to the much agitated question of
whether and to what extent the atomic weight of cobalt differs from
that of nickel, I believe that 1 have answered it in a satisfactory man-
ner and destroyed the hypothesis‘ of Gerhard Kriiss and F. W. Schmid >
with regard to the existence in one of these substances of a third ele-
ment which had received the name of gnomium.

The rapid review that we have just made of the discovery of new
elements during the last twenty-five years shows that new researches
in this line have been pursued with great aetivity and have led to results
of considerable value. And yet the speculations to which these
researches have given rise may be considered as quite uncertain as
regards the question of the possibility of the ultimate decomposition of
those bodies that now appear to be simple; and per contra as regards
the progressive development of a primitive substance and the new for-
mation of the numerous elements that are now recognized. I will only
recall in this connection the hypothesis of Mr. Lockyer‘® as to the dis-
sociation of the elements in the interior of the atmosphere of the
sun. Hypotheses of this sort will remain such as long as no one
has succeeded in decomposing a body hitherte regarded as undoubt-
edly simple, or in transforming any element whatever into another.
And yet they should not be considered as entirely inadmissible; a day
may come when some unexpected event may open to science new ways
of investigation. Four hundred years ago Nicholas Copernicus left, as
a young master of philosophy and of medicine, the old university of
Ulica St. Anny, at Cracow, to go to Bologna and to Rome for the pur-
pose of consecrating his talents as a mathematician to the study of
astronomical sciences. There, attacking the enigma of the firmament,
he finally attained the certainty that the earth was not, as had been
hitherto believed, a central fixed world, but a sphere suspended freely
in space, a planet similar to the other planets, turning around the sun
and having a movement of rotation around its own axis under the action
of gravitation. It was, indeed, a true revolution in the theories that
had been hitherto held, this theory that fixed the sun in the firmament
in spite of its daily ascent and disappearance; an idea that, at the
present day, has become familiar to us. And further, we now know
that neither is the sun itself fixed, but that it is drawn with all its’
cortege of planets along a course without end, across space without

limit. Whence comes it and whither goes it? Properly speaking, we
know nothing about it, and doubtless we will never know either its
origin or its end; but as the earth turns around this movable sun, it

hence results that our planet does not describe a closed path, but a_

sort of spiral, and that it never returns to a spot that it has once
quitted. Each second takes our planet to a new point in the universe,
and from this incessant displacement it ought to follow that no phenom-
enon or event can ever reproduce exactly any anterior phenomenon
or event. ‘Clouds may resemble each other, as one sunrise resembles
another, but there is never an absolute coincidence, and it would seem
that these variations ought to be perpetuated throughout the course of
time that is embraced by the history of humanity.

It would be useless to push further these considerations, they are
merely speculations; but they lead to this thought, which, although
unsupported, continually recurs to our mind—the possibility of a pro-
gressive transformation of matter in a given direction, in that they
show that everything that is with us is drawn along in a dizzy course
across an unknown immensity.
AN UNDISCOVERED GAS.!

By Prof. Witu1AmM Ramsay, Ph. D., LL. D., Se. D., F. B.S.

A sectional address to members of the British association falls under
one of three heads. It may be historical, or actual, or prophetic; it
may refer to the past, the present, or the future. In many cases,
indeed in all, this classification overlaps. Your former presidents have
given sometimes an historical introduction, followed by an account of
the actual state of some branch of our science, and, though rarely, con-
eluding with prophetic remarks. To those who have an affection for
the past the historical side appeals forcibly; to the practical than, and
to the investigator engaged in research, the actual, perhaps, presents
more charm; while to the general public, to whom novelty is often more
of an attraction than truth, the prophetic aspect excites most interest.
In this address I must endeavor to tickle all palates; and perhaps lL
may be excused if I take this opportunity of indulging in the dangerous
luxury of prophecy, a luxury which the managers of scientific journals
do not often permit their readers to taste.

The subject of my remarks to-day is a new gas. I shall describe to
you later its curious properties; but it would be unfair not to put you
at once in possession of the knowledge of its most remarkable prop-
erty—it has not yet been discovered. As it is still unborn, it has not
yet been named. The naming of a new element is no easy matter,
for there are only twenty-six letters in our alphabet, and there are
already over seventy elements. ‘T’o select a name expressible by a
symbol which has not already been claimed for one of the known ele-
ments is difficult, and the difficulty is enhanced when it is at the same
time required to select a name which shall be descriptive of the prop-
erties (or want of properties) of the element.

It is now my task to bring before you the evidence for the existence
of this undiscovered element.

It was noticed by Dobereiner, as long ago as 1817, that certain ele-
ments could be arranged in groups of three. The choice of the elements
selected to form these triads was made on account of their analogous

properties and on the sequence of their atomic weights, which had at
that time only recently been discovered. Thus calcium, strontium,
and barium formed such a group; their oxides, lime, strontia, and
baryta are all easily slaked, combining with water to form soluble
lime-water, strontia-water, and baryta-water. Their sulphates are all
sparingly soluble, and resemblance had been noticed between their
respective chlorides and between their nitrates. Regularity was also
displayed by their atomic weights. The numbers then accepted were 20,
49.5, and 65; and the atomic weight of strontium, 42.5, is the arith-
metical mean of those of the other two elements, for (65 + 20) /2 = 42.5.
The existence of other similar groups of three was pointed out by
Débereiner, and such groups became known as “ Dobereiner’s triads.” ~

Another method of classifying the elements, also depending on their
atomic weights, was suggested by Pettenkofer, and afterward elaborated
by Kremers, Gladstone, and Cooke. It consisted in seeking for some
expression which would represent the differences between the atomic
weights of certain allied elements. Thus, the difference between the
atomic weight of lithium, 7, and sodium, 23, is 16; and between that of
sodium and of potassium, 39, is also 16. The regularity is not always
so conspicuous. Dumas, in 1857, contrived a somewhat complicated
expression which, to some extent, exhibited regularity in the atomic
weights of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, and also of nitrogen,
phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.

The upshot of these efforts to discover regularity was that, in 1864,
Mr. John Newlands, having arranged the elements in eight groups,
found that when placed in the order of their atomic weights, ‘the
eighth element, starting from a given one, is a kind of repetition of the
first, like the eighth note of an octave in music.” To this regularity
he gave the name “The Law of Octaves.”

The development of this idea, as all chemists know, was due to the
late Prof. Lothar Meyer, of Tiibingen, and to Professor Mendeléeff, of
St. Petersburg. It is generally known as the “ Periodic Law.” One
of the simplest methods of showing this arrangement is by means of a
cylinder divided into eight segments by lines drawn parallel to its axis;
a spiral line is then traced round the cylinder, which will, of course, be
cut by these lines eight times at each revolution. Holding the cylinder
vertically, the name and atomic weight of an element is written at each
intersection of the spiral with a vertical line, following the numerical
order of the atomic weights. It will be found, according to Lothar
Meyer and Mendel¢eff, that the elements grouped down each of the
vertical lines form a natural class. They possess similar properties,
form similar compounds, and exhibit a graded relationship between
their densities, melting points, and many of their other properties.
One of these vertical columns, however, differs from the others, inasmuch
as on it there are three groups, each consisting of three elements with
approximately equal atomic weights. The elements in question are
AN UNDISCOVERED GAS. 249

iron, cobalt, and nickel; palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium; and
platinum, iridium, and osmium. There is apparently room for a fourth
group of three elements in this column, and it may bea fifth. And
the discovery of such a group is not unlikely, for when this table was
first drawn up Professor Mendeléeff drew attention to certain gaps,
which have since been filled up by the discovery of gallium, germanium,
and others. ie

The discovery of argon at once raised the curiosity of Lord Rayleigh
and myself as to its position in this table. With a density of nearly 20,
if a diatomic gas, like oxygen and nitrogen, it would follow fluorine in
the periodic table; and our first idea was that argon was probably a
mixture of three gases, all of which possessed nearly the same atomic
weights, like iron, cobalt, and nickel. Indeed, their names were sug-
gested, on this supposition, with patriotic bias, as Anglium, Scotium,
and Hibernium! But when the ratio of its specific heats had, at !east
in our opinion, unmistakably shown that it was molecularly mona-
tomic, and not diatomic, as at first conjectured, it was necessary to
believe that its atomic weight was 40, and not 20, and that it followed
chiorine in the atomic table, and not tluorine. But here arises a diffi-
culty. The atomic weight of chlorine is 35.5, and that of potassium,
the next element in order in the table, is 39.1; and that of argon, 40,
follows, and does not precede, that of potassium, as it might be expected
todo. It still remains possible that argon, instead of consisting wholly
of monatomic molecules, may contain a small percentage of diatomic
molecules, but the evidence in favor of this supposition is, in my opin-
ion, tar from strong. Another possibility is that argon, as at first
conjectured, may consist of a mixture of more than one element; but,
unless the atomic weight of one of the elements in the supposed mixture
is very high, say 82, the case is not bettered, for one of the elements in the
supposed trio would still have a higher atomic weight than potassium.
And very careful experiments, carried out by Dr. Norman Collie and
myself on the fractional diffusion of argon, have disproved the existence
of any such element with high atomic weight in argon, and, indeed,
have practically demonstrated that argon is a simple substance and
not a mixture.

The discovery of helium has thrown a new light on this subject.
Helium, it will be remembered, is evolved on heating certain minerals,
notably those containing uranium; although it appears to be contained
in others in which uranium is not present, except in traces. Among
those minerals are cléveite, monazite, fergusonite, and a host of similar
complex mixtnrres, all containing rare elements, such as niobium, tan-
talum, yttrium, cerium, etc. The spectrum of helium is characterized
by a remarkably brilliant yellow line, which had been observed as long
ago as 1868 by Professors Frankland and Lockyer in the spectrum of
the sun’s chromosphere, and named “helium” at that early date.

The density of helium proved to be very close to 2, and, like argon,
250 AN UNDISCOVERED GAS.

the ratio of its specific heat showed that it, too, was a monatomic gas.
Its atomic weight, therefore, is identical with its molecular weight, viz,
4, and its place in the periodic table is between hydrogen and lithium,
the atomic weight of which is 7.

The difference between the atomic weights of helium and argon is
thus 36, or 40—4. Now there are several cases of such a difference.
For instance, in the group the first member of which is fluorine we

This is approximately the difference between the atomic weights of
helium and argon, 36.

There should, therefore, be an undiscovered element between helium
and argon with an atomic weight 16 units higher than that of helium
and 20 units lower than that of argon, namely 20. And if this
unknown element, like helium and argon, should prove to consist of
monatomic molecules, then its density should be half its atomic weight,
10. And pushing the analogy still further, it is to be expected that
this element should be as indifferent to union with other elements as
the two allied elements.

My assistant, Mr. Morris Travers, has indefatigably aided me in a
search for this unknown gas. There is a proverb about looking for
a needle in a haystack; modern science, with the aid of suitable mag-
netic appliances, would, if the reward was sufficient, make short work
of that proverbial needle. But here is a supposed unknown gas,
endowed no doubt with negative properties, and the whole world to
find itin. Still the attempt had to be made.
AN UNDISCOVERED GAS. 251

We first directed our attention to the sources of helium—minerals.
Almost every mineral which we could obtain was heated in a vacuum,
and the gas which was evolved examined. The results are interesting.
Most minerals give off gas when heated, and the gas contains, as arule,
a considerable amount of hydrogen, mixed with carbonic acid, question-
able traces of nitrogen, and carbonic oxide. Many of the minerals, in
addition, gave helium, which proved to be widely distributed, though
only in minute proportion. One mineral—malacone—gave appreciable
quantities of argon, and it is noteworthy that argon was not found
except in it (and, curiously, in much larger amount than helium) and
in a specimen of meteoric iron. Other specimens of meteoric iron were
_ examined, but were found to contain mainly hydrogen, with no trace of
either argon or helium. It is probable that the sources of meteorites
might be traced in this manner, and that each could be relegated to its
particular swarm.

Among the minerals examined was one to which our attention had
been directed by Professor Lockyer, named eliasite, from which he said
that he had extracted a gas in which he had observed spectrum lines
foreign to helium. He was kind enough to furnish us with a specimen
of this mineral, which is exceedingly rare, but the sample which we
tested contained nothing but undoubted helium.

During a trip to Iceland, in 1895, I collected some gas from the boiling
springs there; it consisted, for the most part, of air, but contained some-
what more argon than is usually dissolved when air is shaken with
water. In the spring of 1896 Mr. Travers and ! made a trip to the
Pyrenees to collect gas from the mineral springs of Cauterets, to which
our attention had been directed by Dr. Bouchard, who pointed out that
these gases are rich in helium. Weexamined a number of samples from
the various springs, and confirmed Dr. Bouchard’s results, but there
was no sign of any unknown lines in the spectrum of these gases. Our
quest was in vain.

We wust now turn to another aspect of the subject. Shortly after
the discovery of helium its spectrum was very carefully examined by
Professors Runge and Paschen, the renowned spectroscopists. The
spectrum was photographed, special attention being paid to the invisible
portions, termed the “ultraviolet” and ‘‘infrared.” The lines thus
registered were found to have an harmonic relation to each other. They
admitted of division into two sets, each complete in itself. Now, a
similar process had been applied to the spectrum of lithium and to that
of sodium, and the spectra of these elements gave only one series each.
Hence, Professors Runge and Paschen concluded that the gas, to which
the provisional name of helium had been given, was, in reality, a mix-
ture of two gases, closely resembling each other in properties. As we
know no other elements with atomic weights between those of hydrogen
and lithium, there is no chemical evidence either for or against this
supposition. Professor Runge supposed that he had obtained evidence
252 AN UNDISCOVERED GAS.

of the separation of these imagined elements from each other by means
of diffusion; but Mr. Travers and I pointed out that the same alteration
of spectrum, which was apparently produced by diffusion, could also be
caused by altering the pressure of the gas in the vacuum tube, and
shortly after Professor Runge acknowledged his mistake.

These considerations, however, made it desirable to subject helium to
systematic diffusion in the same way as argon had been tried. The
experiments were carried out in the summer of 1896 by Dr. Collie and
myself. Theresult was encouraging. It was found possible to separate
helium into two portions of different rates of diffusion and consequently
of different density by this means. The limits of separation, however,
were not very great. On the one hand, we obtained gas of a density
close on 2; and on the other, a sample of density 2.4 or thereabouts.
The difficulty was increased by the curious behavior, which we have
often had occasion to confirm, that helium possesses arate of diffusion
too rapid for its density. Thus, the density of the lightest portion of
the diffused gas, calculated from its rate of diffusion, was 1.874; but this
corresponds to a real density of about 2. After our paper, giving an
account of these experiments, had been published, a German investi-
gator, Herr A. Hagenbach, repeated our work and confirmed our results.

The two samples of gas of different density differ also in other
properties. Different transparent substances differ in the rate at which
they allow light to pass through them. Thus light travels through
water at a much slower rate than through air, and at a slower rate
through air than through hydrogen. Now, Lord Rayleigh found that
helium offers less opposition to the passage of light than any other sub-
stance does, and the heavier of the two portions into which helium had
been split offered more opposition than the lighter portion. And the
retardation of the light, unlike what has usually been observed, was
nearly proportional to the densities of the samples. The spectrum of
these two samples did not differ in the minutest particular. Therefore
it did not appear quite out of the question to hazard the speculation
that the process of diffusion was instrumental not necessarily in sep-
arating two kinds of gas from each other, but actually in removing
light molecules of the same kind from heavy molecules. This idea is
not new. It had been advanced by Professor Schtitzenberger (whose
recent death all chemists have to deplore) and later by Mr. Crookes that
what we term the atomic weight of an element is a mean; that when
we say that the atomic weight of oxygen is 16 we merely state that the
average atomic weight is 16; and it is not inconceivable that a certain
number of molecules have a weight somewhat higher than 32, while a
certain number have a lower weight.

We therefore thought it necessary to test this question by direct
experiment with some known gas, and we chose nitrogen as a good
material with which to test the point. A much larger and more con-
venient apparatus for difftsing gases was built by Mr. Travers and

a
AN UNDISCOVERED GAS. SPA

myself, and a set of systematic diffusions of nitrogen was carried out.
After 50 rounds, corresponding to 180 diffusions, the density of the
nitrogen was unaltered, and that of the portion which should have
diffused most slowly had there been any difference in rate was identical
with that of the most quickly diffusing portion; i.e., with that of the
portion which passed first through the porous plug. This attempt,
therefore, was unsuccessful, but it was worth carrying out, for it is now
certain that it is not possible to separate a gas of undoubted chemical
unity into portions of different density by diffusion; and these experi-
ments rendered it exceedingly improbable that the difference in density
of the two fractions of helium was due to separation of light molecules
of helium from heavy molecules.

The apparatus used for diffusion had a capacity of about 2 liters. It
was filled with helium, and the operation of diffusion was carried
through 30 times. There were 6 reservoirs, each full of gas, and each
was separated into two by diffusion. To the heavier portion of one lot
the lighter portion of the next was added, and in this manner all 6 reser-
voirs were successively passed through the diffusion apparatus. This
process was carried out 30 times, each of the 6 reservoirs having had
its gas diffused each time, thus involving 180 diffusions. After this
process the density of the more quickly diffusing gas was reduced to
2.02, while that of the less quickly diffusing had increased to 2.27.
The light portion, on rediffusion, hardly altered in density, while the
heavier portion, when divided into three portions by diffusion, showed
a considerable difference in density between the first third and the last

third. A similar set of operations was carried out with a fresh quan-
tity of helium, in order to accumulate enough gas to obtain a sufficient
quantity for a second series of diffusions. The more quickly diffusing
portions of both gases were mixed and rediffused. The density of the
lightest portion of these gases was 1.98, and after other 15 diffusions
the density of the lightest portion had not decreased. The end had
been reached; it was not possible to obtain a lighter portion by diffu-
sion. The density of the main body of this gas is therefore 1.98, and
its refractivity, air being taken as unity, is 0.1245. The spectrum of
this portion does not differ in any respect from the usual spectrum
of helium.

As rediffusion does not alter the density or the refractivity of this
gas, it is right to suppose that either one definite element has now
been isolated, or that if there are more elements than one present they
possess the same or very nearly the same density and refractivity.
There may be a group of elements, say three, like iron, cobalt, and
nickel; but there is no proof that this idea is correct, and the simplicity
of the spectrum would be an argument against such a supposition.
This substance, forming by far the larger part of the whole amount of
gas, must, in the present state of our knowledge, be regarded as pure
helium.
254 AN UNDISCOVERED GAS.

On the other hand, the heavier residue is easily altered in density
by rediffusion, and this would imply that it consists of a small quan-
tity of a heavy gas mixed with a large quantity of the light gas.
Repeated rediffusion convinced us that there was only a very small
amount of the heavy gas present in the mixture. The portion which
coutained the largest amount of heavy gas was found to have the density
2.275, and its refractive index was found to be 0.1333. On rediffusing
this portion of gas until only a trace sufficient to fill a Pliicker’s tube
was left, and then examining the spectrum, no unknown lines could be
detected; but on interposing a jar and spark gap the well-known blue
lines of argon became visible, and even without the jar the red lines of
argon and the two green groups were distinctly visible. The amount
of argon present, calculated from the density, was 1.64 per cent, and
from the refractivity 1.14 per cent. The conclusion had therefore to
be drawn that the heavy constituent of helium, as it comes off the
minerals containing it, is nothing new, but, so far as can be made out,
merely a small amount of argon.

If, then, there is a new gas in what is generally termed helium, it is
mixed with argon, and it must be present in extremely minute traces.
As neither helium nor argon has been induced to form compounds,
there does not appear to be any method other than diffusion for isolat-
ing such a gas if it exists, and that method has failed in our hands to
give any evidence of the existence of such a gas. It by no means fol-
lows that the gas does not exist; the only conclusion to be drawn is
that we have not yet stumbled on the material which contains it. In
fact, the haystack is too large and the needle too inconspicuous. Refer-
ence to the periodic table will show that between the elements alumi-
num and indium there appears gallium—a substance occurring only in
the minutest amount on the earth’s surface; and following silicon and
preceding tin appears the element germanium—a body which has as
yet been recognized only in one of the rarest of minerals, argyrodite.
Now, the amount of helium in fergusonite, one of the minerals which
yields it in reasonabie quantity, is only 33 parts by weight in 100,000
of the mineral, and it is not improbable that some other mineral may
contain the new gas in even more minute proportion. If, however, it
is accompanied in its still undiscovered source by argon and helium, it
will be a work of extreme difficulty to effect a separation from these
gases.

In these remarks it has been assumed that the new gas will resem-
ble argon and helium in being indifferent to the action of reagents and
in not forming compounds. This supposition is worth examining. In
considering it the analogy with other elements is all that we have to
guide us.

We have already paid some attention to several triads of elements.
We have seen that the differences in atomic weights between the
elements fluorine and manganese, oxygen and chromium, nitrogen and
AN UNDISCOVERED GAS. 255

vanadium, carbon and titanium are in each approximately the same as
that between helium and argon, viz, 36. If elements farther back in
the periodic table be examined, it is to be noticed that the differences
grow less the smaller the atomic weights. Thus, between boron and
scandium the difference is 33; between beryllium (glucinum) and eal-
cium, 31; and between lithium and potassium, 32. At the same time we
may remark that the elements grow more like each other the lower the
atomic weights. Now, helium and argon are very like each other in
physical properties. It may be fairly concluded, I think, that in so far
_ they justify their position. Moreover, the pair of elements which show
the smallest difference between their atomic weights is beryllium and
calcium. There is a somewhat greater difference between lithium and
potassium. And itis in accordance with this fragment of regularity
that helium and argon show a greater difference. Then again, sodium,
the middle element of the lithium triad, is very similar in properties
both to lithium and potassium; and we might, therefore, expect that
the unknown element of the helium series should closely resemble both
helium and argon.

Leaving now the consideration of the new element, let us turn our
attention to the more general question of the atomic weight of argon
and its anomalous position in the periodic scheme of the elements.
The apparent difficulty is this: The atomic weight of argon is 40; it
has no power to form compounds, and thus possesses no valency;
it must follow chlorine in the periodic table and piecede potassium,
but its atomic weight is greater than that of potassium, whereas it is
generally contended that the elements should follow each other in the
order of their atomic weights. If this contention is correct, argon
should have an atomic weight smaller than 40.

Let us examine this connection. ‘Taking the first row of elements,
we have:

ieee — 9S) — lO) — 1220) il () = Gen 120:
The differences are:
2.8, 1.2, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0.

It is obvious that they are irregular. The next row shows similar
irregularities. Thus:
(?= 20), Na= 23, Mg = 24:3, Al= 27, Si=28, P=31, S=32, Cl=35.5,

A= 40.
And the differences:
3.0, 1.3, 2.7, 1.0, 3.0, 1.0, 3.5, 4.5.

The same irregularity might be illustrated by a consideration of each
succeeding row. Between argon and the next in order, potassium,
there is a difference of — 0.9; that is to say, argon has a higher atomic
weight than potassium by 0.9 unit; whereas it might be expected to
256 “-AN UNDISCOVERED GAS.

have a lower one, seeing that potassium follows argon in the table. —
Farther on in the table there is a similar discrepancy. The row is as
follows:

Ag =108, Cd =112, In=114, Sn=119, Sb =120.5, Ve— 12777, 1127,
The differences are:
4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 1.5, 7.2, —0.7.

Here, again, there is a negative difference between tellurium and
iodine. And this apparent discrepancy has led to many and careful
redeterminations of the atomic weight of tellurium. Professor Brauner,
indeed, has submitted tellurium to methodical fractionation, with no
positive results. All the recent determinations of its atomic weight
give practically the same number, 127.7.

Again, there have been almost innumerable attempts to reduce the
differences between the atomic weights to regularity by contriving
some formula which will express the numbers which represent the
atomic weights with all their irregularities. Needless to say, such
attempts have in no case been successful. Apparent success is always
attained at the expense of accuracy, and the numbers reproduced are
not those accepted as the true atomic weights. Such attempts, in my
opinion, are futile. Still, the human mind does not rest contented in
merely chronicling such an irregularity; it strives to understand why
such an irregularity should exist. And, in connection with this, there
are two matters which call for our consideration. These are: Does
some circumstance modify these ‘‘combining proportions” which we
term “atomic weights?” And is there any reason to suppose that we
can modify them at our will? Are they true ‘constants of nature,”
unchangeable, and once for all determined? Or are they constant
merely so long as other circumstances, a change in which would modify
them ,remain unchanged?

In order to understand the real scope of such questions, it is neces-
sary to consider the relation of the “atomic weights” to other magni-
tudes, and especially to the important quantity termed “energy.”

It is known that energy manifests itself under different forms, and
that one form of energy is quantitatively convertible into another for,
without loss. It is also known that each form of energy is expressible
as the product of two factors, one of which has been termed the “inten-
sity factor” and the other the “capacity factor.” Professor Ostwald,
in the last edition of his Allgemeine Chemie, classifies some of these
forms of energy.as follows:

Kinetic energy is the product of mass into the square of velocity.

Linear energy is the product of length into force.

Surface energy is the product of surface into surface tension.

Volume energy is the product of volume into pressure.

Heat energy is the product of heat capacity (entropy) into temper-
ature.
AN UNDISCOVERED GAS. Dim

Electrical energy is the product of electric capacity into potential.

Chemical energy is the product of “atomic weight” into affinity.

In each statement of factors the “capacity factor” is placed first
and the “intensity factor” second.

In considering the “capacity factors” it is noticeable that they may
be divided into two classes. The two first kinds of energy, kinetic and
linear, are independent of the nature of the material which is subject
to the energy. A mass of lead offers as much resistance to a given.
force, or, in other words, possesses as great inertia as an equal mass of
hydrogen. A mass of iridium, the densest solid, counterbalances an
equal mass of lithinm, the lightest known solid. On the other hand,
surface energy deals with molecules, and not with masses. So does
volume energy. The volume energy of 2 grams of hydrogen, con-
tained in a vessel of 1 liter capacity, is equal to that of 32 grams of
oxygen at the same temperature and contained in a vessel of equal
size. Equal masses of tin and lead have not equal capacity for heat;
but 119 grams of tin has the same capacity as 207 grams of lead; that
is, equal atomic masses have the same heat capacity. The quantity of
electricity conveyed through an electrolyte under equal difference of
potential is proportional, not to the mass of the dissolved body, but to
its equivalent; that is, to some simple fraction of its atomic weight.
And the capacity factor of chemical energy is the atomic weight otf
the substance subjected to the energy. We see, therefore, that while
mass or inertia are important adjuncts of kinetic and linear energies,
all other kinds of energy are connected with atomic weights, either
directly or indirectly.

Such considerations draw attention to the fact that quantity of mat-
ter (assuming that there exists such a carrier of properties as we term
‘“matter”) need not necessarily be measured by its inertia or by gravi-
tational attraction. In fact, the word ‘‘mass” has two totally distinct
Significations. Because we adopt the convention to measure quantity
of matter by its mass the word “ mass” has come to denote “quantity
of matter;” but it is open to anyone to measure a quantity of matter
by any other of its energy factors. I may, if I choose, state that those
quantities of matter which possess equal capacities for heat are equal,
or that ‘‘equal numbers of atoms” represent equal quantities of matter.
Indeed, we regard the value of material as due rather to what it can
do than to its mass; and we buy food, in the main, on an atomic, or,
perhaps, a molecular basis, according to its content of albumen; and
most articles depend for their value on the amount of food required by
the producer or the manufacturer.

The various forms of energy may therefore be classified as those
which can be referred to an ‘‘atomic” factor and those which possess
a “mass” factor. The former are in the majority, and the periodic
law is the bridge between them—as yet an imperfect connection, for
the atomic factors, arranged in the order of their masses, display only

SM 97 17

258 AN UNDISCOVERED GAS.

a partial regularity. It is undoubtedly one of the main problems of
physics and chemistry to solve this mystery. What the solution will
be is beyond my power of prophecy; whether it is to be found in the
influence of some circumstance on the atomic weights hitherto regarded
as among the most certain “constants of Nature” or whether it will
turn out that mass and gravitational attraction are influenced by tem-
perature or by electrical charge I can not tell; but that some means
will ultimately be found of reconciling these apparent discrepancies I
firmly believe. Such a reconciliation is unecessary, whatever view be
taken of the nature of the universe and of its mode of action; what-
ever units we may choose to regard as fundamental among those which
lie at our disposal.

In this address I have endeavored to fulfill my promise to combine a
little history, a little actuality, and a little prophecy. The history
belongs to the Old World. I have endeavored to share passing events
with the New, and I will ask you to join with me in the hope that much
of the prophecy may meet with its fulfillment on this side of the ocean.
FLUORINE.

By Prof. HENRI MOISSAN,

Membre de V Académie des Sciences, Paris.

There has long been known a curious mineral, fluor spar, which
occurs in nature in great cubic crystals, sometimes colorless, sometimes
tinted green or violet. This mineral is a binary compound of a metal,
calcium, united with another element hitherto impossible to isolate,
which has been named fluorine.

This fluoride of calcium has very often been compared with the
chloride of sodium, the composition of which is perfectly well known
to chemists. In fact, there are great and profound analogies between
the fluorides and the chlorides; potassium chloride and potassium
fluoride both crystallize in the cubic system. In their chief properties
the chlorides resemble the fluorides. They usually give parallel reac-
tions; treated with sulphuric acid, both yield hydrogen acids which are
soluble in water and which fume strongly in the air.

In addition to calcium fluoride, other compounds containing fluorine
are found in nature. We know, for example, a complex compound of
calcium phosphate and calcium fluoride which is called apatite. This
mineral, which occurs sometimes in very pretty crystals, has also been
obtained synthetically in the laboratory; but, which is more important,
Henri Sainte-Claire Deville has succeeded in preparing a chlorinated
apatite, and this new compound forms crystals identical with those of
the apatite containing fluorine. We may therefore say with propriety
that in these compounds chlorine can replace fluorine, or act as its
substitute. Here is a remarkable analogy, a bond which connects
well-studied, well-known chlorine with the elementary substance not
yet isolated, fluorine.

Need I cite other examples? They are not lacking. We know the
mineral wagnerite, which contains fluorine naturally, and we can pre-
pare the similar chlorinated compound.

These analogies between chlorine and fluorine go still further.

260 FLUORINE.

Let us treat common salt, the chloride of sodium, with sulphuric acid.
You see that it gives at once an abundant disengagement of gaseous
hydrochloric acid.

We will do the same with sodium fluoride. Let us add, in a leaden
vessel, sulphuric acid to the alkaline fluoride. We shall see copious
fumes produced. In each case, at a temperature of 20° C., we shall
have disengaged a gaseous body which fumes strongly in the air, is
colorless, has the characteristics of an energetic acid, combines in the
dry state with ammonia, is very soluble in water, and dissolves in the
latter with a great increase in temperature.

If we give to sodium fluoride, to the binary compound of fluorine and
sodium, the formula NaF, that of the acid substance produced by the
action of sulphuric acid can only be HF. ‘The two reactions are
identical.

The acid gaseous body formed in this reaction is, therefore. a com-
pound of fluorine and hydrogen; a body analogous to hydrochloric
acid, and to which the name hydrofluoric acid is given.

But in the natural sciences analogy is not sufficient; the scientific
method can only accept that which is rigorously proved. It is there-
fore necessary to demonstrate that hydrofluoric acid is a hydrogen acid.
And this will take us back to the beginning of the century. You know
well how great was the influence of Lavoisier upon the upward flight of
chemistry, and-indeed upon all true science. You know how this great
genius, by the continual use of the balance in the study of reactions,
gave to the science which we follow a mathematical exactness. Struck
by the important part which oxygen plays in combustion, he believed
that that element was indispensable to the formation of acids. To
Lavoisier every acid was an oxygen compound; hydrochiorie acid,
therefore, according to his theories, was regarded as containing oxygen;
and, by analogy, hydrofluoric acid must contain it also.

To your great investigator, Humphry Davy, belongs the honor of
having proved that hydrofluoric acid contains no oxygen. But allow
me, before coming to the beautiful researches of Davy, to recall to you
the history of the discovery of hydrofluoric acid. We need not con-
sider the investigations of Margraff, which were published in 1768,
but we must not forget that it was Scheele who definitely characterized
hydrofluoric acid in 1771, without, however, obtaining it in a state of
purity. In 1809 Gay Lussae and Thénard took up the study of the
compound, and succeeded in producing an acid sufficiently pure and
highly concentrated, although far from being anhydrous. The action
of hydrofluoric acid upon silica and the silicates was then perfectly
elucidated.

Let us now come down to about the year 1813, the time when Davy
undertook the study of hydrofluoric acid. A little earlier Ampére, in
two letters addressed to Humphry Davy, advanced the opinion that
hydrofluoric acid might be regarded as formed by the combination of
FLUORINE. 261

hydrogen with an element yet unknown—fluorine—or, in brief, that it
was not an oxygenated acid.

Davy, who shared this view, sought at once to prove that hydrofluoric
acid contained no oxygen. For this purpose he neutralized the pure
acid with ammonia, and strongly heating the salt in an apparatus of
platinum, collected in the colder parts of the latter only the sublimed
fluohydrate of ammonia containing no trace of water.

Let us repeat the experiment, but with an oxygenated acid; let
us take sulphuric acid and neutralize it with ammonia. We thus
obtain ammonium sulphate. If now we heat this salt in the same
platinum apparatus, it will fuse at about 140° C.; then, at about 180°,
it will decompose into ammonia and the bisulphate, and the latter, at a
still higher temperature, will be transformed into volatile ammonium
bisulphite, nitrogen, and water.

Thus, upon strongly heating ammonium sulphate there has been a
formation of water, and in this experiment of Davy, when performed
with an oxygenated acid, the quantity of water collected is so great as
to be unquestionable. The fluohydrate of ammonia, like the chlor-
hydrate, gives no water upon decomposition, which leads us therefore
to say that hydrofluoric acid contains no oxygen, and that it is analo-
gous to hydrochloric acid. Now we know by experimental demonstra-
tion that hydrochloric acid is composed of chlorine and hydrogen. It
is therefore logical to think that hydrofluoric acid is formed by the
combination of hydrogen with fluorine.

This important experiment, made by skillful hands, did not, however,
compel a general belief in the existence of hydracids.

The views of Lavosier concerning the part played by oxygen in the
formation of acids, ideas which had been opposed at first, were then
so generally admitted that many persons refused to accept the exist-
ence of hydrogenated acids at all. It was only after the memorable
researches of Guy Lussac upon cyanogen and hydrocyanie acid that it
was proved beyond discussion that energetic acids could exist which
contained no trace of oxygen.

Furthermore, when we compare the acid compounds formed by chlo-
rine, for example, or sulphur with hydrogen we have two types of
combination which are entirely different.

Let us take one volume of chlorine and one volume of hydrogen. By
the action of light or of a spark from an induction coil they unite to
form two volumes of hydrochloric-acid gas, a compound having all the
properties of a very energetic acid.

If we combine two volumes of hydrogen with one volume of sulphur
vapor we shall obtain two volumes of sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
which has, it is true, an acid reaction, but incomparably weaker than
that of hydrochloric acid.

It is very evident that by virtue of its powerful reactions, by the

with bases, that hydrofluoric acid should be compared with hydro-—
chlorie acid and not with the sulphur compound. It resembles abso-

lutely the acid formed from one volume of chlorine and one volume of

hydrogen united without condensation.

Let me now recall to you a much more recent experiment of Gore.
This chemist heated fluoride of silver in an atmosphere of hydrogen.
Under these conditions he saw the volume of gas double itself; it was
apparent, then, that hydrofluoric acid was formed by the union of one
volume of hydrogen with one volume of the element not yet isolated,
fluorine. Furthermore, it was evidently that same element which had
left the silver fluoride to unite with hydrogen and to generate the
hydrofluoric acid of which we have spoken.

Thus, without preparing fluorine, without being able to separate it
from the substances with which it is united, chemistry has been able to
study and to analyze a great number of its compounds. The body was
not isolated, and yet its place was marked in our classifications. This
well demonstrates the usefulness of a scientific theory, a theory which
is regarded as true during a certain time, which correlates facts and
leads the mind to new hypotheses, the first causes of experimentation;
which, little by little, destroy the theory itself, in order to replace it
by another more in harmony with the progress of science.

Thus certain properties of among were foreseen even before its isola-
tion became possible.

Let us now see what attempts were made not only with hydrofluoric
acid, but also with the fluorides to isolate fluorine.

I have already spoken of Davy’s experiments, in which, most notably,
he proved that hydrofluoric acid contained no oxygen. In addition to
these experiments Davy made many others which I will briefly recall.

We can in a general way divide the researches upon fluorine into two
great classes:

1. Experiments made by the electrolytic method, either upon the
acid or upon fluorides.

2. Experiments in the dry way. From the eee of these
researches it was foreseen that fluorine, when isolated, would decom-
pose water; consequently all the attempts made by the wet way since
the first work of Davy had no chance of success.

Humphrey Davy made many electrical experiments, and these were
carried out in apparatus of platinum or of fused (cast) chloride of silver
with the powerful voltaic pile of the Royal Society.

He found that hydrofluoric acid was decomposed, despite the fact that
it contained water, and then that the electric current seemed to pass
with much more difficulty. He tried also throwing the electric sparks
into the acid liquid, and was able in some attempts to obtain by this
method a small quantity of gas. But the acid, although cooled, was
rapidly dissipated in vapor and the laboratory soon became uvinhab-
itable. Davy even became quite ill from breathing the vapor of hydro-
FLUORINE. 263

fluoric acid, and he advised all chemists to take the greatest precautions
to avoid its action upon the skin and the bronchial tubes. Gay Lussae
and Thénard also suffered much from the same acid vapors.

The other experiments of Davy (I can not cite them all) were chiefly
directed to the reaction of chlorine upon fluorides. They presented
very great difficulties, for at that time the fluohydrates of the fluorides
were unknown, nor was it known how to prepare the majority of the
anhydrous fluorides.

These researches of Davy are, as should be expected, of the highest
importance, and one remarkable property of fluorine was put in evi-
dence. In those experiments which yielded a small quantity of this
radicle of the fluorides the vessels of gold or platinum in which the
reaction took place were profoundly attacked. In this case fluorides
of gold or of platinum were formed.

Davy varied in many ways the conditions of his experiments. He
repeated the reaction of chlorine upon a metallic fluoride in vessels of
sulphur, of carbon, of gold, of platinum, etc.; and he never attained to
a satisfactory result. He was thus led to think that fluorine undoubt-
edly possessed a chemical activity much greater than that of known
substances.

In closing his memoir, Humphry Davy suggests that these experi-
ments might succeed if they were performed in vessels of fluor spar.
We shall see that this idea has been taken up by different investigators.
To read the work of Davy will interest you, captivate you to the high-
est degree. I can best compare this fine memoir with those pictures
of the masters to which time only adds new charms. One never tires
of admiring them, and discovers in them without end new details and
new beauties.

It was by operating in apparatus made of calcium fluoride that the
brothers Knox sought to decompose silver fluoride with chlorine. The
chief objection to their experiments is based on the fact that the fluoride
of silver employed was not dry. In fact, it is extremely difficult to
completely dehydrate the fluorides of silver and mercury. Further-
more, we shall see, in the researches of Fremy, that the action of chlorine
upon fluorides tends rather to form addition products—fluochlorides—
than to set the fluorine free.

In 1848, Louyet, also working with apparatus of fluor spar, studied
an analogous reaction. He acted with chlorine upon the fluoride of mer-
cury. The objections raised against the researches of the brothers Knox
also apply to the labors of Louyet. IFremy has shown that fluoride of
mereury prepared by Louyet’s process contains a notable amount of
water. Furthermore, the results obtained were quite variable. The
gas collected was a mixture of air, chlorine, and hydrofluoric acid,
whose properties varied during the course of preparation.

The brothers Knox complained much of the action of hydrofluoric
acid upon the respiratory passages, and one of them states that after
264 FLUORINE.

the close of their investigation he spent three years at Genoa and
returned still suffermg. As for Louyet, carried away by his researches,
he took insufficient precautions to avoid the irritating action of the acid
vapors, and paid with his life for his devotion to science.

These researches of Louyet led I'remy, about the vear 1850, to take
up again the question of the isolation of fluorine. remy first studied,
systematically, the metallic fluorides. He proved the existence of
numerous fluohydrates of fluorides, and ascertained their properties
and composition. Next he caused many gaseous substances to react
upon different fluorides, the action of chlorine and of oxygen being
studied with care. Finally, all his attention was drawn to the electro-
lysis of metallic fluorides.

Most of these experiments were performed in vessels of platinum, at
temperatures which were sometimes very high. When, after the gen-
eral examination of the fluorides, fremy studied the action of chlorine
upon the fluorides of lead, antimony, mercury, and silver, he showed
clearly that it was almost impossible then to obtain these compounds
in a condition of absolute dryness. Hence we can understand why, in
his electrolytic researches, this chemist devoted his attention mainly to
calcium fluoride.

Having seen that many fluorides retained water most tenaciously, he
fell back upon fluor spar, which often occurs in nature very pure and
absolutely dry. This fluoride of calcium, liquefied at a high tempera-
ture, he sought to electrolyze in a platinum vessel.

Under these conditions the metal calcium is carried to the negative
pole, while around the platinum rod which formed the negative electrcde,
and which was rapidly corroded, there was visible a boiling, indicating
the escape of a new gas. :

Undoubtedly, in these experiments, fluorine was set free; but con-
sider that the electrolysis was effected at the temperature of a bright
red heat. How difficult experimentation must become under such
conditions. Howisit possible to collect the gas or to ascertain its prop-
erties? This gaseous body displaces iodine from the iodides, but after
a few experiments the alkaline metal, set at liberty, pierces the plati-
nuin walls of the apparatus, the latter becomes useless, and all must be
begun anew.

lar from being discouraged by his failures Fremy, on the contrary,
brought to his work an inconceivable perseverance. He: varied his
experiments, modified his apparatus; the difficulties only encouraged
him to continue his labors.

Two important facts at once stood out by themselves. One entered.
immediately into the domain of science; the other seems to have
attracted much less attention. ;

The first was the preparation of pure, anhydrous hydrofluoric acid.
Until the researches of Fremy, the acid absolutely deprived of water
was unknown. Having prepared and analyzed the fluohydrate of
FLUORINE. 265

potassium fluoride, Fremy made use of it at once as a source of the
pure, dry acid.

He thus obtained a compound which was gaseous at ordinary temper-
atures, and which condensed in a freezing mixture to a colorless liquid
having a great affinity for water. Here, then, is a reaction of great
importance—the preparation of hydrofluoric acid in a state of purity.

Allow me to remark incidentally that when Humphry Davy elee-
trolyzed concentrated hydrofluoric acid the badly conducting liquid
which he obtained at the end of his experiment was the acid very
nearly anhydrous. .

The second fact, which, as I have said, was almost unnoticed, and
which has been of great interest to me, especially at the end of my
researches, was that fluorine has the greatest tendency to unite with
nearly all compounds to form addition products.

In brief, fluorine easily forms ternary and quaternary compounds.
Let chlorine act upon a fluoride, instead of isolating fluorine we shall
prepare a fluochloride. Employ oxygen, and we shall make an oxy-
fluoride. This property explains to us the failures of Louyet, of the
brothers Knox, and of other experimenters. Hven when dealing with
dry fluorides in an atmosphere of chlorine, bromine, or iodine we shall
obtain ternary compounds instead of free fluorine. This fact was
clearly established by Fremy. His memoir covers so great a number
of experiments that it seems to have discouraged chemists, to have
stopped further attempts. Since 1856, the date of publication of
Fremy’s memoir, researches upon hydrofluoric acid and the isolation of
fluorine have been few. The question seems to have been in a state of
arrested development. Nevertheless, in 1869, Gore took up method-
ically the study of hydrofluoric acid. He started with the anhydrous
acid prepared by Fremy’s method. He determined its boiling point, the
tension of its vapor at different temperatures; indeed, all of its prin-
cipal properties. His memoir is one of remarkable exactitude. Among
the numerous investigations of Gore we will consider for the moment
only the following, to which I beg your attention:

In a special apparatus this chemist electrolyzed anhydrous hydro-
fluoric acid containing a little fluoride of platinum in such manner
that the gases produced could be collected at each electrode. At the
negative pole he saw hydrogen disengaged abundantly, while the rod
which terminated the positive pole was.rapidly corroded. This phe-
nomenon was identical with that observed by Faraday during the elec-
trolysis of calcium fluoride. Gore next verified the observation of
Faraday, that hydrofluoric acid containing water allows the current to
pass, but that the absolutely pure anhydrous acid is a nonconductor.
In one of his experiments Gore tried to electrolyze a hydrofluoric acid,
which, because of an impurity, was a good conductor; and, seeking to
avoid the wasting of the electrode, replaced the latter by a stick of
carbon.
266 FLUORINE.

This carbon was prepared with great care, by heating in a current of
hydrogen a dense wood, which gave him a sonorous rod, a good con-
ductor of electricity. The apparatus was put together; the experiment
begun. All at once a violent explosion occurred, and fragments of the
carbon were thrown to the remotest parts of the laboratory. Gore
repeated the experiment several times. The result was always the
same. To-day we are able to give an explanation of the phenomenon.

The carbon, which was thus prepared by the distillation of a very
hard wood, was filled with hydrogen. You all know how easily gases
condense in carbon; the beautiful experiments of Melsens have estab-
lished this most clearly. When we electrolyze, with a negative pole of
such carbon, a conducting hydrofluoric acid, fluorine is set free, which,
as we shall see later, unites with hydrogen, producing a violent detona-
tion. In this experiment of Gore a little fluorine was set free, and it
was to the combination of that with the hydrogen occluded in the car-
bon that the explosion was due.

Now I come to the new experiments, to which I call your attention.

I began these researches with a preconceived opinion. If we sup-
pose for a moment that chlorine had not yet been isolated, although we
knew how to prepare the chlorides of phosphorus and other similar —
compounds, it is clear that we should increase our chances of success
in attempting to isolate that element by working with the compounds
which it could form with the metalloids.

It seemed to me that we could obtain chlorine rather by seeking to
decompose the pentachloride of phosphorus or hydroehloric acid than
by attempting the electrolysis of chloride of calcium or of an alkaline
chloride. .

Should not the same considerations hold good for fluorine?

Again, since fluorine, according to the earlier investigations, and
especially those of Davy, is a body endowed with very energetic
affinities, we should, in order to collect the element, work at the lowest
possible temperatures.

Such are the general conceptions which led me to take up systemat-
ically a study of the compounds formed by fluorine with the metalloids.

My attention was first given to the fluoride of silicon, and I was
struck at once by the great stability of that compound. With the
exception of the alkaline metals, which, at a dull red heat, decompose
it easily, few substances act upon silicon fluoride. It is easy to account
for this property if we remember that its formation is attended by a
very great evolution of heat. M. Berthelot showed long since that the
stability of compounds is greatest when the most heat is generated
during their formation.

I supposed then, rightly or wrongly, before having isolated fluorine,
that if we ever succeeded in preparing the element, its combination
with crystallized silicon should be attended. by incandescence. And
every time during my long researches that I hoped to have set fluorine
FLUORINE. 267

free I did not fail to try that reaction, and we shall see later that it
succeeded perfectly.

After these first experiments upon silicon fluoride, I took up the
investigation of the compounds of fluorine with phosphorus.

Thorpe discovered the compound PF;, the pentafluoride of phospho-
rus. I prepared the trifluoride PF, and I gave all my attention to the
reactions which might lead to its decomposition. I made the experi-
ment of which Humphry Davy had dreamed, of burning phosphorus
trifluoride in oxygen, and | found that there was no formation of phos-
phoriv acid with liberation of fluorine, as the English scholar had
expected, but that the trifluoride and the oxygen united to form a new
gas—phosphorus oxyfluoride.

Here is a new example of the ease with which fluorine yields prod-
ucts of addition.

IT next tried, but without avail, the action of the induction spark
upon phosphorus trifluoride. The pentatluoride of phosphorus discov-
ered by Thorpe has, however, been decomposed by ey strong sparks
into the trifluoride and fluorine.

This experiment was made in a glass tube over mercury. You will
see that at once fluoride of mercury and Huoride of silicon were formed.
There was no hope, under these conditions, of preserving the fluorine,
even when it was diluted by an excess of pentafluoride. I then thought
of another reaction.

We have known, since the researches of Fremy, that the fluoride of
platinum, produced during the electrolysis of alkaline fluorides, decom-
poses at a high temperature. Having found that the fluorides of phos-
phorus are easily absorbed by hot platinum sponge, with the final pro-
duction of platinum phosphide, I thought that this method of preparing
fluoride of platinum might lead to the isolation of fluorine. Heating
gently at first, the absorption of phosphorus fluoride should give a
mixture of phosphorus and platinum fluoride; and, the quantity of
the latter being sufficient, a subsequent increase of temperature should
disengage fluorine. These experiments and others analogous to them
were tried under conditions most favorable to success. They yielded
interesting results, which were not, however, sufficiently sharp to settle
the question of the isolation of fluorine.

While still pursuing the above-mentioned studies, I prepared the
trifluoride of arsenic, which had already been obtained by Dumas in
great purity. I determined its physical constants, together with some
new properties, and investigated with great care the action of the elec-
tric current upon it. :

The fluoride of arsenic, liquid at ordinary temperatures (a binary
compound, formed by a solid, arsenic, with a gas, fluorine) seemed to be
admirably suited to electr aie experiments.

I was obliged at four different times to interrupt these researches
upon arsenious fluoride, the manipulation of which is more dangerous
268 FLUORINE.

than that of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, and whose toxic properties
made it impossible for me to continue the experiments.

I succeeded, however, in effecting the electrolysis of this compound
upon employing the current produced by a battery of 90 Bunsen cells.

Under these conditions the current passed continuously; pulverulent
arsenic was deposited at the negative pole, and at the positive electrode
gaseous bubbles were formed which rose in the liquid, but were almost
instantly absorbed. The liberated fluorine was at once taken up by the
trifluoride of arsenic, AsF3, which was transformed into the penta-
fluoride, AsF;. This investigation, carried on for a long time, gave
me no fluorine, but it yielded me precious data concerning the elec-
trolysis of the liquid compounds of fluorine, and led me to the decom-
position of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid.

In order to effect the electrolysis of hydrofluoric acid I had made the
small apparatus which is before you, and which consists of a platinum
U tube, carrying on each limb an exit tube placed above the level of
the fluid.

.The two openings of the U tube were closed by corks previously
saturated with paraffin, as was done in all of my experiments upon
the electrolysis of arsenious fluoride. :

A platinum wire passed through each stopper and was connected
with a battery of fifty Bunsen elements.

I prepared at first pure anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, and found, as
shown by Faraday and by Gore, that it was a nonconductor.

The experiment was varied in many ways. The result was always the
same. With the current given by ninety Bunsen cells decomposition
occurred only with the hydrous acid, and it stopped as soon as all the
water had been separated into hydrogen and oxygen. It therefore
seemed impossible to effect by this process the decomposition of hydro-
fluoric acid into its elements—hydrogen and fluorine.

At this point I remembered that in the previous study of arsenious
fluoride | had sought to make that liquid a good conductor by adding
to it a little fluoride of manganese or acid fluoride of potassium. This
process was applied to the hydrofluoric acid, and then, after three
years of investigation, I reached the first important experiment upon
the isolation of fluorine.

Hydrofluoric acid containing the acid fluoride of potassium decom-
poses under the action of the current; and in the apparatus which is
before your eyes one could obtain at the negative pole a regular disen-
gagement of hydrogen. What was there at the positive pole? Noth-
ing. A slight increase of pressure—that was all. Only, in dismounting
the apparatus it was found that the cork of the positive pole had been
burnt, carbonized, to the depth of a centimeter. The paraftined
stopper of the negative pole was unaltered. Hence there had been
disengaged at the positive pole a substance having an action upon
cork quite different from that of hydrofluoric acid.
FLUORINE. 269

I should add that in order to lessen the vapor tension of the hydro-
fluoric acid the liquid was cooled by means of methyl chloride, which
by rapid evaporation produces a cold of —50° C.

It was necessary to modify the apparatus, and especially the closing
of the U tube. Stoppers of fluorspar smoothly ground did not give
me good results. The gum lac or gutta-percha which surrounded them
was rapidly attacked by the gas produced at the positive pole. It was
necessary, therefore, to resort to a closure by means of platinum screws,
and after much groping the experiment was thus arranged.

The platinum U tube was closed by screw stoppers. Each stopper
was formed by a cylinder of fluorspar, carefully inserted in a hollow
cylinder of platinum, whose outer surface carried the screw thread.
Each stopper of fluorspar was penetrated by a square rod of plati-
num. The lower ends of these rods, which served as electrodes, dipped
into the liquid. Finally, two branches of platinum, soldered to the
two limbs of the U tube below the stoppers, but above the level of the
liquid, allowed the gases generated by the action of the current to
escape.

In order to obtain pure anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, one begins by
preparing the fluohydrate of potassium fluoride, taking all the precau-
tions indicated by Fremy. Having obtained this salt in a state of
purity, it is dried over the water bath at a temperature of 100° C.;
and afterwards the capsule containing it is placed in vacuo in presence
of sulphuric acid and of caustic potash fused in a silver crucible. The
acid and potash are replaced every morning during fifteen days, and
the vacuum in the bell jar is always maintained to a pressure of about
1 centimetre of mercury.

During this desiccation it is necessary to pulverize the salt from time
to time in an iron mortar, in order to expose fresh surfaces. When the
fluohydrate no longer contains water, it falls into fine powder, and can
then be used for the preparation of hydrofluoric acid. It is to be noted
that well-made fluohydrate of potassium fluoride is much less deli-
quescent than the normal fluoride.

When the fluohydrate is thoroughly dry, it is quickly transferred to
a platinum alembic, which has been dried at a red heat a little while
before. It is heated gently for an hour or an hour and a half, in order
that decomposition may begin slowly; and the first portions of the
hydrofluoric acid formed, which may contain traces of water remaining
in the salt, are rejected. The platinum receiver is then attached to
the retort, which is heated more strongly, but still so as to effect the
decomposition of the fluohydrate somewhat slowly. The receiver is
surrounded by a mixture of ice and salt; and from this point all the
hydrofluoric acid is condensed as a clear liquid, boiling at 19.5° C., very
hygroscopic, and, as we know, fuming abundantly in presence of the
moisture of the air.

During this operation the platinum U tube, dried with the utmost
DO) FLUORINE.

care, has been fixed by means of cork in a cylindrical glass vessel and
surrounded by methyl chloride. Up to the moment of introducing the
hydrofluoric acid the exit tubes have been connected with exsiccators
containing fused potash. The hydrofluoric acid is brought into this
little apparatus by inserting one of the lateral tubes into the receiver
in which it is condensed.

When a determinate volume of liquid hydrofluoric acid has been col-
lected in the platinum apparatus, and cooled by gently boiling methyl
chloride to a temperature of — 23° C., the current from twenty-five large
Bunsen cells, mounted in series, is passed through it. An ampere
meter placed in the circuit enables us to take account of the intensity
of the current.

In order to make the acid a conductor there is added to it before the
experiment a little of the dried and fused fluohydrate of potassium
fluoride, about 2 grams to 10 cubic centimeters of the liquid. Under
these conditions the decomposition takes place continuously, and we
obtain, at the negative pole, a gas which burns with a colorless flame,
and which has all the characteristics of hydrogen. At the positive pole
there is a colorless gas of a very disagreeable, penetrating odor,
resembling that of hypochlorous acid, and irritating to the mucous
membrane of the throat and the eyes. The new gas is endowed with
very energetic properties—for instance, sulphur inflames upon contact
with it.

Phosphorus takes fire in the gas and yields a mixture of oxyfluoride
and fluoride. lIodine combines with it, giving a pale flame and losing
itscolor. Powdered arsenic and antimony combine with fluorine incan-
descently.

Crystallized silicon, even when cold, kindles immediately upon con-
tact with the gas, and burns with much brilliancy, sometimes giving
off sparks. The product is silicon fluoride, which can be collected over
mercury and clearly identified.

Pure boron ignites also, giving fluoride of boron. Amorphous carbon
becomes incandescent upon contact with fluorine. In order to make
these different experiments it suffices to put the solid substance in a
small glass tube, which is brought close to the extremity of the plati-
num tube from which the fluorine emerges. We can also repeat the
experiments by putting small fragments of the solid bodies to be stud-
ied upon the cover of a platinum crucible held near the opening of the
exit tube.

The gas decomposes water in the cold, yielding hydrofluoric acid and
ozone: it ignites carbon disulphide, and when collected in a platinum
crucible containing carbon tetrachloride it produces a continuous lib-
eration of chlorine.

Fused potassium chloride is attacked in the cold with disengage-
ment of chlorine. In presence of mereury the gas is completely
absorbed, forming light-yellow mercurous fluoride. Potassium and
FLUORINE. Piel

sodium become incandescent, yielding fluorides. In general, however,
the metals are attacked less vigorously than the metalloids. This, we
think, is due to a superficial formation of fluoride which hinders fur-
ther attack. Powdered iron and manganese burn in the gas with a
shower of sparks.

Organie-bodies are violently attacked. A piece of cork placed near
the mouth of the platinum exit tube carbonizes at once and inflames.
Alcohol, ether, benzene, turpentine, and petroleum take fire upon con-

tact with fluorine.
— Working under good conditions one can obtain from each pole of the
apparatus two to four liters of gas per hour.

When the experiment has lasted for several hours and the quantity
of hydrofluoric acid remaining at the bottom of the U tube is not suffi-
cient to separate the two gases they recombine in the apparatus with a
violent detonation.

We are assured, by direct experiment, that a mixture of ozone sat-
urated with hydrofluoric acid produces none of the reactions just
described. The same is true of gaseous hydrofluoric acid. It may be
added that the hydrofluoric acid employed, and also the fluohydrate,
were absolutely free from chlorine. Finally, it can not be objected that
the new gas might be a perfluoride of hydrogen; for, passed over iron
heated to redness in a platinum tube it is completely absorbed, without
liberation of hydrogen.

In the most recent investigations I have found that it is possible to
make these experiments in an apparatus of copper, constructed like
the platinum device which is before you.

By the electrolysis of hydrofluoric acid rendered conductive with the
acid fluoride of potassium, we have obtained, at the negative pole,
hydrogen, and at the positive pole the continuous evolution of a gas
having new properties and endowed with very energetic affinities; that
gas is fluorine. We have been able to determine its density, its color,
and its spectrum, and to study its action upon both elements and
compounds.

Now that we know the chief properties of fluorine, now that the
element has been isolated, I am convinced that in spite of its energetic
reactions, new means for its preparation will be discovered.

We may even suppose that purely chemical methods for the prepara-
tion of fluorine may be found, which shall give a better yield than the
electrolytic process.

Will fluorine ever have practical applications?

It is very difficult to answer this question. I may, however, say in
all sincerity that I gave this subject little thought when I undertook
my researches, and I believe that all the chemists whose attempts pre-
ceded mine gave it no more consideration.

A scientific research is a search after truth, and it is only after dis-
covery that the question of applicability can be usefully considered.
DD, FLUORINE.

It is evident that, as we see the great industrial transformations
which take place to-day before our eyes, we can not well dogmatize on
the subject. After the preparation of Bessemer steel, the manufacture
of manganese in the blast furnace, and the synthesis of alizarin, the
chemist dares not-deny the industrial vitality of any reaction of his
laboratory.

When we think of the value which certain metals, such as sodium
and potassium, had when Davy prepared them by electrolysis; when
we recall that by the process of Gay-Lussac and Thenard they cost
some thousands of franes a kilogram, and that to-day, by electrolytic
methods, they can be made for not more than 5 franes, we can not say
of any chemical reaction that it shall have no industrial uses.

Only—and here I shall close—it is curious to see how many con-
tinuous efforts, how many different points of view, are involved in the
solution of one of these scientific questions; or rather, I should say,
to advance one of them, for in reality no subject is ever closed. It
remains always open to our successors; we can only add a link to an
infinite chain.

The advancement of science is slow; it is effected only by virtue of
hard work ana perseverance. And when a result is attained, should
we not in recognition connect it with the efforts of those who have pre-
ceded us, who have struggled and suffered in advance? Is it not truly —
a duty to recall tlie difficulties which they vanquished, the thoughts
which guided them; and how men of different nations, ideas, positions,
and characters, moved solely by the love of science, have bequeathed
to us the unsolved problem? Should not the last comer recall the
researches of his predecessors while adding in his turn his contribution
of intelligence and of labor? Here is an intellectual collaboration con-
secrated entirely to the search for truth, and which continues from
century to century.

This scientific patrimony which we ever seek to extend is a part of
the fortune of humanity; we should preserve it with full recognition of
those who gave it the warmth of their hearts and the best of their
intelligence.
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.!

By Dr. O. LUMMER.

PART I.
HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.

Of the five senses of man that of sight is without doubt the one
which first makes known to us the intimate relationship between inter-
nal seif and the external world.

If we close our eyes, the magnificent colors and the manifold forms of
nature with their lights and shadows all vanish. Everything is wrapped
in dreary impenetrable darkness; we have lost the safe guidance of
sight, and left to the uncertain guidance of the sense of touch, we grope
around inthis darkness. There is no light for us except where there
is sight. The Greek philosophers were wrong in their belief that light
was a Something emanating from the human eye, which returning from
outside objects rendered these visible. The evidence points to a some-
thing emanating from visible objects which, penetrating to the retina,
evokes in the brain the sensations of light and darkness, color and luster.
Newton and his school believed that the something emitted by lumi-
nous bodies consisted of minute material particles (corpuscles).

This theory was, however, supplanted by the wave theory of Huygens,
according to which that something which isemitted by luminous bodies is
not a stream of particles, but a wave-like motion of the “ ether,” which
must be considered as permeating all forms of matter from the lightest
gas to the densest metal. Infinite space is an ocean of ether in which
all natural phenomena take place. Unresisted by friction, the planets
glide swiftly through it. But just as a stone dropped into water pro-
duces ripples in its smooth surface, just as a vibrating tuning fork com-
municates its vibrations to the air, so does a source of hght set in
motion the ether. Sound and light, pitch and color, exactly corre-
spond to one another. A source of light produces light waves in the
ether just as a tuning fork produces sound wavesin theair. The sound
waves penetrating to the auditory nerves through the drum of the ear
produce in the brain the sensation of sound, and similarly the ether
waves, reaching the retina through the lens, produce the sensations of

light and color. Color and musical pitch are therefore purely subjec-
tive phenomena.

If the air is not in vibration no sensation of sound can arise, and
similarly if the ether is not in vibration then there is nolight. A
tuning fork which makes as few as one hundred vibrations per second,
affects the auditory nerves. But at least four hundred billion ether
vibrations per second are necessary to produce the sensation of sight.
We can form no conception of this extremely rapid vibration nor of
the immense velocity of its propagation.

The lightning flashes, and in one-seventh of a second its light travels
more than 26,000 miles, a distance greater than the circumference of
the earth; in eight minutes it would reach the sun.

Bodies which have the property of emitting light by their own
energy are generally called self-luminous bodies. To-day we shall con-
sider only the terrestrial sources of illumination whose light we let
shine as soon as that source of all light and being, the sun, turns aside
its bright and benignant rays. As soon as the great sun sinks like a
red ball of fire below the horizon the suns of other planetary systems,
the stars, begin to twinkle and send their pale light to the earth.
Their rays, tired and weak from their endless journey, tell us the hap-
penings of many years ago. If Sirius should be extinguished to-day
its light would nevertheless long continue shining brightly, for it takes
years for a ray of light to journey to our earth from that star. Star-
light can therefore be of no practical importance, and dark are the
nights that the moon does not wish us well, reflecting graciously a few
of the rays of the sun. But even she, the ever-faithful and true com:
panion of the earth, fails to completely satisfy our longing for more
light. The striving of man to lengthen the days and shorten the
nights can only be fulfilled by his own energies, by exchanging philo-
sophical speculations for a study of reality, and by making use of
experimental research once so despised. How successfully this has
been accomplished this brilliantly ilumined hall gives the plainest
testimony.

It, however, took many centuries to enable man to surround himself
with such a dazzling flood of artificial light. Still, in the dim antiquity,
as the book of invention records, the Persians, the Medes, the Assyr-
ians, and Egyptians illuminated their temples, their palaces, their
plazas, and streets in luxurious prodigality. In Memphis, Thebes,
Babylon, Susa, and Nineveh they are said to have hardly known the
difference between day and night. Along the streets there stood rows
of bronze or stone vases filled with as much as 100 pounds of oil, which
burned from a wick 3 inches in diameter. If such a long-buried civili-
zation of the distant East could develop such a dazzling brightness,
how far back must be the day that man learned for the first time to
kindle the “divine spark.” As valuable as time may appear to modern
civilization, the amount of it at the disposal of science in the interpre-
tation of physical phenomena is practically unlimited. For this reason
\

LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 275

the exact time that a spark was first kindled by man is of no impor-
tance here. We might rather be interested in the manner in which it
was accomplished. Did fire in the shape of a meteor fall from heaven,
was its terrible force first manifested in the glowing lava of the vol-
cano, or are we indebted for it to the hard labor of man in his struggle
with nature for existence?

The most natural and most probable explanation is that man learned
to produce a spark at will while engaged in making the first weapons
of stone. Fire was certainly discovered independently in numerous
parts of the earth.

The significance of this first acquaintance of man with fire for the
development of higher civilization can not be overestimated. It is
reflected in the mythology and songs of all lands. Greek mythology
elevates the fire bringer to the dispenser of light in a spiritual sense,
while the Romans worshiped Vesta as the goddess of the hearth and
also of the sacrificial fires, and in honor of the birth of light the eternal
fire was guarded by the vestal virgins. |

It is a great leap from the hearth fire and the sacrificial fire to the
incandescent electric light and incandescent gaslight. For a long time
the fire on the hearth served at the same time as a source of light, a
custom preserved to this day in many German spinning rooms, and
among the Eskimo no other light is known. First came the flickering
kindling-wood pan, then the resin and pitch fagots, then reeds covered
with wax, pointing to the impending important separation of light and
fire, which was nearly accomplished in the lamp of the ancients and the
taper of the middle ages. The principal aim to-day of artificial illumi-
nation is this separation of light and heat, an end we are gradually
attaining, even though the time may still be distant when light will be
produced, at least for common use, without attendant heat effect.

The candle owed its origin to the development of chemical technology
in the early part of this century, by which solid fats, burning excel-
lently, are made from cheap raw materials, and by which new sub-
stances, such as paraffine, are separated from coal tar. Neither was
the oil lamp of the ancients neglected. The introduction of the hollow
wick by Count Argand in 1786 and of the chimney by the apothecary
Quinquet, of Paris, in 1765 were specially important, even if the sub-
Stitution of petroleum for rape seed and olive oil was necessary to
increase its efficiency to what it is to-day.

Gas lamps mark the transition to illuminating gas. In these the very
volatile products of the dry distillation of tar, e. g., ligroin, benzine,
petroleum, ether, etc., are first vaporized, and the resulting vapor is
burned. Hydrogen gas passed through petroleum gives an excellent
iluminating gas. ;

The ordinary illuminating gas, which was utilized in England as early

‘as 1792, was not introduced into Germany until more than thirty years

later. It was formed by heating bituminous coal in retorts to a red
heat in the absence of air. The escaping gases, after being thoroughly
276 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

cleaned by washing, ete., are collected in large receivers and maintained
under pressure, by means of which they are distributed to consumers
through iron pipes. Illuminating gas, or ‘“‘ philosophical light,” as one
of the first producers called it in his ecstatic joy, is therefore coal gas.
That which remains of the coal in the retort is coke.

Looked upon at first as a wonder, illuminating gas seemed destined
to entirely supplant tallow and oil. But it was not thus. It rather
formed an incentive to improve the existing sources of illumination so
that they could compete with it.

In the same manner the introduction of the electric light has not
been a deathblow to gas, but has given it brighter life in the shape of
Auer’s incandescent gas light, and, as the discovery of acetylene shows,
there are still further successes “ease ble.

Every system of illumination has its individual anonlbaniiies and
especial advantages, which justify its existence and its worth. For
this reason it is not easy to estimate the relative values of the various
kinds of illumination unless the comparison be made on the rather
unsatisfactory basis of the price per candlepower; that is, by making
photometry the supreme judge.

MEASUREMENT OF CANDLEPOWER.
It is a comparatively simple matter to determine by photometry the
relative intensity of the light emitted by two sources. All it requires

background, since less light is reflected from the greased paper than —

from the ungreased portion of the screen. On the other hand, if the

source L alone is active, the grease spot appears bright on a dark

background. If both sources are active at the same time the effect

will be similar to the above cases according to whether R sends more
or less light, respectively, to the screen than L.!

The luminous intensity produced at the screen depends, firstly, on

the intensity of the source or its candlepower, and secondly, on the

distance of the source from the screen, so that the intensity diminishes

1'This is on the assumption that the screen and the grease spot on it satisfy certain
conditions. For these and for the bibliography see O. Lummer and E. Brodhun:

doubled, trebled, quadrupled, ete. By regulating the distance R F and
L F the grease spot then can be made to disappear as well as by vary-

ing the intensity of the sources. In this case the ratio ce gives

directly the ratio of the candlepower of L to that of R. (Compare
note on page 276.)

In Germany the luminous intensities of all sources are expressed in
terms of that of a Hefner-Alteneck lamp; e. g., gaslight is said to
have an intensity of a certain number of the above units. Measure-
ments of this kind are made in the Physikalisch-Technischen Reichsan-
stalt in Charlottenburg, and are officially certified to. Instead of the
Bunsen photometer, above described, a more exact and more easily
manipulated photometer is used. This was designed by E. Brodhun
and myself and was constructed according to our specifications by Fr.
Sehmidt & Haensch, Berlin. It differs from Bunsen’s principally in
that the grease spot is replaced by a purely optical device by means of
which the “ideal grease spot” is realized, one which transmits all the
incident light and reflects none. [Experiment. |

By means of this device, and on account of the better definition of
the ideal grease spot in comparison with Bunsen’s, the accuracy of pho-
tometric measurements is much increased. I can not dwell on this
point, but let it suffice to say that by means of the Lummer-Brodhun
photometer the intensity of a source can with ease be determined to
one fourth per cent of its value.

SOURCES OF ILLUMINATION ARRANGED ON A PHOTOMETRIC BASIS
IN ORDER OF THEIR RELATIVE COST.

If we know in addition to the intensity of a light its price per hour
of use, we have a measure of its relative economic value.

In the following table you will find interesting data concerning the
price per unit intensity (1 unit = 1 Hefner lamp) per hour of the vari-
ous kinds of illumination most used at present, on the basis of the
assumptions made, as stated in the table.

278 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

According to this table, the Welsbach light is cheapest; next comes
the are light; then follow in order the light of a petroleum lamp, are
light with ground-glass globe, ordinary gas light as furnished by an
Argand burner, acetylene light, incandescent electric light, and finally
gas light as obtained from the fish-tail burners, which are in most com-
mon use. <A candle, as you perhaps all know, is even at the present
time an article of luxury.

It must be admitted that this arrangement is quite arbitrary, as it is .
based on the average market price of materials, etc. For example,
electric light is decidedly cheaper when supplied by a private installa-
tion and if the machines are always loaded to their full capacity. A
plant of at least 100 horsepower can supply power at the price of 24
to 3 cents per kilo-watt-hour; for smaller plants this becomes 5 or 6
cents. In the first case the are light would be the cheapest, and the
electric incandescent light would come third.

This order of value is entirely upset when we consider other condi-
tions besides the question of cheapness as influencing the value.
According to the purposes which a light is to serve these conditions
are very different. Kor example, the very cheap arc light can not for
one moment be considered for illuminating dwelling rooms, for it is not
sufficiently divisible, and similarly the relatively more expensive incan-
descent electric light far surpasses the incandescent gas light on account
of its enormous sanitary advantages.

Part II.
THE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LIGHT.

The consideration of these secondary actions of a gas flame intro-
duces us to the second part of our subject, which deals with the nature
of the different kinds of light and with the physical processes involved.
In the third part I will try to elucidate the physical laws connecting
the luminous intensity of a body with its temperature and with its
nature, on which factors the intensity of a source of light depends.
We will divide sources of illumination into two classes, namely, those
in which the luminosity is produced by highly heating a body and those
which produce the sensation of light at a relatively low temperature—
cold flames, fluorescence, and others of that character.

In the first class we must distinguish between free-burning flames,
such as a candle, a petroleum lamp, a gas flame, and an acetylene lamp,
and electric lights—that is, according to the manner in which the
luminous bodies are brought to incandesence.

Although my lecture will deal principally with the theory of lumi-
nosity produced by high temperatures, since this alone is the basis of
all the sources of light in common use, I can not omit reference to the
‘‘cold flames” as long as they point out the direction in which we must
look for the light of the future.
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 279

So-called ‘cold flames.”—To these belong all those free-burning flames,
such as that of carbon bisulphide, which emits a bluish, weakly light
even at the relatively low temperature of 150° C. The classical repre-
sentatives of this class are, however, the lightning bug and the will-o’-
the-wisp. ‘The phosphoresence at sea is also included in this class.
Those who have not yet seen this natural phenomenon can form no idea
of its magnificence, especially in southern seas. As soon as night falls
and the stars appear in the heavens bright spots begin to glisten in the
water, first only here and there at the bow of the ship; these increase
in numbers; they come and go; they enlarge almost without limit,
until finally spiral strands of gold seem to rise from the depths, often
condensing to large nuggets.

This phosphorescence is also produced by living organisms, for bil-
lions of infusoria unite their weak light to produce the magnificent
effect. Its origin is as unknown to us as that of the faint light emitted
by wood in the process of rotting and other phenomena which have
become generally known since the discovery of the X-rays. I refer to
the luminosity of gases in Geissler tubes.

You are all familiar with the action of the Ruhmkorff coil used so
much in medicine for the treatment of partial muscular paralysis, ete.
If an electric current from such a coil—that is, one of high tension and
high frequency—is sent through a highly exhausted Geissler tube, the
residual gas shines with a magic blue-violet light. [Experiment.| By
touching the tube we can assure ourselves that its temperature is not
high. The peculiar striation of the light in the neighborhood of the
electrode is an indication of the presence of a rarefied gas. In this
second Geissler tube we have, in addition to the light emitted by the
gas, the colored light of the glass, and especially at those parts of the
tube made of uranium glass. We say that the glass fluoresces, with-
out attempting to give an explanation of the curious phenomenon.
Now, if a Geissler tube is still further exhausted the stratification of
the glass becomes more indistinct and the luminosity of the gas finally
ceases entirely.' Curious rays (cathode rays) radiate from the cathode—
_ that is, from the negative terminal of the circuit—into the almost
completely exhausted interior of the tube.

We can not see these rays, but they can be made visible by placing
in their path fluorescent materials. In this tube asbestus is caused to
fluoresce. [Hxperiment.] In this second tube the glass fluoresces at
those parts on which the cathode rays impinge. You can plainly see
the green surface of the glass wall which is turned toward you, and
within this surface is a dark cross. That is the shadow produced by
the screening of these mysterious cathode rays by a metal cross in the
interior of the tube. If this latter is overturned the shadow disappears
and the whole surface shines brilliantly. But the phenomenon appears

''This tube is called by the lecturer a Hittorf tube, but is similar to that commonly
known in America as a Crooke’s tube. (Translator. )
280 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

still more wonderful if I move a magnet along the tube. You can see
that the shadow of the cross moves with the motion of the magnet,
showing that the cathode rays are deflected by a magnet.' Only those
parts of the tube fluoresce to which I thus direct the cathode rays. If
I introduce into a Hittorf tube in the neighborhood of the cathode a bar
magnet, the cathode rays begin to rotate about the pole of the magnet
and the fluorescence glides in a circle around the magnet along the
sides of the tube. [Experiment.] In a similar manner it has been found
by difficult experiments that cathode rays can be reflected, ete. But as
long as they were confined it was difficult to get atthem. Great prog-
ress was made when Lenard discovered a method of enticing the cath-
ode rays out of the tube. Hertz had found that the cathode rays pass
through aluminum witb relative ease. Lenard constructed a Hittorf
tube with an opening at one end sealed air tight by a piece of sheet
aluminum one-hundredth of a millimeter in thickness. On exhausting
this tube Lenard found that substances placed in front of the alumi-
num window could be made to fluoresce. In addition, these Lenard
rays showed almost the same peculiarities which made the X-rays,
discovered later, known to the whole civilized world. There was only
one fault to be found with them—their intensity was diminished by
passing through the aluminum and their action was therefore weak.

How superior in this respect to the Lenard rays are the X-rays dis-
covered by W.C.Réntgen. No window is needed for these. They
radiate freely from those portions of the tube on which the cathode
rays fall, into the exterior space, and pitilessly destroy photographic
plates which are placed as obstructions in their paths, however care-
fully they may be protected from the action of ordinary light. It is
remarkable that they should have remained undiscovered so long and
that they should have been discovered by happy accident. These
Roéntgen rays after an existence of hardly a year have already been so
well known that I will confine myself to showing you the latest form
of X-ray tube of the firm of Siemens & Halske, which is so constructed
that the vacuum can be regulated at will. A screen coated witk
barium platino-cyanide is so brightly illuminated as to be visible in the
farthest part of the hall. We now introduce between the X-ray tube
and the screen a wooden block 10 centimeters in thickness (4 inches).
On this is nailed a cross made of sheet lead, and you can probably all
see the shadow of this cross on the screen, while the wood, although
thirty times as thick, only gives the suggestion of a shadow. After
the lecture, however, you can individuatly convince yourselves of the
efficiency of these tubes. If the radiations are passed through a human
body the beating of the heart and the motion of the diaphragm in
breathing can be plainly observed. ®

The Réntgen rays owe their immense popularity to their ability of

‘Professor Goldstein has discovered cathode rays which are not affected by mag-
nets.
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 281

penetrating flesh about a hundred times more easily than bones or
metallic substances, aluminum excepted, and in this they have found
their widest application. We can not help admiring this wonderful
quality, whether the rays are an entirely new kind of longitudinal
ether waves, or whether, as is more probable, they are merely trans-
verse ether waves just like ordinary light waves, although of a very
minute wave length, so that they may easily pass between the mole-
cules of substances of moderate density. Let us rejoice that they
have helped suffering mankind in their application to surgery, and let
us hope that they will point out to science new lines of investigation.
In all these experiments the electric current of the Ruhmkorff coil was
conducted directly through the electrodes into the interior of the
exhausted tube. If alternating electric currents of millions of alter-
nations per second are used, so-called electrical oscillations such as are
produced by the discharge of a Leyden jar or condenser, the Geissler
tube shines brightly even if it is only held near the wire without any
metallic connection whatever with it. The name of Nicola Tesla, an
American, will be permanently associated with these phenomena, since
he was the first to carry out experiments in this field on a large scale.
The light effects produced by ‘electrical oscillations” are especially
distinguished in that by means of them nearly the whole of the elec-
trical energy supplied is transformed into light. H. Ebert conducted
high frequency currents of a definite periodicity to a tube in the inte-
rior of which a specially selected fluorescent substance was placed.
By the fluorescence produced by the cathode rays he obtained a lumin-
osity of about one-thirtieth of a Hefner unit by an expenditure of one-
millionth of a watt. The total energy consumed was about one-two-
thousandth of that of a Hefner lamp. We have here realized very
nearly an ideal artificial illumination, and with justice Ebert calls his
lamp ‘the lamp of the future,” although, on account of the technical
difficulties involved and the small luminosity, it may be a long time
before these lamps will be able to compete with those now used.

LUMINOSITY DUE TO HIGH TEMPERATURES.

The transition from luminosity at low to that at high temperatures is
found in the ghost-like glowing observed in the dark during the slow
oxidization of some substances—for example, phosphorus. This action
is not really a combustion. Oxidation and combustion are essentially
similar to each other; in both there is a combination of the substance
with oxygen. But while the oxidation can take place at relatively low
temperatures, ignition and combustion occur only at relatively high
temperatures.

The development of heat from light which takes place in every fire,
in every freely-burning flame, in a candle, a lamp, etc., is therefore
nothing more than an oxidation or combustion; that is, the combination
of a substance with oxygen at a high temperature.
282 LIGHT AND IFS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

THE PROCESS OF COMBUSTION.

Substances like rocks, which have no affinity for oxygen, do not
oxidize, do not burn, and furnish nolight and heat. But what a strong
affinity do carbon, hydrogen, and the hydrocarbons manifest for all-
consuming oxygen! When these elements are brought together there
is a great development of heat attended most frequently by light
effects.

If hydrogen is burned alone, water vapor is formed—that is, the com-
bination of hydrogen and oxygen. [Experiment showing the oxy-
hydrogen blowpipe.] If pure carbon is used, as when a diamond is
burned, carbon dioxide is ordinarily formed, although poisonous carbon
monoxide is formed with an insufficient supply of air. Both reactions
take place simultaneously in all free-burning flames in which chemical .
compounds of carbon and hydrogen, so-called hydrocarbons, combine
with oxygen. The most commonly used illuminating materials, as
oils, tallow, fats, stearine, and wax consist principally of hydrocar-
bons and burn under favorable conditions. In order that oxygen may
combine with hydrogen and carbon with the development of light, the
combustible substance must both be in a gaseous state and be heated
to a high temperature. In the case of the gas flame the works furnish
the gaseous hydrocarbons, while the match supplies the necessary heat
for ignition. The hot gas is then immediately attacked by the oxygen
of the surrounding air with the formation of carbon dioxide and noncom-
bustible water vapor. The heat produced is sufficient to heat the gas
which follows so that this also can burn, and this action continues as
long as gas escapes from the burner and as long as the surrrounding
air contains sufficient oxygen. The processes involved in every com-
bustion are similar to those involved in the production of illuminating
gas on a large scale. Every fire is the luminous effect of a gas under-
going the process of combustion. Every flame is a gas flame, and
many other sources of light, petroleum lamps, candles, etc., are there-
fore miniature gas works. P

Let us for a few moments consider the candle which, notwithstanding ~
its modest appearance, is a small miracle, and whose importance is indi-
cated by the fact that it forms the subject of six lectures by the cele-
brated English physicist, Faraday. The heat furnished by the match
takes the place of the fire under the retort in the gas works. The
stearine melts, rises in the wick, and is also vaporized by the heat of
the match, in the same manner as coal is made into gas in the retorts
by the heat of the fire beneath. The process of combustion from here
on is that described above, the hot hydrocarbon gas produced at the
end of the wick unites with the oxygen of the air, while the heat devel-
oped heats the gas which follows previous to its combustion. If all
these processes are to be continuous and harmonious, as is the case with
a candle which burns well and does not drip, we can not help admiring
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 283

it as a small work of art. This involves a proper adjustment of the
rate at which the material melts, the rate at which the molten material
is vaporized, and the rate at which the vapor thus developed is
consumed.

The proper burning of a luminous flame depends principally on the
rate at which air is supplied. If the wick is too large or too small the
candle does not burn regularly; it either smokes or gives an insuffi-
cient quantity of light. You all understand what is meant by saying
that a lamp “smokes.” Under those circumstances the wick is too
large, the amount of gas developed is too great for the air supply, and
clouds of smoke are formed. If the flame is reduced by screwing down
the wick the smoking ceases, but even then the carbon is not entirely
consumed. With an insufficient air supply all the carbon particles
can not be satisfied with oxygen. This is fortunate for us, for the un-
combined particles of carbon are heated to incandescence by the hot
carbon dioxide.

A flame can not emit light unless it contains uncombined solid parti-
cles in an incandescent state. If I mix illuminating gas with air
before combustion and ignite the mixture the flame no longer shines
brightly, but gives forth a weak blue-violet light. [Experiment.| The
explanation is that in such a mixture the oxygen can combine with all
the carbon particles so that the flame contains no solid particles at
all, for to these alone a flame owes its luminosity. Transparent gases
heated ever so high hardly emit any light and hence the weak luminos-
ity of a Bunsen flame.

One consequence of the combustion of all the carbon contained in
illuminating gas is the increase of the temperature of the flame, since
there are no foreign particles to be heated as in the ordinary flame. In
the Bunsen flame all the carbon contributes to the heat developed,
while in a light-giving flame less carbon is burned in the first place,
and this uncombined carbon abstracts heat from the hot products of
combustion in the second place. The Bunsen flame is therefore hotter
than the ordinary gas flame. But on this account it emits less light.

In order to make it luminous it is necessary to introduce in it incom-
bustible materials. You see how brilliantly a piece of sheet platinum
shines on being placed in a Bunsen flame. [Experiment.| If it is
introduced into the still hotter oxyhydrogen flame it is heated to white-
ness and then melts. [Experiment.| By substituting for the platinum
an infusible substance, such as lime, chalk, or magnesia, a dazzling

light is produced which illumines the whole hall. [Experiment.]
Brighter still than this so-called Drummond’s lime light is the zirco-
nium light, in which zirconium is burned in the oxyhydrogen flame.
The intensity of ordinary gas flame can not be compared with that pro-
duced by solid substances in an incandescent state. It was therefore
a great step in advance in the art of illumination when Mr. Auer von
Welsbach succeeded in producing greater luminosity in a gas flame in
284 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

a similar manner to that in the lights just mentioned, by placing a
mantle of incombustible material in the very hot but nonluminous
Bunsen flame, thus bringing the mantle to incandescence. [Experi-
ment.| If the maximum luminosity is to be obtained, the incandescent
body must satisfy many theoretical conditions; especially, it must not
reduce the temperature of the products of combustion and must emit
as much light as possible corresponding to its temperature. Auer’s
invention is not new in principle, and indeed had been anticipated in
practice. For instance, it is said that the streets of Nantes were illu-
minated by incandescent gaslights in which a mantle was brought to
incandescence in the hottest part of a Bunsen flame. The reason that
these lamps were so soon relegated to forgetfulness was entirely due to
the nature of the mantle, which was made of platinum wire instead of
the material Auer used. This example illustrates once more how the
very best principle can fail, and must fail if ignorantly and improperly
applied. In order to understand the superiority of the Auer light over
the ordinary gaslight and the related questions, why does one source of
light emit more light than another,
and how does the increase of tem-
perature influence the intensity, we
must first familiarize ourselves with
two fundamental physical laws known
as Stefan’s law of radiation and Kir-
choff’s law of the absorption and
emission of light. Before doing this
however, I will briefly consider the
other sources of light commonly
employed.

A new addition has recently been
made to the free-burning flames,
namely, the much-renowned and now
almost notorious acetylene light.
Director Schultz-Hencke was kind enough to place at my disposal for
this evening a generating apparatus which you see before you. |Experi-
ment.| Figure 2 shows its construction. It is built like an ordinary
gasometer, the outer vessel G G is partly filled with water, through
which the tube R hk, provided with a cock h, extends above the level of
the water. In the outer vessel is contained a second vessel P P, which
carries suspended from the lid in the interior a basket K containing
about 200 grams of calcium carbide. The cylinder P P floating on the
water sinks by gravity as soon as the cock at H is opened, and the
inclosed air escapes through the tube R. But as soon as P P has sunk
So deep that the calcium carbide is brought into contact with the water,
acetylene gas is produced, and a very explosive mixture of air and
acetylene gas escapes from the burner }. Nevertheless, I apply a
burning match to the burner. The gas is finally ignited and burns

Fig. 2.
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 285

with increasing brightness, while the cylinder P P sinks with the
basket K into the water; that is, with diminishing air content of the
gas. Finally only pure acetylene gas escapes, and you are no doubt
surprised at the fullness of the white light which fills the dark hall.
But in this flame, as in the others, the luminosity is due to uncombined
carbon particles, though judging from the color of the light, the
temperature is far in excess of that of the ordinary gas flame.

The question may be asked, why does not the mixture of air and
acetylene first issuing from the burner explode? The answer is, that
the heat from the match can not penetrate through the narrow aper-
ture of the burner and through the long tube R into the interior of the
cylinder PP, otherwise a violent explosion would surely have taken
place; for all combustible vapors mixed with air are extremely explo-
sive and are similar in their action to gunpowder. If a spark comes in
contact with them the ignition spreads rapidly from the given point
through the whole mixture. The enormous increase in volume thereby
produced exerts a sudden pressure correspondingly large on the inclo-
sure which, therefore, bursts if it is not able to withstand the pressure
to which it is thus subjected. [Experiment.]

The apparently empty space in this bottle, containing a small quan-
tity of petroleum, similar to the reservoir of a nearly empty petroleum
lamp, is filled with petroleum vapors mixed with air. I ignite the
mixture by means of an electric spark and you hear the report pro-
duced by the blowing out of the cork stopper. In blowing out a lamp
care must be taken not to turn down the wick too far, so that no open-
ing into the interior of the petroleum reservoir is produced, through
which the flame can enter when being extinguished. It is best to cut
off the air supply by covering the wick with a cap which can be manip-
ulated from without. At all events the flame should not be turned
down too low before it is blown out.

That which makes acetylene gas so dangerous is its property of
spontaneously exploding at a pressure of only two atmospheres. By
exerting a greater pressure on the reservoir PP, as I now do (experi-
ment), this alone will suffice to produce an explosion.

NATURE OF ELECTRIC LIGHTS.

In electric lights the light is produced by incandescent carbon just
as itis in freely burning flames. In the electric incandescent light a
carbon filament (for instance, of carbonized bamboo fiber with chem-
ically precipitated carbon) serves to carry an electric current, and in
consequence of the resistance which it offers to the current it becomes
heated. In the electric arc light the current passes between two rods
of retort carbon through an air space, under which conditions an
electric arc is formed in this space and the ends of the carbon rods are
heated to the temperature of volatilization of carbon. In this respect
electric lights are similar to gas flames, for in both highly heated carbon
286 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

is the source of the luminosity. But while in all flames, and also in
the incandescent gaslight, the heating of the carbon or the mantle is
produced by the heat developed in the combustion of the gas, in
electric lights the heat of combustion of coal or of gas serves first for
the production of electric energy, which can be transmitted over con-
siderable distances and which, far from the furnace, heats up the fila-
ment of the incandescent lamp or the carbons of the are lamp to a
white heat. Naturally a considerable quantity of energy is lost in this
roundabout process. For while in a gas flame the heat energy of the
gas is directly transformed into light, with electric lights, for which,
for example, the power is originally supplied by a gas motor, the gas
first sets in motion the gas motor, this in turn drives the dynamo, and
finally the electric current thus produced brings the carbon to incan-
descence. Only a few per cent of the heat of combustion of the fuel
reappear as light. For this reason, however, this roundabout process
furnishes most acceptable light. In it only the power absolutely neces-
sary for heating the carbon filament is conducted into the room, while
the noxious products of combustion of coal, of petroleum, of gas, etc.,
are taken care of in the electric power house. In the incandescent
electric lights the only heat introduced into the room is that necessary
for raising the temperature of the filament and which the filament
radiates in the form of light and heat.

The gas flame, the petroleum light, the candle, in short, all gaslights
in the broadest sense of the word necessitate very much greater heat
effects. In all of them there is a continuous current of the products
of combustion, together with the carbon particles producing incan-
descence. In order to maintain around the flame the high temperature
required for the incandescence of the carbon particles a large space
must be brought to a high temperature. All parts of the flame, the
chimney of the lamp, and the surrounding air must become hot if the
combustion temperature of the gas is to reach its highest value, and
thus enable the carbon particles or the incandescent mantle to radiate
most efficiently. The heat carried off by the products of combustion
is partly utilized in the regenerative burner of Fr. Siemens, in which
the gas supplied to the burner is first heated by these hot gases. We
can thus see why all flames are attended by the evolution of large
quantities of heat. But, unfortunately, the flame emits not only heat.
The most important product of combustion is carbon dioxide, which is
produced at the expense of the oxygen of the air, and with which,
together with other noxious gases (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide,
etc.), the air becomes charged.

This harmful action accompanies the ordinary gaslight as well as
the incandescent gaslight, although in the latter it is much less for
the same candle power. While the electric light is much more expen-
sive than the incandescent gaslight on account of the very poor return
for the heat of combustion of the fuel, its advantages over the free-
burning flame is very great from a sanitary standpoint. By giving
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 287

proper consideration to these secondary actions of the different sources
of light it is surprising that, in the choice between the two kinds, the
consideration of cheapness plays such an important role. In addition,
the danger of an explosion is entirely excluded in an electric light, and,
moreover, the process of turning it on is an exceedingly simple one.

Having considered the nature and performance of the sources of
illumination in common use, we will proceed to the third part of our
subject, in which we will familiarize ourselves with the physical reasons
why the intensity and color of different lights is so different, and in
which we will discuss the factors on which the luminosity of a source
of light depends.

Parr IIl.
THE PHYSICAL LAWS OF LUMINOSITY.

The radiation of light and heat.—The sensation of light is purely sub-
jective, as has already been pointed out. A pressure on the eye is
sufficient to produce it, but ordinarily it is produced by ether waves
penetrating to the retina and there producing the sensation.

A source of light—the sun, for example—excites the optic nerve.
The same ray of sunlight falling on our skin and evoking the sensation
of warmth would produce in the eye the sensation of light and would
decompose the sensitive silver salts of a photographic plate. We
therefore speak of ‘“‘heat rays,” “light rays,” and “ actinic rays” corre-
sponding to these three different effects, although the three kinds of
rays correspond to motions of the ether, differing principally in their
periods of oscillation. Every luminous solid emits ether waves of all
possible wave lengths, of which only those of a length between four
ten-thousandths and eight ten-thousandths millimeter can affect the
optic nerve. The existence of the other waves can not be demon-
strated by the eye, but can be determined by sensitive physical appa-
ratus. [Experiment.] A spectrum is produced on the distant screen
by the light emitted by zirconium heated in the oxyhydrogen blow-
pipe. The spectrum is similar to the rainbow, produced by the refrac-
tion of sun rays inrain drops. Every color of the spectrum corresponds
to ether waves of a definite wave length, the wave length decreasing
continuously from the red to the blue. This visible spectrum, however,
embraces only a small portion of the waves emitted by the zirconium
light. Both to the left of the red and to the right of the blue there
are ether waves the existence of which can be demonstrated. The
former, in the infrared, are called heat rays, for their existence can be
shown by sensitive thermometers, such as the radiometer, the thermo.
pile, the bolometer, etc., while the latter, the ultraviolet rays, are
called chemical rays, on account of their photographic activity. They
all agree, however, in that they carry with them a definite quantity of
energy which is transformed into heat when intercepted by a ther-
mometer. In this respect all the rays emitted by a luminous body are
“heat rays,” although the energy corresponding to the violet and the
288 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

ultraviolet rays is very small compared with that of the red and infra-
red rays. The heat emitted by a candle at a distance of 1 meter would
raise the temperature of 1 gram of water, hardly a thimbleful, by only
1° ©. in one and one-fourth years, provided it could be stored for that
length of time. This will give you some notion of the extreme sensi-
tiveness of the eye for light rays. But nevertheless it takes a definite
quantity of energy, a very small quantity, to produce the sensation of
light. Hence a body radiating light waves of this intensity just begins
to become visible. This incipient incandescent state begins at a rela-
tively high temperature in the sources of light commonly used. It is
not that these waves are not present at lower temperatures, but their
energy is too small to affect the optic nerve. Just as soon as the crit-
ical temperature is passed, the heated body becomes luminous and its
brightness increases rapidly with increasing temperature. The amount
of energy producing the sensation of light is however a minute fraction
of the total energy radiated by the body. ‘This total radiation obeys
definite laws in respect to its increase with the temperature, and so
does that portion of it which affects the eye. Before considering these
laws, let us first see how these two kinds of radiation can be separated.

Separation of heat radiation from light radiation.—I have here a strip
of sheet platinum through which an electric current of any strength
up to 100 amperes can be transmitted. [Experiment.|
The current heats the strip, and as it increases the
temperature of the metal increases until it finally begins
to glow, and by a still further increase it is heated to
intense whiteness and then melts. Before it begins to
glow it nevertheless emits energy, for the heat radiated
by it can readily be felt by placing the hand near it. In
order to show this development of heat to all of you
I make use of a so-called “differential thermometer”

Kees (fig. 3). It consists of two glass bulbs connected by a
tube ach, which contains a quantity of liquid separating the air in the
two bulbs. This liquid column is displaced when either bulb is heated.
On the projection screen you see an enlarged image of one of the liquid
surfaces. As soon as I bring up the platinum strip, through which the
current is passing, to one of the bulbs previously coated with lampblack,
the level of the liquid immediately begins to change, although the plati-
num is not emitting visible radiations. The ether waves emitted are
simply absorbed by the lampblack and transformed into heat, which is
imparted to the inclosed air. This expands, and the liquid is forced
over into the other bulb.

The higher the temperature of the platinum the more rapidly does
the air of the differential thermometer expand when the platinum is
brought near it. Now it glows with dull redness, and the level of
the liquid is displaced beyond the limits of the screen. But as soon as
a glass plate, or still better a vessel containing water, is interposed

LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 289

between the bulb of the thermometer and the platinum, the level of
the liquid returns to its original position. This shows that glass and
water absorb the whole of the heat emitted by the glowing platinum.
Our method is not sensitive enough to detect the light radiations
transmitted through the water when the platinum is heated to white-
ness, but this can, however, be very easily measured by a sensitive
bolometer. As soon as the vessel is removed, the level of the liquid
changes rapidly.

The property of absorbing heat rays and of freely transmitting light
rays is utilized in the construction of glass windows. Although long
unknown to man, they separate, for his comfort, warmth and light,
preventing the escape of the heat of the room from within and pre-
venting the penetration of cold from without, while they transmit
sunlight almost undiminished.

On the same property depends the action of clouds in retaining the
heat of the earth. Impenetrable for the long heat waves, the clouds
prevent the earth from radiating its warmth received from the sun
during the day into infinite space and thus protect it from loss of heat.
Without this moist blanket the earth would lose enormous quantities
of heat by radiation during the long, starry, winter nights, and thus a
strong cooling would take place. The fact that our eye is insensitive
to waves of great wave length is due to the absorptive action of
liquids. The infra-red rays are simply absorbed by the lens and
aqueous humor of the eye before they reach the retina. According
to Darwin, this indicates that our eye is modeled after that of the
Amphibia. For these, the absorption of the infra-red rays by the
eye is of small importance, for they have already been absorbed by
the upper layers of the water, in whose depths their eyes must still
be able to see.

From the experiment you have just seen we recognize that the tran-
sition from a nonluminous to a luminous body, or better, from one
radiating heat to one radiating light and actinic rays, is in reality
determined by a sufficient increase of its temperature. It matters not
how its temperature be increased, whether by the electric current or by
the direct application of heat, a material heated electrically or in a
furnace begins to glow at the same temperature.

Moreover, the luminosity of a hot body is a secondary properties tone
might almost say an accidental property. If it were not for the eye
the luminous state could only be distinguished from the nonluminous
in that the energy of the different waves is not the same. This is not
surprising when we consider that the heat residing in a body, and on
which its temperature depends, consists solely in the energy of motion
of its molecules; that is, of its smallest mechanically conceivable parts.

DEAT IS MOTION.

It was long supposed that a heated body emitted a subtle material
in the same way as it was supposed that light was a material substance.
sm 97——19
290 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

We now know, thanks to the researches of Rumford, Joule, Mayer,
and Helmholtz, that heat and molecular motion are identical, and that
the greater this molecular motion the greater is the temperature of the
body. By hammering, drilling, etc., the materials operated on finally
become so hot that they can not be touched without burning the
fingers.

The work performed by our muscles in hammering a piece of lead is
partly transformed into heat and thus applied to increasing its tem-
perature. The motion of the hammer has been transformed into the
motion of the molecules of the lead. This transformation of work
into heat follows definite laws, so that a definite quantity of heat is
equivalent to a definite amount of work done. The law of the ‘“‘mechan-
ical equivalent of heat” states the numerical relation of one to the
other. In nature, where a certain quantity of heat appears to have
been lost in the transformation—as, for example, in the production of
electric light—it certainly reappears somewhere in the process as heat;
that is, as an increase in temperature. The law of the conservation of
energy expresses the recognition of this fact.

Every body in nature must then be considered as consisting of mole-
cules in a state of rapid motion. Solids, liquids, and gases only differ
in the nature of the motion. If a solid is heated to a sufficiently high
temperature it is finally transformed into the liquid or ‘gaseous state.
Even carbon evaporates at 3,600° C. Corresponding to this increase
in temperature, the motion of the molecules becomes more and more
rapid and the energy of the ether waves emitted increases with it. All
apparatus which can absorb heat—our skin, a thermopile, a bolometer,
ete.—indicate how rapidly the radiation of a body increases with
increasing temperature. By means of our differential thermometer we
can show the increase of the radiation of the electrically heated plati-
num strip with its temperature. The law involving this relation for
solids was first stated by Stefan, and was deduced by theory for a
so-called “black” body by Boltzmann. If we call the total radiation
of the body the sum total of the energy corresponding to all the ether
waves emitted, and if we call the absolute temperature of a body its
temperature on the Centigrade scale, increased by 273°, Stefan’s law
of radiation may be stated as follows: The total radiation is propor-
tional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.

An example will make this law plainer. Let a body at 27° C. be
heated to a temperature of 327° C., i.e., from an absolute temperature
of 273° + 27° = 300° to one of 273° 4 327° = 600°, thus doubling the
absolute temperature of the body; but if the absolute temperature is
doubled the total energy emitted is increased, according to Stefan’s
law, 2‘ or 16 times. If the absolute temperature is trebled the total
radiation is increased 3* or 81 times, etc. You will thus recognize how
rapidly the energy of radiation increases with increasing temperature.
I must not omit to state that the energy maximum of the whole spec-
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION, 291

trum is displaced from the red end toward the violet. If the energy of
certain ether waves is great enough they affect the eye as light and
the body emitting them is “self-luminous.” We can now distinguish
between sources of heat and sources of light—between heat radiation
and light radiation. Objectively both kinds of radiation are parts of
the total radiation emitted by the body. in the same manner as the
total radiation, the partial radiation must rapidly increase in intensity
with increasing temperature. The light radiated by an incandescent
body will therefore increase much more rapidly than the temperature.

To form a general notion of the relation between light radiation and
the temperature we will make use of a law recently proposed by Wien,
following in Boltzmann’s footsteps. The law reads as follows: ‘In the
norma! emission spectrum of a black body the energy maximum is so
displaced by the variations of the temperature that the product of the
temperature and wave length remains constant.” In connection with
Stefan’s law it states that the maximum energy in the normal spec-
trum is proportioned to the fifth power of the absolute temperature.
Basing our conclusions on both laws, we may certainly assume that the
light radiation increases still more rapidly with increasing temperature
than the total energy, since the energy maximum in highly heated bodies
is certainly in the visible part of the normal spectrum. Unfortunately
there are practically no experimental data on the relation between the
light radiation and the total radiation at different temperatures, and
we will therefore assume that light radiation as well as the maximum
energy in the normal spectrum is proportional to the fifth power of the
absolute temperature; that is, that the brightness of a luminous black
body—for instance, the carbon filament of an incandescent lamp—will
increase 2° or 32 times if its absolute temperature be doubled, or 3° or
243 times by trebling its absolute temperature.

Before we deduce the consequences of these laws we must discuss
whether they can be applied to the incandescent bodies used in prac-
tice. ‘To do this it will be necessary to familiarize ourselves with a law
which forms the basis of spectrum analysis and which has attained
widespread importance. I refertto Kirchhoff’s law of absorption and
emission of light, which states that a heated body at any temperature
emits only those particular rays which it absorbs at the very same tem-
perature. If we apply this law to bodies rendered luminous by high
temperatures it states that all those bodies are nonluminous, however
high the temperature, which either freely transmit the light rays or
which reflect them entirely instead of absorbing them. Highly heated
gases absorb no light and therefore do not emit any, as you can see in
the Bunsen flame. [Experiment.| Carbon absorbs a large proportion
of incident light even in an incandescent state. If heated to the same
temperature as a Bunsen flame it emits a correspondingly large amount
of light. All solid bodies and all metals exhibit a similar behavior.
These absorb to a greater or less degree waves of all wave lengths and
292 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

therefore emit waves of all wave lengths. Consequently they emit at
a sufficiently high temperature white light, since white light consists of
a mixture of light of all wave lengths. The absorptive power of an
incandescent body can therefore be determined by the light it emits,
and conversely, the color of the light emitted can be determined from
its absorption. The greenish color of the Welsbach light is most prob-
ably due to the selective absorption of green light by the material of
the mantle at its high temperature. In order to produce white light it
would be necessary to combine the substances now used in its con-
struction with materials which would be more partial to the red light.

Bodies which completely absorb all wave lengths at all tempera-
tures and therefore emit rays of all wave length are called “absolutely
black” bodies. In nature these ideal conditions are never realized,
and, moreover, the laws of Stefan and Wien apply only to them.
Nevertheless these properties are almost realized if the interior of a
hollow sphere is permitted to radiate through a small opening in its
wall.!

Experiments on the radiation of an absolutely black body are in
contemplation at the Reichs-anstalt, by which it is to be determined
how nearly carbon, the metals, and their oxides correspond to an
absolutely black body. It is, however, certain that the absolutely
black body is the only one which emits the maximum amount of energy
theoretically possible. It emits, therefore, other things being equal,
more light than any other substance. The absolutely black body
would be the first to evoke the sensation of light with gradually
increasing temperature and would emit light when metals, e. g., plati-
num, at the same temperature would still be nonluminous. The lumi-
nosity of a body, especially its first visible manifestation, depends also
to a great extent on the organ of sensation; therefore we must in
addition study the structure of the eye. But we will first take up the
study of the conditions under which heated bodies just begin to emit
light.

THE FIRST SIGNS OF LUMINOSITY OR HEATED BODIES (GRAY HEAT
AND RED HEAT).’

According to the modern theory of heat discussed above, we must
assume that a solid body, certainly a black body, emits waves of all
possible wave lengths, at all possible temperatures, and therefore even
at the ordinary temperature. At every temperature ether waves, of a
wave length corresponding to light waves, reach the retina of the eye.
These waves are, however, not recognized as light waves until the
energy accompanying them is great enough to affect the optic nerve.
Under these circumstances a body is said to emit both heat and light.

absolutely black body. Wied, Ann. d. Physik u. Chemie, 1895, Bd. 56, S. 451-456.

*The statements concerning gray heat and red heat mentioned in the lecture are
partly the results of some personal observations as yet unpublished.
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 293

If we gradually heat this platinum strip [experiment] you will see
that it first shines with a reddish light. This first stage of luminosity
is called red heat. Al solid substances which are incombustible at high
temperatures behave in the same manner as platinum. The tempera-
ture at which solids begin to glow was determined by Draper some fifty
years ago and was found by him to be about 525° C. Most solid
bodies, therefore, would have to be heated to an absolute temperature
of 273° + 525° or 800° before becoming self-luminous. In order that
the other wave lengths may affect the eye the temperature must be
increased very much above 525° C. The observations of Draper, that
solids first emit a red glow, were not contested for a long time, since
they agreed with ordinary daily experiences. I need only instance a
red hot poker, a very hot stove, etc. It was all the more interesting,
therefore, when W. F. Weber showed, some ten years ago, that the red
heat is not at all the first stage of luminosity.

On repeating the experiments of Draper in 1886, Weber carefully
excluded light from all external sources and observed that solid bodies
emit, at much lower temperatures than that corresponding to redness, a
foggy, grayish light. ‘The first trace of the grayish light appears to the
eye as an unsteady gleaming, flitting hither and thither. Its intensity
increases very rapidly with increasing temperature, while its appear-
ance changes from dim gray successively to ashen gray, a yellowish
eray, and finally to red. ‘To use Weber’s words, “ with the first appear-
ance of the redness the last trace of grayness disappeared, as also did
the unsteadiness, which has been prominent in all stages of gray heat.”

As might be deduced from Kirchhoft’s law, the redness as well as the
preliminary stage of luminosity begins at a temperature depending
upon the nature of the substance. In fact, investigations by R. Emden
show that gold begins to glow at 403° while platinum does not begin
until its temperature is 425° C.

Weber’s observations are specially interesting to me beeause they
seem to give us some explanation of the structure of the eye, and espe-
cially of the properties of the retinal elements (the rods and cones) and
of their functions in color sensation. Stenger first pointed out that
Weber’s experiments did not give any evidence concerning the physical
nature of the spectrum emitted by the body. I will show that these
queer and ghost-like phenomena of the “gray” light can only be
explained by attributing entirely different functions to the rods on the
one hand and to the cones on the other, considering them as two differ-
ent organs of sight, just as is done in modern physiology.

Based on the latest physiological researches of Hering, Hillebrand,
Ebbinghaus, Preyer, Brodhun, Tonn, and others, and based on the
theory of A. Konig! of the function of “visual purple” in sight, J. v.
Kries’ of Freiburg, suggested a theory of vision which easily explains

294 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

many contradictions in the observations hitherto made, and which
unfolds many new relations. According to this theory the cones pro-
duce the sensation of sight when the stimulus is very intense, and their
excitation produces in the brain a color sensation, while the rods repre-
sent the organs of a color-blind eye and make no distinction of color
whatever. If the intensity is very small the rods are at first only
affected and evoke in the brain an impression of light without color,
and thus increase the sensitiveness of the organ very greatly in the
dark. But as soon as the stimulus is sufficiently increased, the cones
are affected and the sensation of color is added to that of light.

Even Konig had assigned a special role to the rods in his color theory.
Based on the absorptive properties of ‘visual purple” for waves of all
wave lengths, Kénig drew the conclusion that the absence of color to
the normal eye in the spectrum, if its intensity is very small, and the
sense of sight of persons who are totally color blind, is essentially a
consequence of the decomposition of ‘“‘ visual purple.”! Since only the
rods are charged with “visual purple,” and since the cones do not
contain any, the rods are the only parts of the eye affected in colorless
vision of the normal eye when the intensity is very small, and are the
only elements that can be affected in total color blindness by any
luminous intensity. But while Konig draws the conclusion from his
experiments that the cones do not respond to blue light, since “ visual
yellow” or decomposed ‘visual purple” produces the sensation of blue,
Kries was led to the hypothesis that the cones are excited by light of
all colors without exception. Now there is on the retina a central por-
tion called the retinal depression or fovea centralis, on which there are
only cones and no rods, while on the rest of the retina both elements
are found; so that as we pass from the center outward the number of
rods increases in comparison with the number of cones, until near the
periphery the former outnumber the latter. Morevver, the fovea cen-
tralis is that portion of the retina corresponding to most distinct vision,
the part on which the image of an object which we wish to closely
scrutinize is focused.

In direct or foveal vision, therefore, the rods are not concerned at all,
while in indirect or ponpherl vision both the rods and cones are
excited. Therefore if the luminous intensity is small enough the rods
only are affected, producing the sensation of grayness, of light without
color. Long before physiologists had reached these conclusions com-
parative anatomists were led to the recognition that the rods of a
retina make it possible for an eye to see in the dark.

Zoologists, Max Schultze for example, as early as 1866 were aware
that animals such as the owl, which preys in the darkness, or the
mole, condemned to spend its life beneath the ground, were provided

'This kind of total color blindness for small intensities in normal eyes, discovered
and thoroughly investigated by Hering and Hillebrand in 1889, had already been
observed in 1873 by W. v. Bezold in connection with his investigations on the law of
color mixtures and the theory of color vision.
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 295

with rods even at the point of most distinct vision, where we have only
cones, and that there are even prowlers of the night which have only
rods on the retina and.uo cones whatever. Like the latter class of
animals, we see in the dark by the same retinal elements, and indeed
we are color-blind if the intensity of the light is too weak to excite the
cones. ;

The theory of Kries receives a new confirmation if applied to the
explanation of Weber’s experiments on the initial stages of luminosity
of bodies, and at the same time it throws a new light on these little-
understood phenomena.

Let us first deduce from the cry of Kries what phenomena should
be observed if a normal eye intently views the surface of a piece of
sheet platinum gradually heated by an electric current. Let us assume,
moreover, that the eye is directed to the center of the sheet, so that
not only the fovea centralis, but also the surrounding parts of the
retina, may be affected by the rays emitted. If the eye has been suffi-
ciently rested so that the rods have attained their maximum sensibility,
the latter are excited as soon as the platinum reaches a certain defi-
nite temperature (400° C., according to Weber), producing in the brain
the sensation of light without color, which increases in intensity rapidly
with increasing temperature. So long as the cones are not sensibly
affected, the foveal parts of the retina transmit no sensation to the
brain. This is attended to by those parts of the retina which are not
ordinarily involved in direct vision. The curious condition then arises
that we see something which we are not looking at, and therefore the
object thus seen escapes as soon as the eye is directed to it.

The sensation of gray is therefore produced by the rods, and can
only be produced by indirect vision. This easily explains the “unsteady
flitting about of the light” observed in all stages of the phenomenon by
Weber. It ceases as soon as the temperature, and therefore the inten-
sity, is increased to a sufficient amount to excite the cones. Then we
begin to see the glowing by direct vision, exactly as we are accus-
tomed to do, and the unsteady gray changes gradually into the reddish
glow observed. This transition occurs, according to Draper, at about
525° C,

The observed color depends partly on the size of the portion of the
retina producing the sensation. Each set of elements acts independ-
ently of the other in transmitting its intelligence to the brain, and
therefore the effect produced is a composite one.

If we assume that the cones first respond to yellowish-red waves, the
first color sensation would likely be a foggy red, changing gradually to
a reddish-yellow, just as Weber describes.

On account of the greater number of the cones, the rods, only
endowed with their greatest sensibility in the dark, lose their suprem-
acy with the increase of luminosity, and thus the color becomes more
and more fiery —600° C. corresponding to bright redness.
296 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

The phenomenon transpires quite differently if the observations are
made so that only the rods or only the cones can be affected. In the
first place, the intensity of the gray sensation would have to increase
with increasing temperature without ever passing to redness. We
might expect to observe this state if the radiations are confined to the
outer portions of the retina, where the rods predominate.

If, however, a very small surface be observed so that only the yellow
spot, where there are no rods, is affected, the gray stage would be entirely
eliminated, and the surface would, when first visible, appear red.

A few observations I have personally made verify on the whole these
deductions. It is very easy to show that a small platinum surface
heated electrically gives out a grayish light by indirect vision before it
is visible at all by direct vision. The following experiment will illustrate
this more clearly:

I look at a surface of molten niter (temperature 550° C.) through a
small hole in the cover of the bath. The conditions are such that very
close to the hole the whole surface is simultaneously visible, while at
greater distances the visible portion is limited by the size of the
opening.

In accordance with theory the reddish glow of the surface, seen from
the distance, assumes on approaching the eye a whitish appearance,
until finally there remains hardly a trace of color in the sensation pro-
duced.

The following experiment indicates the far greater sensitiveness of
the rods at small intensities. If a small opening in a hollow copper
sphere, heated to 600° C., is viewed by direct vision, it appears bright
red, corresponding almost to the radiation emitted by an absolutely
black body at the same temperature. But by directing the eye slightly
to one side the opening appears to emit the colorless, grayish light, and
assumes the appearance of the full moon in the heavens on a starry
night.

These experiments have been repeated, and their results confirmed
by Prof. E. Pringsheim.

PHYSICAL BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION OF SOURCES OF LIGHT.

As soon as the initial stages have been passed, the intensity increases
very rapidly with increasing temperature, at the same time taking on
more and more of a color such as is produced when we add to red yel-
low, then green, then blue, and finally violet. At a sufficiently high
temperature the light produces the sensation of white and the tem-
perature is called white heat. You can follow the various stages of
luminosity produced by gradually heating this strip of platinum up
to its melting point. [Experiment.] Immediately before melting, the
Strip emits a fullness of white light which makes this large hall almost
as bright as day. But nevertheless the temperature corresponding to
bright redness is a little less than half of that corresponding to white-

ness, for the melting point of platinum is about 2,000°, while the redness
corresponds to 800° on the absolute scale. If we assume Wien’s law
as expressing the increase in intensity with the temperature, the energy
emitted by platinum at the absolute temperature of 800° is to that at
2,000° as 800° is to 2,000°, i. e., roughly in the ratio of 1 to 100. The
mantle of an incandescent gas light is probably at about the same tem-
perature as that of melting platinum if we assume that it attains
the highest temperature of the flame. If we assume, in addition, that
thorium oxide radiates as much energy as platinum at the same tem-
perature, an assumption not altogether justifiable, the amount of light
emitted by a given area of the incandescent substance would have to
be equal in both cases. In reality thorium oxide corresponds more
nearly to a black body, in Kirchhoft’s sense of that word, and therefore
the former would radiate, ceteris paribus, more than the latter. The
experiment I will now show will teach us how much more light ferric
oxide radiates than polished platinum. I have written with ink a few
words on the piece of platinum, and I now heat it to incipient white-
ness by passing an electric current through it. I will project on the
screen the side of the strip on which I have written and you can plainly
see the words appear bright on a darker background. This shows that
the iron oxide left on heating the ink radiates much more light than
does the polished surface of the platinum at the same temperature.

By the assistance of our knowledge of the radiating power of lumi-
nous substances and of the temperature at which they become luminous
I can compare theoretically the intensities of different sources of light.
Unfortunately, considerable difficulties are met with in the measure-
ment of high temperatures. According to the latest measurement of
the radiation of the sun by Paschen its temperature is about 5,400° C.,
and according to Violle’s measurements the temperature of the electric
are is about 3,600° C. Assuming that the material of the sun radiates
light as well as carbon, the quantity of light emitted by a given area
in the two sources is in the ratio of 3° to 2°, or about as 8 is tol. Now
the sun subtends at the earth an angle of 32 minutes of are, and a sur-
face of a square centimeter in area would subtend about the same angle
at a distance of 1 meter. On the assumptions made we obtain the
result that the sun will illuminate a surface eight times as brightly as
an incandescent carbon surface 1 square centimeter in area at a tem-
perature of 3,600° (that of the electric arc) at a distance of i meter, or,
ceteris paribus, just as brightly as a surface of 8 square centimeters at
the same distance.

The results obtained by comparing sources of light in which the same
substance, for instance carbon, is brought to incandescence are more
reliable. To this class belong, besides all free burning flames, the
incandescent electric light and the are light. Since in all of these
the incandescent substance approximates a black body, their relative
temperatures can be determined by the color of the light emitted. The
298 LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION.

higher the temperature the whiter is the color of the light, since the
short violet rays are added to the long waves only at higher tempera-
tures. On the scale of whiteness, the are light come first; it is similar
in its composition and its appearance to sunlight. After this comes
the acetylene light, with its dazzling whiteness. Then comes the red-
dish-colored lights, such as the gas flame, the incandescent electric light,
the candle, and the petroleum lamp, and finally come the red lights,
such as the hearth fire. The absolute temperature of the arc, as stated
above, is about 3,600° C. That of the petroleum lamp is certainly below
2,000° and the melting point of platinum is, let us say, 1,500°- Then
the absolute temperatures of the two are in the ratio of 3,600 to 1,800,
oras2istol. For the same area the carbon of the arc light would
emit about 16 times as much light as the petroleum lamp. And yet the
price per candle power is almost as great for the arc light as for the
petroleum lamp, as shown above. This indicates how large a propor-
tion of the energy must be lost in the transformation of the heat
equivalent of the fuel into energy of motion of the dynamo and the
transformation of this energy into electrical energy and finally into
light. It is therefore easily understood why the incandescent electric
light occupies almost the last place in the table. In addition to the
energy which is lost in the production of the electric current we must
consider that the temperature of the filament of an incandescent lamp
is much lower than that of the carbon in the are. In the arc lamp the
maximum temperature is practically determined by the volitilization
temperature of the carbon. In the incandescent lamp the filament
must be kept intact. This can only be done if it is heated to moderate
whiteness in the absence of air—i.e.,of oxygen. If a long life of the
incandescent lamp is not to be considered, by increasing the tempera-
ture of the filament to intense whiteness the glow lamp emerges from
its darkness and outshines all luminous flames. I now gradually
increase the electric current passed through this incandescent lamp.
[Experiment.] The filament becomes brighter and brighter, and you
see what a flood of light is emitted by this single lamp. 1t, however,
lasts only a short while, for the filament disintegrates. While the
increase in temperature has quadrupled its brightness, the current
passed through it only had to be doubled. I can not make it any
plainer to you than by this experiment that an improvement in the
incandescent light can only be attained if we succeed in increasing
the temperature of the filament without at tbe same time disintegrat-
ing it or volitilizing it. But even now, with the low market price of
incandescent lamps, less stress is to be laid on their life than on their
luminosity, and it is more economical to use three lamps, each capable
of burning three hundred hours and with very bright filaments, than to
use one lamp outlasting all the others but with a reddish filament.
The radiation of light is proportional to the fifth power of the absolute
temperature, while the electric energy which is supplied to the lamp is
proportional to the second power of the temperature.
LIGHT AND ITS ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION. 299

The aim, on the whole, is then to raise the incandescent substances
to the highest possible temperature even at the expense of reducing
the size of the luminous area. In this sense the Argand burner with
chimney corresponds to a great improvement over the fish-tail burner,
just as does the petroleum lamp of to-day over the oil lamp of the ancients.
In both cases an increase in temperature of the combining gases and
therefore of the incandescent carbon particles is produced. And while
the former is not important practically, the intensity increases as the
fifth power of the temperature, so that the flame of an Argand burner
is only about half as expensive as that of a fish-tail burner. Still
cheaper is the gaslight obtained from a Siemen’s regenerative burner,
in which the gas before combustion is heated up by the heat otherwise
carried off by the products of combustion, and by this means the tem-
perature of the flame is still further increased.

Cheapest of all is, however, the Welsbach light, because the temper-
ature of combustion is still higher than that of the regenerative burner.
The mantle had to be constructed such that a large part of it would
assume a high temperature (2,0U0° absolute) and had to be at the same
time of such a composition as to radiate almost as freely as carbon.
Both objects have been attained by Auer von Welsbach to whom, there-
fore, great credit is due.

In the acetylene light the incandescence is also due to highly heated
carbon, aS mentioned above, but, judging from the whiteness of the
light produced, its temperature must far exceed that of the Argand
burner. Although the price of acetylene light is dearer at present
than gaslight, it is principally due to the excessive cost of the calcium
carbide, from which the acetelyne is produced. If both acetylene gas
and ordinary illuminating gas could be furnished at the same price the
acetylene would be cheapest of all, the price being under these circum-
stances .005 cent per hour per candle power.

But we could reason similarly in regard to the cost of electric light
and of petroleum light. The relative cost as given in the table depends
on the assumptions made in the second and fourth columns.

The struggle for supremacy will never end, for much can still be
attained if the directions pointed out by science are followed. There
are, however, many difficulties to be overcome before we can expect to
realize the ideal source of illumination theoretically possible.
EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE!

By HENRI DE GRAFFIGNY.

As meteorologists have become convinced of the many advantages
that balloons present for the study of aerial phenomena and the explo-
ration of the atmosphere, there has been formed an international scien-
tific commission for aerostation, having for its president M. Bouquet
de la Grye, and the study of the higher regions by means of unmounted
recording balloons, commenced in France by M. Gustave Hermite and
in Germany by M. Assmann, has been pursued with a success which
leads us to hope for the most surprising results, when, by means of an
uninterrupted series of experiments, we shall be able to deduce a com-
plete theory from ascertained facts.

It appears to us that the time has come to summarize the recent
work of physicists of different countries relating to this most interest-
ing question, so as to bring out, from the indications furnished by the
registering apparatus, the facts that result from these novel observa-
tions. These have an incontestable interest, for the benefits that
science confers by the forecasting of the weather are of a general
character and benefit the entire human race, which derives the elements
of life from the aerial ocean. We will, then, recount the various experi-
ments made up to the present time, both in France and abroad, taking
them up in order of date, and afterwards discussing the results obtained
by these new means of investigation.

I.— RECORDING BALLOONS.

Until recent years meteorological observations at great heights were
made from mounted balloons by physicists who carried with them
apparatus whose indications they themselves recorded from time to
time. Among celebrated ascensions of this kind we note the following,
calling attention to the fact that greater and greater altitudes have
been successively attained.

302 EXPLORATIONS -OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

The danger of these high altitudes is well known, especially since
the dramatic ascent of the balloon Zenith; hence it seemed wholly
desirable, in view of the progress that has been made in the construc-
tion of automatic registering apparatus, that unmounted aerostats car-
rying these improved instruments should be used. Thus there would
be no risk to the lives of the observers, and the difficulties of ascents
to great heights, requiring balloons of enormous capacity, would be
much diminished.

We owe to M. Gustave Hermite the first experiments of this kind,
these being first made by means of recording balloons formed of paper,
then by an ‘“Aerophile,” made entirely of gold-beater’s skin, having a
capacity of about 113 cubic meters. The first ascent was from the
aerostatic park of Vaugirard, March 21, 1892, when the height attained
was 16,000 meters, but the tracing made was incomplete, the ink of the
registering pen having frozen because of the excessive cold of the
upper regions. Many other experiments were afterwards made during
succeeding years, and in each of them some new improvement was
effected.

In Germany, M. Assmann, chief of section in the Meteorological Insti-
tute at Berlin, under the direction of M. von Bezold, had a balloon
of 250 cubic meters capacity built, which, released on two different
occasions, reached heights of 16,600 and 18,000 meters, and fell the
first time in Russia, the second time in Bosnia.

M. Besancon, the young and already celebrated aeronaut, having
combined his efforts with those of M. Hermite, there resulted from the
collaboration of these two investigators great improvements in all
parts of the apparatus hitherto used. Considering that the essential
condition for reaching higher and higher altitudes consisted in pro-
eressively increasing the ratio between the ascensional force and the
volume of the balloon, the weight of every part of their new aerophile
was reduced toa minimum. The tissue employed for the envelope was
a marvel of lightness and strength. Its resistance to traction was 550
kilograms per linear meter, its weight 30 grams per square meter when
unfinished, and 120 grams after it was made impermeable by four suc-
cessive coats of varnish. The volume of the balloon being 380 cubic
meters, its envelope, therefore, weighed 9 kilograms before varnishing,
and 31 kilograms after the last coat of varnish had been applied, the
total varnished surface being 250 square meters. Now, the weight of
the same volume and surface made of cotton or silk, having a lifting
power of 1,000 kilograms per meter, is about 110 kilograms. We per-
ceive at once what progress was made in the construction of this bal-
loon without in any way Sacrificing its strength.

This balloon was provided at its upper extremity with a valve of
discharge, having a diameter of 48 centimeters, acting automatically
to produce descent, and effecting collapse in a few moments. It was
covered by a net of white Anjou hemp, of exceptional strength in
EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE. 303

spite of its light weight of 5 kilograms. Its total resistance, which
was 5,500 kilograms at the top, was 8,300 kilograms at the equator,
and thence diminished to the 8 suspension cords, which had a total
resistance of 4,500 kilograms. These cords were united below in a
single point by means of a special apparatus called a cone. Itis at
this point of union that are fixed, first, a thimble in which slides the
cable serving to manage the balloon; then two cords, one light, at the
end of which the registering apparatus is suspended, the other strong,
to which is attached a tray charged with ballast when the balloon has
mounted to the desired height by the running out of the controlling
cable. - When it is wished to let the aerostat go, one end of the cable
is pulled; then, when it has fallen to the ground, it is sufficient to cut
with a knife the cordage that holds it. By this means there is avoided
all shock to the instruments, which, in the first experiments, were con-
siderably injured.

The complete apparatus weighs only 41 kilograms, the same as does
the German balloon of 250 cubic meters, the Cirrus, mentioned above.
A simple calculation shows that this balloon, filled with pure hydrogen
having a weight of 1,150 grams per cubic meter, ought to rise to a
height of more than 20 kilometers. Still it has not reached anything
like that height, but this fact is explained when we learn that it has
only been filled with illuminating gas, having a lifting power of only
700 grams per meter, and that it has always been loaded with from
10 to 25 kilograms of registering apparatus. Besides, we may doubt
whether the formula of Laplace, by which barometers are graduated,
can still be applied to those regions of our atmosphere in which the
pressure is reduced to a few centimeters of mercury.

IIl.—THE INSTRUMENTS.

The experience had by MM. Hermite and Besancon at the time of their
previous trials with their Aerophile of gold-beater’s skin led. them to
modify considerably the arrangement of the instruments carried by the
recording balloon, so as to make the diagrams more accurate.

The principal record desired was that of the temperature of the
regions traversed, and for this purpose a registering apparatus was
constructed by M. Richard and tested in the frigorific chamber of M.
de la Baume-Pluvinel. This instrument, made almost entirely of alumi-
num, weighs only about 1,200 grams, and gives three different diagrams;
that of variations of pressure (barometer), of temperature (thermome-
ter), and of degree of humidity (hygrometer). The tracing is made
upon paper ribbons covered with Jampblack, fixed on a revolving eylin-
der driven by clockwork. ‘This barothermograph, when-set up, is sus-
pended in a loosely woven wicker basket by rubber bands, thus guarding
the instrument from injury during the shock of landing. This basket
is itself hung in the same manner within a large wicker cylinder cov-
ered externally with silvered paper. In this way the barothermograph
is completely protected from solar radiation as well as from shocks.
304 EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

Besides obtaining the temperature of atmospheric spaces, it was con-
sidered desirable to bring down in a special receptacle a certain quan-
tity of air taken in at the highest point of the ascension, 12,000 to 15,000
meters. As early as the beginning of 1896, M. Hermite tried to solve
this difficult problem, and the Aerophile that was released on the 22d
of March from the gas works of La Villette and that landed near Cam-
brai, after having reached a height of 14,000 meters, and having been
subjected to a cold of —63° C., carried an automatic apparatus for taking
in air, which, unfortunately (probably because of the low temperature),
gave noresult. The reservoir, in which a vacuum had been made pre-
vious to the ascent, was to have been opened at the highest point by
means of the action of sulphuric acid on chlorate of potash. The res-
ervoir once filled, a continuation of the same action was to hermetically
seal it by melting and closing the tube for ingress of air, and thus the
air of the higher regions might be brought down and analyzed.

In succeeding experiments, following the advice of M. Cailletet, M.
Hermite changed the arrangement of his apparatus, and successively
used a cock moved by clockwork adjusted before the ascent, a mixture of
paraffin and glycerin, and finally closure by means of a ball valve of a
quite novel character. After many disappointments and difficulties sue-
cessively overcome by dint of ingenuity and perseverance, the physicist
attained his end, his apparatus worked admirable, and we have now
ascertained the nature of the air in the higher regions, as will be seen
later on.

Another problem, likewise very important, is the determination of the
actual altitude to which the recording balloon rises with the attached
instruments, for it is evident that the basis of any serious study of the
higher atmosphere must rest upon a knowledge of the law of the decrease
of barometric pressure with increase of altitude, a law which, when
scrutinized closely, is an evident corollary to the law of universal
gravitation.

As a micrometer telescope had not proved successful, it became nec-
essary to devise another method, and M. Hermite was led to contrive
another apparatus, based upon the principle already employed in geodesy
for measuring the height of clouds, and which consists in observing a
moving point by means of two theodolites set on a previously deter-
mined base. But in practice this proceeding has a serious inconven-
ience, for the rapid displacement of the object prevents the observer
who watches the balloon at the telescope of the theodolite from noting
the azimuth and zenith distances and the time. An aid is necessary
for each of these, and it will be easily seen that if the operators are not
very well drilled they will embarrass each other and the observations
will fail. ;

Hermite’s dromograph is a sort of registering theodolite, with which
one may obtain a continuous automatic registration of the position of
the balloon as long as it remains visible by observing it behind the
EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE. 305

crossed threads of the instrument. Movements of the telescope in
the vertical and in the horizontal planes are transmitted, by means of
cogwheels and a chain invented by Galle, to an arm carrying a writing
pen. The tracing made by this pen on a sheet of cross-section paper
borne on a vertical cylinder gives the various angles of the balloon in
zenith and azimuth, and constitutes a complete diagram. In the model
used in the ascension of the 5th of August, 1896, the registering ecylin-
der was 18 centimeters high and 7 in diameter, revolving in fifty-five
minutes. Using cross-section paper with millimeter squares, we have,
for every minute of time, 4 millimeters of horizontal displacement of
the cylinder. For zenith distances from 0° to 90°, 1 millimeter equals
one-half a degree, and for azimuths, 2°. To obviate confounding the
tracings, the pens carry ink of different colors.

This apparatus can not pretend to the extreme precision of the the-
odolites employed in geodesy, but it has the compensating advantage
that it furnishes a document that can be examined at leisure. With
two dromographs established on a suitable base, the actual height of
the aerostat may be determined with a certain amount of approxima-
tion, and this may then be compared with the registering diagrams of
the balloon.

While waiting, M. Hermite has made interesting observations upon
the velocity and direction of winds at high altitudes, using the baro-
metric diagram to solve the triangle.

Now that we have become acquainted with the apparatus See prea
we may consider the three last trials that have been made in France
with the instruments just described.

III.—THE ASCENSION OF AUGUST 5, 1896.

At 11.40 a. m. the Aerophile, provided with its basket protector con-
taining the barothermograph carrying within the balloon a registering
thermometer and provided with a 12 pound apparatus for automatic-
ally taking in air, was ready to start. The signal being given and
the mooring cord cut, the balloon darted up with great velocity, carry-
ing its load of instruments. The dromograph properly set up registered
the trajectory followed; but at 12.10 o’clock at a height of about 8,500
meters and at a distance of 22 kilometers from the gas works of La Vil-
lette, the place of departure, the Aerophile disappeared behind thick
clouds while still continuing its ascent. That very evening a dispatch
arrived at Paris announcing that the recording balloon had come to
the ground in Germany, at Niedermiebach, about 30 kilometers beyond
Cologne, where M. Hermite went the next day to get it, finding the
apparatus in a perfect state of preservation.

An examination of the barogram showed that the ascent was made
with an average velocity of 6 meters per second, and that the maximum
altitude was reached at 12.33 p. m., about three-quarters of an hour
after the start. The barometric pressure had then fallen to about 135

sm 97-——20
306 EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

millimeters of mercury, which corresponds to a height of 13,343. meters,
according to the formula of Laplace. Then, after a period of equi-
librium lasting three hours, the descent commenced, slow at first, then
more and more rapid, until it attained a velocity of 3 meters per sec-
ond at landing, 4.30 p. m.

The thermometric diagram showed a regular decrease of temperature,
which reached —50° C. at the moment when the descent commenced.
But this record, which does not agree with those obtained in preceding
experiments, appears somewhat uncertain, and M. Hermite thinks that
it may have been falsified by various more or less hypothetical causes—
for example, the insufficient ventilation of the apparatus.

A registering thermometer had been inclosed, as we have said, in
the interior of the balloon. An examination of the tracing obtained
showed that the temperature of the gas was about 30° C. during the
inflation, while the temperature outside was only 18°. But as soon as
the ascent commenced the carbureted hydrogen naturally expanded
with great rapidity, and the temperature of the gas fell to —21°, a
result to-day well understood. The balloon forms a gigantic actinom-
eter, which shows the effects of solar radiation, and the intensity of
‘ihe radiation increases with the DUNES and is in inverse proportion
to the density of the air.

The apparatus for taking in air appeared to have worked according
to the conditions that M, Cailletet had foreseen, and M. Hermite
brought it back intact, its orifices hermetically closed, to Paris, where
M. Muntz, director of the Laboratory of Agricultural Chemistry, was
to analyze it. But as the vacations were about to commence he could
not take up this analysis until some months later—in October, and it
was then found that, during this long interval, the air in the receiver
had resumed its normal pressure. There had therefore been a leakage,
and the experiment would have to be repeated.

It has been found possible to reconstruct the trajectory of the aero-
stat from the time of its departure by using the diagrams furnished by
the dromograph and the barometric curve. We thus have on the one
hand the azimuth of the balloon at every moment, and on the other the
angle a, whose value represents the height of the balloon. The sine of
the angle a is furnished by the barometric curve, using the formula of
Laplace; a quite simple trigonometric operation then suffices to resolve
the right-angled triangle. In this way also it has been possible to
determine the velocity of the currents which transported the Aerophile
at different altitudes. This velocity was as follows:

38 kilometers per hour between 3,000 and 5,000 meters.

70 kilometers per hour between 5,000 and 6,200 up

80 kilometers per hour between 6,200 and 7,000 eC
102 kilometers per hour between 7,000 and 7,700 eS
132 kilometers per hour between 7,700 and 8,200 sf
158 kilometers per hour between 8,200 and 9,700 sg

This appears to indicate that the velocity of the wind increases with
the altitude. The distance traveled by the balloon was 430 kilometers
in four hours and forty-five minutes, which gives an average velocity of
90 kilometers an hour.

4 IV.—INTERNATIONAL ASCENTS OF THE 14TH NOVEMBER, 1896.

The International Conference of Meteorology, held in the month of
September, 1896, under the presidency of M. Mascart, having manifested
a desire to see the experiment tried of simultaneous ascents of several
balloons provided with registering apparatus, an agreement was entered
into by MM. Hermite and Besancon and various foreisn observers
M. Hergesell, president of the international committee of scientific
aerostation; M. Assmann, chief of division in the Meteorologic Insti-
tute of Berlin; General Rykatcheff, at St. Petersburg, and M. Erk,
at Munich. It was decided that simultaneous ascensions should be
made on the night of the 13th-14th November, from the gas works of
La Villette, at Paris, from Strasburg, from Berlin, from Munich, and
from St. Petersburg. Many mounted balloons were also freighted to
start at about the same hour from different cities, and thus contribute
to the general result.

The ascent from Paris took place, during magnificent weather, at
2.06 a.m. The air was calm, but saturated with moisture. The baro-
metric pressure was 761 millimeters and the temperature 3° C. The
ascensional force of the Aerophile was 248 kilograms, which gives the
gas a lifting force of about 800 grams per cubic meter.! The total
weight of the material taken up was 40.5 kilograms, the only instru-
ments carried up being the barothermograph, which we have already
described.

The balloon disappeared in the night with extraordinary rapidity and
for three days we heard nothing further fromit. 1t was thought that
it might have been lost at sea or in some distant forest, when a letter
came to Paris, informing MM. Hermite and Besancon that their appa-
ratus had fallen at break of day at Graide, in Belgian Luxemburg, and,
by a singular coincidence, less than a kilometer away from where we

1The density of illuminating gas is very variable, and at the works of La Villette
its lifting force per cubic meter oscillates between 620 and 820 grams. It would
therefore be desirable to inflate the Aerophile with pure hydrogen, as the Germans
do with the Cirrus. But pure hydrogen is not found in France, and MM. Hermite
and Besancon, whe had asked the minister of war for permission to purchase the
quantity of gas necessary for inflation from the persons who furnish hydrogen to the
army, received no reply. We then offered to assist the two persevering physicists
in their attempt to avoid the difficulty and to purify—to decarburise, in brief—the
nauseous compound furnished to aeronauts by the Parisian gas company. The
apparatus is now completed, and if, as there is reason to hope, the experiment
demonstrates the justice of our theory, the Aerophile will be inflated with almost
pure hydrogen, purified by passing through a decarburator before being stored in
the sphere of silk, and the ascensional force will be found to be increased by about
one-fourth.
308 EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

ourselves, in company with M. Besancon and four other aeronauts, nad
landed with the balloon Touring Club just three months before.

The material of the Aerophile was unhappily in a very deplorable
state. As the peasants who possessed themselves of it at the time of
its fall did not know how to read they did not think of opening the
envelope containing the instructions given by the aeronauts to the per-
sons who might find the balloon, which, in order to detach from the
trees upon which it had fallen, they tore in several places. The net
was torn to pieces and completely useless. As to the sheets covered
with lampblack wound about the registering cylinder, the peasants,
attaching no sort of importance to them, had detached them and thrown
them aside in a corner, where M. Hermite fortunately found them.

The diagram which thus escaped those whom we ean scarcely call
the rescuers of the balloon shows that the aerostat reached equilibrium
ata pressure of 115 millimeters of mercury, which corresponds to a height
of 15,000 meters according to the formula of Laplace, no correction
being made for the temperature of the air. The vertical velocity at
starting was about 8 meters per second, and the highest point was
reached in forty minutes. The velocity of descent was 6 meters per
second when near the ground. It was then twice as rapid as usual, a
fact which may be attributed to an accumulation of moisture upon the
envelope of the aerostat.

The thermometer registered a minimum temperature of 60° C. at
about 6 a.m., the barometric pressure being then 160 millimeters of
mercury.

This observation agrees completely with those that have been made
not only in a balloon but on the ground, for it has been shown that
under almost all circumstances a marked lowering of temperature
takes place a little before sunrise. Still, before relying absolutely upon
this, it would be well to assure ourselves that the registering apparatus
was sufficiently ventilated; for, in spite of the absence of every cause
due to heating during this nocturnal ascension, it is possible that
aeration plays a very important part in the precision of thermometric
observations. In order to remove these uncertainties there should
be, in subsequent experiments, comparative observations made with
several similar registering thermometers under various conditions of
aeration.

As compared with the preceding ascent, the motion of translation of
the Aerophile was quite slow. The distance from Paris to Graide being
about 220 kilometers as the crow flies, and being traversed in four
hours and twenty-five minutes, the balloon traveled only 36 kilometers
an hour.

V.—FOREIGN ASCENTS ON THE 14TH OF NOVEMBER.

As we have already said, three recording balloons and four mounted
balloons were released at different points on the night of the 14th of
November. ‘The results of these experiments were as follows:

meters, was filled with illuminating gas having an ascensional power
of 800 grams per cubic meter, and was released at 2a.m. An hour and
a half later the apparatus fell in the Biack Forest, at the foot of Mount
Hornsgrinde, 30 kilometers northeast of Strasburg. The maximum
height attained was 800 meters, and the barometric diagram shows a
perfect regularity, while that of the thermometer, undoubtedly falsified
by some derangement of the mechanism, shows a rise of temperature
not corresponding to any natural phenomenon. M. Hergesell, struck
with this irregularity, has since that time thought proper to have M.
Richard modify the construction of the thermometric reservoir, in order
to prevent the recurrence of a similar accident.

The recording balloon Cirrus, of Berlin, received only 150 cubic
meters of pure hydrogen gas, its capacity being 250 meters. It carried
a barothermograph and a Richard barograph, as well as a thermo-
graph of German construction. It was released at 2.51 a. m., local time,
and its descent occurred a short time after in the Griinenwald, a forest
situated a few kilometers to the southeast of Berlin. The maximum
altitude attained was only 5,800 meters, the balloon having exploded -
in the air, a phenomenon that was by no means surprising when we:
~ consider the vacuum that existed in the aerostat at the time of depar-
ture. M. Assmann adds, also, that the Cirrus was old and worn by
reason of prolonged service.

The recording balloon released at St. ae by M. Rykatcheff

had a similar unfortunate fate, for it burst at an elevation of 1,500
meters. It was released at 4 a. m., local time, and the voyage lasted a
quarter of an hour. Temperature at starting, —5°; at the culminating
point of its ascent, —13°.

The mounted balloon Buzzard, having a capacity of 1,300 cubic
meters, was released from the aerostatic park of Schéneberg, at Ber-
lin, at 2.48 a.m. It had received 1,000 cubic meters of pure hydrogen,
and was accompanied by Lieutenant Von Keller, an officer of the bal-
loon service, and by M. Berson, a well-known meteorologist and
aeronaut. The voyage was a very remarkable one; it lasted eleven
hours and thirty-seven seconds, and ended on the seashore at Volk-
hagen, near Ribnitz, in Mecklenburg. The average velocity was
5 meters per second, the maximum height 5,600 meters, which was
attained at 11.43 a. m. The lowest temperature observed at this
height was —24.4°, by means of an aspiration apparatus invented by
M. Assmann.

At St. Petersburg the balloon Vannesky, having a capacity of 1,000
cubic meters, started at 4.45 a. m., accompanied by MM. Kowenko and
Semkowski. The lowest temperature observed was —22.8° C., at the
height of 3,500 meters, and —23° at 4,560 meters for the mercurial ther-
mometer. With the alcohol thermometer the lowest was —27.2° at 3,840
meters. The descent was made at 11.30 a.m. near Pskow. The first,
rays of the sun reached the aerostat at 7.48, and somewhat disturbed
the course of the meteorological observations.
310 EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

At Warsaw the balloon Strella, having a cubic capacity of 1,000
meters, filled with ordinary illuminating gas, and directed by Lieuten-
ant Prince Obolensky, with Lieutenant Oiilianin as observer, ascended
at 3.15 a. m. and descended near Brzozow, in Austria, at 12.50. It was
up, therefore, for nine hours and thirty-five minutes. Its maximum
altitude was 3,500 meters, but the temperature could not be observed
beyond 2,000 meters, where 20° C. was shown. Beyond this the
observations were interrupted, the mercury being wholly within the
bulb of the thermometer.

At Munich, the balloon Academie, having a cubic capacity of 1,300
meters, and filied with pure hydrogen, ascended at 6.45 a. m., central
European time, having on board M. Erk, director of the Meteorological
Observatory at Munich, and Captain Guttenberg. The lowest tem-
perature observed was —6.5° C., with a barometrical pressure of 505
millimeters, taken at 12.02. The wet bulb thermometer gave —7.9°.
This expedition was certainly one of the most interesting of the day.
As the sun drew near to the meridian the balloon rose progressively
above a sea of clouds, between which glimpses were obtained of the
immense panorama of the Alps. The temperature, which had regu-
larly descended up to that time, rose again when above the clouds,
and attained a maximum of +2.7° at 1,600 meters, to redescend to
—6.5° at the culminating point of the ascension, at 3,350 meters. A
landing was effected without any notable incident after traversing
about 200 kilometers, at 1.45, at Longvitz. In none of the ascents were
any Shooting stars perceived. ;

It would at this time be premature to attempt to draw any conclu-
sions from these simultaneous observations, although it may be affirmed
in a general way that up to an altitude of from 8,000 to 10,000 meters
the local influences and the configurations of the ground cause great
differences in the temperature of the air, observed at the same time
and altitude. We must wait until successive observations made upon
the higher atmosphere shall have changed in some degree the theo-
ries believed to be the best settled; but it should not be forgotten —
that observations made in meteorological stations on mountains have
prepared us for conclusions of this kind. There, as is well known, the
differences in the temperature of the air taken with the metallic ther-
mometer in the shade and in the sun vary with the altitude. Much is
yet to be studied before we can settle in a definite and certain manner
these various questions.

VI.—ASCENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY MADE ON THE 18TH OF FEBRUARY, 1897.

In accordance with the advice given by the Scientific Commission at
Paris, at its session of February 3, a new exploration of the distant
Strata of the atmosphere was decided upon, in concert with the Inter-
national Committee of Aeronautics and Meteorology. The Aerophile,
which returned ina pitiable state after its journey to Belgium, had been

carefully repaired in the workshops of the central establishment for
aerostation, its net being entirely renewed, and M. Besancon had added
to it an equatorial band which increased its volume to 480 cubic meters.
The ascension was fixed for February 18 at 10 a. m.

Besides the barothermograph of Richard, which was hung freely
within the protecting basket, the Aerophile carried a thermograph
suspended in the interior of the balloon and an apparatus for taking
in air which had been contrived with the greatest care by M. Cailletet.
This exploration, the seventh one made by the French in the higher
regions of the atmosphere, had for its sponsor on this occasion Prince
Roland Bonaparte, who had assumed the entire cost of the enterprise.

At 10.15 a.m., during cold and foggy weather, the cord attaching
the aerostat to the ground was cut, and in less than a minute it had
disappeared in a dense fog. There was no delay this time in getting
news from it, for about the middle of the afternoon a dispatch arrived at
Paris informing MM. Hermite and Besancon that their balloon had
descended near Chaulnes, at Meharicourt, in the department of the
Somme, 105 kilometers from Paris, at 12.30. But this time, also, the
material had been considerably damaged, having dragged nearly 5
kilometers over ground wet with rain. The silk was torn in severai
places and the net frayed into shreds. Happily the diagrams were
intact.

The scientific results of this experiment were as follows:

The maximum height attained by the Aerophile was 15,500 meters,
as Shown by the barogram. This height was reached at 11.30, about
an hour after the ascent from the gas works of La Villette. The
descent was effected very quickly, as was also the case at the noctur-
nal ascent of the 14th of November, and it is possible that this effect —
was produced by a deposit, in the region of the cirri, of fine particles of
ice, which, accumulating on the dome of the aerostat, overcharged it
and caused its rapid fall.

An examination of the curve traced by the style of the external ther-
mograph shows that the lowest range of temperature —66°C., corre-
sponds not to the highest point of the ascent, but to a little before the
finaldescent; that is to say, to a pressure of 109 millimeters of mercury.
The curve of the registering thermometer hung within the balloon is no
less curious. It shows a rapid fall, as low as —22°, due to the simulta-
neous action of the expansion of the gas and the cooling of the exte-
rior. Then the temperature ascended during the descent of the balloon,
attaining +14° at the level of the ground. During the entire voyage,
therefore, the temperature of the gas was considerably above that of
the surrounding medium, and when the temperature of the outside was
at the minimum there was a difference of 46° C. between the air and
the interior of, the Aerophile. This phenomenon was already known,
as we especially remarked it in our experiment of August 12, 1896.

The most important result of this experiment was the entire success
312 EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

in obtaining, by means of the automatic apparatus devised by -M.
Hermite, in conjunction with M. Cailletet, member of the institute, the
air of unknown regions where respiration can not be supported; an
experiment that, as we have above stated, had hitherto failed. The
arrangement of this apparatus was as follows:

The air reservoir, cylindrical in form, is of red copper, tinned within
so as to close all fissures and blowholes that might exist in the metal.
The tinning has no effect upon the gas imprisoned in the upper atmos-
phere, and has the advantage of assuring the complete impermeability
of the reservoir. Glass would not have answered because of its agg
and the difficulty of attaching the necessary tubing.

This receiver, holding about 6 liters, communicates with a tight cock
inclosed in a special box formed by a “Gall of red copper; an ingenious
arrangement that obviates, by its elasticity, the rupture of the joints
from violent shock.

The box that contains the cock, the essential and delicate organ of
this apparatus, is lined inside with felt 2 centimeters thick, surrounding
another receptacle of tin filled with acetate of sodium, and within this
is the cock that opens and closes the pipe allowing ingress of air. The
outer envelope of this cock turns very slowly upon itself, driven by
powerful clockwork also set in the receptacle containing the acetate. A
needle attached to this cock turns about a graduated dial, and allows
one to set the time for opening the cock, which, having a hole | millimeter
in diameter, remains open for four minutes only. A tube that extends
for 2 meters below the apparatus serves to admit the external air to the
receiver, in which, it isof course understood, a vacuum has been formed
by means of an air pump. Before sending it off the entire apparatus
was inclosed in a loose wicker case filled with straw, to protect it against
the shock of descent. Its total weight was about sul 5 kilograms.

It was only with very great difficulty, after repeated attempts and
patient studies, that MM. Cailletet and Hermite attained this result of
an absolutely tight cock maintaining a perfect vacuum.

This cock was constructed by MM. Ducretet & Co. The conduit for
ingress of air passing to the reservoir is a canal, hollowed obliquely
out of the axis of the movable piece of the cock, so as to end at two
points situated at different heights, corresponding to the intake of the
air and to its discharge into the reservoir. Thanks to this arrange-
ment, the leakage that generally occurs through the circular and
almost invisible grooves that result from the wear of metallic pieces
upon each other is avoided. In the arrangement adopted these
grooves, so difficult to prevent, no longer correspond to the orifices of
ingress and egress, and the apparatus may retain its vacuum indefi-
nitely.

The fixed bronze piece in which the key of the cock moves has the
form of a sewing thimble, as in the apparatus of M. Carré intended
for producing cold.
EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE. oe

Still, perfect tightness has only been obtained by a perfect adapta-
tion of the movable sleeve and a quite close fitting of the cock which
at first stopped the effect of the train of clockwork. It was necessary
to add to the square piece terminating the sleeve of the cock a toothed
sector upon which engages the pinion of a barrel containing a spring
wound up until it effected the turning of the cock. The apparatus
being found to work well in the labaratory could then be used for
experimenting in inaccessible regions.

M. Muntz, member of the institute, who undertook the analysis of
this air, obtained the following results:

The volume of the air obtained at 15,500 meters, at the temperature
of zero ©, and at a pressure of 760 millimeters was 1.18581 liters.

Composition of the aiyv.—The amount of carbonic acid in 100 volumes
of air is 0.033 volume.

In each 100 volumes of air deprived of carbonic acid the relation of
the argon to the sum of the nitrogen and argon is 0.01185.

M. Th. Schloesing, jr., has determined the volume of the argon, by
the very exact method which he has invented, and has likewise super-
vised the analysis that determined the amount of oxygen.

M. Cailletet, nevertheless, thinks that it wiH be necessary in the
future to gather anew quantities of air and submit them to compara-
tive analyses which will allow us to determine with certainty the com-
position of the air that fills these elevated regions, where scientific
instruments had never before penetrated.

M. Muntz adds, in his communication to the Academy of Sciences,
that he has shown that the receiving apparatus worked in an irreproach-
able manner and that the cock would maintain the vacuum indefinitely.
There is no fear that other air will be introduced into the reservoir.

The quantity of air contained in the reservoir may then be used to
calculate the barometric pressure of the altitude at which the air was
taken. The results of the analysis show already, what was indeed to
be expected, that at the altitude attained the composition of the air
does not differ much from that of the lower regions.

But these figures must be accepted with some reserve. It will, in
fact, be necessary to still further improve the method of obtaining the
air so as to avoid all possible alteration in its composition. For oiling
the cock it will be necessary to use a mineral oil incapable of absorbing
a trace of oxygen and consequently emitting a trace of carbonic acid,
at least under the conditions under which the experiment is made. It
wil likewise be necessary to use a reservoir whose walls can not absorb
any trace of oxygen. For this purpose a glass receiver would be an
ideal one, but a reservoir of gilded copper would seem to answer the
purpose equally well. In the present case we may suppose that the
314 EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

small quantity of carbonic acid found in excess of that in normai air
(0.033 in place of 0.029) is due to the oxidation of the oil employed,
which may have produced the tenth of @ milligram of excess which
corresponds to the volume of air employed.

In the sume way the smaller quantity of oxygen found than that of
normal air (20.79 in place of 20.96),and which represents for the volume
of air collected 3 milligrams, may come from the absorption of that gas
by the oil of the cock or indeed by the metallic surface of tinned
copper.

By eliminating the possible causes of error in new ascensions, we
may hope to show with certainty whether or not real differences exist
in the air taken at various altitudes; for the methods of gas analysis
are to-day so perfect, thanks to the efforts of M. Th. Schloesing, jr., that
they show extremely small differences; if, in fact such differences exist.

But as it is to be expected that in the regions of the atmosphere
possible to explore by means of recording balloons the air is still sub-
ject to that intimate mixing that renders the air of lower regions prac-
tically uniforin, we ought to expect to find the differences in its com-
position very slight, and only to be established with certainty by taking
the most minute precautions.

The results of this fine experiment were the subject of a note pre-
sented to the Academy of Sciences and read at its session of the 8th
of March by MM. Hermite and Besancon at the same time that there
were presented communications on the subject by MM. Cailletet and
Muntz, as we have said above. These persevering investigators were
warmly felicitated by the whole assembly, and upon the motion of M.
Berthelot a grant of 1,200 frances was made to MM. Hermite and Besan-
eon, in order that they might pursue their interesting researches, which
will reveal still other unknown facts in meteorology and the physics of
the globe.

VII.— FOREIGN ASCENTS ON THE 18TH OF APRIL, 1897.

At the same time that the Aerophile was ascending from the works of
La Villette several ascensions were going on in different cities, and we
will pass them rapidly in review, so as to understand the results obtained
by foreign observers.

The ascensions at Berlin were undertaken by the military aerostatic
establishment at Schéneberg, in presence of tle Emperor and the
Empress of Germany, as well as the ambassadors of France and Rus-
sia. Like those of the 14th of November, they will be the subject of a
circumstantial report, which M. Assmann has drawn up for the Emperor.

The recording balloon, Cirrus II, having exploded in the preceding
experiment of November 14, 1896, because the net was not sufficiently
strong, it was not thought prudent to completely inflate the aerostat.
The envelope could not unfold with a speed corresponding to the dilata-
tion, and the aerostat was torn. The barograph and thermograph,
which were attached to a protecting basket, were saved and placed
EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE. 315

during the ascent of the 18th of February on a normal military balloon
having a capacity of 560 cubic meters, used for captive ascents in the
army. The weight of this aerostat, with its attached instruments, was
exactly 225 kilograms.

This. aerostat was picked up in the little village of Sereen, 150 kilo-
meters to the east of Berlin, 70 kilometers to the east of the city of
Frankfort on Oder, and in the neighborhood of the little village of
Meseritz, department of “Ost Stenberg.” The ascension lasted from
11.04 to 3.20. The military balloon rose to a height corresponding toa
pressure of 248 millimeters, finding a temperature of —42°, which gives
an altitude, when corrected, of 8,850 meters above the level of the sea.
The imperial Geodesic Institute had established three stations pro-
vided with theodolites. The geodesists took some 30 observations,
which gave for the maximum altitude 8,800 meters, a coincidence truly
remarkable, and which may be considered as a verification of Laplace’s
law of barometric heights.

There were also two mounted balloons released. The first, which
had a capacity of 1,300 cubic meters and was inflated with illuminating
gas, was called the Condor. It carried M. Juring, a physicist attached
to the Meteorological Institute, and was directed by M. von Kehler, an
officer of the balloon service. The Condor, starting at 9.40, rose to a
height of 3,258 meters where the temperature was —7.5°. Itdescended
at 4.30 p. m., 250 kilometers east of Berlin, at Schneidemuhl, in the
duchy of Posen.

M. Berson, a member of the International Commission, made an
ascent witha military balloon having the same weight and voiume as that
of the recording balloon. He descended at Naeckel, 295 kilometers N.
4° 8. of Berlin, after having reached an altitude of 4,632 meters, where
he encountered a temperature of —13.8° and air almost saturated with
humidity. The voyage lasted seven hours and forty-seven minutes.

The barometric and thermometric curvesof the recording balloon could
be read very well, although the diagrams were covered with a great
number of spots produced at the time of the landing and in returning
to Berlin.

During the month of March M. Assmann intends to make a private
experiment, with illuminating gas and a discharge sac, as well as new
instruments.

The thermometric tracings are found to be affected with a great
number of little serrations that seem to have an almost periodic char-
acter, being reproduced every fifteen or sixteen minutes. M. Assmann
attributes them to the fact that the protecting basket does not give
sufficient protection, and supposes that they are caused by a rotation
of the balloon.

At Strasburg.—The recording balloon Strasburg was released during
a thick fog, and, like Aerophile III, was immediately lost to sight. It
was not until after eight days of search that it was found attached to
316 EXPLORATIONS OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

the branches of a tree in a forest near Rosenthal, a little village of
Hesse, 400 kilometers to the north. The diagrams were uninjured, and
according to what M. Hergesell writes, it appears that they will give
information as to the results of insolation. The altitude attained was
12,000 meters, and the temperature observed was— 67°. The diagrams
will be published hereafter.

M. Hergesell took part in the ascent of a mounted balloon which
ascended to the height of 2,500 meters. The descent took place near
Frankfort. M. Hergesell found that the temperature rose until the
height of 1,500 meters was reached. This effect was due to the action
of the sun, which warmed the air until that stratum was reached where
no vapor offered an obstacle to the action of its rays. After this the
lowering of the temperature was very rapid.

At St. Petersburg.—The Government organized an ascent under the
direction of M. Porker, an officer of the aerostatic service. The descent
took place at Luban, in the government of Novgorod.

The conclusion of this examination of the work of meteorologists in
the new line of researches in which the latter are engaged is thus
reached by the summarizing of the results obtained up to the present
time; and the high approbation given by the Academy of Sciences
shows what our opinion ought to be regarding it. We should applaud
these observers for resolutely leaving the rut of the beaten track and
for seeking by new methods to complete the observations made in
terrestrial stations scattered over the surface of the globe. There
remains to be gathered an abundant harvest of new facts, and the
explorers of the higher atmosphere may with reason hope that from
their work, continued over a sufficient space of time, there will arise a
new theory, generalizing all the phenomena that occur in the aerial
ocean, and enabling us to correctly forecast the weather and thus profit
all mankind.
THH EXPLORATION OF THE FREE AIR BY MEANS OF KITES
~ AT BLUE HILL OBSERVATORY, MASSACHUSETTS.

By A. LAWRENCE RKorcuH, Director.

The first use of kites for scientific purposes, so far as is known, was
in 1749 when Dr. Alexander Wilson and his pupil Thomas Melville, of
Glasgow, raised thermometers attached to kites into the clouds.' Three
years later Benjamin Franklin performed, in Philadelphia, his celebra-
ted experiment of collecting the electricity of the thunderstorm by
means of a kite.2 During the first part of the present century kites
were used in Hurope to carry thermometers into the air, and about
1840 Espy, in this country, employed kites to verify calculations of the
height of clouds by means of the dew-point.®

Modern kiteflying for scientific purposes may be said to date from
1883, when Douglas Archibald, in England, fastened to the kite wire
anemometers which registered the total wind movements on dials, and
so obtained differential measures of wind velocity at heights up to 1,200
feet. In 1885 Alexander McAdie (now of the United States Weather
Bureau) repeated Franklin’s experiments on Blue Hill, using an elee-
trometer,’ and in 1891 and 1892 he measured, simultaneously, the elec-
tric potential at the base of Blue Hill, on the hill, and with kites as
collectors, several hundred feet above the hilltop. About the same
time L. Weber in Breslau, Germany, made a more extended use of kites
to collect atmospheric electricity.®

To William A. Eddy, of Bayonne, N. J., is due the credit of again
turning the attention of scientific men to kiteflying, and thus causing.
the widespread interest in it which now exists. About 1890 Mr. Eddy
used an ordinary kite to lift thermometers, but soon afterwards devised
a tailless kite which resembled the kite flown in Java. This kite has
the ends of its horizontal cross stick bent backward, and the convex
Surface exposed to the wind obviates the necessity of a tail and

enables the kite to be easily fown. In 1891 Mr. Eddy attached a mini-
mum thermometer to several of these tailless kites flown tandem, and
proposed to obtain in this way data for forecasting the weather.' In
the Proceedings of the Aeronautical Conference held in connection
with the Chicago Exposition of 1893 Prof. M. W. Harrington, then
Chief of the United States Weather Bureau, quoted Mr. Eddy’s esti-
mate of the cost of exploring the air to a height of 15,000 feet by
means of kites flown in a series. Up to this time it does not appear
that self-recording instruments—that is to say, those which make con-
tinuous graphic records—hail been raised by kites. In the days of the
early experimenters such instruments were too heavy to be lifted by
more or less unmanageable kites. Within the past few years the self-
recording instruments made in Paris by MM. Richard are both light
and simple, so that it became possible to obtain simultaneous records
at the kite and at a station on the ground from which to study the
changes of temperature and humidity. This seems to have been done
first at Blue Hill Observatory by my assistants, Messrs. Clayton and
Fergusson. In August, 1894, Mr, Eddy brought his kites to Blue Hill
and with them lifted a Richard thermograph, which had been partly
reconstructed of aluminum by Mr. Fergusson so that it weighed but
2+ pounds, to the height of 1,500 feet, where the earliest automatic
record of temperature was obtained by a kite.2 During the next sum-
mer Mr. Eddy assisted again in the experiments at Blue Hill and
secured photographs from a camera carried between his kites. Now
that the possibility of lifting self-recording meteorological instruments
to considerable heights had been demonstrated, an investigation of the
thermal and hygrometric conditions of the free air was undertaken by
the staff of the Blue Hill Observatory, who had already made a detailed
study of the movements of the air at great heights from the observa-
tions of clouds.®

The development of the kite and its accessory apparatus, and the
acquisition of the knowledge how to use them, required much time and
resulted in the damage or loss of many kites. Two costly meteoro-
graphs, as the combination of self-recording instruments is called, were |
dropped from a great height and no trace of them could be found.
Usually, however, when by the breaking of the line kites and instru-
ments were carried away, they fell gently to the ground and were
recovered uninjured. It would be tedious to recount the vicissitudes
of kiteflying at Blue Hill which have resulted in the present system of
work, so only a brief historical statement will be given, to be followed
by a description of the methods now in use. At first the Eddy, or
Malay kite, as it is sometimes called, was employed. Several of
these kites, which were covered first with paper and later with var-

nished cloth, were coupled tandem to secure greater safety and more
lifting power. The first meteorograph, being a combined recording
thermometer and barometer, was constructed by Mr. Fergusson, who
in November, 1895, united an anemometer with the thermometer. One
of these meteorographs was hung to a ring at the point of attachment
of the two kite lines to the main line, a method which still obtains. In
August, 1895, in conjunction with the Eddy kites there was first used
the cellular or box kite invented by Lawrence Hargrave, of Sydney,
New South Wales, which was built from a description published shortly
before.t At the present time some form of the Hargrave kite is gen-
erally employed at Blue Hill and elsewhere. Notwithstanding the
efficiency of these kites, on account of the weight of the large cord
necessary to control them and the surface which this cord presented to
the wind, it was found impossible to lift the meteorograph to the height
of 2,000 feet. During January, 1896, following Archibald’s example
and the methods of deep-sea sounding described by Captain Sigsbee,
U.S. N., steel pianoforte wire was substituted for cord, and with this
wire, which, although lighter and smaller, had greater strength than
the cord, the height of a mile was reached in July and a mile and three-
quarters in October, 1896.”

Up to this time a reel turned by two men sufficed to draw down the
kites, but with the increasing pull and length of wire recourse to steam
was necessary. In January, 1897, a grant of money was allotted from
the Hodgkins fund of the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose of
obtaining meteorological records at heights exceeding 10,000 feet.
With this grant a steam windlass was built by Mr. Fergusson with
ingenious devices for distributing and measuring the wire, but the
cumulative pressure of the successive coils of wire finally crushed the
drum. Our next apparatus was copied from the deep-sea sounding
machine of Sir William Thomson (now Lord Kelvin), and with it records
were brought down from the prescribed height in October, 1897. Two
meteorographs were made by J. Richard, of Paris, that recorded three
elements, viz, atmospheric pressure (from which the height of the instru-
ment can be calculated), air temperature, and relative humidity. The
first of these meteorographs was ordered in 1896 on the model of one
carried by French aeronauts; but since for use with kites lightness is
all essential, M. Richard constructed his triple recorder for the first
time of aluminum and thereby reduced its weight to 2! pounds.°®

The kites and apparatus now used at Blue Hill are as follows: The
kites generally have two rectangular cells covered with nainsook cloth,
except at their tops and bottoms, and one is secured above the other
by four or more sticks. The wooden frames are as light as possible,
but are made rigid by guys of steel wire which bind them in all diree-

tions. Some of the kites stand nearly 9 feet high and have 64 square —
feet of lifting surface. A very efficient but complex form is Lamson’s
aero-curve folding kite which has the sustaining surfaces of its forward
cell curved like a bird’s wing, while the rear cell, with triangular super-
posed planes, acts as a tailor rudder. Figure 1 shows this kite in position
to rise from the ground. In the bridle or hanger of the Blue Hill kites
an elastic cord has been inserted which stretches when the wind pres-
sure increases beyond a safe amount, causing the kite to fly more nearly
horizontal while the gust lasts. These kites may be started in a wind
which blows more than 12 miles an hour, and they continue to fly in
gales of 50 miles per hour. On Blue Hill the average velocity of the
wind for the year is 18 miles an hour, consequently there are few days
when kites can not be flown there. The flying cords are fastened into
aring at the end of the wire, where the meteorograph is hung. The main
line is steel “‘ music wire,” capable of withstanding a pull of 300 pounds,
and weighing 15 pounds per mile. Several miles of this wire are spliced
together with the greatest care, special pains being taken that no sharp
bends occur which would cause it to break. To manipulate this wire
the deep-sea sounding apparatus, driven by steam, has been modified
by Mr. Fergusson to pull obliquely downwards. ‘The wire from the—
kites passes over a Swiveling pulley which follows the direction of the
wire and registers on a dial the exact length of wire unreeled. Next
the wire bears against a pulley carried by a strong spiral spring, by
which the pull upon the wire at all times is graphically recorded on a
paper-covered drum turned by clockwork. ‘The wire then passes several
times around the strain puliey and is finally coiled under slight tensions
upon a large storage drum. When the kites are to be pulled down,
the strain pulley is driven by a belt from a 2-horsepower Shipman auto-
matic steam engine. When they are rising, the belt is disconnected
and the pull of the kites is sufficient to unreel the wire. The usual rate
of speed at which the wire is drawn in is from 3 to 6 miles an hour.
Figure 2 shows the steam windlass and its zonstructor. In order to lift
the increasing weight of wire it is customary to attach kites at various
points on the wire, according to the pull upon it, so that nearly the
Same angular elevation may be maintained. This is done by screwing
on the wire aluminum clamps to which the flying lines of the kites are
tied or connected by toggles. The meteorograph, made in Paris, is
contained in an aluminum cage of about a foot cube and weighs com-
plete less than 3 pounds. The cage contains a barometer, a thermom-
eter, and a hygrometer which all record their readings automatically on
one cylinder turned by clockwork in twelve hours. It is only necessary
to screen the thermometer from the sun’s rays to obtain the true air
temperature, since the wind insures the circulation of air. A kite
meteorograph just constructed by Mr. Fergusson contains an anemom-
ter, barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer, and yet weighs but 3
pounds. Figure 3 shows this instrument in the air supported by two
of the largest Hargrave kites.

THE EXPLORATION OF THE FREE AIR. Ball

The method of making a kite flight for meteorological purposes at
Blue Hill is as follows: Two large kites, fastened by their cords to the
ring in the main wire, being in the air the meteorograph is hung to the
ring by a cord with a spiral spring interposed to lessen shocks. The
kites are then allowed to rise and to unreel the wire until the angle with
the horizon becomes low, when, by means of the clamp just described,
another kite is added, and so on. After a pause at the highest attain-
able altitude the reel is connected with the steam engine and the kites
are drawn down. The pauses at the highest point, and when kites are
attached or detached, are necessary to allow the recording instruments
to acquire the conditions of the surrounding air, and because at these
times the meteorograph is nearly stationary, measurements of its angu-
lar elevations are then made with a surveyor’s transit. Since the length
of the wire is known the height of the meteorograph can be calculated,
it having been found that the sag of the wire or its deviation, either in
a vertical or horizontal plane, from the assumed chord of the approxi-
mate are which the wire follows, does not introduce an error of more
than 3 per cent in the height so computed. When the meteorograph is
hidden by clouds the altitude is computed from the barometer record
by Laplace’s formula. The time of making each angular measurement
is noted in order that the corresponding point on the curve of the
meteorograph may be determined.

The greatest heights ever reached by kites were above Blue Hill in
the autumn of 1897. On September 19, the meteorograph was lifted
9,250 feet above the hill which is 630 feet above sea level. Seven kites,
having a total lifting surface of 213 square feet, were employed to lift
it and the wire which weighed about 60 pounds, was nearly 4 miles in
length, and transmitted to the reel a maximum pull of 150 pounds.
The flight occupied less than six and a half hours, and during nearly
five hours the meteorograph was a mile or more above sea level. On
October 15, the meteorograph was raised still higher by only four kites,
of which the largest was Lamson’s aero-curve kite, already described,
the total lifting surface being 153 square feet. The height of 11,080
feet above the hill, or 11,710 feet above the sea, was reached with nearly
the same length of wire and amount of pull as on September 19. The
velocity of the wind at the ground varied from 13 to 22 miles per hour »
during the flight, which occupied but four and a half hours. In both
these flights the temperature fell on the average about 1° F, for each 360
feet of ascent, but in the day the decrease was slower in the upper air,
confirming Glaisher’s observations in balloons. Although the sky was
clear, strata of high humidity were encountered both in the ascent and
descent, corresponding to the levels at which the cumulus and alto-
cumulus clouds are known to form. At the highest altitude the air
contained a very small percentage of moisture.

To understand the value of such data it may be necessary to state
that the progress of the science of meteorology demands a knowledge
of the conditions high above the earth’s surface. Although some of

this knowledge has been gained by meteorological stations on moun-
tains in various parts of the world, yet these observations, which have
the distinction of being the only long-continued ones possible at a fixed
height, are affected to a greater or less extent by the mountain itself,
and so do not give the true conditions of the free air. Balloons carry-
ing aeronauts have long been used for this purpose, but the results
obtained, from a meteorological standpoint, are incommensurate with
the expense and risk incurred. Nevertheless, at the last international
meteorological conference in Paris it was voted to recommend the use
of balloons, both captive and free, which carried aeronauts, and free bal-
loons provided only with automatic instruments to record at far greater
heights than man can live. The successful experiments with kites at
Blue Hill led to the recommendation that this method also should be
included in the international scheme for exploring the atmosphere.
An international committee, of which the writer is the American mem-
ber, was appointed to carry out the recommendations. International
cooperation in the work with balloons has been secured in Europe, but
in America attention has been given chiefly to kites. To obtain the
atmospheric conditions up to a height of at least 10,000 feet, kites pre-
sent many advantages over free balloons whenever oneree is wind. Cap-
tive balloons, besides being more expensive than kites, can not attain
nearly so great heights on account of the weight of the cable necessary
to control the balloon. Kites then have these points of superiority:

1. Economy in installation and working.

2. Accurate determination of height by angular measurements.

3. Adequate exposure and ventilation of the thermometers which in
a balloon are bathed in heated and stagnant air. Therefore the tem-
peratures observed at a given height in a balloon are generally warmer
during the ascent than during the descent, which is not the case with
kites.

4, The possibility of making frequent ascents and descents permits
observations to be obtained almost simultaneously in different air strata
ard nearly over a station at the ground where there may be instruments
recording simultaneously.

On the few occasions when the wind is lacking near the bene there
can be substituted the “kite balloon” already tried in Germany, which
will always carry instruments to moderate heights, because it is not
driven down, like the ordinary captive balloon, by the high winds
which pr onal i in the upper air.

The advantages of kites are now becoming recognized, not only in
this country, but abroad. Our Government Weather Bureau has
expressed its intention to equip 20 stations with kite appliances to
obtain synoptic data at the height of a mile in the free air for fore-
casting. In Europe the Blue Hill experiments have been repeated at
Paris and at Strassburg.

About 200 records from kites have been obtained in the free air at
Smithsonian Report, 1897.—Rotch. PLATE III.

heights of 100 to 11,000 feet above Blue Hill, in all kinds of weather.
Most of them are discussed by Mr. Clayton in Appendix B to Part I
of Vol. XLII of the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Har-
vard, and some general conclusions can only be stated here. As
regards wind, the observations show that, as a rule, the wind steadily
increases with elevation, confirming the measurements made upon
clouds. The tendency of the kites as they rise is to come into a cur-
rent from the west, and it is possible, with no great difference of
height, to find currents almost diametrically opposed to each other.
The decrease of temperature with increasing elevation varies under
different conditions. On most days when there are no clouds the tem-
perature falls at the adiabatic rate for unsaturated air, i. e., 1° F. for
each 180 feet of ascent, to the height of a mile or more. On fair days
with clouds the fall is at the above rate to the base of the clouds. In
_ the cloud the rate of fall is slow, and it is still slower above the cloud.
Kite records have been obtained during nearly twenty-four consecutive
hours at a height of about half a mile above the ground. From these
' records it appears that the diurnal change in temperature in the free
air nearly disappears at about 2,500 feet, which is much lower than has
been hitherto supposed. During calm nights there is a marked inver-
sion of temperature, so that the air near the ground is usually much
colder than at the height of a few hundred feet. Indeed, on some
occasions the air may be colder at the ground than at the height of
several thousand feet. Kite flights, which were made daily for a week,
confirm the theory that temperature changes in the upper air are
cyclonic in character, being due to the passage of “warm and cold
waves,” that are more strongly felt in the upper air than near the
ground. The changes with altitude which precede a warm wave are
these: During the day a decrease of temperature at the adiabatic rate
from the ground up to more than 1,000 feet, then a sudden rise of
temperature, amounting to perhaps 15°, followed by a slow fall.
Clouds form when the dew point of the warm current, which over-
flows the cold current, is sufficiently high. Such conditions announce
the arrival of a ‘“warm wave” eight to twenty-four hours in advance
of its appearance at the earth’s surface. The conditions which indicate
the coming of a ‘cold wave” are a rapid fall of temperature, which
exceeds the adiabatic rate up to about 1,000 feet and above that is the
adiabatic rate to 3,000 feet or higher. During the prevalence of the
cold wave the temperature at the height of a mile, which is sometimes
its upper limit, may be 25° or 30° F. lower than at the ground. After
the cold wave has passed, and with the coming of a southeast storm,
the temperature rises rapidly up to a height of 1,000 or 2,000 feet and
then slowly falls. Cloud usually occurs where the temperature begins
to fall, and sometimes this cloud extends downward to the éarth as fog.
The relative humidity generally increases to saturation/ in the clouds
and above them rapidly decreases. In clear weather there may be no

change of relative humidity with altitude, as during cold waves, or
with no change of temperature vertically, both the absolute and rela-
tive humidity may decrease rapidly with increase of altitude, as is the
case in areas of high barometric pressure. At the height of half a
mile the diurnal changes of relative humidity are the inverse of those
at the ground. In brief, then, during fair weather in the upper air the
days are relatively cold and damp, while the nights are warm and dry,
as compared with surface conditions. Electricity is usually noticed on
the kite wire whenever the altitude of the kites exceed 1,700 feet. At
higher altitudes during snowstorms and near thunderstorms the poten-
tial increases and is sufficient to cause strong sparking discharges.
It therefore appears to be only necessary to tap the great atmospheric
reservoir to obtain an inexhaustible supply of electricity, which
perhaps may be applied to the service of man.
THE DEBT OF THE WORLD TO PURE SCIENCE!

By Joun J. STEVENSON.

The fundamental importance of abstruse research receives too little
consideration in our time. The practical side of life is all absorbent;
the results of research are utilized promptly, and full recognition is
awarded to the one who utilizes while the investigator is ignored. The
student himself is liable to be regarded as a relic of medieval times,
and his unconcern respecting ordinary matters is serviceable to the
dramatist and newspaper witlet in their times of need.

Yet every thoughtful man, far away as his calling may be from
scientific investigation, hesitates to accept such judgment as accurate.
Not a few, engrossed in the strife of the market place, are convinced
that, even from the selfish standpoint of mere enjoyment, less gain is
found in amassing fortunes or in acquiring power over one’s fellows
than in the effort to solve nature’s problems. Men scoff at philosoph-
ical dreamers, but the scoffing is not according to knowledge. The
exigencies of subjective philosophy brought about the objective phil-
osophy. Error has led to the right. Alchemy prepared the way for
chemistry; astrology for astronomy; cosmogony for geology. The birth
of inductive science was due to the necessities of deductive science,
and the greatest development of the former has come from the trial of
hypotheses belonging in the borderland between science and philosophy.

My effort this evening is to show that discoveries, which have proved
all important in secondary results, did not burst forth full grown; that
in each case they were, so to say, the crown of a structure reared pain-
fully and noiselessly by men indifferent to this world’s affairs, caring
little for fame and even less for wealth. Facts were gathered, prin-
ciples were discovered, each falling into its own place until at last the
brilliant crown shown out and the world thought it saw a miracle.

This done, I shall endeavor to draw a moral, which it is hoped will
be found worthy of consideration.

The heavenly bodies were objects of adoration from the earliest
antiquity; they were guides to caravans on the desert as well as to
mariners far from land; they marked the pees of Seasous) or, as

in Egypt, the limits of vast periods embracing many hundreds of years.
Maps were made thousands of years ago showing their positions; the
path of the sun was determined rudely; the influence of the sun and
moon upon the earth was recognized in some degree, and their influence
upon man was inferred. Beyond these matters, man, with unaided
vision and with knowledge of only elementary mathematics, could
not go.

Mathematical investigations by Arabian students prepared the means
by which, after Europe’s revival of learning, one, without wealth, gave
a new life to astronomy. Copernicus, early trained in mathematics,
during the last thirty years of his life spent the hours, stolen from his
work as a clerk and charity physician, in mathematical and astro-
nomical studies, which led him to reject the complex Ptolemaic system
and to accept in modified form that bearing the name of Pythagoras.
Tycho Brahe followed. A mere star-gazer at first, he became an earn-
est student, improved the instruments employed, and finally secured
recognition from his sovereign. For twenty-five years he sought facts,
disregarding none, but seldom recognizing economic importance in any.
His associate, Kepler, profiting by his training under Brahe, carried
the work far beyond that of his predecessors—and this in spite of dis-
ease, domestic sorrows, and only too frequent experience of abject pov-
erty. He divested the Copernican hypothesis of many crudities, and
discovered the laws which have been utilized by astronomers in all
phases of their work. He ascertained the causes of the tides, with the
aid of the newly invented telescope made studies of eclipses and occu-
lations, and just missed discovering the law of gravitation. He laid
the foundation for practical application of astronomy to everyday life.

In the eighteenth century astronomy was recognized by governments
as no longer of merely curious interest, and its students received
abundant aid. The improvement of the telescope, the discovery of.
the law of gravitation, and the invention of logarithms had made pos-
sible the notable advances marking the close of the seventeenth
century. The increasing requirements of accuracy led to exactness in
the manufacture of instruments, to calculation and recalculation of
tables, to long expeditions for testing methods as well as conclusions,
until finally the suggestion of Copernicus, the physician, and of Kepler,
the ill-fed invalid, became fact, and astronomical results were utilized
to the advantage of mankind. The voyager on the ocean and the
agriculturist on land alike reap benefit from the accumulated observa-
tions of three centuries, though they know nothing of the principles or
of the laborers by whom the principles were discovered. The regula-
tion of chronometers as well as the fixing of boundary lines between
great nations is determined by methods due to slow accumulation of
facts, slower development in analysis and calculation, and even slower
improvement in instruments.

Galvani’s observations that frogs’ legs twitch when near a friction

machine in operation led him to test the effect of atmospheric electricity
upon them. The instant action brought about the discovery that it was
due not to atmospherie influence, but to a current produced by contact
of acopper hook with an iron rail. Volta pursued the investigation and
constructed the pile which bears his name. With this, modified, Davy,
in 1807, decomposed potash and soda, thereby isolating potassium and
sodium. This experiment, repeated successfully by other chemists,
was the precursor of many independent investigations, which directed

_ to many lines of research, each increasing in interest as it was followed.

Volta’s crown of cups expanded into the clumsy trough batteries
which were displaced finally in 1836 by Daniel’s constant battery, using
two fluids, one of which was cupric sulphate. De la Rue observed
that, as the sulphate was reduced, the copper was deposited on the
surface of the outer vessel and copied accurately all markings on that
surface. Within two cr three years Jacobi and Spencer made the
practical application of this observation by reproducing engravings
and medals. Thus was born the science of electro-metallurgy. At first
mere curiosities were made, then electroplating in a wider way, the
electrotype, the utilization of copper to protect more easily destructible
metals, the preparation of articles for ornament and utility by covering
baser metals with copper or silver or gold, while now the development
of electro-generators has led to wide applications in the reduction of
metals and to the saving of materials which otherwise would go to
waste.

Oersted, in 1819-20, puzzling over the possible relations of voltaic
electricity to magnetism, noticed that a conductor carrying an electrical
current becomes itself a magnet and deflects the needle. Sturgeon,
working along the same lines, found that soft iron inclosed in a coil
through which a current passes becomes magnetic, but loses the power
when the current ceases. This opened the way for our own Henry’s
all-important discovery of the reciprocating electro magnets and the
vibrating armature—the essential parts of the magnetic telegraph.
Henry actually constructed a telegraph in 1832, winding the wires
around his class room in Albany and using a bell to record the making
and breaking signals. Here, as he fully recognized, was everything
but a simple device for receiving signals.

Several years later Professor Morse, dreaming night and day of the
telegraph, was experimenting with Moll’s electro-magnet and finding
only discouragement. His colleague, Professor Gale, advised him to
discard the even then antiquated apparatus and to utilize the results
given in Henry’s discussion. At once the condition was changed, and
soon the ingenious recording instrument bearing Morse’s name was
constructed. Henry’s scientific discoveries were transmuted by the
inventor’s ingenuity into substantial glory for Morse and proved a
source of inconceivable advantage to the whole civilized world. Stein-
hal’s discovery that the earth can be utilized for the return current
328 THE DEBT OF THE WORLD TO PURE SCIENCE.

completed the series of fundamental discoveries, and since that time
everything has been elaboration.

Oersted’s discovery respecting the influence of an electric current,
closely followed by that of Arago in the same direction, opened the way
for Faraday’s complete discovery of induction, which underlies the con-
struction of the dynamo. This ascertained, the province of the inven-
tor was well defined—to conjure some mechanical appliance whereby
the principle might be utilized. But here as elsewhere the work ~
of discovery and that of invention went on almost pari passu; the
results of each increased those of the other. The distance from the
Clark and Page machines of the middle thirties, with their cumbrous
horseshoe magnets and disproportionate expenditure of power, to the
Siemens machine of the fifties was long, but it was no leap. In like
manner Slow steps marked progress thence to the Gramme machine, in
which one finds the outgrowth of many years of labor by many men,
both investigators and inventors. In 1870, forty years after Faraday’s
announcement of the basal principle, the stage was reached whence
progress could be rapid. Since that time the dynamo has been brought
into such stage of efficiency that the electro-motor seems likely to dis-
place not merely the steam engine, but also other agencies in direct
application of force. The horse is passing away and the trolley road
runs along the country highway; the longer railways are considering
the wisdom of changing their power; cities are lighted brilliantly where
formerly the gloom invited highwaymen to ply their trade, and even the
kitchen is invaded by new methods of heating.

Long ago it was known that if the refining of pig iron be stopped
just before the tendency to solidify became pronounced the wrought
iron is more durable than that obtained in the completed process.
Thus, imperfectly refined metal was made frequently, though uninten-
tionally and ignorantly. A short railroad in southwestern Pennsylva-
nia was laid in the middle sixties with iron rails of light weight. A
rail’s life in those days rarely exceeded five years, yet some of those
light rails were in excellent condition almost fifteen years afterwards,
though they had carried a heavy coke traffic for several years. But
this process was uncertain, and the best puddlers could never tell
when to stop the process in order to obtain the desired grade.

When a modification of this refining process was attempted on a
grand scale almost contemporaneously by Martien in this country and
Bessemer in England, the same uncertainty of product was encountered;
sometimes the process was checked too soon, at others pushed too far.
Here the inventor came to a halt. He could use only what was known
and endeavor to improve methods of application. Under such condi-
tions the Bessemer process was apparently a hopeless failure. Another,
however, utilized the hitherto ignored work of the closet investigator.
The influence of manganese in counteracting the effects of certain inju-
rious substances and its relation to carbon when present in pig iron
THE DEBT OF THE WORLD TO PURE SCIENCE. 329

were understood as matters of scientific interest. Mushet recognized
the bearing of these facts and used them in changing the process. His
method proved successful, but, with thorough scientific forgetfulness
of the main chance, he neglected to pay some petty fees at the Patent
Office and so reaped neither profit nor popular glory for his work.

The Mushet process having proved the possibility of immediate
and certain conversion, the genius of the inventor fcund full scope.
The change in form and size of the converter, the removable base, the
use of trunnions, and other details, largely due to the American, Hol-
ley, so increased the output and reduced the cost that Bessemer steel
soon displaced iron and the world passed from the age of iron into the
age of steel.

Architectural methods have been revolutionized. Buildings ten sto-
ries high are commonplace; those of twenty no longer excite comment,
and one of thirty arouses no more than a passing pleasantry respecting
possibilities at the top. Such buildings were almost impossible a score
of years ago, and the weight made the cost prohibitive. The increased
use of steel in construction seems likely to preserve our forests from
disappearance.

In other directions the gain through this process has been more
important. The costly, short-lived iron rail has disappeared and the
durable steel rail has taken its place. Under the moderate conditions
of twenty-five years ago, iron rails rarely lasted for more than five years;
in addition, the metal was soft, the limit of load was reached quickly,
and freight rates, though high, were none too profitable.

But all changed with the advent of steel rails as made by the Ameri-
can process. Application of abstruse laws, discovered by men unknown
to popular fame, enabled inventors to improve methods and to cheapen
manufacture until the first cost of steel rails was less than that of iron.
The durability of the new rails and their resistance to load justified
increased expenditure in other directions to secure permanently good
condition of the roadbed. Just here our fellow-member, Mr. P. H.
Dudley, made his contribution, whose importance can hardly be over-
estimated. With his ingenious recording apparatus it is easy to dis-
cover defects in the roadway and to ascertain their nature, thus making
it possible to devise means for their correction and for preventing their
recurrence. The information obtained by use of this apparatus has led
him to change the shape and weight of rails, to modify the type of
joints and the methods of ballasting, so that now a roadbed should
remain in good condition and even improve during years of hard use.

But the advantages have not inured wholly to the railroad companies.
It is true that the cost of maintenance has been reduced greatly; that
locomotives have been made heavier and more powerful; that freight
cars carry three to four times as much as they did twenty-five years
ago, so that the whole cost of operation is very much less than formerly.
But where the carrier has gained one dollar the consumer and shipper
330 THE DEBT OF THE WORLD TO PURE SCIENCE.

have gained hundreds of dollars. Grain and flour can be brought from
Chicago to the seaboard as cheaply by rail as by water; the farmer
in Dakota raises wheat for shipment to Europe. Coal mined in West
Virginia can be sold on the docks of New York at a profit for less than
half the freight of twenty-five years ago. Our internal commercial
relations have been changed, and the revolution is still incomplete.
The influence of the Holley-Mushet-Bessemer process upon civilization
is hardly inferior to that of the electric telegraph.

Sixty years ago an obscure German chemist obtained an oily liquid
from coal-tar oil, which gave a beautiful tint with calcium chloride;
five years later another separated a similar liquid from a derivative
of coal-tar oil. Still later, Hofmann, then a student in Liebig’s labora-
tory, investigated these substances and proved their identity with an
oil obtained long before by Zinin from indigo, and applied to them all
Zinin’s term, Anilin. The substance was curiously interesting, and
Hofmann worked out its reactions, discovering that with many mate-
rials it gives brilliant colors. The practical application of these dis-
coveries was not long delayed, for Perkins made it in 1856. The
marvelous dyes, beginning with Magenta and Solferino, have become
familiar toall. The anilin colors, especially the reds, greens, and blues,
are among the most beautiful known. They have given rise to new
industries and have expanded old ones. Their usefulness led to deeper
studies of coal-tar products, to which is due the discovery of such
substances as antipyrin, phenacetin, ichthyol, and saccharin, which
have proved so important in medicine.

One is tempted to dwell for a little upon meteorology, that border
land where physics, chemistry, and geology meet, and to speak of the
signal-service system, the outgrowth of the studies of an obscure school
teacher in Philadelphia, but the danger of trespassing too far upon your
endurance makes proper only this passing reference.

While men of wealth and leisure wasted their energies in literary and
philosophical discussions respecting the nature and origin of things,
William Smith, earning a living as a land surveyor, plodded over Eng-
land, anxious only to learn, in no haste toexplain. His work was done
honestly and slowly; when finished as far as possible with his means,
it had been done so well that its publication checked theorizing and
brought men back to study. His geological map of England was the
basis upon which the British survey began to prepare the detailed
sheets showing Britain’s mineral resources.

In our country Vanuxem and Morton early studied the New Jersey
Cretaceous and Eocene, containing vast beds of marl. Scientific inter-
est was aroused, and eventually a geological survey of the State.was
ordered by the legislature. The appropriation was insignificant, and
many of the legislators voted for it hoping that some economic discov-
ery might be made to justify their course in squandering the people’s
money. Yet there were lingering doubts in their minds and some
THE DEBT OF THE WORLD TO PURE SCIENCE. 331

found more than lingering doubts in the minds of their constituents.
But when the marls were proved to contain materials which the
chemist Liebig had shown to be all-important for plants, the condi-
tions were changed and criticism ceased. The dismal sands of eastern
New Jersey, affording only a scanty living for pines and grasses, were
converted by application of the marl into gardens of unsurpassed
fertility. Vanuxem’s study of the stratigraphy and Morton’s study of
the fossils had made clear the distribution of the marls, and the survey
scattered the information broadcast.

Morton and Conrad, with others scarcely less devoted, labored in
season and out of season to systematize the study of fossil animals.
There were not wanting educated men who wondered why students
of such undoubted ability wasted themselves in trifling employment
instead of doing something worthy of themselves so as to acquire money
and fame. Much nearer to our own time there were wise legislators
who questioned the wisdom of ‘‘ wasting money on pictures of clams
and salamanders,” though the same men appreciated the geologist who
could tell them the depth of a coal bed below the surface. But the
lead diggers of Illinois and Iowa long ago learned the use of paleon-
tology, for the “lead fossil” was their guide in prospecting. The impor-
tance and practical application of this science, so largely the outgrowth
of unappreciated toil in this country as well as in Kurope, is told best
in Professor Hall’s reply to a patronizing politician’s query: ‘And what
are your old fossils good for?” ‘For this: Take me blindfolded in a
balloon; drop me where you will; if I can find some fossils I'll tell you
in ten minutes for what minerals you may look and for what minerals
you need not look.”

Many regard botany as a pleasing study, well fitted for women and
dilletanti, but hardly deserving attention by strong men. Those who
speak thus only exercise the prerogative of ignorance, which is to
despise that which one is too old or too lazy to learn. The botanist’s
work is not complete when the carefully-gathered specimen has been
placed in the herbarium with its proper label. That is but the begin-
ning, for he seeks the relations of plantsin all phases. In seeking these
he discovers facts which often prove to be of cardinal importance. The
rust which destroys wheat in the last stage of ripening, the disgusting
fungus which blasts Indian corn, the poisonous ergot in rye, the blight
of the pear and other fruits, fall as much within the botanist’s study
as do the flowers of the garden or the Sequoias of the Sierra. Nota few
of the plant diseases which have threatened famine or disaster have
been studied by botanists unknown to the world, whose explanations
have led to palliation or cure.

The ichthyologist, studying the habits of fishes, discovered charac-
teristics which promptly commended themselves to men of practical
bent. The important industry of artificial fertilization and the trans-
portation of fish eggs, which has enabled man to restock exhausted

localities and to stock new ones, is but the outgrowth of closet studies
which have shown how to utilize nature’s superabundant supply.

The entomologist has always been an interesting phenomenon to a
large part of our population. Insects of beauty are attractive, those
of large size are curious, while many of the minuter forms are efficient
in gaining attention. But that men should devote their lives to the
study of the unattractive forms is to many a riddle. Yet entomology
yields to no branch of science in the importance of its economic bear-
ings. The study of the life habits of insects, their development, their
food, their enemies, a study involving such minute detail as to shut
men off from many of the pleasures of life and to convert them into
typical students, has come to be so fraught with relations to the public
weal that the State entomologist’s mail has more anxious letters than
that of any other officer. :

Insects are no longer regarded as visitations from an angry deity, to
be borne in silence and with penitential awe. The intimate study of
individual groups has taught in many cases how to antagonize them.
The scab threatened to destroy orange-culture in California; the Colo-
rado beetle seemed likely to ruin one of our important food crops;
minute aphides terrified raisers of fruit and cane in the Sandwich
Islands. But the scab is no longer a frightful burden in California;
the potato bug is now only an annoyance, and the introduction of lady
birds swept aphides from the Sandwich Islands. The gypsy moth,
believed for more than a hundred years to be a special judgment, is no
longer thought of as more than a very expensive nuisance. The cur-
culio, the locust, the weevil, the chinch bug, and others have been
subjected to detailed investigation. In almost all cases methods have
been devised whereby the ravages have been diminished. Even the
borers, which endangered some of the most important timber species,
are now understood, and the possibility of their extermination has been
changed into probability.

Having begun with the ‘infinitely great,” we may close this sum-
mary with a reference to the ‘infinitely small.” The study of fer-
mentation processes was attractive to chemists and naturalists, each
claiming ownership of the agencies. Pasteur, with a patience almost
incredible, revised the work of his predecessors and supplemented it
with original investigations, proving that a very great part of the
changes in organic substances exposed to the atmosphere are due pri-
marily to the influence of low animals or plants, whose germs exist in
the atmosphere.

One may doubt whether Pasteur had any conception of the possibili-
ties hidden in his determination of the matters at issue. The canning
of meats and vegetables is no longer attended with uncertainty, and
scurvy is no longer the bane of explorers; pork, which has supplied
material for the building of railroads, the digging of canals, the con-
Struction of ships, can be eaten without fear. Flavorless butter can be

rendered delicious by the introduction of the proper bacteria; sterilized
milk saves the lives of many children; some of the most destructive
plagues are understood and the antidotes are prepared by the culture
of antagonistic germs; antiseptic treatment has robbed surgery of half
its terrors, and has rendered almost commonplace operations which,
less than two decades ago, were regarded as justifiable only as a last
resort. The practice of medicine has been advanced by outgrowths of
Pasteur’s work almost as much as it was by Liebig’s chemical investi-
gations more than half a century ago.

In this review the familiar has been chosen for illustration in prefer-
ence to the wonderful, that your attention might not be diverted from
the main issue, that the foundation of industrial advance was laid by
workers in pure science, for the most part ignorant of utility and caring
little about it. There is here no disparagement of the inventor; with-
out his perception of the practical and his powers of combination the
world would have reaped little benefit from the student’s researches.
But the investigator takes the first step and makes the inventor possi-
ble. Thereafter the inventor’s work aids the investigator in making
new discoveries, to be utilized in their turn.

Investigation, as such, rarely receives proper recognition. It is usu-
ally regarded as quite a secondary affair, in which scientific men find
their recreation. Ifa geologist spends his summer vacation in an effort
to solve some perplexing structural problem he finds, on his return,
congratulations because of his glorious outing; the astronomer, the
physicist, and the chemist are all objects of semienvious regard, because
they are able to spend their leisure hours in congenial amusements;
while the naturalist, enduring all kinds of privation, is not looked upon
as a laborer, because of the physical enjoyment which most good people
think his work must bring.

It is true that investigation, properly so-called, is made secondary,
but this is because of necessity. Scientific men in Government service
are hampered constantly by the demand for immediately useful results.
Detailed investigation is interrupted because matters apparently more
important must be considered. The conditions are even more unfavor-
able in most of our colleges and none too favorable in our greater
universities. The “literary leisure” supposed to belong to college pro-
fessors does not fall to the lot of teachers of science, and very little of
it can be discovered by college instructors in any department. The
intense competition among our institutions requires that professors be
magnetic teachers, thorough scholars, active in social work, and given
to frequent publication, that, being prominent, they may be living
advertisements of the institution. How much time, opportunity, or
energy remains for patient investigation some may )e able to imagine.

The misconception respecting the relative importance of investiga-
tion is increased by the failure of even well-educated men to appreciate
the changed conditions in science. The ordinary notion of scientific
334 THE DEBT OF THE WORLD TO PURE SCIENCE.

ability is expressed in the popular saying that a competent surgeon
can saw a bone with a butcher knife and carve muscle with a handsaw.
Once, indeed, the physicist needed little aside from a spirit lamp, test
tubes, and some platinum wire or foil; low power microscopes, small
reflecting telescopes, rude balances, and home-made apparatus certainly
did wonderful service in their day; there was a time when the finder of
a mineral or fossil felt justified in regarding it as new and in describing
it as such; when a psychologist needed only his own great self as a
basis for broad conclusions respecting all mankind. All of that
belonged to the infancy of science, when little was known and any
observation was liable to be a discovery; when a Humboldt, an Arago,
or an Agassiz was possible. But all is changed; workers are multiplied
in every land; study in every direction is specialized; men have ceased
the mere gathering of facts and have turned to the determination of
relations. Long years of preparation are needed to fit one to begin
investigation; familiarity with several languages is demanded; great
libraries are necessary for constant reference, and costly apparatus is
essential even for preliminary examination. Where tens of dollars once
supplied the equipment in any branch of science, HMC euls, yes, thou-
sands, of dollars are required now.

F silnne to appreciate the changed conditions induces neglect to
render proper assistance. As matters now stand, even the wealthiest
of our educational institutions can not be expected to carry the whole
burden, for endowments are insufficient to meet the too rapidly increas-
ing demand for wider range of instruction. It is unjust to expect that
men, weighted more and more by the duties of science teaching, involv-
ing, too often, much physical Jabor from which teachers of other sub-
jects are happily free, should conduct investigations at their own
expense and in hours devoted by others to relaxation. Even were the
pecuniary cost comparatively small, to impose that would be unjust,
for, with few exceptions, the results are given to the world without
compensation. Scientific men are accustomed to regard patents much
as regular physicians regard advertising.

America owes much to closet students as well as to educated invent-
ors who have been trained in scientific modes of thought. The extraor-
dinary development of our material resources—our manufacturing,
mining, and transporting interests—shows that the strengthening of our
educational institutions on the scientific side brings actual profit
to the community. But most of this strengthening is due primarily
to unremunerated toil of men dependent on the meager salary of college
instructors or Government officials in subordinate positions. Their
aptitude to fit others for usefulness, coming only from long training,
was acquired in hours stolen from sleep or from time needed for recupera-
tion. But the labors of such men have been so fruitful in results that
we can no longer depend on the surplus energy of scientific men, unless
we consent to remain stationary. If the rising generation is to make
THE DEBT OF THE WORLD TO PURE SCIENCE. 335

the most of our country’s opportunities it must be educated by men
who are not compelled to acquire aptness at the cost of vitality. The
proper relation of teaching-labor to investigation-labor should be
recognized, and investigation, rather than social, religious, or political
activity, should be a part of the duty assigned to college instructors.

Our universities and scientific societies ought to have endowments
specifically for aid in research. The fruits of investigations due to
Smithson’s bequest have multiplied his estate hundreds of times over
to the world’s advantage. He said well that his name would be remem-
bered long after the names.and memory of the Percy and Northumber-
land families had passed away. Hogkins’ bequest to the Smithsonian
Institution is still too recent to have borne much fruit, but men already
wonder at the fruitfulness of a field supposed to be well explored.
Nobel knew how to apply the results of science; utilizing the chemist’s
results, he applied nitroglycerin to industrial uses; similarly he devel-
oped the petroleum industry of Russia and, like that of our American
petroleum manufacturers, his influence was felt in many other industries
of his own land and of the Continent. At his death he bequeathed
millions of dollars to the Swedish Academy of Sciences that the income
might be expended in encouraging pure research. Smithson, Hodg-

“kins, and Nobel have marked out a path which should be crowded
with Americans.

The endowment of research is demanded now as never before. The
development of technical education, the intellectual training of men to
fit them for positions formerly held by mere tyros, has changed the
material conditions in America. The surveyor has disappeared—none
but a civil engineer is trusted to lay out even town lots; the founder
at an iron furnace is no longer merely a graduate of the casting house—
he must be a graduate in metallurgy; the manufacturer of paints can
not intrust his factory to any but a chemist of recognized standing;
no graduate from the pick is placed in charge of mines—a mining
engineer alone can gain confidence; and soeverywhere. With the will
to utilize the results of science there has come an intensity of competi-
tion in which victory. belongs only to the best equipped. The profit
awaiting successful inventors is greater than ever, and the anxious
readiness to apply scientific discoveries is shown by the daily records.
The Réntgen rays were seized at once and efforts made to find profit-
able application; the properties of zirconia and other earths interested
inventors as soon as they were announced; the possibility of tele-
graphing without wires incited inventors everywhere as soon as the
principle was discovered.

Nature’s secrets are still unknown and the field for investigation is ~
as broad as ever. We are only on the threshold of discovery, and the
coming century will disclose wonders far beyond any yet disclosed.
The atmosphere, studied by hundreds of chemists and physicists for a
full century, proved for Rayleigh and Ramsay an unexplored field

within this decade. We know nothing yet. We have gathered a few
large pebbles from the shore, but the mass of sands is yet to be
explored.

And now the moral has been drawn. The pointing is simple. If
America, which, more than other nations, has profited by science, is to
retain her place, Americans must encourage, even urge,research; must
strengthen her scientific societies and her universities, that under the
new and more complicated conditions her scientific men and her invent-
ors may place and keep her in the front rank of nations.
THE AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE!

By the Right Hon. Lord KELVIN, G. C. V. O.

1. The age of the earth as an abode fitted for life is certainly a sub-
ject which largely interests mankind in general. For geology it is of
vital and fundamental importance—as important as the date of the
battle of Hastings is for English history—yet it was very little thought
of by geologists of thirty or forty years ago; how little is illustrated by
a statement,” which I will now read, given originally from the presi-
dential chair of the Geological Society by Professor Huxley in 1869,
when for a second time, after a seven years’ interval, he was president
of the society.

“TI do not suppose that at the present day any geologist would be
found * * * to deny that the rapidity of the rotation of the earth
may be diminishing, that the sun may be waxing dim, or that the earth
itself may be cooling. Most of us, I suspect, are Gallios, ‘who care for
none of these things,’ being of opinion that, true or fictitious, they have
made no practical difference to the earth, during the period of which a
record is preserved in stratified deposits.” :

2. I believe the explanation of how it was possible for Professor
Huxley to say that he and other geologists did not care for things on
which the age of life on the earth essentially depends is because he
did not know that there was valid foundation for any estimates worth
considering as to absolute magnitudes. If science did not allow us to
give any estimate whatever as to whether 10 million or 10 billion years
is the age of this earth as an abode fitted for life, then I think Professor
Huxley would have been perfectly right in saying that geologists should
not trouble themselves about it, and biologists should go on in their
own way, not inquiring into things utterly beyond the power of human
understanding and scientific investigation. This would have left geol-
ogy much in the same position as that in which English history would
be if it were impossible to ascertain whether the battle of Hastings
took place 800 years ago, or 800 thousand years ago, or 800 million

years ago. If it were absolutly impossible to find out which of these
periods is more probable than the other, then I agree we might be Gal-
lios as to the date of the Norman Conquest. But a change took place
just about the time to which I refer, and from then till now geologists
have not considered the question of absolute dates in their: science as
outside the scope of their investigations.

3. I may be allowed to read a few extracts to indicate how geological
thought was expressed in respect of this subject, in various largely used
popular text-books, and in scientifie writings which were new in 1868,
or not too old to be forgotten. Ihave several short extracts to read
and I hope you will not find them tedious.

The first is three lines from Darwin’s Origin of Species, 1859 edition,
page 287:

“In all probability a far longer period than 300 million years has
elapsed since the latter part of the secondary period.”

Here is another still more important sentence, which I read to you
from the same book:

‘He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles
of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having pro-
duced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how icom-
prehensibly vast have been the vast periods of time, may at once close
this volume.”

I shall next read a short statement from Page’s Advanced Students’
Text-Book of Geology, published in 1859:

‘‘Again where the FORCE seems unequal to the result, the student
should never lose sight of the element TIME: an element to which we can
set no bounds in the past, any more than we know of its limit in the
future.

“It will be seen from this hasty indication that there are two great
schools of geological causation—the one ascribing every result to the
ordinary operations of nature, combined with the element of unlimited
time, the other appealing to agents that operated during the earlier
epochs of the world with greater intensity, and also for the most part
over widerareas. The former belief is certainly more in accordance with
the spirit of right philosophy, though it must be confessed that many
problems in geology seem to find their solution only through the ad-
mission of the latter hypothesis.”

4, I have several other statements which I think you may hear with
some interest. Dr. Samuel Haughton, of Trinity College, Dublin, in
his Manual of Geology, published in 1865, page 82, says:

‘“‘ The infinite time of the geologists is in the past; and most of their
speculations regarding this subject seem to imply the absolute infinity of
time, as if the human imagination was unable to grasp the period of
time requisite for the formation of a few inches of sand or feet of mud,
and its subsequent consolidation into rock.” (This delicate satire is
certainly not overstrained.)

‘“‘ Professor Thomson has made an attempt to calculate the length of
time during which the sun can have gone on burning at the present
rate, and has come to the following conclusion: ‘It seems, on the whole,
AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE. 339

most probable that the sun has not illuminated the earth for 100,000,000
years, and almost certain that he has not done so for 500,000,000 years.
As for the future, we may say with equal certainty, that the inhabitants
of the earth can not continue to enjoy the light and heat essential to
their life for many million years longer, unless new sources, now
unknown to us, are prepared in the great storehouse of creation.”

I said that in the sixties and I repeat it now; but with charming
logicit is held to be inconsistent with a later statement that the sun has
not been shining 60,000,000 years; and that both that and this are
stuitified by a still closer estimate which says that probably the sun
has not been shining for 30,000,000 years! And so my efforts to find
some limit or estimate for geological time have been referred to and put
before the public, even in London daily and weekly papers, to show how
exceedingly wild are the wanderings of physicists, and how mutually
contradictory are their conclusions as to the length of time which has
actually passed since the early geological epochs to the present date.

Dr. Haughton further goes on:

“¢ This result (100 to 500 million years) of Professor Thomson’s, although
very liberal in the allowance of time, has offended geologists, because, having
been accustomed to deal with time as an infinite quantity at their disposal,
they feel naturally embarrassment and alarm at any attenvpt of the science
of physics to place a limit upon their speculations. It is quite possible
that even a hundred million of years may be greatly in excess of the
actual time during which the sun’s heat has remained constant.”

5. Dr. Haughton admitted so much with a candid open mind; but
he went on to express his own belief (in 1865) thus:

“Although I have spoken somewhat disrespectfully of the geological
calculus in my lecture, yet I believe that the time during which organic
life has existed on the earth is practically infinite, because it can be
shown to be so great as to be inconceivable by beings of ovr limited
intelligence.”

Where is inconceivableness in 10,000,000,0002 There is nothing
inconceivable in the number of persons in this room, or in London.
We get up to millions quickly. Is there anything inconceivable in
30,000,000 as the population of England, or in 38,000,000 as the popu-
lation of Great Britain and Ireland, or in 352,704,863 as the population
of the British Empire? Not at all. It is just as conceivable as half a
million years or 500 millions.

6. The following statement is from Professor Jukes’s Students’ Man-
ual of Geology:

“The time required for such a slow process to effect such enormous
results must of course be taken to be inconceivably great. The word
‘inconceivably’ is not here used in a vague but in a literal sense, to
indicate that the lapse of time required for the denudation that has
produced the present surfaces of some of the older rocks is vast beyond
any idea of time which the human mind is capable of conceiving.

“Mr. Darwin, in his admirably reasoned book on the origin of species,
So full of information and suggestion on all geological subjects, estimates
the time required for the denudation of the rocks of the Weald of Kent,
340 AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE.

or the erosion of space between the ranges of chalk hills, known as the
North and South Downs, at three hundred millions of years. The grounds
for forming this estimate are of course of the vaguest description. It
may be possible, perhaps, that the estimate is a hundred times too
great, and that the real timeelapsed did not exceed three million years,
but, on the other hand, it is just as likely that the time which actually
elapsed since the first commencement of the erosion till it was nearly
as complete as it now is, was really a hundred times greater than his
estimate, or thirty thousand millions of years.”

7. Thus Jukes allowed estimates of anything from 3,000,000 to
30,000 millions as the time which actually passed during the denudation
of the Weald. On the other hand, Professor Phillips in his Rede lecture
to the University of Cambridge (1860), decidedly prefers 1 inch per
annum to Darwin’s J inch per century as the rate of erosion, and says
that most observers would consider even the 1 inch per annum too
small for aJl but the most invincible coasts. He thus, on purely geolog-
ical grounds, reduces Darwin’s estimate of the time to less than one
one-hundredth. And,reckoning the actual thicknesses of all the known
geological strata cf the earth, he finds 96,000,000 years as a possible
estimate for the antiquity of the base of the stratified rocks, but he
gives reasons for supposing that this may be an overestimate, and he
finds that from stratigraphical evidence alone we may regard the antiq-
uity of life on the earth as possibly between 38,000,000 and 96,000,000
of years. Quite lately a very careful estimate of the antiquity of strata
containing remains of life on the earth has been given by Professor
Sollas, of Oxford, calculated according to stratigraphical principles
which had been pointed out by Mr. Alfred Wallace. Here it is:!

‘““So far as I can at present see, the lapse of time since the beginning
of the Cambrian system is probably less than 17,000,000 years, even
when computed on an assumption of uniformity, which to me seems
contradicted by the most salient facts of geology. Whatever addi-
tional time the calculations made on physical data can afford us may
go to the account of pre-Cambrian deposits of which at present we know
too little to serve for an independent estimate.”

8. In one of the evening conversaziones of the British Association
during its meeting at Dundee, in 1867, I had a conversation on geolog-
ical time with the late Sir Andrew Ramsay, almost every word of which
remains stamped on my mind to this day. We had been hearing a
brilliant and suggestive lecture by Professor (now Sir Archibald)
Geikie on the geological history of the actions by which the existing
scenery of Scotland was produced. J asked Ramsay how long a time
he allowed for that history. He answered that he could suggest no
limit. to it. I said, “‘ You don’t suppose things have been going on
always as they are now? You don’t suppose geological history has
run through 1,000,000,000 years?” ‘Certainly Ido.” ‘ 10,000,000,000
years?” ‘ Yes.” ‘Thesun isa finite body. You can tellhow many tons
itis. Do you think it has been shining on for a million million years?”

“7 am as incapable of estimating and understanding the reasons which
you physicists have for limiting geological time as you are incapable of
understanding the geological reasons for our unlimited estimates.” I
answered, ‘‘ You can understand physicists’ reasoning perfectly if you
give your mind to it.” I ventured also to say that physicists were not
wholly incapable of appreciating geological difficulties; and so the
matter ended, and we had a friendly agreement to temporarily differ.

9. In fact, from about the beginning of the century till that time
(1867), geologists had been nurtured in a philosophy originating with
the Huttonian system; much of it substantially very good philosophy,
but some of it essentially unsound and misleading—witness this from
Playfair, the eloquent and able expounder of Hutton:

‘¢ How often these vicissitudes of decay and renovation have been
repeated is not for us to determine; they constitute a series of which, as
the author of this theory has remarked, we neither see the beginning
nor the end; a circumstance that accords well with what is known con-
cerning other parts of the economy of the world. In the continuation
of the different species of animals and vegetables that inhabit the
earth, we discern neither a beginning nor an end; in. the planetary
motions, where geometry has carried the eye so far both into the future
and the past, we discover no mark either of the commencement or the
termination of the present order.”

10. Led by Hutton and Playfair, Lyell taught the doctrine of eter-
nity and uniformity in geology; and to explain plutonic action and
underground heat, invented a thermo-electric ‘ perpetual” motion on
which, in the year 1862, in my paper on the “Secular cooling of the
earth,”! published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh, I commeuted as follows:

‘To suppose, as Lyell, adopting the chemical hypothesis, has done,”
that the substances, combining together, nay be again separated elec-
trolytically by thermo.electric currents, due to the heat generated by
their combination, and thus the chemical action and its heat continued
in an endless cycle, violates the principles of natural philosophy in
exactly the same manner, and to the same degree, as to believe that a
clock constructed with a self-winding movement may fulfill the expecta-
tions of its ingenious inventor by going forever.”

It was only by sheer force of reason that geologists have been com-
pelled to think otherwise, and to see that there was a definite beginning,
and to look forward to a definite end, of this world as an abode fitted
tor life.

11. It is curious that English philosophers and writers should not
have noticed how Newton treated the astronomical problem. Playfair,
in what I have read to you, speaks of the planetary system as being
absolutely eternal, and unchangeable; having had no beginning and
showing no signs of progress toward an end. He assumes also that

the sun is to go on shining forever, and that the earth is to go on
revolving round it forever. He quite overlooked Laplace’s nebular
theory; and he overlooked Newton’s counterblast to the planetary
“perpetual motion.” Newton, commenting on his own First Law of
Motion, says, in his terse Latin, which | will endeavor to translate:
‘But the greater bodies of planets and comets, moving in spaces less
resisting, keep their motions longer.” That is a strong counterblast
against any idea of eternity in the planetary system.

12. I shall now, without further preface, explain, and I hope briefly,
so as not to wear out your patience, some of the arguments that I
brought forward between 1862 and 1869, to show strict limitations to
the possible age of the earth as an abode fitted for life.

Kant! pointed out in the middle of last century, what had not
previously been discovered by mathematicians or physical astronomers,
that the frictional resistance against tidal currents on the earth’s
surface must cause a diminution of the earth’s rotational speed. This
really great discovery in natural philosophy seems to have attracted
very little attention—indeed to have passed quite unnoticed—among
mathematicians, and astronomers, and naturalists, until about 1840,
when the doctrine of energy began to be taken to heart. In 1866
Delaunay suggested that tidal retardation of the earth’s rotation was
probably the cause of an outstanding acceleration of the moon’s mean
motion reckoned according to the earth’s rotation as a timekeeper
found by Adams in 1853 by correcting a calculation of Laplace which
had seemed to prove the earth’s rotational speed to be uniform.?
Adopting Delaunay’s suggestion as true, Adams, in conjunction with
Professor Tait and myself, estimated the diminution of the earth’s
rotational speed to be such that the earth as a timekeeper, 1n the course
of acentury, would get twenty-two seconds behind a thoroughly perfect
watch or clock rated to agree with it at the beginning of the century.
According to this rate of retardation the earth, 7,200 million years ago,
would have been rotating twice as fast as now; and the centrifugal force
in the equatorial regions would have been four times as great as its
present amount, which is 345 of gravity. At present the radius of the
equatorial sea-level exceeds the polar semidiameter by 214 kilometers,

which is, as nearly as most careful calculations in the theory of the
earth’s figure can tell us, just what the excess of equatorial radius of
the surface of the sea all round would be if the whole material of the
earth were at present liquid and in equilibrium under the influence of
eravity and centrifugal force with the present rotational speed, and
one-fourth of what it would be if the rotational speed were twice as
great. Hence, if the rotational speed had been twice as great as its
present amount when consolidation from approximately the figure of
fluid equilibrium took place, and if the solid earth, remaining absolutely
rigid, had been gradually slowed down in the course of millions of years
to its present speed of rotation, the water would have settled into two
circular oceans round the two poles; and the equator, dry all round,
would be 64.5 kilometers above the level of the polar sea bottoms.
This is on the supposition of absolute rigidity of the earth after primi-
tive consolidation. There would, in reality, have been some degree of
yielding to the gravitational tendency to level the great gentle slope
up from each pole to equator. But if the earth, at the time of primitive
consolidation, had been rotating twice as fast as at present, or even 20
per cent faster than at present, traces of its present figure must have
been left in a great preponderance of land, and probably no sea at all,
in the equatorial regions. ‘Taking into account all uncertainties,
whether in respect to Adams’ estimate of the rate of frictional retarda-
tion of the earth’s rotatory speed, or to the conditions as to rigidity of
the earth once consolidated, we may safely conclude that the earth was
certainly not solid 5,000 million years ago, and was probably not solid
1,000 million years ago.'

13. A second argument for limitation of the earth’s age, which was
really my own first argument, is founded on the consideration of under-
ground heat. To explain a first rough and ready estimate of it I shall
read one short statement. It is from a very short paper that I com-
municated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on the 18th of December,
1865, entitled ‘‘ The Doctrine of Uniformity in Geology briefly refuted.”

“The ‘Doctrine of Uniformity’ in geology, as held by many of the
most eminent of British geologists, assumes that the earth’s surface
and upper crust have been nearly as they are at present, in temperature
and other physical qualities, during millions of millions of years. But
the heat which we know, by observation, to be now conducted out of the
earth yearly is so great that if this action had been going on with any
approach to uniformity for 20,000 million years the amount of heat lost
out of the earth would have been about as much as would heat by

100° C. a quantity of ordinary surface rock of one hundred times the
earth’s bulk. This would be more than enough to melt a mass of sur-

The fact that the continents are arranged along meridians, rather than in an
equatorial belt, affords some degree of proof that the consolidation of the earth took
place at a time when the diurnal rotation differed but little from its present value.
It is probable that the date of consolidation is considerably more recent than a
thousand million years ago.” Thomson and Tait. Treatise on Natural Philosophy,
second edition, 1883, § 830,

face rock equal in bulk to the wholeearth. No hypothesis as to chemi-
cal action, internal fluidity, effects of pressure at great depth, or possible
character of substances in the interior of the earth, possessing the
smallest vestige of probability. can justify the supposition that the
earth’s upper crust has remained nearly as it is, while from the whole
or from any part ofthe earth so great a quantity of heat has been lost.”

14. The sixteen words which I have emphasized in reading this state-
ment to you (italics in the reprint) indicate the matter-of-fact founda-
tion for the conclusion asserted. This conclusion suffices to sweep
away the whole system of geological and biological speculation demand-
ing an ‘“‘inconceivably” great vista of past time, or even a few thousand
million years, for the history of life on the earth and approximate
uniformity of plutonic action throughout that time, which, as we have
seen, was very generally prevalent thirty years ago among British
geologists and biologists, and which, I must say, some of our chiefs of
the present day have not yet abandoned. Witness the presidents of
the geological and zoological sections of the British Association at its
meetings of 1893 (Nottingham) and of 1896 (Liverpool).

Mr. Teall: Presidential Address to the Geological Section, 1893.
‘The good old British ship ‘ Uniformity,’ built by Hutton and refitted
by Lyell, has won so many glorious victories in the past, and appears
still to be in such excellent fighting trim, that I see no reason why she
should haul down her colors either to ‘Catastrophe’ or ‘ Evolution.’
Instead, therefore, of acceding to the request to ‘hurry up,’ we make
a demand for more time.” one

President Poulton: Presidential Address to the Zoological Section,
1896. “Our argument does not deal with the time required for the
origin of life, or for the development of the lowest beings with which
we are acquainted from the first formed beings, of which we know
nothing. both these processes may have required an immensity of
time; but as we know nothing whatever about them, and have as yet
no prospect of acquiring any information, we are compelled to confine
ourselves as to much of the process of evolution as we can infer from
the structure of living and fossil forms—that is, as regards animals,
to the development of the simplest into the most complex Protozoa,
the evolution of the Metazoa from the Protozoa, and the branching of the
former into its numerous Phyla, with all their classes, orders, families,
genera, and species. But we shall find that this is quite enough to
necessitate a very large increase in the time estimated by the geologist.”

15. In my own short paper, from which I have read you a sentence,
the rate at which heat is at the present time lost from the earth by
conduction outward through the upper crust, as proved by observa-
tions of underground temperature in different parts of the world and
by measurement of the thermal conductivity of surface rocks and
strata, sufficed to utterly refute the doctrine of uniformity as taught
by Hutton, Lyell, and their followers, which was the sole object of that
paper.

I had considered the cooling of the earth due to this loss of heat, and

by traeing backward the process of cooling had formed a definite

estimate of the greatest and least number of million years which can

possibly have passed since the surface of the earth was everywhere red-
hot. I expressed my conclusion in the following statement:

“\WWe are very ignorant as to the effects of high temperatures in
altering the conductivities and specific heats and melting temperatures
ot rocks, and as to their latent heat of fusion. We must, therefore,
allow very wide limits in such an estimate as I have attempted to make;
but I think we may with much probability say that the consolidation
can not have taken place less than 20 million years ago, or we should
now have more underground heat than we actually have; nor more than
400 million years ago, or we should now have less underground heat
than we actually have. That is to say, I conclude that Leibnitz’s epoch
ot emergence of the consistentior status {the consolidation of the earth
from red-hot or white-hot molten matter] was probably between those
dates.”

17. During the thirty-five years which have passed since [ gave this
wide-ranged estimate experimental investigation has supplied much of
the knowledge then wanting regarding the thermal properties of rocks
to form a closer estimate of the time which has passed since the con-
solidation of the earth, and we have now good reason for judging that
it was more than 20 and less than 40 million years ago, and probably
much nearer 20 than 40.

18. Twelve years ago, in a laboratory established by Mr. Clarence
King in connection with the United States Geological Survey, a very
important series of experimental researches on the physical properties
of rocks at high temperatures was commenced by Dr. Carl Barus for
the purpose of supplying trustworthy data for geological theory. Mr.
Clarence King, in an article published in the American Journal of
Science,” used data thus supplied to estimate the age of the earth more
definitely than was possible for me to do in 1862 with the very meager
information then available as to the specific heats, thermal conductivi-
ties, and temperatures of fusion of rocks. I had taken 7,000° F.
(3,871° C.) as a high estimate of the temperature of melting rock.
Even then I might have taken something between 1,000° C. and 2,000°
C. as more probable, but I was most anxious not to underestimate the
age of the earth, and so I founded my primary calculation on the 7,000°
I’. for the temperature of melting rock. We know now from the experi-
ments of Carl Barus* that diabase—a typical basalt of very primitive
character—melts between 1,100° and 1,170° C. and is thoroughly liquid
at 1,200°. The correction from 3,871° to 1,200° C., or 1/3.22 of that
value, for the temperature of solidification would, with no other change
of assumptions, reduce my estimate of 100,000,000 to 1/(3.22)? of its

amount, or a little less than 10,000,000 years; but the effect of pressure
op the temperature of solidification must also be taken into account,
and Mr. Clarence King, after a careful scrutiny of all the data given
him for this purpose by Dr. Barus, concludes that without further
experimental data “we have no warrant for extending the earth’s age
beyond 24,000,000 years.”

19. By an elaborate piece of mathematical bookkeeping I have
worked out the problem of the conduction of heat outward from the
earth, with specific heat increasing up to the melting point as found
by Riicker and Roberts-Austen and by Barus, but with the conductivity
assumed constant; and, by taking into account the augmentation of
melting temperature with pressure in a somewhat more complete man-
ner than that adopted by Mr. Clarence King, I am not led to differ
much from his estimate of 24,000,000 years. But until we know some-
thing more than we know at present as to the probable diminution of
thermal conductivity with increasing temperature, which would shorten
the time since consolidation, it would be quite inadvisable to publish
any closer estimate.

20, All these reckonings of the history of underground heat, the
details of which Iam sure you do not wish me to put before you at
present, are founded on the very sure assumption that the material of
our present solid earth all round its surface was at one time a white- -
hot liquid. The earth is at present losing heat from its surface all round
from year to year and century to century. We may dismiss as utterly
untenable any supposition such as that a few thousand or a few million
years of the present régime in this respect was preceded by a few
thousand or a few million years of heating from without. History,
guided by science, is bound to find, if possible, an antecedent condition
preceding every known state of affairs, whether of dead matter or of
living creatures. Unless the earth was created solid and hot out
of nothing, the régime of continued loss of heat must have been
preceded by molten matter all round the surface.

21. I have given strong reasons! for believing that immediately
before solidification at the surface the interior was solid close up to
the surface, except comparatively small portions of lava or melted rock
among the solid masses of denser solid rock which had sunk through
the liquid, and possibly a somewhat large space around the center
occupied by platinum, gold, silver, lead, copper, iron, and other dense
metals still remaining liquid under very high pressure.

22. I wish now to speak to you of depths below the great surface of
liquid lava bounding the earth before consolidation, and of mountain
heights and ocean depths formed probably a few years after a first
emergence of solid rock from the liquid surface (see 24 below), which
must have been quickly followed by complete consolidation all round
the globe. But I must first ask you to excuse my giving you all my

1On the Secular Cooling of the Earth, Vol. III, Math. and Phys. Papers, §\ 19-33,
AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE. 347

depths, heights, and distances in terms of the kilometer, being about
six-tenths of that very inconvenient measure the English statute mile,
which, with all the other monstrosities of our British metrical system,
will, let us hope, not long survive the legislation of our present parlia-
mentary session, destined to honor the sixty years’ jubilee of Queen
Victoria’s reign by legalizing the French metrical system for the United
Kingdom.

23. To prepare for considering consolidation at the surface let us go
back to a time (probably not more than twenty years earlier as we shall
presently see—24), when the solid nucleus was covered with liquid
lava to a depth of several kilometers; to fix our ideas let us say 40 kilo-
meters (or 4,000,000 centimeters). At this depth in lava, if of specific
gravity 2.5, the hydrostatic pressure is 10 tons weight (10,000,000
gram) per square centimeter, or 10,000 atmospheres approximately.
According to the laboratory experiments of Clarence King and Carl
Barus! on diabase, and the thermodynamic theory” of my brother, the
late Prot. James Thomson, the melting temperature of diabase is 1,170°
C. at ordinary atmospheric pressure, and would be 1,420° under the
pressure of 10,000 atmospheres, if the rise of temperature with pressure
followed the law of simple proportion up to so high a pressure.

24, The temperature of our 40 kilometers deep lava ocean of melted
diabase may therefore be taken as but little less than 1,420° from sur-
face to bottom. Its surface would radiate heat out me space at some
such rate as 2 (gram-water) thermal units centigrade per square centi-
meter per second.’ Thus, in a year (31,500,000 seconds) 63,000,000
thermal units would be lost per square centimeter from the surface,
This is, according to Carl Barus, very nearly equal to the latent heat of
fusion abandoned by a million cubic centimeters of melted diabase in
solidifying into the glassy condition (pitchstone) which is assumed
when the freezing takes place in the course of a few minutes. But, as
found by Sir James Hall in his Edinburgh experiments‘ of one hundred
years ago, when more than a few minutes is taken for the freezing, the
solid formed is not a glass but a heterogeneous crystalline solid of rough
fracture; and if a few hours or days, or any longer time, is taken, the
solid formed has the well-known rough crystalline structure of basaltic
rocks found in all parts of the world. Now, Carl Barus finds that basaltic
diabase is 14 per cent denser than melted diabase and 10 per cent

cal Journal, November, 1850. Reprinted in Math. and Phys. Papers (Kelvin), Vol. I,

3 This is a very rough estimate which I have formed from consideration of J. T.
Bottomley’s accurate determinations in absolute measure of thermal radiation at
temperatures up to 920° C. from platinum wire and from polished and blackened
surfaces of various kinds in receivers of air pumps exhausted down to one ten- |
millionth of the atmospheric pressure. Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., 1887 and 1893,

denser than the glass produced by quick freezing of the liquid. Ie
gives no data, nor do Riicker and Roberts- Austen, who have also experi-
mented on the thermodynamic properties of melted basalt, give any
data as to the latent heat evolved in the consolidation of liquid lava
into rock of basaltic quality. Guessing it as three times the latent heat
of fusion of the diabase pitchstone, I estimate a million cubic centime-
ters of liquid frozen per square centimeter per centimeter per three
years. This would diminish the depth of the liquid at the rate of a
million centimeters per three years, or 40 kilometers in twelve years.

25. Let us now consider in what manner this diminution of depth of
the lava ocean must have proceeded by the freezing of portions of it;
all having been at temperatures very little below the assumed 1,420°
melting temperature of the bottom when the depth was 40 kilometers.
The loss of heat from the white-hot surface (temperatures from 1,420° to
perhaps 1,380° in different parts), at our assumed rate of 2 (gram-
water centigrade) thermal units per square centimeter per second pro-
duces very rapid cooling of the liquid within a few centimeters of the
surface (thermal capacity 0.36 per gram, according to Barus), and in
consequence great downward rushes of this cooled liquid and upward
of hot liquid, spreading out horizontally in all directions when it reaches
the surface. When the sinking liquid gets within perhaps 20 or 10 or 5
kilometers of the bottom, its temperature! becomes the freezing point
as raised by the increased pressure; or, perhaps more correctly stated,
a temperature at which some of its ingredients crystallize out of it.
Hence, beginning a few kilometers. above the bottom, we have a snow
shower of solidified lava or of crystalline flakes, or prisms, or granules
of feldspar, mica, hornblende, quartz, and other ingredients; each little
crystal gaining mass and falling somewhat faster than the descending
liquid around it till it reaches the bottom. This process goes on until,
by the heaping of granules and crystals on the bottom, our lava ocean
becomes silted up to the surface.

PROBABLE ORIGIN OF GRANITE.

26. Upon the suppositions we have hitherto made we have, at the
stage now reached, all round the earth at the same time a red-hot or
white-hot surface of solid granules or crystals, with interstices filled by
the mother liquor still liquid, but ready to freeze with the slightest
cooling. The thermal conductivity of this heterogeneous mass, even
before the freezing of the liquid part, is probably nearly the same as
that of ordinary solid granite or basalt at a red heat, which is almost
certainly? somewhat less than the thermal conductivity of igneous
rocks at ordinary temperatures. If you wish to see for yourselves how

'The temperature of the sinking liquid rock rises in virtue of the increasing pres-
‘sure; but much less than does the freezing point of the liquid or of some of its
ingredients. (See Kelvin Math. and Phys. Papers, Vol. ILI, pages 69, 70.)

“AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE. 349

quickly it would cool when wholly solidified, take a large macadamizing
stone and heat it red-hot in an ordinary coal fire. Take it out with a
pair of tongs and leave it on the hearth or on a stone slab at a distance
from the fire, and you will see that in a minute or two, or perhaps ip
less than a minute, it cools to below red heat.

27. Half an hour! after solidification reached up to the surface in
any part of the earth the mother liquor among the granules must have
frozen to a depth of several centimeters below the surface, and must
have cemented together the granules and crystals, and so formed a
crust of primeval granite comparatively cool at its upper surface and
red-hot to white-hot, but still all solid a little distance down, becoming
thicker and thicker very rapidly at first, and after a few weeks certainly
cold enough at its outer surface to be touched by the hand.

PROBABLE ORIGIN OF BASALTIC ROCK.

28. We have hitherto left without much consideration the mother
liquor among the crystalline granules at all depths below the bottom
of our shoaling lava ocean. It was probably this interstitial mother
liquor that was destined to form the basaltic rock of future geological
time. Whatever be the shapes and sizes of the solid granules when
first falling to the bottom, they must have lain in loose heaps with a
somewhat large proportion of space occupied by liquid among them;
but at considerable distances down in the heap the weight of the super-
incumbent granules must tend to crush corners and edges into fine
powder. If the snow shower had taken place in air, we may feel pretty
sure, even with the slight knowledge which we have of the hardnesses of
the crystals of feldspar, mica, and hornblende, and of the solid granules
of quartz, that at a depth of 10 kilometers enough of matter from the
corners and edges of the granules of different kinds would have been
crushed into powder of various degrees of fineness to leave an exceed-
ingly small proportionate volume of air in the interstices between the
solid fragments. But in reality the effective weight of each solid par-
ticle, buoyed as it was by hydrostatic pressure of a liquid less dense
than itself by not more than 20 or 15 or 10 per cent, can not have been
more than from about one-fifth to one-tenth of its weight in air, and
therefore the same degree of crushing effect as would have been expe-
rienced at 10 kilometers with air in the interstices, must have been
experienced only at depths of from 50 to 100 kilometers below the bot-
tom of the lava ocean.

29. A result of this tremendous crushing together of the solid gran-
ules must have been to press out the liquid from among them, as water
from a sponge, and cause it to pass upward through the less and less
closely packed heaps of solid particles and out into the lava ocean

1 Witness the rapid cooling of lava running red-hot or white-hot from a volcano,
and after a few days or weeks presenting a black, hard crust, strong enough and cool

350 AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE.

above the heap. But, on account of the great resistance against the
liquid permeating upward 30 or 40 kilometers through interstices
among the solid granules, this process must have gone on somewhat
slowly, and during all the time of the shoaling of the lava ocean there
may have been a considerable proportion of the whole volume occupied
by the mother liquor among the solid granules, down to even as low as
50 or 100 kilometers below the top of the heap or bottom of the ocean
at each instant. When consolidation reached the surface, the oozing
upward of the mother liquor must have been still going on to some
degree. Thus probably for a few years after the first consolidation at
the surface, not probably for as long as one hundred years, the settle-
‘ment of the solid structure by mere mechanical crushing of the cor-
ners and edges of solid granules may have continued to cause the oozing
upward of mother liquor to the surface through cracks in the first-
formed granite crust and through fresh cracks in basaltic crust subse-
quently formed above it.

LEIBNITZ’S CONSISTENTIOR STATUS.

30. When this oozing everywhere through fine cracks in the surface
ceases we have reached Leibnitz’s consistentior status; beginning with
the surface cool and permanently solid and the temperature increasing
to 1,150° C. at 25 or 50 or 100 meters below the surface.

PROBABLE ORIGIN OF CONTINENTS AND OCEAN DEPTHS OF THE
EARTH.

31. If the shoaling of the lava ocean up to the surface had taken
place everywhere at the same time the whole surface of the consistent
solid would be the dead level of the liquid lava all round, just before its
depth became zero. On this supposition there seems no possibility
that our present day continents could have risen to their present
heights and that the surface of the solid in its other parts could have
sunk down to their present ocean depths during the twenty or twenty-
five million years which may have passed since the consistentior status
began, or during any time, however long. Rejecting the extremely
improbable hypothesis that the continents were built up of meteoric
matter tossed from without upon the already solidified earth, we have
no other possible alternative than that they are due to heterogeneous-
ness in different parts of the liquid which constituted the earth before
its solidification. The hydrostatic equilibrium of the rotating liquid
involved only homogeneousness in respect to density over every level
surface (that is to say, surface perpendicular to the resultant of gravity
and centrifugal force); it required no homogeneousness in respect to
chemical composition. Considering the almost certain truth that the
earth was built up of meteorites falling together, we may follow in
imagination the whole process of shrinking from gaseous nebula to
liquid lava and metals, and solidification of liquid from central regions
AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE. 351

outward, without finding any thorough mixing up of different ingre-
dients, coming together from different directions of space—any mixing
up so thorough as to produce, even approximately, chemical homoge-
neousness throughout every layer of equal density. Thus, we have no
difficulty in understanding how even the gaseous nebula, which at one
time constituted the matter of our present earth, had in itself a hetero-
geneousness from which followed, by dynamical necessity, Europe, Asia,
Africa, America, Australia, Greenland and the Antarctic Continent, and
the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic ocean depths, as we know
them at present.

32. We may reasonably believe that a very slight degree of chemical
heterogeneousness could cause great differences in the heaviness of the
snow shower of granules and crystals on different regions of the bottom
of the lava ocean when still 50 or 100 kilometers deep. Thus we can
quite see how it may have shoaled much more rapidly in some places
than in others. Itis also interesting to consider that the solid granules
falling on the bottom may have been largely disturbed, blown as it
were into ridges (like rippled sand in the bed of a flowing stream or
like dry sand blown into sand hills by wind) by the eastward horizontal
motion which liquid descending in the equatorial regions must acquire,
relatively to the bottom, in virtue of the earth’s rotation. It is indeed
not improbable that this influence may have been largely effective in
producing the general configuration of the great ridges of the Andes
and Rocky Mountains and of the west coasts of Europe and Africa.
It seems, however, certain that the main determining cause of the
continents and ocean depths was chemical differences, perhaps very
slight differences, of the material in different parts of the great lava
ocean before consolidation.

33. To fix our ideas let us now suppose that over some great areas,
such as those which have since become Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia,
and America, the lava ocean had silted up to its surface, while in other
parts there still were depths ranging down to 40 kilometers at the
deepest. In a very short time, say, about twelve years according to
our former estimate (24), the whole lava ocean becomes silted up to its
surface.

o4. We have not time enough at present to think out all the compli-
cated actions, hydrostatic and thermodynamic, which must accompany
and follow after the cooling of the lava ocean surrounding our ideal
primitive continent. By a hurried view, however, of the affair we see
that in virtue of, let us say, 15 per cent shrinkage by freezing, the level
of the liquid must, at its greatest supposed depth, sink six kilometers
relatively to the continents; and thus the liquid must recede from
them and their bounding coast lines must become enlarged. And just
as water runs out of a sand bank, drying when the sea recedes from it
on a falling tide, so rivulets of the mother liquor must run out from
the edges of the continents into the receding lava ocean. But, unlike

sand banks of incoherent sand permeated by water remaining liquid
our uncovered banks of white-hot solid crystals, with interstices full of
the mother liquor, will, within a few hours of being uncovered, become
crusted into hard rock by cooling at the surface and freezing of the
liquor at a temperature somewhat lower than the melting temperatures
of any of the crystals previously formed. The thickness of the wholly
solidified crust grows at first with extreme rapidity, so that in the
course of three or four days it may come to be as much as a meter. At
the end of a year it may be as much as 10 meters, with a surface almost
or quite cool enough for some kinds of vegetation. In the course of
the first few weeks the régime of conduction of heat outward becomes
such that the thickness of the wholly solid crust, as long as it remains
undisturbed, increases as the square root of the time; so that in one
hundred years it becomes ten times, in twenty-five million years five
thousand times, as thick as it was at the end of one year. Thus, from
one year to twenty-five million years after the time of surface freezing,
the thickness of the wholly solid crust might grow from 10 meters to 50
kilometers. These definite numbers are given merely as an illustra-
tion, but it is probable they are not enormously far from the truth in
respect to what has happened under some of the least disturbed parts
of the earth’s surface.

We have now reached the condition described above in 30, with only
this difference, that instead of the upper surface of the whole solidified
crust being level we have, in virtue of the assumptions of 33, 34,
inequalities of 6 kilometers from highest to lowest levels, or as much
more than 6 kilometers as we please to assume it.

36. There must still be a small but important proportion of mother
liquor in the interstices between the closely packed uncooled crystals
below the wholly solidified crust. This liquor, differing in chemical
constitution from the crystals, has its freezing point somewhat lower—
perhaps very largely lower—than the lowest of their melting points.
But when we consider the mode of formation (25) of the crystals from
the mother liquor we must regard it as still always a solvent ready to
dissolve and to redeposit portions of the crystalline matter when
Slight variations of temperature or pressure tend to cause such actions.
Now as the specific gravity of the liquor is less, by something like 15
per cent, than the specific gravity of the solid crystals, it must tend to
find its way upward, and will actually do so, however slowly, until
stopped by the already solidified impermeable crust, or until itself
becomes solid on account of loss of heat by conduction outward. If
the upper crust were everywhere continuous and perfectly rigid the
mother liquor must inevitably, if sufficient time be given, find its way
to the highest places of the lower boundary of the crust, and there
form gigantic pockets of liquid lava, tending to break the crust above
it and burst up through it.

37. But in reality the upper crust can not have been infinitely strong;
AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE. 353

and, judging alone from what we know of properties of matter, we
should expect gigantic cracks to occur from time to time in the upper
crust, tending to shrink as it cools and prevented from lateral shrink-
age by the nonshrinking uncooled solid below it. When any such

crack extends downward as far as a pocket of mother liquor under-
lying the wholly solidified crust, we should have an outburst of trap
rock or of volcanic lava just such as have been discovered by geologists
in great abundance in many parts of the world. We might even have
comparatively small portions of high plateaus of the primitive solid
earth raised still higher by outbursts of the mother liquor squeezed out
from below them in virtue of the pressure of large surrounding por-
tions of the superincumbent crust. In any such action, due to purely
gravitational energy, the center of gravity of all the material concerned
must sink, although portions of the matter may be raised to greater
heights; but we must leave these large questions of geological dynam-
ics, having been only brought to think of them at all just now by our
consideration of the earth antecedent to life upon it.

38. The temperature to which the earth’s surface cooled within a few
years after the solidification reached it must have been, as it is now,
such that the temperature at which heat radiated into space during
the night exceeds that received from the sun during the day, by the
small difference due to heat conducted outward from within.! One
year after the freezing of the granitic interstitial mother liquor at the
earth’s surface in any locality the average temperature at the surface
might be warmer by 60° or 80° C. than if the whole interior had the
same average temperature as the surface. To fix our ideas, let us sup-
pose at the end of one year the surface to be 80° warmer than it
would be with no underground heat; then at the end of one hundred
years it would be 8° warmer, and at the end of ten thousand years it

1 Suppose, for example, the cooling and thickening of the upper crust has proceeded
so far that at the surface, and therefore approximately for a few decimeters below
the surface, the rate of augmentation of temperature downward is one degree per
centimeter. Taking as a rough average 0.005 c. g.s. as the thermal conductivity of
the surface rock, we should have for the heat conducted outward 0.005 of a gram
water thermal unit centigrade per square centimeter per second (Kelvin Math. and —
Phys. Papers, Vol. III, p. 226). Hence if (ibid., p. 223) we take x;);5 as the radiational
emissivity of rock and atmosphere of gases and watery vapor above it radiating
heat into the surrounding vacuous space (ether), we find 8000 x .005 or 40° C. as
the excess of the mean surface temperature above what it would be if no heat were
conducted from within outward. The present augmentation of temperature down-
ward may be taken as 1° C. per 27 meters as a rough average derived from observa-
tions in all parts of the earth where underground temperature has been observed.
(See British Association Reports from 1868 to 1895. The very valuable work of this
committee has been carried on for these twenty-seven years with great skill, perse-
verance, and success by Professor Everett, and he promises a continuation of his
reports from time to time.) This with the same data for conductivity and radia-
tional emissivity as in the preceding calculation makes 40°/2700 or 0.0148° C. per
centimeter as the amount by which the average temperature of the earth’s surface
is at present kept up by underground heat.

would be 0.8 of a degree warmer, and at the end of twenty-five million
years it would be 0.016 of a degree warmer than if there were no under-
ground heat.

39. When the surface of the earth was still white-hot liquid all round,
at a temperature fallen to about 1,200° C., there must have been hot
gases and vapor of water above it in all parts, and possibly vapors of
some of the more volatile of the present known terrestrial solids and
liquids, such as zinc, mercury, sulphur, phosphorus. The very rapid
cooling which followed instantly on the solidification at the surface
must have caused a rapid downpour of all the vapors other than water,
if any there weré; and a little later, rain of water out of the air, as
the temperature of the surface cooled from red heat to such moderate
temperatures as 40° and 20° and 10° C. above the average due to sun
heat and radiation into the ether around the earth. What that primi-
tive atmosphere was, and how much rain of water fell on the earth in
the course of the first century after consolidation, we can not tell for
certain; but natural history and natural philosophy give us some founda-
tion for endeavors to discover much toward answering the great ques-
tions, Whence came our present atmosphere of nitrogen, oxygen, and
carbonic acid? Whence came our present oceans and lakes of salt and
fresh water? How near an approximation to present conditions was
realized in the first hundred centuries after consolidation of the surface?

40. We may consider it as quite certain that nitrogen gas, carbonic-
acid gas, and steam escaped abundantly in bubbles from the mother
liquor of granite before the primitive consolidation of the surface, and
from the mother liquor squeezed up from below in subsequent eruptions
of basaltic rock; because all, or nearly all, specimens of granite and
basaltic rock which have been tested by chemists in respect to this
question’ have been found to contain, condensed in minute cavities
within them, large quantities of nitrogen, carbonic acid, and water. It
seems that in no specimen of granite or basalt tested has chemically
free oxygen been discovered, while in many chemically free hydrogen
has been found, and either native iron or magnetic oxide of iron in those
which do not contain hydrogen. From this it might seem probable
that there was no free oxygen in the primitive atmosphere, and that if
there was free hydrogen it was due to the decomposition of steam by
iron or magnetic oxide of iron. Going back to still earlier conditions
we might judge that, probably, among the dissolved gases of the hot
nebula which became the earth the oxygen all fell into combination
with hydrogen and other metallic vapors in the cooling of the nebula,
and that although it is known to be the most abundant material of all
the chemical elements constituting the earth none of it was left out of
combination with other elements to give free oxygen in our primitive
atmosphere.

See, for example, Tilden, Proc. R. §., February 4, 1897, ‘‘On the Gases inclosed in
Crystalline Rocks and Minerals.”

AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE. 355

41, It is, however, possible, although it might seem not probable, that
there was free oxygen in the primitive atmosphere. With or without
free oxygen, however, but with sunlight, we may regard the earth as
fitted for vegetable life as now known in some species, wherever water
moistened the newly solidified rocky crust cooled down below the tem-
perature of 80° or 70° of our present Centigrade thermometric scale, a
year or two after solidification of the primitive lava had come up to the —
surface. The thick, tough velvety coating of living vegetable matter
covering the rocky slopes under hot water flowing direct out of the

earth at Banff (Canada)! lives without help from any ingredients of the
atmosphere above it, and takes from the water and from carbonic acid
or carbonates, discolved in it, the hydrogen and carbon needed for its
own growth by the dynamical power of sunlight; thus leaving free
oxygen in the water to pass ultimately into the air. Similar vegetation
is found abundantly on the terraces of the Mammoth Hot Springs and
on the beds of the hot water streams flowing from the geysers in the
Yellowstone National Park of the United States. This vegetation, con-
sisting of conferve, all grows under flowing water at various tempera-
tures, some said to be as high as 74° C. We can not doubt but that
some such conferve, if sown or planted in a rivulet or pool of warm
water in the early years of the first century of the solid earth’s history
and if favored with sunlight would have lived, and grown, and multi-
plied, and would have made a beginning of oxygen in the air if there
had been none of it before their contributions. Before the end of the
century if sun heat, and sunlight, and rainfall were suitable the whole
earth not under water must have been fitted for all kinds of land plants
which do not require much or any oxygen in the air, and which can find
or make place and soil for their roots on the rocks on which they grow,
and the lakes or oceans formed by that time must have been quite fitted
for the life of many or all of the species of water plants living on the
earth at the present time. The moderate warming, both of land and
water, by underground heat, toward the end of the century, would
probably be favorable rather than adverse to vegetation, and there can
be no doubt but that if abundance of seeds of all species of the present
day had been scattered over the earth at that time an important pro-
portion of them would have lived and multiplied by natural selection
of the places where they could best thrive.

42, But if there was no free oxygen in the primitive atmosphere or
primitive water several thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of
years must pass before oxygen enough for supporting animal ie as
we now know it, was produced. Even if the average activity of veg-
etable growth on land and in water over the whole earth was, in those
early times, as great in respect to evolution of oxygen as that of a
Hessian forest, as estimated by Liebig? fifty years ago, or of a culti-

'Rocky Mountains Park of Canada, on the Canadian Pacific Railway.

vated English hayfield of the present day, a very improbable supposi-
tion, and if there were no decay (eremacausis, or gradual recombina-
tion with oxygen) of the plants or of portions such as leaves falling
from plants, the rate of evolution of oxygen, reckoned as three times
the weight of the wood or the dry hay produced, would be only about 6
tons per English acre per annum, or 13 tons per square meter per thou-
sand years. At this rate it would take only one thousand five hundred
and thirty-three years, and therefore in reality a much longer time would
almost certainly be required, to produce the 2.3 tons of oxygen which
we have at present resting on every square meter of the earth’s sur-
face, land and sea.'' But probably quite a moderate number of hundred
thousand years may have sufficed. It is interesting, at all events, to
remark that at any time the total amount of combustible material on
the earth, in the form of living plants or their remains left dead, must
have been just so much that to burn it all would take either the whole
oxygen of the atmosphere or the excess of oxygen in the atmosphere
at the time, above that, if any, which there was in the beginning.
This we can safely say, because we almost certainly neglect nothing
considerable in comparison with what we assert when we say that the
free oxygen of the earth’s atmosphere is augmented only by vegeta-
tion liberating it from carbonic acid and water, in virtue of the power
of sunlight, and is diminished only by virtual burning’ of the vege-
table matter thus produced. But it seems improbable that the average
of the whole earth—dry land and sea bottom—contains at present coal,
or wood, or oil, or fuel of any kind originating in vegetation, to so
great an amount as 0.767 of a ton per square meter of surface, which
is the amount at the rate of 1 ton of fuel to 3 tons of oxygen that
would be required to produce the 2.3 tons of oxygen per square meter
of surface which our present atmosphere contains. Hence it seems
probable that the earth’s primitive atmosphere must have contained
free oxygen.

43. Whatever may have been the true history of our atmosphere, it
seems certain that if sunlight was ready, the earth was ready, both for
vegetable and animal life, if not within a century, at all events within a
few hundred centuries after the rocky consolidation of its surface. But
was the sun ready? The well-founded dynamical theory of the sun’s
heat, carefully worked out and discussed by Helmholtz, Newcomb, and
myself,? says NO if the consolidation of the earth took place as long ago
as fifty million years; the solid earth must in that case have waited

1Jn our present atmosphere, in average conditions of barometer and thermometer,
we have, resting on each square meter of the earth’s surface 10 tons total weight, of
which 7.7 is nitrogen and 2.3 is oxygen.

*This ‘virtual burning” includes eremacausis of decay of vegetable matter, if
there is any eremacausis of decay without the intervention of microbes or other
animals. It also includes the combination of a. portion of the food with inhaled
oxygen in the regular animal economy of provision for heat and power.

AGE OF THE EARTH AS AN ABODE FITTED FOR LIFE. 357

twenty or thirty million years for the sun to be anything nearly as
warm as he is at present. If the consolidation of the earth was fin-
ished twenty or twenty-five million years ago the sun was probably
ready—though probably not then quite so warm as at present, yet
warm enough to support some kind of vegetable and animal life on the
earth.

44, My task has been rigorously confined to what, humanly speak-
ing, we may call the fortuitous concourse of atoms in the preparation
of the earth as an abode fitted for life, except in so far as I have
referred to vegetation, as possibly having been concerned in the prep-
aration of an atmosphere suitable for animal life as we now have it.
Mathematics and dynamics fail us when we contemplate the earth,
fitted for life but lifeless, and try to imagine the commencement of life
upon it. This certainly did not take place by any action of chemistry,
or electricity, or crystalline grouping of molecules under the influence
of force, or by any possible kind of fortuitous concourse of atoms. We
must pause, face to face with the mystery and miracle of the creation
of living creatures.
RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY!

‘By ROBERT BELL,
Of the Geological Survey of Canada.

In the Provinces of Ontario and Quebee it has been found from
actual levelings by Gilbert, Spencer, and Upham that the old shore
lines are not perfectly horizontal, but that they slope upward in a
northeasterly direction at rates varying in different regions from a few
inches to a foot and even 2 feet per mile. If this upward slope were
continued in the same direction to the northeastern extremity of Lab-
rador, 1,300 miles from Lake Huron, the increase in the elevation might
there amount to 1,000 or 2,000 feet. It is scarcely probable that the
differential elevation is constant and regular for such a great distance.
Still, it is a fact that well-preserved shore lines are to be seen at great
heights in the northern parts of Labrador. In my Geological Survey
Report for 1884 I have mentioned ancient beaches at Nachvak, 140
miles south of Hudson Strait, which have an estimated altitude of
1,500 feet above the sea.

The two sides of Hudson Bay present very different physical char-
acters. The eastern is formed mostly of crystalline rocks, and, as a
rule, is more or less elevated, with a broken surface sloping some-
what rapidly westward or toward the bay; while the western side
is mostly very low and much of it is underlaid by nearly horizontal
Silurian and Devonian strata. These low shores are accompanied by
shallow water extending far to seaward. The head of James Bay,
which forms the southern prolongation of Hudson Bay, is extremely
shallow, but the various rivers which flow into it have cut channels
‘through the soft shallows, and by means of these the land may be
approached with seagoing vessels. The whole of Hudson Bay may
be said to be shallow in proportion to its great area, as the soundings
show that it does not average more than 70 fathoms in depth.

The shores of the bay everywhere afford abundant evidence that
there has been a comparatively rapid rise in the land and that the ele-
vation is still going on. I have mentioned numerous proofs of this in
my various official reports on the geology of these regions from 1875

to 1886, and I shall now recall a few of those and give fresh ones in
addition, some of which came to my knowledge on a journey to the bay
during the past summer. It is well known to those who have paid
any attention to the subject that since the establishment of the posts of
the Hudson Bay Company in the mouths of the rivers around the bay,
two hundred years ago, there has been an ever-increasing difficulty in
reaching these establishments from the sea.

On the eastern side the most striking evidence of the rising of the
land is afforded by the numerous well-preserved and conspicuous ter-
races cut in the till and other deposits. Near the sea these may be
seen at various heights, up to about 300 feet, but above this elevation
the searcity of soft material out of which terraces might be excavated
renders this kind of evidence less apparent than it might otherwise be
at higher levels.

On this side of the bay one of the best evidences that the elevation
of the land is still going on is furnished by the long lines of driftwood
which one sees in many places far above the reach of the highest tides.

The old beaches, on which this wood is plainly seen, occur at various
levels up to about 30 feet above high tide, but the remains of rotten
wood may be detected in some localities up to nearly 50 feet, above
which it has disappeared from the ancient shores by long exposure to
the weather. This driftwood consists principally of spruce, but a little
white cedar and other kinds, which have been brought down by the
rivers, are also mixed with it. The bark having been worn off by the
action of the waves while the trunks were still fresh has tended to their
preservation. Owing principally to the salt water and the cold climate,
wood endures for an incredibly long time in exposed situations in this
region wherever it has an opportunity of drying quickly after rain.
Some of the wood which may still be seen upon the higher levels may
be upward of six hundred years old.

It has been suggested that all this driftwood along hundreds of miles
of coast may have been thrown up by some extraordinarily high tide.
But there are many reasons why this is quite unlikely. It seems
impossible that any modern tide could rise to such a great height and
deposit so much wood at different levels all at once and in such even
lines, following all the sinuosities of more than one of the raised
beaches. The suppositious extraordinary tide would necessarily be
of brief duration, and would be accompanied by a tremendous gale
blowing upon the coast. This would have the effect of throwing the
wood in confused heaps and only into situations favorable for catching
it, such as angles of the shore. But instead of this we find it at differ-
ent levels laid longitudinally all along, as if accumulated by slow
degrees with moderate winds from every quarter. The fact that the
wood is freshest along the lower lines and becomes progressively more
decayed as we ascend, and that finally only traces remain on the
higher levels, shows that it must have been stranded from time to time
RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY. 361

as the land was rising above the sea, and we are forced to adopt this
obvious view of the case.

In support of the paroxysmal tide theory, it is related that once dur-
ing a northern gale the tide was forced as high as the front gate in the
palisaded inclosure at Rupert House, near the head of James Bay, and
it is added that this would be equivalent to a height of about 30 feet.
When at Rupert House last summer, I could hear no authentic account
of such an extraordinary rise in the water, and, besides, the gate referred
to did not appear to be more than 15 feet above the sea level. But
even if such a great rise in the water had once occurred at this place,
it would prove nothing in regard to the raised beaches on the long
straight shore out on the open sea. Hudson Bay is about 1,000 miles
long and its outline is funnel-shaped, with James Bay representing the
contracted extremity. Rupert House is situated near the end of this
narrow continuation, so that just here we should expect very high
water with a spring tide and northern gales driving the sea in from the
broad expanse outside and heaping it up at the extremity of the con-
stantly narrowing termination.

The gravel terraces seen at various elevations around the coves and
upon the thousands of small islands along the east coast of James Bay
are remarkably sharp and well preserved and almost as fresh-looking
as if they had been formed but yesterday. ‘They are generally bare of
trees or bushes and the yet smooth surface pebbles are onty partially
covered by lichens. Similar terraces may be seen farther north on this
coast and in Hudson Strait, wherever material exists out of which they
may be formed. On Marble Island the raised beaches are very plainly
visible on account of the whiteness of their smooth quartzite shingle.

On the west side of Hudson Bay the land is generally too low to
admit of the relatively higher sea levels of former times having been
recorded in the shape of terraces near the present shore line, but if we
go back into the woods we shall find unmistakable evidence of the
existence of such higher levels at comparatively recent periods. These
consist of long, low ridges of drifted materials, such as we see in a
fresher state at the present high-tide mark. They are made up of
driftwood and other vegetable débris in a completely decayed condi-
tion, covered by moss and having trees and shrubs growing upon them.
In some places we may still trace the forms of the larger trunks which
had been cast ashore by the waves at high tide. Between these ridges
and the present shore there is a thick growth of the coniferous forest
and the ground is carpeted with moss, over which the tide has never
passed. Examples of these low ridges may be seen near the head of
tide water at the mouth of Nelson River, at Attawapishkat River, and
in places between the latter and Albany River.

To the west and southwest of James Bay the till, covering the nearly
flat Silurian and Devonian rocks, is generally overspread by stratified
clays. Marine shells are found in these up to an elevation of 400 to
362 RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY.

500 feet, but on the eastern side of the bay no fossils have yet been
detected at such high levels, owing perhaps to the scarcity there of
marine deposits and to the fact that but little search has yet been made
for them. In the sandy deposits among the hills about 20 miles south
of Cape Wolstenholme I saw abundance of Saxicava rugosa and Tellina
grenlandica, with smaller numbers of a few other species, at heights
varying from the sea level up to about 200 feet; and last summer I
found brackish water varieties of a number of the commoner species of
our northern marine shells up to 70 feet above the sea in the clay banks
along the lower portion of the Noddawai River.

Around the head of James Bay and up its western side the encroach-
ment of the outer lines of the forest upon the wide alluvial flats which
extend all along these shores and are constantly broadening toward
the sea is good evidence that a rising of the land is now going on. The
existing condition in this part of the bay is well described by Mr. A. P.
Low in speaking of Agoomski Island. On page 24, J. Geol. Survey
Report for 1887, he says:

“The island closely resembles the adjoining mainland in physical
character, being very low and swampy. The shore line above hbigh-
water mark is made up of muddy flats covered in part with grasses and
sedges, followed farther inland by thick growths of small willows, these
in turn giving place to small black spruce and tamarack as slightly
higher ground is reached. The line of these trees is often over 2 miles
inland from high-water mark, itself a long distance from the sea at low
water.”

No living mollusks are to be found in James Bay, except perhaps in
the northern part, owing probably to the muddy and brackish nature
of the water, but abundance of the dead shells of a considerable num-
ber of kinds are washed out of the clays forming the present shores.
Some of these belong to moderately deep-water species and are well
preserved, retaining the epidermis. This, of course, shows a recent
elevation of the sea bottom.

Richmond Gulf, on the eastern side, is separated from the main bay
by a high bar of stratified rocks, which strike with its length and dip
westward or toward the open sea. This bar is cut through by several
gaps, all resembling one another, except in their heights above the sea,
and all bearing evidence of their having been well-worn channels of
communication at more or less remote times according to the greater
or less elevation of their beds above the sea. Only one narrow passage
now remains open or low enough to admit the water, but two others
are as yet only slightly raised above the tides.

Some of the aboriginal geographical names around the head of James
Bay are significant of considerable changes in the topography since
these shores became inhabited by the natives who still occupy them.
The large peninsula between Hannah and Rupert bays is called
Ministik-oo-watum, which means wooded island with a cove or hole in
it, ministik being the Cree for a wooded island and watum for a cove or
RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY. 363

hole. The heads of the channels, which now run in behind the present
peninsula from the opposite sides, are separated by a strip of low
ground, some 10 miles long, covered by bushes. Midway across this
strip the elevation is estimated to be about 15 feet above high tide.
The most prominent point on the coast between Moose Factory and
Fort Albany is now called ‘“‘Cockispenny” by the whites, but the Cree
name is Ka-ka-ki-sippin-a-wayo Minis, or Island where the Crow-duck
(Cormorant) lays eggs. Since this island became connected with the
mainland, bushes have taken the place of the grasses and sedges which
first grew upon the low ground between them, and the former are con-
stantly acquiring a stronger growth. Many years ago the winter trail
of the coast passed over the neck of this peninsula, but now it has
become necessary to go outside of it, because the bushes have grown so
large that they catch the snow which, in such situations, remains too
soft for dog teams and snow shoers.

The salt marshes along the west coast of James Bay and also in the
vicinity of York Factory, which used to attract vast numbers of wild
geese and ducks, have been gradually drying up, much to the incon-
venience of the Hudson Bay Company’s people, who depended largely
upon them for food.

The character of the lower portions of such rivers as the Moose,
Albany, and Attawapishkat shows a recession of the sea. This is
particularly observable in the lower 30 miles of the Moose, where very
long and narrow or ribbon-like islands run parallel to one another for
many miles. The process of their formation appears to have been a
constant drawing out of their lower extremities as the sea receded
from them, just as the lowest islands of the present day are growing.

On the east main coast, where the land is comparatively high, the
grade of the rivers is rapid as they approach the bay, and in some of
them, as the Nastapoka and the Langlands, there are perpendicular
falls of about 100 feet almost directly into the sea. This condition
indicates recent elevation.

One of the best evidences of the modern rising of the land is to be
found in the beach dwellings of the Eskimo, which may be seen at all
elevations up to about 70 feet. Insummer these people generally camp
on the shore, and their favorite locations are at the mouths of small
streams into which the sea trout run at high tide. Here they construct
weirs of stones, which impound the fish when the tide retires. On Outer
Digges Island, I have found these fish traps and the rings of stones
and other structures marking their old camping places up to a height
estimated at 70 feet.

Among the historical evidences bearing upon this question since the
advent of the white man may be mentioned the fact that in 1610 Henry
Hudson, the navigator, wintered in a bay full of islands on the east
coast south of latitude 53°. None of the bays in this region would now
be possible for this purpose, showing that a considerable change in the
level of the sea has taken place in less than three hundred years.
364 RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY.

In 1674 Charles Bayley, then local governor for the Hudson Bay
Company, sailed through in a sloop between Agoomski Island and the
main west shore of James Bay. It would now be impossible to pass
here in a seagoing vessel of any kind. In 1886 I found it difficult to
get through in bark canoes, drawing only a few inches of water. The
shoaling is not due to a silting up, since the almost dry bottom consists
of a level surface of till with bowlders scattered thickly over it.

From 1675 to 1685 the Hudson Bay Company’s establishment in the
mouth of Moose River was upon Hayes Island, which, it is to be pre-
sumed, was selected for convenience of landing goods from their vessels
and shipping out their returns. This island is now unapproachable ~
except by canoes and small boats. For more than two hundred years
the factory! has stood upon Moose Island, the next below Hayes Island.
The annual ship from England anchors in the channel cut through the
sands off the mouth of Moose River. On account of the risk of rough
water it is necessary to discharge the cargo by schooners. Within the
memory of living men these schooners could ascend to a wharf built
opposite the large storehouse of the factory. But for many years the
same schooners have been unable to ascend all the way, and the cargo
requires to be transferred into scows, which complete the trip to the
wharf; and the distance to which the schooners can ascend is constantly
diminishing. In the beginning of the present century Princess Island,
a narrow, bushy strip immediately in front of the factory, was separated
by a channel with a good depth of water at the lowest tides. Last
autumn I saw it quite dry on several occasions during ebb tide. Itis
well known to everyone who has lived at this post in the present gener-
ation that every now and then a new “lump” will appear in the bed of
the river and become permanent, growing higher and higher, event-
ually escaping submergence at most tides and at length becoming
covered with grass and then with bushes. Some islands which were
covered only with bushes forty or fifty years ago now support a growth
of young trees. The small one on the west side of Middleboro, below
Moose Island, is an example of this, and the appearance of the trees
upon it is within the memory of Mr. Broughton, the gentleman now in
charge of Moose Factory. Middleton Island, between the mouths of
Rupert and Noddawai rivers, lies close to the east shore of Rupert Bay.
Up toa few years ago canoes and boats could pass at high tide through
the long, narrow, grassy channel behind this island, but last autumn I
found it impossible to do so with my canoes, and we were obliged, at
great inconvenience, to go round outside.

Two hundred years ago the ships of the Hudson Bay Company appear
to have had no difficulty in entering the mouths of various rivers on
the Eastmain Coast, which can not now be used as harbors. In old
times the principal post of the company on that coast was in the mouth
of Kastmain River, which had no doubt been chosen because it afforded

RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY. 365

a good harbor. It is only a few years since the mouth of Little Whale
River, several hundred miles farther north, had to be abandoned as a
harbor on account of the increasing shallowness of the water.

At York Factory there is a “ship hole” in the channel of Hayes
River, directly in front of the storehouse. The seagoing vessels of light
draft employed in the Hudson Bay Company’s trade have been accus-
tomed to anchor in this hole, and formerly they remained atloat at all
stages ot the tide, but of late years vessels drawing even less than
those of former times have begun to “take the ground” at low water.
In objection to the belief that the land is rising it may be said this may
be due to a silting up of the hole, but on examining the material
brought up on the flukes of the anchors I found it to consist of light-
colored stiff bowlder clay or till.

In 1782, after the French Admiral Lepeyrouse had destroyed Fort
Prince of Wales at the mouth of Churchill River, he landed with ean-
non on the southeast side of Nelson River, and, hauling them across the
point between it and Hayes River, captured York Factory. Two ships
belonging to the Hudson Bay Company which were then lying in Hayes
River, laden with valuable cargoes, escaped under cover of the dark-
ness of the following night and got safely to England. At the present
time it is only possible for a seagoing vessel to get out from this river
at the top of high water with favorable wind and careful piloting in
daylight. To say nothing of the difficulty caused by the darkness, it
is unlikely that all the other conditions now necessary to enable a ves-
sel to leave the river conspired to aid the escape of these ships. It is
much more reasonable to believe that the water was deeper then than
it is now. The landing of Lepeyrouse with his guns on the shore of
Nelson River abreast of York Factory was a feat the like of which
could not be accomplished at the present day, owing to the extreme
shallowness of the water.

The present Fort Churchill, or ‘“‘ New Fort,” as it is still called, was
built in 1782 on the west side of the river, about 44 miles above Fort
Prince of Wales, as soon as the French had retired after destroying the
latter establishment. The residents now suffer much inconvenience on
account of the continued shoaling of the water, and they have been
obliged to lengthen out their “launch” or long landing trestle from
time to time in order to be able to reach the outer end of it with their
coast boats.

Off the western side of the lagoon, within the mouth of Churchill
River, is Sloops Cove, a small elliptical pond connecting with the lagoon
by a very narrow entrance, through which the water barely passes at
high tide. On the arkose rocks beside this little cove many inscrip-
tions have been cut and some ring bolts have been fastened for moor-
ing vessels, all of which indicate that the cove was used for wintering
Ships in old times. Indeed,it is known that the Furnace and the Dis-
covery, two small ships commanded by Captain Middleton, passed the
366 RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY. ~

winter of 1741-42 in this cove. I have examined the place on various
occasions and have copied most of the sketches and inscriptions on the
rocks, and it always appeared to me that the conditions which we
observe indicate a rise in the land since the last ship wintered there.
At the present time the tide does not rise high enough to allow of the
passage into it of crafts larger than ordinary rowboats. No seagoing
vessel could now enter it, which would indicate an elevation nearly
equal to the draft of the ships formerly frequenting it. It would bea
boon to the agents of the Hudson Bay Company at Churchill if they
could now winter their small schooner in this cove instead of being
obliged to send her every autumn to winter at York Factory. The
captain who commands her happens to be the person now in charge of
the company’s post at Churchill, and both he and his crew are obliged
to walk back 150 miles through the mud from York Factory after leav-
ing their vessel there in the autumn, and to walk the same distance
again to bring her back in the spring. Mr. J.B. Tyrrell visited Sloops
Cove in the autumn of 1893, and in a paper published in the Geological
Magazine for August, 1894, says he thinks the land is here in a state of
equilibrium. Two inscriptions which he saw on the rocks, namely,
‘May 25 and May 27, 1753,” were about 7 feet above the present high
tide, and he thinks these were cut by men standing on the ice. This,
however, does not prove much, for the men were quite as likely to have
sat as stood while engraving these inseriptions. As the tide still enters
the cove and keeps it full of water the average relative level of its ice
to the rocks surrounding it may not have differed much from what it is
now. When I visited Fort Prince of Wales in 1879 oak planks brought
from England while the fort was still occupied, as well as timbers of
native wood, all charred by Lepeyrouse’s fire, were found stranded far
out of reach of the present tides and still in perfect preservation. On
the occasion referred to I met at the ‘‘ New Fort” children of some of
the people who were living at the “‘Old Fort” when it was captured
by the French, and from them some information could be obtained as
to the conditions at that time. We have, besides, the description and
illustrations in the book by Samuel Hearne, who was then in charge of
the place. Any light which these accounts may throw on the state of
matters then as compared with the present time points in the direction
of some elevation having taken place.

Among the photographs which I took around Fort Prince of Wales
in 1879 is one which shows strips of dry land grasses alternating with
little parallel ridges of gravel thrown up by the waves and now above
the highest tide mark, but below the level of the spot which was
pointed out to me as the landing place of Lepeyrouse. The ground on
which the fort stands was an island during high tide at the time the
place was occupied, and a bridge was thrown across the narrowest part
of the little separating channel to connect the island with the mainland.
This channel is now entirely dry.
RISING OF THE LAND AROUND HUDSON BAY. 367

If anything further were wanting to show that an elevation of the
land is now going on in this region we have some direct personal evi-
dence in the lifetime of the witness himself in support of the facts
already cited. About twenty years ago a very aged Indian, who was
said to have ‘‘seen more than a hundred winters,” and who was quietly
passing the last years of his extraordinarily long life at Norway House,
told me in presence of the factor, Mr. Roderick Ross, and the other
gentlemen of that establishment that he had, when a boy, witnessed
the landing of Lepeyrouse and the destruction of Fort Prince of Wales.
He gave graphic details of every circumstance, which agreed perfectly
with Lepeyrouse’s own account, and he answered all my questions on
other points entirely satisfactorily and without a moment’s hesitation.
Among other things, he mentioned that the spot where the French-
men’s boats landed was quite close to that portion of the western wall
which they undermined and blew up with gunpowder. He said that
when all was ready they laid a ‘‘rope” (train) of gunpowder across the
beach and, setting fire to the end of it, ran off to a safe distance to
witness the effect. It is now a considerable distance from this spot to
the nearest point of water at high tide.

The proofs of the rising of the land around Hudson Bay in post-
glacial times would be admitted by any geologist, and the question of
the continuance of the movement at the present time is, I think,
answered in the affirmative by the actual general shoaling of the
water which is going on, and the encroachment of the land on all sides,
some proofs of which have been given in the foregoing pages. All the
facts which have been mentioned (and many more might be added)
point in the same direction, while there appears to be no evidence of
a contrary character. The officers of the Hudson Bay Company are an
intelligent set of men, and their universal opinion, based upon life-
_ times of observation, is that the land all around the bay is rising. The
following is part of a letter recently received from Mr. Joseph For-
tescue, lately a chief factor in the Hudson Bay Company, in answer to
my request for his opinion on this subject:

“ Regarding the rising of the shores of Hudson Bay I have no doubt
whatever. When I was at York Factory I heard several Indians say
that the sea or tide had retired 2 miles from places they remembered
when they were young, and my own observations during twenty years
there would lead me to entertain the same opinion. When I revisited
Moose Factory, after nearly forty years’ absence, I found a great change
in the appearance of the coast and river. Channels which were navi-
gable at all times of the tide formerly could now only be used at high
water.”
CRATER LAKE, OREGON,!

By J. 8. DILLER,
United States Geological Survey.

Of lakes in the United States there are many and in great variety,
but of crater Jakes there is but one of great importance. Crater lakes
are lakes which occupy the craters of volcanoes or pits (calderas) of
volcanic origin. They are most abundant in Italy and Central Amer-
ica, regions in which volcanoes are still active; and they occur also in
France, Germany, India, Hawaii, and other parts of the world where
volcanism has played an important role in its geologic history.

The one in the United States belongs to the great volcanic field of
the northwest, but it occurs in so secluded a spot among high moun-
tains that it is almost unknown to tourists and men of science who are
especially interested in such natural wonders. Crater Lake of south-
ern Oregon lies in the very heart of the Cascade Range, and, while it is
especially attractive to the geologist on account of its remarkable geo-
logic history, it is equally inviting to the tourist and others in search
of health and pleasure by communion with the beautiful and sublime
in nature.

According to W. G. Steel? the lake was first seen by white men in
1853. It had long previously been known to the Indians, whose
legends have contributed a name, Llao Rock, to one of the prominences
of its rim. They regarded the lake with awe as an abode of the Great
Spirit. Prospectors were the earliest explorers of the lake.’ The first
travelers of note who visited the lake were Lord Maxwell and Mr.
Bentley, who, in 1872, with Capt. O. C. Applegate, of Modoc war fame,
and three others, made a boat trip along its borders and named several
of the prominences on the rim after members of the party.’ Mrs. F. F.

Victor saw the lake in 1873, and briefly describes it in ‘Atlantis
Arisen.”! The same year Mr. 8S. A. Clarke gave an interesting
account of the lake in the December number of the Overland Monthly.

The first Geological Survery party visited the lake in 1883, when
Everett Hayden and the writer, after spending several days in examin-
ing the rim, tumbled logs over the cliffs to the water’s edge, lashed
them together with ropes to make a raft, and paddled over to the
island. In 1886, under the direction of Capt. (now Maj.) C. E. Dutton,
many soundings of the lake were made by W. G. Steel, and a topo-
graphic map of the vicinity was prepared by Mark B, Kerr and Eugene
Ricksecker. Dutton was the first to discover the more novel and
salient features in the geological history of the lake, of which he has
given, for his entertaining pen, an all too brief account.’

Under the inspiration of the ‘‘Mazamas,” a society of mountain
climbers at Portland, Oregon,’ a more extended study of the lake has
just been made by Government parties from the Department of Agri-
culture, the Fish Commission, and the Geological Survey.

Crater Lake is deeply set in the summit of the Cascade Range, about
65 miles north of the California line. As yet it may be reached only
by private conveyance over about 80 miles of mountain roads from
Ashland, Medford, or Gold Hill, on the Southern Pacific Railroad, in
the Rogue River Valley of southern Oregon (see fig. 1). This valley
marks the line between the Klamath Mountains of the Coast Range on
the west and the Cascade Range on the east. The journey from the
railroad to Crater Lake affords a good opportunity to observe some of
the most important features of this great pile of lavas. The Cascade
Range in southern Oregon is a broad irregular platform, terminating
rather abruptly in places upon its borders, especially to the westward,
where the underlying Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments come to the
surface. It is surmounted by voleanic cones and coulees, which are
generally smooth, but sometimes rough and rugged. The cones vary
greatly in size and are distributed without regularity. Each has been
an active voleano. The fragments blown out by violent eruption have
fallen about the voleanie orifice from which they issued and built up
cinder cones. From their bases have spread streams of lava (coulees),
raising the general level of the country between the cones. From some
vents by many eruptions, both explosive and effusive, large cones, like
Pitt, Shasta, and Hood have been built up. Were we to examine their
internal structure, exposed in the walls of the canyons carved in their
slopes, we should find them composed of overlapping layers of lava and
volcanic conglomerate, a structure which is well illustrated in the rim
of Crater Lake.

OREGON AN
CRATER LAKE, OREGON. dT1

The journey from Ashland by the Dead Indian road crosses the range
where the average altitude is less than 5,000 feet. The road passes
within a few miles of Mount Pitt and skirts Pelican Bay of Klamath
Lake, famous for its fishing. After following northward for some 20
miles along the eastern foot of the range, it ascends the eastern slope,
along the castled canyon of Anna Creek to the rim of Crater Lake.

From Medford or Gold Hill, the trip is a tritle shorter by the Rogue
River road. It affords some fine views of the canyons and rapids of
that turbulent stream and of the high falls, where it receives its afflu-
ents. Striking features along both roads, within 20 miles of the lake,
are the plains developed upon a great mass of detritus filling the val-
leys. Across these plains Anna Creek and Rogue River have carved
deep, narrow canyons with finely sculptured walls, which the roads fol-
low for some distance.

Approaching the lake from any side, the observer sees, as in the dis-
tant part of figure 2, a broad cluster of gentle peaks rising about a
thousand feet above the general crest of the range on which they stand,
but not until after he has left the main road, 3 miles from the lake, does
he begin to feel the steepness of the ascent. The way winds over a
large moraine littered with lava bowlders and well studded with firs.
Arriving at the crest, the lake in all its majestic beauty, as it appears
in figure 3, comes suddenly upon the scene, and is profoundly impres-
sive. Descending the wooded slope a short distance within the rim to
Victor Rock, an excellent general view of the lake is obtained. Upon
the left is the western border of the lake (fig. 4), and upon the right
its southern border (fig. 5). The eye beholds 20 miles of unbroken
cliffs ranging from over 500 to nearly 2,000 feet in height, encircling a
deep blue sheet of placid water, in which the mirrored walls vie with

the originals in brillianey and greatly enhance the depth of the prospect.

The first point to fix our fascinated gaze is Wizard Island, lying
nearly 2 miles away, near the western margin of the lake. Its irregu-
lar western edge and the steep but symmetrical truncated cone in the
eastern portion are very suggestive of volcanic origin. We can not,
however, indulge our first impulse to go at onee to the island, for the
various features of the rim are of greater importance in unraveling the
earlier stages of its geological history.

The outer and inner slopes of the rim are in strong contrast; while
the one is gentle, ranging in general from 10° to 15°, the other is abrupt
and full of cliffs. This difference is well expressed by the contour
map in figure 6. The vertical interval of the contours is 200 feet.
Upon the inner slope the contours are crowded close together to show
a Slope so steep that one needs to travel but a little way to descend 200
feet, while upon the outer slope the contours are so far apart that to
descend 200 feet one needs to travel a considerable portion of a mile.
The outer slope at all points is away from the lake, and as the rim rises
at least 1,000 feet above the general summit of the range, it is evidently
the basal portion of a great hollow cone in which the lake is contained.
372 CRATER LAKE, OREGON.

In addition to the strong contrast between the outer and inner slopes
of the rim the map shows the occurrence of a number of small cones
upon the outer slope of the great cone. These adnate cones are of
peculiar significance when we come to consider the volcanic rocks of
which the region is composed. The rim is ribbed by ridges and spurs
radiating from the lake, and the head of each spur is marked by a
prominence on the crest of the rim. The variation in the altitude of
the rim crest is 1,460 feet (from 6,759 to 8,228) with seven points rising
above 8,000 feet. The crest generally is passable, so that a pedestrian
may follow it continuously around the lake, with the exception of short
intervals about the notches in the southern side. At many points the
best going is on the inner side of the crest, where the open slope, gener-
ally well marked with deer trails over beds of pumice, affords an unob-
structed view of the lake.

Reference has already been made to the glacial phenomena of the
outer slope of the rim. There are scattered bowlders upon the surface,
and also in piles of glacial moraine (fig. 7) which contain besides bowl-
ders much gravel and sand. Such glacial drift is spread far and wide
over the southern and western portion of the rim, extending down
the watercourses in some cases for miles to broad plains through which
the present streams have carved the deep and picturesque canyons
already observed on the ascent. At many points the lavas are well
rounded, smoothed, and striated by glacial action. ‘This is true of the
ridges as well as of the valleys, and the distribution of these marks is
coextensive with that of the glacial detritus.

A feature that is particularly impressive to the geologist making a
trip around the lake on the rim crest is the general occurrence of
polished and striated rocks, in place on the very brow of the cliff over-
looking the lake. The best displays are along the crest for 3 miles
northwest of Victor Rock, but they occur also on the slopes of Llao
Rock, Round Top, Kerr Notch, and Eagle crags, thus completing the
circuit of the lake. On the adjacent slope toward the lake the same
rocks present rough fractured surfaces, showing no strie. The glacia-
tion of the rim is a feature of its outer slope only, but as shown in
figure 8, it reaches up to the very crest. The glaciers armed with
stones in their lower parts, that striated the crown of the rim, must
have come down from above, ahd it is evident that the topographic
conditions of to-day afford no such source of supply. The formation
of glaciers requires an elevation extending above the snow line to
afford a gathering ground for the snow that it may accumulate, and
under the influence of gravity descend to develop glaciers lower down
on the mountain slopes. During the glacial period Crater Lake did
not exist. Its site must then have been occupied by a mountain to
furnish the conditions necessary for the extensive glaciation of the rim,
and the magnitude of the glacial phenomena indicates that the peak
was a large one, rivaling, apparently, the highest peaks of the range.
CRATER LAKE, OREGON. 373

The Mazamas held a meeting in August, 1896, at Crater Lake in con-
nection with the Crater Lake clubs of Medford, Ashland, and Klamath
Falls, of the same State. Recognizing that the high mountain which
once occupied the place of the lake was nameless, they christened it,
with appropriate ceremonies, Mount Mazama. The rim of the lake is
a remnant of Mount Mazama, but when the name is used in this paper
reference is intended more especially to that part which has disappeared.

The inner slope of the rim, so well in view from Victor Rock, although
precipitous, is not a continuous cliff. Itis made up of many cliffs, whose
horizontal extent is generally much greater than the vertical. The
cliffs are in ledges, and sometimes the whole slope from crest to shore
is one great cliff, not absolutely vertical, it is true, but yet at so high
an angle as to make it far beyond the possibility of climbing. Dutton
Cliff on the southern and Llao Rock on the northern borders of the lake
are the greatest cliffs of the rim. Besides cliffs, the other elements of
the inner slope are forests and talus, and these make it possible at a few
points to approach the lake, not with great ease, but yet, care being
taken, with little danger. Southwest of the lake the inner slope, clearly
seen from Victor Rock, is pretty well wooded, and from near the end of
the road, just east of Victor Rock, a steep trail descends to the water.
Where fresh talus slopes prevail there are no trees, and the loose mate-
rial maintains the steepest slope possible without sliding. Such slopes
are well displayed along the western shore opposite the island and near
the northeast corner of the lake under the palisades, illustrated in
figure 10.. At this point the rim is only 520 feet high, and a long slide,
called from its shape the Wineglass, reaches from crest to shore.

The best views of the rim are obtained from a boat on the lake, which
affords an opportunity to examine in detail the position and structure
of the cliffs. They are composed wholly of volcanic conglomerate and
streams of lava arranged in layers that dip into the rim and away from
the lake on all sides. Both forms of volcanic material are well exposed
on the trail descending the inner slope, and, although most of the cliffs
are of lava, many are of conglomerate.

On arriving at the water’s edge the observer is struck with the fact
that there is no beach. The steep slopes above the surface of the lake
continue beneath its waters to great depths. Here and there upon the
shore, where a rill descends from a melting snow bank near the crest, a
small delta deposit makes a little shallow, turning the deep-blue water
to pale green.

As the boat skirts the western shore and passes toward Llao Rock,
the layered structure of the rim is evident. This feature is best illus-
trated in figure 4. On the whole, the lava streams predominate.
although there is much conglomerate. Of all the flows exposed upon the
inner slope, that of Llao Rock is most prominent and interesting. In
the middle it is over 1,200 feet thick, and fills an ancient valley down
the outer slope of the rim. Upon either side it tapers to a thin edge
374 CRATER LAKE, OREGON.

against the upper slope of the valley. Figure 11, from a color sketch
of the photograph from which figure 3 was prepared, shows the Llao
Rock flow distinctly. To the lake it presents a sheer cliff—that is, it is
abruptly cut off—and one wonders how much farther it may have
extended in that direction. Beneath the rock the outline of the valley
in cross section is evident, and it rests upon many layers of older lavas,
forming the rim down to the water’s edge. The direction of flow in this
great lava stream forces us to believe that it was erupted from a large
voleano which once stood upon the site of the lake. Every layer of
lava in the rim is a coulee, dipping away from the lake. This is espe-
cially well shown in the canyon of Sun Creek, cut in its outer slope.
The sections of these radiating flows exposed upon the inner slope of
the rim all tell the same story as to their source. By projecting the
lavas in their course toward a common center we can reconstruct in
fancy the great voleano, Mount Mazama, which once occupied the place
of the lake, and, like Shasta or Rainier, formed a great landmark of
the region. Proceeding eastward from Llao Rock the rim loses some-
what in height, and at the head of Cleetwood Cove one sees the remark-
able spectacle of a lava stream descending the inner slope of the rim.
It is the only one that has behaved in this way, and its action throws
much light upon the disappearance of Mount Mazama.

The Palisades are less than 600 feet in elevation above the lake, and
are composed almost wholly of one great flow. The streams of lava
extending northeast from this portion of the rim are broad and much
younger in appearance than those forming the great cliffs south of the
lake, where the flows are thinner and more numerous.

Round Top is a dome-shaped hill over the eastern end of the Pali-
sades, and is made up chiefly of the lava stream that formed the
Palisades, overlain by two sheets of pumice separated by a layer of
rhyolite. The upper surface of the Palisade flow, where best exposed
‘upon the lakeward slope of Round Top, bears glacial striz, that extend
beneath the layers of pumice and rhyolite of later eruption from Mount
Mazama. It is evident from this relation that Mount Mazama was an
active volcano during the glacial period. The occurrence of eruptions
from a snow-capped volcano must necessarily produce great floods, and
these conditions may account in some measure at least for the detritus-
filled valleys of the streams rising on the rim of Crater Lake.

Returning from this glacial digression to the boat trip on the lake, it
is observed upon the eastern side of the lake that Red Cloud Cliff is
rendered beautiful by the pinnacles of reddish tuff near the summit,
where it is capped by a great, dark flow of rhyolite, filling a valley in
the older rim and extending far to the northeast. Here the springs
begin to gush from the inner slope and cascade their foaming rills to the
lake. They recur at Sentinel Rock, Dutton Cliff, and especially under
Eagle Crag, as well as farther westward. Their sources in many cases
can be seen in the banks of snow above, but in others they gush forth
CRATER LAKE, OREGON. 315

as real springs, whose water must find its way in from the snow upon
the outer slope.

The boldest portion of the rim, excepting perhaps Llao Rock, is
Dutton Cliff, which is made more impressive by the deep U-shape
notches on either s'de and the Phantom Ship at its foot (fig. 12). The
notches mark poin:s where the canyons of Sun and Sand creeks pass
through the rim to the ciift overlooking the lake. In figure 13, which
shows the same view as figure 12, but in the opposite direction, the
notch at the head of Sun Creek Canyon is well illustrated. These
canyons, due to erosion on lines of drainage, belong to the period when |
the topographic conditions in that region were quite unlike those of to-
day. They were carved out by streams of ice and water descending
from a point over the lake, and their presence, ending as they do in
the air hundreds of feet above the present water level, affords strong
evidence in favor of the former reality of Mount Mazama.

The Phanton Ship (fig. 14) is a craggy little islet near the border
of the lake under Dutton Cliff. Its rugged hull, with rocks towering
like the masts of a ship, suggests the name, and, phantom-like, it dis-
appears when viewed in certain lights from the western rim. Stand-
ing in line with an aréte that descends from an angle of the cliff, it
possibly marks a continuation of the sharp spur beneath the water,
or perhaps, but much less likely, it is a block slid down from the
cliff. Whatever its history, it attracts everyone by its beauty and
winsomeness.

At times of volcanic eruption the lava rises within the volcano until
it either overflows the crater at the top or, by the great pressure of the
column, bursts open the sides of the voleano and escapes through the
fissure to the surface.. In the latter case, as the molten material cools,
the fissure becomes filled with solid lava and forms a dike. The best
example of this sort about Crater Lake appears along the inner slope
directly north of Wizard Island, and is locally known as the Devil’s
Backbone. It is shown in figures 3 and 11 across the left end of
Wizard Island. This dike rock, standing on edge, varies from 5 to 25
feet in thickness and cuts the rim from water to crest. Dikes are most
numerous in the older portion of the rim under Llao Rock. They do
not cut up through Llao Rock and are clearly older than the lava of
which that rock is formed. Dikes occur at intervals all around the
lake and radiate from it, suggesting that the central volcanic vent
from which they issued must have been Mount Mazama.

There is another important feature concerning the kinds of volcanic
rocks and their order of eruption and distribution about the rim of
Crater Lake that is of much interest to the geologist. AJl the older
lavas comprising the inner slope of the rim, especially toward the
water’s edge, are andesites. The newer ones, forming the top of the
rim in Llao Rock, Round Top, and the Rugged Crest about the head
of Cleetwood Cove as well as at Cloud Cap, are rhyolites. Other later

flows, all of which escaped from the smaller adnate cones upon the
outer slope of the rim, are basalts. The eruptions began with lavas
containing a medium amount of silica (andesites), and after long-
continued activity lavas both richer (rhyolites) and poorer (basalts) in
silica follow, giving a completeness to the products of this great vol-
canic center that make it an interesting field of study. Furthermore,
the remarkable opportunity afforded by the dissected voleano for the
examination of its structure and succession of lavas is unsurpassed.
It should be stated, before dismissing the kinds of lava, that there are
some rhyolites in the Sun Creek Canyon south of the lake that appear
to be older than those upon the north side, and that the final lava of
the region on Wizard Island is andesite.

The glaciation and structure of the rim clearly establish the former
existence of Mount Mazama, but there may well be doubt as to its
exact form and size. Judging from the fact that Mount Shasta and
the rim of Crater Lake have the same diameter at an altitude of 8,000
feet, and that their lavas are similar, it may with some reason be inferred
that Mount Mazama and Mount Shasta were nearly of equal height.
The slopes of Mount Shasta may be somewhat steeper than those.of
the rim of Crater Lake at an equal altitude, but the glaciation of the
rim is such as to require a large peak for its source.

In figure 9 is given a section of Crater Lake and its rim, with the
probable outline of Mount Mazama. Wonderful as the lake, encircled
by cliffs, may be, it serves but to conceal in part the greatest wonder—
that is, the enormous pit or caldera which is half filled by the lake.
The caldera is 4,000 feet deep. An impressive illustration of it is seen
in figure 15 which was prepared from a photograph of a model of
Crater Lake now in the United States Nationai Museum. The water
surface is represented by glass, so that one may see through to the
bottom and get the full impression of the depth of this tremendous
hole in the ground. It extends from the top of the rim, which is
the very summit of the Cascade Range, halfway down to the sea level,
and nearly a square mile of its bottom is below the level of Upper
Klamath Lake at the eastern foot of the range. The volume of the
caldera is nearly a dozen cubic miles, and if we add the volume of the
lost Mount Mazama, that amount would be increased by at least one-
half. How was it possible to remove so large a mass and in the process
develop so great a depression ?

The caldera is completely inclosed, so that it can not be regarded as
an effect of erosion. The voleanic origin of everything about the lake
would suggest in a general way that this great revolution must have
been wrought by volcanism, either blown out by a great volcanic explo-
sion or swallowed up by an equally great engulfment. It is well known
that pits have been produced by voleanic explosions, and some of them
are occupied by lakeseof the kind usually called crater lakes. Depres-
sions produced in this way, however, are, with rare exceptions, sur-
CRATER LAKE, OREGON. 317

rounded by rims composed of the fragmental material blown out from
the depression.

At first sight the rim about Crater Lake suggests that the caldera
was produced by an explosion, and the occurrence of much pumice in
that region lends support to this preliminary view; but on careful
examination we find, as already stated, that the rim is not made up of
fragments blown from the pit, but of layers of solid lava interbedded
with those of volcanic conglomerate erupted from Mount Mazama before
the caldera originated. The moraines deposited by glaciers descending
from the mountain formed the surface around a large part of the rim,
and as there is no fragmental deposits on these moraines, it is evident
that there is nothing whatever to indicate any explosive action in
connection with the formation of the caldera.

We may be aided in understanding the possible origin of the caldera
by picturing the conditions that must have obtained during an effusive
eruption of Mount Mazama. At such a time the column of molten
material rose in the interior of the mountain until it overflowed at the
summit or burst open the sides of the mountain and escaped through
fissures. Fissures formed in this way usually occur high on the slopes
of the mountain. If instead, however, an opening were effected on the
mountain side at a much lower level—say some thousands of feet below
the summit—and the molten material escaped, the mountain would be
left hollow, and the summit, having so much of its support removed,
might cave in and disappear in the molten reservoir.

Something of this sort is described by Professor Dana as occurring at
Kilauea, in Hawaii. The lake in that case is not water, but molten lava,
for Kilauea is yet an active volcano. In 1840 there was an eruption from
the slopes of Kilauea, 27 miles distant from the lake and over 4,000 feet
below its level. The column of lava represented by the lake of molten
material in Kilauea sank away in connection with this eruption to a
depth of 385 feet, and the floor of the region immediately surrounding
the lake, left without support, tumbled into the depression. In the
intervals between eruptions the molten column rises again toward the
surface, only to be lowered by subsequent eruptions, and the subsidence
is not always accompanied by an outflow of lava upon the surface.
Sometimes, however, it gushes forth as a great fountain a hundred feet
or more in height.

The elevated position of the great caldera occupied by Crater Lake
makes its origin by subsidence seem the more probable. The level of
the lowest bed of the lake reaches the surface within 15 miles down the
western slope of the range. That Mount Mazama was ingulfed is
plainly suggested by the behavior of its final lava stream. The greater
portion of this last flow descended and spread over the outer slope of
the rim, but from the thickest part of the flow where it fills an old
valley at the head of Cleetwood Cove some of the same lava, as already
noted, poured down the inner slope. The only plausible explanation
378 CRATER LAKE, OREGON.

of this phenomena seems to be that soon after the final eruption of
Mount Mazama, and before the thickest part of the lava effused at that
time had soliditied, the mountain collapsed and sank away and the yet
viscous portion of the stream followed down the inner slope of the
caldera.

It has been suggested, but perhaps not in serious thought, that the
cone on Wizard Island may represent the summit of the sunken Mount
Mazama projecting above the water. To determine the truth of the
matter we must cross over to the island. Wizard Island has two por-
tions—an extremely rough lava field and a cinder cone. These parts
may be distinguished in figure 16, a view of the island from the
Watchman. A portion of the lava field is shown in the foreground of
figure 18. The lava is dark and has a much more basaltic look than
any seen in the main body of the rim. It has evidently been erupted
from the base of the cinder cone in its present position. The cinder
cone, too, is a pertect little voleano, with steep symmetrical slopes. 845
feet in height, and surmounted by a crater 80 feet deep. A portion of
this crater is shown in figure 17. It is so new and fresh that it
is scarcely forested, and shows no trace of weathering. Instead of
being a part of the sunken Mount Mazama, it is an entirely new vol-
eano built up since the subsidence by volcanic action upon the bottom
of the caldera. Were it not for the lake the whole bottom of the
caldera could be examined, and it is possible that other small voleanic
cones might be found. This suggestion is borne out by the soundings
of the lake, which appear to reveal two other cases, but they do not
rise to within 400 feet of the surface of the water. It is evident that
the voleanic eruptions upon the bottom of the caldera have partially
filed it up. Originally it may have been much more than 4,000 feet
deep.

Given the caldera with water-tight walls, there is no difficulty in
forming Crater Lake, for in that region precipitation is greater than
evaporation. Observations upon precipitation and evaporation have
not been made at Crater Lake, but, judging from those made at nearest
points, the annual precipitation should be between 60 and 70 inches,
while the annual evaporation is between 50 and 60 inches. The aver-
age diameter of the lake is nearly 5 miles. Its area, including Wizard
Island, is about 21.30 square miles. ‘The drainage area inclosed by the
rim of the lake, according to Mr. E.C. Barnard, is 27.48 square miles.
During the winter great masses of snow drift within the rim, and thus
considerably augment the normal precipitation of the lake. The lake
does not fill up and overflow. Thesurplus water must have a subterra-
nean outlet, probably toward the southeast, where the region is tra-
versed by extensive breaks in the rocks, and abounds in excellent
springs.

The color of the lake is deep blue, excepting along the borders, where
it merges into various shades and tints of green. It is so transparent

that even on a hazy day a white dinner plate 10 inches in diameter may
be seen at a depth of nearly 100 feet. It contains no fish, but a small
crustacean flourishes in its waters, and salamanders occur in abundance
locally along the shore.

The level of the lake oscillates with the seasons. During the rainy
winter if rises, and in the summer it falls. In August, 1896, observa-
tions were made for twenty-two days, and the lake sank at the rate of
1 inch for every five or six days, depending somewhat on the conditions
of the weather. The Mazamas have established a water gauge, and it
was hoped that an extended series of observations would be obtained,
but the ice broke it off the next winter.

Mr. B. W. Evermann, of the United States Fish Commission, who
visited the lake last summer, made some interesting observations of its
temperature. At 1 p.m., August 22—

The temperature of the surface water was ....--..----..------.---..----------- 60°
Ata depth of 555 feet the temperature was ---5-2--::.-.---..-.-12...---..----- 39°
Atvadepthi ot 1043 teet the temperature was 222225222... ----5.--2---.2-.._2--- 41°
At a depth of 1,623 feet (on the bottom) the temperature was ..--..--..---.---- 46°

The increase of temperature with the depth suggests that the bottom
may yet be warm from volcanic heat, but more observations are needed
to fully establish such an abnormal relation of temperatures in a body
of water.

Aside from its attractive scenic features, Crater Lake affords one of
the most interesting and instructive fields for the study of volcanic
geology to be found anywhere in the world. Considered in all its
aspects, it ranks with the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, the Yosemite
Valley, and the Falls of Niagara, and it is interesting to note that a
bill has been introduced in Congress to make it a national park for the
pleasure and instruction of the people.

THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. !

By J. Scott KELTIE, LI

We meet this year in exceptional circumstances. Thirteen years ago
the British Association met for the first time in a portion of the Empire
beyond the limits of the British Islands. During these thirteen years
much has happened of the greatest interest to geographers, and if I
attempted to review the progress which has been made during these
years—proeress in the exploration of the globe, progress in geographical
research, progress in geographical education—I could not hope to do it
to any purpose in the short time during which it would be right for a
president to monopolize the attention of the section. But we have, at
the same time, reached another stage in our history which naturally
leads us to take stock of our progress in the past. We have all of us
been celebrating the sixtieth year of the glorious reign of the Sovereign,
of whose vast dominions Canada and the United Kingdom form integral
parts. The progress made during that period in our own department
of science has been immense; it would take volumes to tell what has
been done for the exploration of the globe. The great continent of
Africa has practically been discovered, for sixty years .ago all but its
rim was a blank. In 1837 enormous areas in North America were unex-
plored, and much of the interior of South America was unknown. In
all parts of Asia vast additions have been made to our knowledge; the-
maps of the interior of that continent were, sixty years ago, of the most
diagrammatic character. The Australian interior was nearly as great
a blank as that of Africa; New Zealand had not even been annexed.
Need I remind you of the great progress which has been made during
the period both in the North and South Polar areas, culminating in the
magnificent achievement of Dr. Nansen? It was just sixty years ago
that the great Antarctic expedition under Sir James Ross was being
organized; since that, alas, little or nothing has been done to follow
up his work. Sixty years ago the science of Oceanography, even the
term, did not exist; it is the creation of the Victorian era, and may be
said almost to have had its origin in the voyage of the Challenger, which
added a new domain to our science and opened up inexhaustible fields

of research. I have thought then that the most useful and most man-
ageable thing to do on the present occasion will be to indicate briefly
what, in my estimation, are some of the problems which geography has
to attack in the future, only taking such glances at the past as will
enable us to do this intelligibly.

It has been customary for the occupants of this chair to try to define
the field of geography, and on occasions, in somewhat too apologetic
language, to justify its existence as a section of a scientific associa-
tion. I do not think this is any longer necessary. Even in England
and America, during the last thirteen years, geography has done work
enough to prove that she has a mission which no other department of
research can fulfill. I say thirteen years, because that not only carries
us back to the last Canadian meeting of the British Association, but to
the year when the Royal Geographical Society undertook an inquiry
into the position of geography at home and abroad, mainly with a view
to the improvement of geographical education in England. During
that time a good deal has been written as to the field and scope of
geography, and a good many definitions given. But we really did not
require to go to Germany to teach us as to the fie'd and functions of
geography. Sixty years ago, the then president of the Royal Geo-
graphical Society, Mr. William R. Hamilton, delivered the first
presidential address ever given at that society, and his conception of
the field and aims of geography was as exalted and comprehensive as
the most exacting German geographer could wish. It is too long to
quote here. !

It would be difficult to improve upon Mr. Hamilton’s definition, and it
shows that a correct conception of the wide and important field of
geography is no new thing in England. He proceeded to indicate what
remained to be done in the field of exploration, and I commend his
address to anyone desirous of forming a conception of the vast progress
that has been made since it was delivered sixty years ago. Since I am
dealing with definitions, I may be permitted to quote that given by one
so severely scientific as Gen. Sir R. Strachey in a course of lectures which
he gave at the University of Cambridge in 1888, in connection with the
establishment of a lecturership in geography in that university:
“The aim of geographical science,” he says, “is to investigate and
delineate the various features of the earth; to study the distribution of
land and sea, the configuration and relief of the surface, position on the
globe, and so forth, facts which determine the existing condition of
various parts of the earth, or which indicate former conditions; and to
ascertain the relations that exist between these features and all that is
observed on the earth. * * * JI claim for geography,” Sir R.
Strachey says, ‘‘a place among the natural sciences as supplying the
needful medium through which to obtain a connected and consistent
conception of the earth and what is on it.” He gives a list of the

1 Journal R. G.S8., Vol. VIII, 1838.
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. 383

various matters which, in his conception, it is the business of geogra-
phy to deal with, and they are varied and important enough to satisfy
the demands of the most exacting. ‘These are,” he says, ‘the studies
through which scientific geography will lead you, teaching you to view
the earth in its entirety, bringing together the great variety of objects
seen upon it, investigating their connection, and exploring their causes;
and so combining and harmonizing the lessons of all the sciences which
supply the key to the secrets of Nature.”!

I think we may briefly define geography as the science of the topo-
graphical distribution of the great features of the earth’s surface and
of all that it sustains—mineral, vegetable, and animal, including man
himself. In fact, man is the ultimate term in the geographical problem,
the final object of which is to investigate the correlation between
humanity and its geographical environment.

I may be pardoned for dwelling at some length on the function and
field of geography. It is a subject that has been occupying the atten-
tion of geographers in England for some years, and it may not be
without interest to our colleagues on this side of the Atlantic to know
the conclusions which we have come to. Moreover, it seems necessary
to arrive at some clear conception on the matter, with a view to the
researches of the future. I say that the subject has been occupying
our attention in England for some time; it has done so, I may say, as
a result of the inquiry by myself on the part of the Royal Geograph-
ical Society to which I have referred. The object of that inquiry was
mainly to collect information as to the position of geography in eduea-
tion at home and abroad. The report which I presented to the society
attracted some attention, and whether as a result of that or not it is
hardly for me to say, but certainly since that inquiry some twelve years
ago the position of geography in England has considerably improved
both in education and as a field for research. Better methods have
been introduced in our schools; a much wider scope has been given to
the subject; in many quarters teachers have shown themselves anxious
to be guided in the right direction; and, above all, both Oxford and
Cambridge at length consented to the establishment of lectureships
in geography. A school of young geographers has grown up, consisting
of men who have had a thorough university training in science and
letters, and who are devoting themselves to the various branches of
geography as a specialty. In this way the arid old text-books and
characterless maps are being supplanted by others that will bear com-
parison with the best productions of Germany. Photography and
lantern slides illustrating special geographical features are coming into
use in schools; and in other directions appliances for use in education
are being multiplied and improved. A British geographical literature
is growing up, and if, as I hope, the progress be maintained, we shall
be able to hold our own in geography with any country. The interest

‘Lectures on Geography delivered before the University of Cambridge, London, 1888.
384 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

in the subject has been extended by the foundation of geographical
societies in various large centers; whereas thirteen years ago the only
geographical society was that of London, there are now similar societies
in Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, and Edinburgh, the last with
branches in Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen. If this progressive move-
ment is maintained, as there is every reason to hope it will be, the
scientific and educational aspects of geography in Britain will be more
nearly ona par with exploration in which our country has so long held
the lead.

In the United States I found that the position of the subject in edu-
cation was not much more Satisfactory than it was in England. Since
then there is reason to believe considerable progress has been made.
One of the best text-books on physical geography, Hinman’s Eclectic
Physical Geography, is of American origin, while in the States, as in
England, a school of scientific geographers has arisen which bids fair
to give the subject a high place in that country. I fear, from what I
can learn, that the position in Canada is not as satisfactory as it ought
to be. It seems to me, then, that one of the great problems which
geographers have to face in the future is the place which this subject
is to hold in education, both as a body of information and as a disci-
pline. We have been making progress, and if we persevere with intel-
ligence and firmness and maintain the subject at the highest standard
as a field of research, there can be little doubt of our success.

There is a prevalent belief that geopraphers have nothing more to
learn in Europe—that the old continent has been thoroughly explored.
It is true that nearly every country in Europe has been or is being
trigonometrically surveyed. [Except some parts of the Balkan Penin-
sula and north of Russia the topography of the continent has been
accurately mapped on scales and by methods sufficient at least for the
purposes of the geographer. Yet there are districts in the Balkan
Peninsula—for example, Albania—which are as vaguely known as
central Africa. But it is a delusion to think that because a country
has been fully mapped the occupation of the geographer is gone. It
is only when a region at large is adequately mapped that the work of
geographical research begins. The student, with a satisfactory map of
a definite district as his guide, will find on the spot abundant occupa-
tion in working out its geographical details, the changes which have
taken place in its topography, and the bearing of its varied features
upon its history, its inhabitants, its industries. This kind of work has
been in progress in Germany for over ten years under the auspices of
the central commission for the scientitic geography (Landeskunde)
of Germany, with its seat at Stuttgart. Under the collective title of
“Forschungen zur Deutschen Landes- und Volkskunde,” a long series
of monographs by specialists has been published, dealing in minute
detail with one or more aspects of a limited district. Thus we have
such memoirs as “The plain of the Upper Rhine and its neighboring
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. 385

Mountains,” by Dr. Richard Lepsius; “The towns of the North German
Plain in relation to the configuration of the ground,” by Dr. Hahn;
“The Munich Basin: A Contribution to the physical geography of -
southern Bavaria,” by C. Gruber; ‘‘The Mecklenburg Ridges and their
relation to the Ice Age,” by Dr. EH. Geinitz; ‘“The influence of the
mountains on the climate of central Germany,” by R. Assmann; ‘‘The
distribution and origin of the Germans in Silesia,” by Dr. K. Weinhold;
‘¢ Mountain structure and surface configuration of Saxon Switzerland,”
by Dr. A. Hettner; ‘‘The Erzgebirge: An orometric-anthropogeograph-
ical study,” by Dr. J. Burgkhardt; ‘The Thuringian forest and its
surroundings,” by Dr. H. Proscholdt, and so forth. There is thus an
inexhaustible field for scientific geography in its most comprehensive
sense—a series of problems which may take generations to work out.
In a less systematic way we have similar monographs by French
geographers. One or two attempts, mainly by teachers, have been
made in England to do similar work, but the impression generally
produced is that the authors have not been well equipped for the task.
Iam glad to say that in England the Royal Geographical Society has
initiated a movement for working out in a systematic fashion what
one may call the regional geography of the British Islands on the
basis of the l-inch maps of the Ordnance Survey. It is a strange
thing that the geography of the mother country has never yet been
systematically worked out.

Taking the sheets of the Ordnance Survey map as a basis, it is pro-
posed that each district should be thoroughly investigated, and a com-
plete memoir of moderate dimensions systematically compiled to
accompany the sheet, in the same way that each sheet of the Geolog-
ical Survey map has its printed text. It is a stupendous undertaking,
that would involve many years’ work, and the results of which when
complete would fill many volumes. But it is worth doing; it would
furnish the material for an exact and trustworthy account of the geog-
raphy of Britain on any scale and would be invaluable to the historian,
as well as to others dealing with subjects having any relation to the
past and present geography of the land. The librarian of the society,
Dr. H. BR. Mill, has begun operations on a limited area in Sussex.
When he has completed this initial memoir, it will be for the society to
decide whether it can continue the enterprise, or whether it will suc-
ceed in persuading the Government to take the matter up. I refer to
work of this kind mainly to indicate what, in my conception, are some
of the problems of the future which geography has to face, even in
fully surveyed countries. Even were the enterprise referred to carried
out, there would be room enous for special researches in particular
districts.

But while there is an ier lancible field in the future for geograph-
ical work in the direction I have indicated, there is no doubt that much
still remains to be done in the way of exploring the unknown, or little

386 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

known, regions of the globe. Let us briefly refer to the problems
remaining to be solved in this direction. Turning to the continent of
Asia, we find that immense progress has been made during the past
sixty years. In the presidential address given sixty years ago, already
referred to, Mr. Hamilton says of Asia: ‘We have only a very general
knowledge of the geographical character of the Burman, Chinese, and
Japan Hmpires; the innumerable islands of the latter are still, except
occasionally, inaccessible to European navigators. Geographers hardly
venture on the most loose description of Tibet, Mongolia, or Chinese
Tartary, Siam, and Cochin China.” Since then the survey of India,
one of the greatest enterprises undertaken by any State, has been
completed and is being rapidly extended over Burma. But I need not
remind you in detail of the vast changes that have taken place in Asia
during these years and the immense additions that have been made to
our knowledge of its geograpby. Exploring activity in Asia is not
likely to cease, though it is not to be expected that its inhospitable
center will ever be so carefully mapped as have been the mountains of
Switzerland.

The most important desiderata, so far as pioneer exploration in Asia
is concerned, may be said to be confined to two regions.’ In southern
and central Arabia there are tracts which are entirely unexplored. It
is probable thac this unexplored region is in the main a sandy desert.
At the same time it is, in the south at least, fringed by a border of
mountains whose slopes are capable of rich cultivation, and whose sum-
mits the late Mr. Theodore Bent found, on his last and fatal journey, to
be covered with snow. In exploration, as in other directions, it is the
unexpected that happens; and if any traveler cared to face the diffi-
culties—physical, political, and religious—which might be met with in
southern and central Arabia, he might be able to tell the world a sur-
prising story.

The other region in Asia where real pioneer work still remains to be
done is Tibet and the mountainous districts bordering it on the north
and east. Lines of exploration have in recent years been run across
Tibet by Russian explorers like Prejevalsky, by Rockhill, Prince Henry
of Orleans and Bonvalot, by Bower, Littledale, Wellby, and Malcolm.
From the results obtained by these explorers we have formed a fair
idea of this, the most extensive, the highest, and the most inhospitable
plateau in the world. A few more lines run in well-selected directions
would probably supply geography with nearly all she wants to learn
about such a region, though more minute exploration would probably
furnish interesting details as to its geological history.

The region lying to the north of the Himalayan range and to the
south of the parallel of Lhasa is almost a blank on the map, and there
is ample room here for the enterprising pioneer. The forbidden city of

‘For, part of what follows with reference to Asia I am indebted to a valuable
memorandum on the subject drawn up by the late Mr. Ney Elias.
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. 387

Lhasa is at present the goal of several adventurers, though as amatter
of fact we can not have much to learn in addition to what has been
revealed in the interesting narrative of the native Indian traveller,
Chandra Das. The magnificent mountain region on the north and east
of Tibet furnishes a splendid field for the enterprising explorer. Mrs.
Bishop recently approached it from the east, through Sze-chuen, and
her description of the romantic scenery and the interesting non-Mon-
golian inhabitants leaves us with a strong desire to learn more. On
the southeast of Tibet is the remarkable mountainous region, consist-
ing of a series of lofty parallel chains, through which run the upper
waters of the Yangtse, the Mekong, the Salwin, and the Irawady. This
last-named river, recent exploration has shown, probably does not reach
far into the range. But it will be seen by a glance at a map that the
upper waters of the other rivers are carried far into the heart of the
mountains. But these upper river courses are entirely conjectural and
have given rise to much controversy. There is plenty of work here for
the explorer, though the difficulties, physical and political, are great.

But besides these great unexplored regions, there are many blanks
to be filled up in other parts of Asia, and regions which, though known
in a general way, would well repay careful examination. There is the
mountain track between the upper Zarafshan River and the middle
course of the Sarkhab tributary of the Oxus, and the country lying
between that and the Oxus. There is the great Takla-Makan desert in
Chinese or eastern Turkistan, part of which has recently been explored
by Russian expeditions and by that young and indefatigable Swedish
traveler, Dr. Sven Hedin. Itis now one of the most forbidding deserts
to be found anywhere, but it deserves careful examination, as there
are evidences of its once having been inhabited, and that at no very
remote period. It is almost surrounded by the Tarim, and on its east-
ern edge lies Lob-nor, the remarkable changes in which have been the
subject of recent investigation. As readers of Dr. Nansen’s “ Voyage
of the Fram” will remember, the Siberian coast is most imperfectly
mapped; of course it is a difficult task, but it is one to which the Rus-
sian Government ought to be equal. China has on paper the appear-
ance of being fairly well mapped; but as a matter of fact our knowl-
edge of its mountain ranges and of its great river courses is to a large
extent extremely vague. All this awaits careful survey. In north-
eastern Manchuria and in many parts of Mongolia there are still blanks
to be filled up and mountain and river systems to be surveyed. In the
Malay Peninsula and in the great array of islands in the east and
southeast of Asia—Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines—much work still
remains to be done. Thus for the coming century there will be abun-
dance of work for explorers in Asia, and plenty of material to occupy
the attention of our geographical societies.

Coming to the map of Africa, we find the most marvelous transfor-
mation during the last sixty years, and mainly during the last forty
388 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

years, dating from Livingstone’s memorable journey across the conti-
nent. Though the north of Africa was the home of one of the oldest
civilizations, and though on the shores of the Mediterranean, Pheeni-
cians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans were at work for centuries, it
has only been within the memory of many of us that the center of the
continent, from the Sahara to the confines of Cape Colony, has ceased
to be an unexplored blank. This blank has been filled up with bewiid-
ering rapidity. Great rivers and lakes and mountains have been laid
down in their main features, and the whole continent, with a few unim-
portant exceptions, has been parceled out among the powers of Europe.
But much still remains to be done ere we can form an adequate concep-
tion of what is in some respects the most interesting and the most
intractable of the continents. Many curious problems still remain to
be solved. The pioneer work of exploration has to a large extent been —
accomplished; lines have been run in all directions; the main features
have been blocked out. But between these lines the broad meshes
remain to be filled in, and to do this will require many years of careful
exploration. However, there still remain one or two regions that afford
scope for the adventurous pioneer.

To the south of Abyssinia and to the west and northwest of Lake
Rudolf, on to the Upper Nile, is a region of considerable extent, which
is still practically unknown. Again, in the western Sahara there is
an extensive area, inhabited mainly by the intractable Tuaregs, into
which no one'lias been able to penetrate, and of which our knowledge
is extremely scanty. Even in the central Sahara there are great areas
which have not been traversed, while in the Libyan desert much remains
to be done. These regions are of interest almost solely from geograph-
ical and geological standpoints. But they deserve careful investiga-
tion, not only that we may ascertain their actual present condition, but
in order, also, that we may try to discover some clews to the past his-
tory of this interesting continent. Still, it must be said that the great
features of the continent have been so fully mapped during the last half
century that. what is required now is mainly the filling-in of the details.
This is a process that requires many hands and special qualifications.
All over the continent there are regions which will repay special inves-
tigation. Quite recently an English traveler, Mr. Cowper, found not
far from the Tripoli coast miles of magnificent ruins and much to cor-
rect on our maps. If only the obstructiveness of the Turkish officials
could be overcome, there is a rich harvest for anyone who will go to
work with patience and intelligence. Even the interior of Morocco,
and especially the Atlas Mountains, are but little known. The French,
both in Tunis and Algeria, are extending our knowledge southwards.
All the powers who have taken part in the scramble for Africa are
doing much to acquire a knowledge of their territories. Germany,
especially, deserves praise for the persistent zeal with which she has
carried out the exploration of her immense territories in east and west
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. 389

Africa. The men she sends out are unusually well qualified for the
work, capable not simply of making a running survey as they proceed,
and taking notes on country an‘! people, but of rendering a substantial
account of the geology, the fauna, the flora, and the economic condi-
tions. Both in the French and British spheres good work is also being
done, and the map of Africa being gradually filled up. But what we
especially want now are men of the type of Dr. J. W. Gregory, whose
book on the Great Rift Valley is one of the most valuable contributions
to African geography ever made. If men of this stamp would settle
down in regions like that of Mount Ruwenzori, or Lake Rudolf, or the
region about Lakes Bangweolo and Tanganyika, or in the Atlas, or in
many other regions that could be named, the gains to scientific geogra-
phy, as well as to the economical interests of Africa, would be great.
An example of work of this kind is seen in the discoveries made by a
young biologist trained in geographical observation, Mr. Moore, on
Lake Tanganyika. There he found a fauna which seems to afford a
key to the past history of the center of the continent, a fauna which,
Mr. Moore maintains, is essentially of a salt-water type. Mr. Moore, I
believe, is inclined to maintain that the ancient connection of this part
of Africa with the ocean was not by the west, as Joseph Thomson sur-
mised, but by the north, through the Great hkift Valley of Dr. Gregory;
and he strongly advocates the careful examination of Lake Rudolf as
the crucial test of his theory. It is to be hoped that he, or someone
equally competent, will have an opportunity of carrying out an inves-
tigation likely to provide results of the highest importance.

But there are other special problems connected with this, the most
backward and the most repellent of continents, which demand serious
investigation, problems essentially geographical. One of the most
important of these, from the point of view of the development of Africa,
is the problem of acclimatization. The matter is of such prime impor-
tance that a committee of the association has been at work for some
years collecting data as to the climate of tropical Africa. In a general
way we know that that climate is hot and the rainfall scanty; indeed,
even the geographers of the Ancient World believed that central Africa
was uninhabitable on account of its heat. But science requires more
than generalities, and therefore we look forward to the exact results
which are being collected by the committee referred to with much hope.
We can only go to work experimentally until we know precisely what
we have to deal with. It will help us greatly to solve the problem of
acclimatization when we have the exact factors that go to constitute
the climate of tropical Africa. At present there is no doubt that the
weight of competent opinion—that is, the opinion of those who have
had actual experience of African climate, and of those who have made a
special study of the effects of that climate on the human constitution—
is that though white men, if they take due precautions, may live and
do certain kinds of work in tropical Africa, it will never be possible to
390 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

colonize that part of the world with people from the temperate zone.
This is the lesson taught by generations of experience of Europeans in
India. So far, also, sad experience has shown that white people can not
hope to settle in central Africa as they have settled in Canada and the
United States and in Australia, and make it a nursery and a home for
new generations. Even in such favorable situations as Blantyre, a lofty
region on the south of Lake Nyasa, children can not be reared beyond
a certain age; they must be sent home to England, otherwise they will
degenerate physically and morally. No country can ever become the
true home of a peopleif the children have to be sent away to be reared.
Still, it is true our experience in Africa is limited. It has been main-
tained that it might be possible to adapt Europeans to tropical Africa
by a gradual process of migration. Transplant southern Europeans to
North Africa; after a generation or two remove their progeny farther
south, and so on, edging the succeeding generation farther and farther
into the heart of the continent. The expe:iment—a long one it would
be—might be tried; but it is to be feared that the ultimate result
would be a race deprived of all those characteristics which have made
Europe what itis. An able young Italian physician, Dr. Sambon, has
recently faced this important problem, and has not hesitated to come
to conclusions quite opposed to those generally accepted. His position
is that it has taken us centuries in Europe to discover our hidden
enemies, the microbes of the various diseases to which northern human-
ity isa prey, and to meet them and to conquer them. In Africa we have
a totally different set of enemies to meet, from lions and snakes down
to the invisible organisms that produce those forms of malaria, anzemia,
and other diseases characteristic of tropical countries. Headmits that
these are more or less due to heat, to the nature of the soil, and other
tropical conditions, but that if once we knew their precise nature and
modes of working we should be in a position to meet them and conquer
them. It may beso, but this is a result that could only be reached
after generations of experience and investigation; and even Dr. Sam-
bon admits that the ultimate product of European acclimatization in
Africa would be something quite different from the European progeni-
tors. Whatis wanted is a series of carefully conducted experiments.
I have referred to the Blantyre highlands; in British East Africa there
are plateaus of much greater altitude, and in other parts of central
Africa there are large areas of 4,000 feet and over above sea level. The
world may become so full that we may be forced to try to utilize these
lofty tropical regions as homes for white people when Canada and
Australia and the United States beccme over populated. As one of
my predecessors in this chair (Mr. Ravenstein) tried to show at the Leeds
meeting some years ago, the population of the world will have more
than doubled in a century, and about one hundred and eighty years
hence will have quadrupled. At any rate, here is a problem of prime
importance for the geographer of the coming century to attack; with —
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. 391

so many energetic and intelligent white men all over Africa, it should
not be difficult to obtain the data which might help toward its
solution. t

I have dwelt thus long on Africa because it will really be one of the
great geographical problems of the coming century. Had it been as
suitable as America or Australia, we may be sure it would not have
remained so long neglected and despised by the European peoples as
it has done. Unfortunately for Africa, just as it had been circumnavi-
gated, and just as Europeans were beginning to settle upon its central
portion and trying to make their way into the interior, Columbus and
Cabot discovered a new world, a world as well adapted as Europe for
the energies of the white races. That discovery postponed the legiti-
mate development of Africa for four centuries. Nothing could be
more marked than the progress which America has made since its
rediscovery four hundred years ago and the stagnation of Africa, which
has been known to Europe since long before the beginning of history,
During these four hundred years North America at least has been
very thoroughly explored. The two great nations which divide North
America between them have their Government surveys, which are
rapidly mapping the whole continent and investigating its geology,
physical geography, and its natural resources. I need hardly tell an
audience like this of the admirable work done by the survey of Canada
under Sir William Logan, Dr. Selwyn, and his successor, Dr. George
Dawson; nor should it be forgotten that under the lands department
much excellent topographical work has been carried out by Captain
Deville and his predecessors. Still, though much has been done,
much remains to be done. There are large areas which have not as
yet even been roughly mapped. Within quite recent years we have
had new regions opened up to us by the work of Dawson and Ogilvie
on the Yukon, by Dr. Bell in the region to the south of Hudson Bay,
by the brothers Tyrrell in the Barren Lands on the west of the same
bay, by O’Sullivan beyond the sources of the Ottawa, and by Low
in Labrador. But it is not so long since that Dr. Dawson, in reviewing
what remains to be done in the Dominion in the way of even pioneer
exploration, pointed out that something like a million square miles
still remained to be mapped. Apart from the uninhabitable regions
in the north, there are, as Dr. Dawson pointed out, considerable areas
which might be turned to profitable agricultural and mining account
of which we know little, such areas as these which have been recently
mapped on the south of Hudson Bay by Dr. Bell, and beyond the
Ottawa by Mr. O’Sullivan. Although the easternsand the western
provinces have been very fully surveyed, there is a considerable area
between the two, lying between Lake Superior and Hudson Bay, which
seems to have been so far almost untouched. A very great deal has
been done for the survey of the rivers and lakes of Canada. I need
hardly say that in Canada, as elsewhere in America, there is ample
392 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

scope for the study of many problems in physical geography—past and
present glaciation and the work of glaciers, the origin and régime of
lake basins, the erosion of river beds, the oscillation of coast lines.
Happily, both in Canada and the United States there are many men
competent and eager to work out problems of this class, and in the
reports of the various surveys, the transactions of American learned
societies, in scientific periodicals, in separate publications, a wealth of
data has already been accumulated of immense value to the geographer.

Every geologist and geographer knows the important work which
has been accomplished by the various surveys of the United States,
as well as by the various State surveys. The United States Coast
Survey has been at work for more than half a century, mapping not
only the coast but all the navigable rivers. The Lake Survey has
been doing a similar service for the shores of the Great Lakes of North
America. Butitis the work of the Geological Survey which is best
known to geographers—a survey which is really topographical as well
as geological, and which, under such men as Hayden, King, and Powell,
has produced a series of magnificent maps, diagrams, and memoirs of
the highest scientific value and interest. Recently this Survey has
been placed on a more systematic basis; so that now a scheme for the
topographical survey of the whole of the territory of the United
States is being carried out. Extensive areas in various parts of the
States have been already surveyed on different scales. It is to be
hoped that in the future, as in the past, the able men who are employed
on this survey work will have opportunities of working out the physi-
ography of particular districts, the past and present geography of
which is of advancing scientific interest. Of the complete explora-
tion and mapping of the North American continent we need have no
apprehension; it is only a question of time, and it is to be hoped that
neither of the Governments responsible will allow political exigencies
to interfere with what is really a work of national importance.

It is when we come to Central and South America that we find ample
room for the unofficial explorer.!. In Mexico and the Central American
States there are considerable areas of which we have little or only the
vaguest knowledge. In South America there is really more room now
for the pioneer explorer than there is in Central Africa. In recent
years the Argentine Republic has shown,a laudable zeal in exploring
and mapping its immense territories, while a certain amount of good
work has also been done by Brazil and Chile. Most of our knowledge
of South America is due to the enterprise of European and North
American explorers. Along the great river courses our knowledge is
fairly satisfactory, but the immense areas, often densely clad with for-
ests, lying between the rivers are almost entirely unknown. In Pata-
gonia, though a good deal has recently been done by the Argentinian

able memorandum by Sir Clements R. Markham and Col. G. E. Church.

Government, still in the country between Punta Arenas and the Rio
Negro we have much to learn, while on the west coast range, with its
innumerable fjord-like inlets, its islands and peninsulas, there is a fine
field for the geologist and physical geographer. Indeed, throughout
the whole range of the Andes systematic exploration is wanted, explora:
tion of the character of the excellent work accomplished by Whymper
in the region around Chimborazo. There is an enormous area lying to
the east of the northern Andes, and including their eastern slopes,
embracing the eastern half of Ecuador and Colombia, southern Vene-
zuela, and much of the country lying between that and northern
Bolivia, including many of the upper tributaries of the Amazon and
Orinoco, of which our knowledge is of the scantiest. Even the coun.
try lying between the Rio Negro and the Atlantic is but little known.
There are other great areas in Brazil and in the northern Chaco which
have only been partially described, such as the region whence the
Streams forming the Tapajos and the Paraguay take their rise, in Mato
Grosso. A survey and detailed geographical and topographical descrip-
tion of the whole basin of Lake Titicaca is a desideratum. In short,
in South America there is a wider and richer field for exploration than
in any other continent. But no mere rush through these little-known
regions will suffice. The explorer must be able to use his sextant
and his theodolite, his compass, and his chronometer. Any expedi-
tions entering these regions ought to be able to bring back satisfactory
information on the geology of the country traversed, and of its fauna
and flora, past and present; already the revelations which have been
made of the past geography of South America and of the life that
flourished there in former epochs are of the highest interest. Moreover,
we have here the remains of extinct civilizations to deal with, and
although much has been done in this direction, much remains to be
done, and in the extensive region already referred to, the physique, the
traditions, and the customs of the natives will repay careful investiga-
tion.

The southern continent of Australia is in the hands of men of the
Same origin as those who have developed to such a wonderful extent
the resources of Canada and the United States, and therefore we look
for equally satisfactory results so far as the characteristics of that con-
tinent permit. The five colonies which divide among them the 3,000,000
square miles of the continent have eaeh of them efficient government
Surveys, which are rapidly mapping their features and investigating
their geology. But Australia has a trying economic problem to solve.
In none of the colonies is the water supply quite adequate; in all are
stretches of desert country of greater or less extent. The center and
western half of the continent is covered by a desert more waterless
and more repellent than even the Sahara; so far as our present knowl-
edge goes one-third of the continent is uninhabitable. This desert area
has been crossed by explorers, at the expense of great sufferings, in
394 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

various directions, each with the same dreary tale of almost feature-
less sandy desert, covered here and there with Spinifex and scrub worse
than useless. There are hundreds of thousands of square miles still
unknown, but there is no reason to believe that these areas possess
any features that differ essentially from those which have been found
along the routes that have been explored. There have been one or two
well-equipped scientific expeditions in recent years that have collected
valuable data with regard to the physical characteristics, the geology
and biology of the continent; and it is in this direction that geography
should look for the richest results in the future. There remains much
to be done before we can arrive at satisfactory conclusions as to the
physical history of what is in some respects the most remarkable land
area on the globe. Though the surface water supply is so scanty there
is reason to believe that underneath the surface there is an immense
store of water. In one or two places in Australia, especially in west-
ern Queensland, and in New South Wales, this supply has been tapped
with satisfactory results; millions of gallons a day have been obtained
by sinking wells. Whether irrigation can ever be introduced on an
extensive scale into Australia depends upon the extent and accessi-
bility of the underground water supply, and that is one of the geograph-
ical problems of the future in Australia. New Zealand has been fairly
well surveyed, though a good deal remains to be done before its mag-
nificent mountain and glacier system is completely known. In the
great island of New Guinea both the British and the Germans are
opening up the interiors of their territories to our knowledge, but the
western and much larger portion of the island presents a large field
for any explorer who cares to venture into its interior.

The marvelous success which has attended Dr. Nansen’s daring
adventure into the Arctic seas has revived a widespread interest in
Polar exploration. Nansen may be said to have almost solved the
North Polar problem—so far, at least, as the Old World side of the
Pole is concerned. That someone will reach the Pole at no distant date
is certain; Nansen has shown the way, and the legitimate curiosity of
humanity will not rest satisfied till the goal be reached. But Arctic
exploration does not end with the attainment of the Pole. Europe has
done her share on her own side of the Pole. What about the side
which forms the Hinterland of North America, and specially of Canada?
To the north of Europe and Asia we have the scattered groups of
islands Spitsbergen, Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, and the New
‘Siberian Islands. To the north of America we have an immense archi-
pelago, the actual extent of which is unknown. Nansen and other
Arctic authorities maintain that the next thing to be done is to com-
plete exploration on the American side, to attempt to do for that half
of the North Polar region what Nansen has done for the other half.
It may be that the islands which fringe the northern shores of the New
World are continued far to the north; if so they would form convenient
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. 395

stages for the work of a well-equipped expedition. It may be that they
do not go much farther than we find them on our maps. Whatever be
the case it is important, in the interests of science, that this section of
the Polar area be examined; that as high a latitude as possible be
attained; that soundings be made to discover whether the deep ocean
extends all round the Pole. It is stated that the gallant Lieutenant
Peary has organized a scheme of exploring this area which would take
several years to accomplish. Let us hope that he will be able to carry
out his scheme. Meantime, should Canada look on with indifference?
She has attained the standing of a great and prosperous nation. She
has shown the most commendable zeal in the exploration of her own
immense territory. She has her educational, scientific, and literary
institutions which will compare favorably with those of other countries;
her press is of a high order, and she has made the beginnings of a litera-
ture and an art of herown. In these respects she is walking in the steps
of the mother country. But has Canada not reached a stage when she
isin a position to follow the maternal example still further? What has
more contributed to render the name of Great Britain illustrious than
those great enterprises which for centuries she has sent out from her
own shores, not a few of them solely in the interests of science? Such
enterprises elevate a nation and form its glory and its pride. Surely
Canada has ambitions beyond mere material prosperity, and what bet-
ter beginning could be made than the equipment of an expedition for
the exploration of the seas that lie between her and the Pole? I ven-
ture to throw out these suggestions for the consideration of those who
have at heart the honor and glory of the great Canadian Dominion.
Not only has an interest in Arctic exploration been revived, but in
Europe at least an even greater interest has grown up in the explora-
tion of the region around the opposite pole of the earth, of which our
knowledge is so scanty. Since Sir James C. Ross’s expedition, which
was sent out in the year 1839, almost nothing has been done for Ant-
arctic research. We have here to deal with conditions different from
those which surround the North Pole. Instead of an almost landless
ocean, it is believed by those who have given special attention to the
subject that a continent about the size of Australia covers the South -
Polar region. But we don’t know for certain, and surely, in the inter-
ests of our science, it is time we had a fairly adequate idea of what
are the real conditions. We want to know what is the extent of that
land, what are its glacial conditions, what is the character of its geol-
ogy, what evidence exists as to its physical and biological conditions in
past ages. We know there is one lofty, active volcano; are there any
others? Moreover, the science of terrestrial magnetism is seriously
impeded in its progress because the data in this department from the
Antarctic are so scanty. The seas around this continent require to
be investigated both as to their depth, their temperature, and their life.
We have here, in short. the most extensive unexplored area on the
396 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

surface of the globe. For the last three or four years the Royal Geo-
graphical Society, backed by other British societies, have been attempt-
ing to move the Home Government to equip an adequate expedition to
complete the work begun by Ross sixty years ago and to supplement
the great work of the Challenger. But though sympathy has been
expressed for Antarctic exploration, and though vague promises have
been given of support, the Government is afraid to enter upon an enter-
prise which might involve the services of a few naval officers and men.
We need not criticise this attitude. But the Royal Geographical Soci-
ety has determined not to let the matter rest here. It is now seeking
to obtain the support of public-spirited men for an Antarctic expedition
under its own auspices. It is felt that Antarctic exploration is pecul-
iarly the work of England, and that if an expedition is undertaken it
will receive substantial support from the great Australasian colonies,
which have so much to gain from a knowledge of the physical condition
of a region lying at their own doors, and probably having a serious
influence on their climatological conditions. Here, then, is one of the
greatest geographical problems of the future, the solution of which
should be entered upon without further delay. It may be mentioned
that a small and well-equipped Belgian expedition has already started,
mainly to carry out deep-sea research around the South Polar area, and
that strenuous efforts are being made in Germany to obtain the funds
for an expedition on a much larger scale.

But our science has to deal not only with the lands of the globe; its
sphere is the whole of the surface of the earth, and all that is thereon,
so far at least as distribution is concerned. The department of ocean-
ography is a comparatively new creation; indeed, it may be said to
have come definitely into being with the famous voyage of the Challenger.
There had been expeditions for ocean investigation before that, but on
a very limited scale. It has only been through the results obtained by
the Challenger, supplemented by those of expeditions that have exam-
ined more limited areas, that we have been able to obtain an approxi-
mate conception of the conditions which prevail throughout the various
ocean depths—conditions of movement, of temperature, of salinity, of
- life. We have only a general idea of the contours of the ocean bed and
of the composition of the sediment which covers that bed. The extent
of the knowledge thus acquired may be gauged from the fact that it
-oceupies a considerable space in the fifty quarto volumes—the Challenger
publications—which it took Dr. John Murray twenty years to bring
out. But that great undertaking has only, as it were, laid down the
general features of the oceanic world. There is plenty of room for fur-
ther research in this direction. Our own surveying ships, which are
constantly at work all over the world, do a certain amount of oceanic
work, apart from mere surveying of coasts and islands and shoals. In
1895 one of these found in the South Pacific soundings deeper by 500
fathoms than the deepest on record, that found twenty years earlier by
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. == 397

the Tuscarora to the northeast of Japan. The deepest of these new
soundings was 5,155 fathoms. In the interests of science, as well as of
cable laying, it is desirable that our surveying ships should be encour-
aged to carry out work of this kind more systematically than they do
at present. This could surely be arranged without interfering with
their regular work. We want many more observations than we now
have, not only on ocean depths, but on the nature of the ocean bed,
before we can have a satisfactory map of this hidden portion of the
-earth’s surface and form satisfactory conclusions as to the past rela-
tions of the ocean bed with what is now dry land. I believe the posi-
tion maintained by geologists, that from the remote period when the
ereat folds of the earth were formed the present relations between the
great land masses and the great oceans have been essentially the same;
that there have no doubt been great changes, but that these have been
within such limits as not to materially affect their relations as a whole.
This is a problem which further oceanic research would go a long way
to elucidate. That striking changes are going on at the present day,
and have been going on within the human period can not be doubted.
Some coast lines are rising; others are falling. Prof. John Milne, our
great authority on seismology, has collected an extremely interesting
series of data as to the curious changes that have taken place in the
ocean bed since telegraphic cables have been laid down. The frequent
breakages of cables have led to the examination of the suboceanic
ground on which they have been laid, and it is found that slides and
sinkings have occurred, in some cases amounting to hundreds of fath-
oms. ‘These, it is important to note, are on the slopes of the continental
margin, or, as it is called, the continental shelf, as, for example, off the
coast of Chile. It is there, where the earth’s crust is peculiarly in a
state of unstable equilibrium, that we might expect to find such move-
ments; and therefore soundings along the continental margins, at
intervals of, say, five years, might furnish science with data that might
be turned to good account.

As an example of what may be done by a single individual to eluci-
date the present and the past relations between land and sea, may I
refer to an able paper in the Geographical Journal of May, 1897, by Mr.
T. P. Gulliver, a pupil of Professor Davis, of Harvard, himself one of
the foremost of our scientific geographers? Mr. Gulliver has made a
special study on the spot, and with the help of good topographical and
geological maps, of Dungeness Foreland on the southeast coast of
Kent. Mr. Gulliver takes this for his subject, and works out with great
care the history of the changing coast line here, and in connection with
that the origin and changes of the English Channel. This is the kind
of work that well-trained geographical students might undertake. It
is work to be encouraged, not only for the results to be obtained, but
as one species of practical geographical training in the field, and as a
reply to those who maintain that geography is mere bookwork, and
398 THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY.

has no problem to solve. Professor Davis himself has given an example
of similar practical work in his elaborate paper on ‘ The development
of certain English rivers” in the Geographical Journal for February,
1895 (Vol. V. p. 127), and in many other publications. |

Another important problem to attack, and that in the near future, is
that of Oceanic Islands. I say in the near future, because it is to be
feared that very few islands now remain unmodified by contact with
Europeans. Not only have the natives been affected, both in physique
and in customs, but the introduction of EKuropean plants and animals
has to a greater or less extent modified the native fauna and flora.
Dr. John Murray, of the Challenger, has set a good example in this
direction by sending a young official from the Natural History Museum
to Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, one of the few untouched
islands that remain, lying far away from any other land, to the south-
east of the Keelings.

What islands are to the ocean, lakes are to the land. It is only
recently that these interesting geographical features have received the
attention they deserve. Dr. Murray has for some time been engaged
in investigating the physical conditions of some of the remarkable
lakes in the west of Scotland. Some three years ago my friend and
colleague, Dr. Mill, carried out a very careful survey of the English
lakes, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society. His
soundings, his observations of the lake conditions, of the features on
the margins of and around the lakes, when combined with the investi-
gation of the régime of the rivers and the physical geography of the
surrounding country, conducted by such accomplished geologists as
Mr. Marr, afford the materials for an extremely interesting study in
the geographical history of the district. On the Continent, again, men
like Professor Penck, of Vienna, have been giving special attention to
lakes, that accomplished geographer’s monograph on Lake Constance,
based on the work of the five States bordering its shores, being a
model work of its kind. But the father of limnology, as this branch
of geography is called, is undoubtedly Professor Forel, of Geneva, who
for many years has been investigating the conditions of that classical
lake, and who is now publishing the results of his research. Dr.
Forel’s paper on “ Limnology, a branch of geography,” and the discus-
sion which follows in the report of the last International Geographical
Congress, affords a very fair idea in short space of the kind of work to
be done by this branch of the science. In France, again, M. Delebec-
que is devoting himself to a similar line of research; in Germany, Ule,
Halbfass, and others; Richter in Austria, and the Balaton Commission
in Hungary. I may also here refer appropriately to Mr. Israel C. Rus-
sell’s able work, published in Boston in 1895, on “The Lakes of North
America,” in which the author uses these lakes as a text fora discourse
on the origin of lake basins and the part played by lakes in the changes
studied by dynamic geology. One of the best examples of an exhaus-
THE FUNCTION AND FIELD OF GEOGRAPHY. 399

tive study of a lake basin will be found in the magnificent monograph
on Lake Bonneville, by Mr. G. K. Gilbert, and that on Lake Lahontan
by Mr. Israel Cook Russell, published by the United States Geological
Survey; the former is, indeed, a complete history of the great basin,
the largest of the interior drainage areas of the North American con-
tinent. In the publications of the various surveys of the United States,
as well as in the official reports of the Canadian lake surveys, a vast
amount of material exists for anyone interested in the study of lakes;
in addition, the elaborate special reports on the great lakes by the
hydrographic department. Indeed, North America presents an excep-
tionally favorable field for limnological investigation; if carried out on
a systematic method, the resuits could not but be of great scientific
interest.

Rivers are of not less geographical interest than lakes, and these
have also recently been the subject of special investigation by physical
geographers. I have already referred to Professor Davis’s study of a
special English river system. The work in the English lake district by
Mr. Marr, spoken of in connection with Dr. Mill’s investigations, was
mainly on the hydrology of the region. Both in Germany and in Rus-
sia special attention is being given to this subject, while in America
there is an enormous literature on the Mississippi alone, mainly, no
doubt, from the practical standpoint, while the result of much valuable
work on the St. Lawrence is buried in Canadian official publications.

But time does not admit of my going further. I might have pointed
out the wide and vastly interesting field presented by what the Ger-
mans call anthropogeography, dealing with the interrelations between
humanity and its geographical environment. Geography, Mr. Mackin.
der has said, is the physical basis of history; it is, indeed, the physical
basis of all human activity, and from that standpoint the field for geo-
graphical research is unbounded. But I can only hint at this. I have
endeavored to indicate what are some of the leading geographical
problems of the future; first, in order to show at this somewhat critical
epoch how very much yet remains to be done, how many important lines
of inquiry are open to the geographical student, and that the possi-
bilities of our science are, like those of other departments of research,
inexhaustible. My aim has also been to indicate by actual examples
what, in the conception of British geographers at least, is the field of
our subject. We need not trouble greatly about any precise definition
so long as there is such a choice of work for the energies of the geog-
rapher. I trust I have been, to some extent at least, successful in the
double object which I have had in view in this opening address in a
country which presents so splendid a field to the practical geographer.
LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY.

THE BALLOON EXPEDITION TO THE POLE—AN ACCOUNT OF THE
START BY ANDREE’S FELLOW-VOYAGER, NILS STRINDBERG—LET-
TERS RELATING TO THE EXPEDITION FROM STRINDBERG’S FATHER.

On the 11th of last July, one Sunday afternoon, S. A. Andrée, with
two companions, Nils Strindberg and Knut Fraenkel, ascended from
Danes’ Island in the balloon ‘‘Ornen” (The Eagle) and sailed away
northward, hoping by this untried means to reach the North Pole. Dar-
ing even to foolhardiness as Andrée’s project may well seem, it had been
very coolly and prudently matured and systematically prepared for.
Andrée was born in Sweden October 18, 1854, and is now, therefore, 43
years old. He is a carefully educated mechanical engineer and man of _
science. From 1886 to 1889 he filled a chair in the leading Swedish
school of technology; he passed the winter of 1882-83 in Spitzbergen
as a member of a Swedish meteorological expedition, directing experi-
ments and observations in atmospheric electricity, and he has held for
some years an important engineering post under the Swedish Govern-
ment. In 1876, while on his way to America to serve the Swedish
exhibitors at the Centennial Exhibition, he was impressed with the
seeming regularity of the trade winds, and thus was led to consider
the possibility of balloon voyages across the Atlantic. His coming to
America augmented also in another way his interest in ballooning. In
a little speech spoken by him into a gramophone, for use at a Swedish
Aid Society’s fair holding in Brooklyn while he was preparing for his
journey to the Pole, Mr. Andrée said:

‘It is a great pleasure for me to be able to contribute to the Swedish
Aid Society’s fair. I have been in America myself and have experi-
enced how hard it is to be without work. I was glad many times to
make my living by wielding a broom. In spite of that I have many
pleasant recollections from that time, because I learned a great deal
while staying there. It was there I met the old aeronaut John Wise,
from Philadelphia, and it was there I got the first lesson in the manu-
facturing of balloons. For meis America, therefore, indeed memorable,
and the Americans can rest assured that I should like very much, if I
could, to visit them with my balloon via the North Pole.”

Early in 1895 Mr. Andrée laid his ideas for a balloon expedition into
the Arctic, then pretty well matured, before the Swedish Academy of

Science. Later in the same year he presented them in England before
the International Geographical Congress. He estimated that he would
require for his project a little over $36,000. In time the money was
provided, mainly by the generosity of Mr. Alfred Noble, who died,
however, before Andrée could make his start; Baron Oscar Dickson,
who died soon after the start; and the King of Sweden. Andrée had
now been studying balloons with great care for some years. He had
himself made a number of ascensions, and he had had some very thril-
ling and dangerous adventures. With the money he required made
secure, he set about the construction of a balloon especially suited to
his purpose.
THE BALLOON.

The “ Ornen” was built by M. Lachambre, the well-known balloon
maker of Paris, at an original cost of $10,000. The balloon proper was
originally 97 feet through from top to bottom; and at the widest part
674 feet through from side to side; After the failure to make a start in
1896, Andrée decided to enlarge it, and it was carried back to Paris,
cut in two at the middle, and an additional section inserted about 34
feet high. The perpendicular diameter was thus increased by about
that much, but the horizontal diameter remained as before. By this
enlargement the volume of the balloon was increased 10,600 cubic feet,
becoming in all 170,000 cubic feet. Itis made of silk—three thicknesses
through the upper two-thirds, and two through the lower third, all
varnished twice over, inside and out. Over all the seams are laid pro-
tecting strips, and to doubly insure tightness these were varnished at
the edges, just before the start, with a varnish especially devised for
this use. There are two valves about halfway up the balloon, nearly,
but not quite, opposite each other; and there is a third at the bottom.
The Jatter works automatically; the others are controlled by ropes
attached to them on the inside and coming out of the balloon at the
bottom beside the third.

The balloon is encased in a heavy netting of hemp, woven above,
with much intricacy, of 384 separate ropes, and ending below in 48
“suspension ” ropes, to which is attached what is known as the “ bear-
ing ring.” This ring is a part of great importance; itis to the balloon
much what the keelis to a ship. Itis about 74 yards in circumference,
is made of wood, and is braced with cross-bars.

To the bearing ring is attached the car, or basket, by six ropes, each
about 14 inches in diameter. These ropes are knitted into the wall of
the car, and fastened securely at the bottom of it. Above the car they
are encircled and braced by five horizontal ropes, equidistant from each
other, which thus form a series of guard rails. Above these, about 64
feet from the roof of the car, is yet another; it is much shorter, and
draws the suspending ropes into a circle of about half the diameter of
that made by the lower ones.

The car is cylindrical in form, about 64 feet in diameter and 5 in
LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY. 403

depth. It is of wicker, woven over a frame of chestnut wood. Iron
and steel were avoided in its construction, lest they might disturb the
action of the magnetic instruments with which the balloon is equipped.
At one side, on the lower edge, the car is sheared, or beveled, away, in
order that on landing it may strike more gently and not be overturned.
Well up in the wall of the car are two small windows closed with glass,
and near the bottom are two openings closed with wood, while through
the roof is a trap door. The whole car is covered with tarpaulin.

The interior of the car is chiefly for rest and retirement. The place
for work and observation is the roof. Here is erected a sort of swing-
ing gallery, free at the bottom, so that it may remain horizontal under
the tip of the balloon, and shielded somewhat from the weather by a
curtain of tarpaulin. In this gallery were placed the scientific instru-
ments: thermometers, barometers, cameras, and so on—a full equip-
ment; and here two of the aeronauts would keep an outlook and
manage the balloon, while the third took his rest in the car below. A
sleeping bag (a hair mattress encased in reindeer skin) occupied the
middle of the car; and all about, in ingenious compartments, were
stored books, maps, instruments, toilet articles, kitchen utensils, arms,
ammunition, and what not.

The main places of storage, however, were the bearing ring, which
with its cross braces formed a sort of garret floor whereon were stowed
various tools and implements, such as shovels, anchors, and reserve
ropes; and the spaces between the forty-eight suspension ropes above
the bearingring. Securely hung in these spaces were forty-eight large,
strong cloth sacks, divided into numerous compartments. In twelve
were stowed sledges, boats, sail yards, and kindred articles; in thirty-
Six were stored provisions.

ANDREE’S PROVISIONS.

Andrée’s store of provisions, since his fate became so much of a
mystery, has grown to be a subject of great interest. Thousands of
letters, from all parts of the world, have gone to the Academy of Science
at Stockholm asking about it; and finally, in order to satisfy public
curiosity, King Oscar of Sweden requested Dr. Beauvais of Copenhagen,
head of the house that supplied Andrée, to make a report on the amount
of provisions he carried. Dr. Beauvais has just reported as follows:

“The Andrée expedition has provisions for nine months. All the
boxes in which the conserved food is kept were made of copper, as iron
would have had a disastrous effect on the magnetic instruments carried
by the expedition. To occupy as little space as possible they were
made square instead of round. The food consists of’ every kind of
steaks, sausages, hams, fish, chickens, game, vegetables, and fruit. If
these provisions have been saved, together with the food which the
explorers can procure through fishing and hunting, they have sufficient
provisions to last them two years.

“The expedition is also furnished with a new kind of lozenges of
concentrated lemon juice. This is the first time these have been used
404 LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY.

by Polar expeditions, and it is expected they will absolutely prevent
every attack of scurvy.

“Hinally, the expedition is provided with 25 kilos (about 55 pounds)
of thin chocolate cakes, mixed with pulverized pemmican. To preserve
this food against dampness it is packed in pergament, covered with
stannine, a brittle metal composed of tin, sulphur, and copper, and
inclosed in air-tight boxes. Nansen’s expedition was also provided with
this food, and it was found to be both nourishing and pleasant to the
taste.”

Even a means of cooking was not lacking from the outfit. A stove
about 10 by 17 inches, heated by a spirit lamp, was carried along; and,
in order to avoid the danger of using it near the gas of the balloon, it
was so devised and placed that it could be lighted and operated hanging
25 feet below the roof of the car.

To aid in steering and controlling the balloon, Andrée devised an
apparatus of sails and guide ropes—three sails, presenting to the wind
when full spread a surface of 800 square feet; and three guide ropes,
one about 1,017 feet long, another about 1,042 feet and the third about
1,205 feet. The ropes trail from the bearing ring, and are attached to
it in such wise that they can be shifted from point to point; and by
thus shifting them, the theory at least is that there can be a corre-
sponding shift made in the course of the balloon. The sails are hung
two from bamboo spars projecting from the bearing ring, and one
above the bearing ring between the suspension ropes.

Andrée’s first design was to sail in the summer of 1896. The balloon
and all stores and appliances were conveyed to Danes’ Island; a
balloon house was erected, and engines set up for producing hydrogen
gas and inflating the balloon. All, indeed, was made ready; but the
‘south wind they wanted for the start did not come. They waited for
it until the season had advanced too far for a safe venture, and then
they came back to Sweden. In May, 1897, they returned, and by
July 1 again had everything ready for a start. And again the south
wind refused to come. They had to wait ten days for it. We have a
very interesting view of the party at this trying time, as well as a
full account of the work they had had to do in getting ready, in the
following letter, written by Andrée’s companion, Nils Strindberg, to
his brother in New York and not before published:

LETTER FROM NILS STRINDBERG.

‘Yes, now the folks at home believe us to be ascended. From Anna
I had no letter, and papa was very doubtful about his letter reaching
me. But alas! it is true that we have not yet departed. As you have
probably heard through the papers or letters from home, we anchored
the 30th of May in Virgo Harbor, after having been detained by the
ice in Danes’ Gate. It seems to have been an exceptionally mild
winter. There is considerably less snow this year than last, which still
was milder than the average winter. The balloon house stood when
LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY. A405

we arrived, but was so damaged by the winter storms that it was on
the verge of collapsing. But one must remember that it was only
calculated to remain for one summer. With the aid of tackle and
buttresses it was soon fixed, and June 14 we brought the balloon from
the Virgo to the balloon house. On the 16th the balloon was stretched
out on the floor, which had been covered with thick coarse felt. The
Virgo left Danes’ Island on the 16th. And now we had our hands full
to make the balloon tight and to inflate it. To make it tight we had to
varnish all the seams on the outside as well as the inside. In order to
varnish the inside the balloon is partly inflated with air by a large
bellows, and the workmen crawl in through the lower opening. Sve-
denborg, Fraenkel, Machuron, and myself take turns in the super-
intending of theinside varnishing. The interior of the balloon is a very
strange sight. It looks like a low vault of stone masonry. * * *
There we were, eight men, each with a pot of varnish and a brush, and
varnished every seam of the upper half of the balloon. The varnish
makes the air very bad, and after some time one begins to feel a pain
in one’s eyes, as of onions.

‘““On Saturday, the 17th, at 7 o’clock in the morning, the hydrogen
apparatus was started and put in connection with the balloon, and at
12 o’clock, midnight, between the 22d and 23d, it was inflated. Then
it had to be tested as to its tightness and the principal holes fixed.
This was done by anew method invented by Mr. Stake. It is simply to
allow the few particles of hydrogen sulphide, which are always pro-
duced with the hydrogen, to accompany the hydrogen into the balloon.
If pieces of muslin saturated with a solution of acetate of lead are put
on the balloon, the smallest leakage may be discovered by the escaping
hydrogen Faiphide, which causes the muslin to turn black. This
method proved to be very practical, and we discovered several small
~ holes which could be fixed. During these operations one walks around
on top of the balloon, which only yields imperceptibly. * * *

‘“‘A fter these preparations we have succeeded in getting the balloon in
pretty good shape; at all events much better than last year. It loses
daily about 45 kilos (a fraction over 99 pounds) in carrying capacity;
but as we have possibilities of throwing out 1,700 kilos (about 3,748
pounds) of ballast, we will easily float for more than a month.

‘““We do not intend to start until we get favorable wind, to avoid
being pushed right back to Spitzbergen by contrary winds. If we get
the right wind we ought to be able to go some distance in these thirty
days. With a fairly strong wind we will make from 10 to 20 knots an
hour, and will reach the Pole, or a point near to it, in from thirty to
sixty hours. Once having reached the northernmost point, we don’t
care where the wind carries us. Of course we would rather land in
Alaska near the Mackenzie River, where we would very likely meet
American whalers, who are favorably disposed toward the expedition.
It would really be a glorious thing to succeed so well. But even if we
406 LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY.

were obliged to leave the balloon and proceed over the ice, we shouldn’t
consider ourselves lost. We have sledges and provisions for four
months, guns, and ammunition; hence are just as well equipped as other
expeditions as far as that is concerned. I would not object to such a
trip. The worst thing is that the folks at home will feel uneasy if we
don’t appear in the fall, but are obliged to spend the winter in the Are-
tic regions. My body is now in such good condition, and I have got so
accustomed to the Arctic life, that a winter up here don’t seem terrible
at all. One gets used to everything. But the best thing would be to
come home in the fall. * * *

‘¢ Well, I hope we shall soon have favorable winds. On the 8th day
of July we had a strong southerly wind, but then it was too strong.
It was almost a gale, and it would have been impossible to ascend
without damage to the balloon. Later it shifted over to the west too
much. If we don’t get a southerly wind before the 15th of July we
intend to try with a southeasterly, to be carried north of Greenland,
and there possibly utilize the south winds which, according to Lieuten-
ant Peary, are prevalent during summer.

‘“ Well, good-bye, now, brother; just wonder if we will meet next time
in New York. Send my love to Uncle and Aunt Outad and the boy,
also to the Ellnrod family. Tell them that nowadays I write to nobody
but my fiancée. Got no time for more.

‘¢ Your brother, NILs.

“The Lofoten, which arrived this morning at 7 o’clock, has left
already at 10; so this will have to go by the next mail.”

THE START.

When the members of the party arose on the morning of July 11,
they sent up a joyous ery of “A strong, steady wind from the south!”
What followed this bestirring announcement has been very well
described by one of the party, and we can not do better than to quote
his account:

‘After a short discussion on the morning of the 11th, Mr. Andrée
and his companions decided to ascend as soon as possible. Now fol-
lowed some hours of great activity. Everyone felt perceptibly the
importance of the moment, and all demonstrated this in an excellent
way. Through the roaring storm, which so powerfully pressed against
the balloon house that it cracked and squeaked in all its joints, Mr.
Andrée’s powerful voice was heard, now from the outside, now from the
inside, and now again from the top of the colossal building, giving
orders and superintending the last preparations for this long-planned
journey, which had cost so much effort and so much anxiety and for
which so much was risked. All that was invested in the undertaking
could still be lost at the very start.

“The wind is roaring, and the gigantic balloon pulls and pulls at its
anchorage, sometimes with threatening force. Heavy clouds come
tearing down from the mountain tops; a sudden gush of wind strikes
LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY. AO7

the house, and it crashes more than ever. One of the poles at the
upper balcony, to which canvas is fastened for protection against the
wind, yields to the pressure and falls over the balloon, and might cause
the whole expedition to come to naught, did not quick hands check it
in its fall. The whole thing seems to hang ona hair. But Andrée does
not seem at all excited. He takes in every detail of the preparations,
and gives his orders, which are carried out rapidly and carefully.

‘In about an hour’s time the north wall of the house is torn partly
down, and all hands are called to assist in raising and managing the
balloon. Finally there is nothing left todo but attach the car—an
extremely difficult job, as the raised balloon sways to and fro more than
before. But even this is accomplished successfully, and now, about
three and one-half hours after the work began, our three daring coun-
trymen are ready to start on their hazardous journey. A few moments
for the last farewells, and Andrée with his two companions, Nils
Strindberg and Knut Fraenkel, jumps aboard the ‘Ornen,’ and orders
are given to cut the retaining ropes. The captain of the Svensksund,
Count Ehrensvard, proposes a ‘long life’ for Mr. Andrée, which is given
with four hearty hurrahs. Andrée and his companions answer with,
‘Long live old Sweden!’

‘As the last ropes are loosened I[ hurry up a hill behind the balloon
house to take photographs of the ascending balloon. Just as I reach
my elevated position, the immense balloon slowly and majestically
rises out of its prison. On account of its undulations the lower part
catches on something connected with the house, but slips off again the
next moment, and the balloon rises to between 600 and 700 feet, at the
same tine moving in a northeasterly direction out over Danes’ Gate.
But suddenly it drops down again, in a course straight toward the sea,
being depressed by a current of air that has descended suddenly upon
it from the mountain top, and also being somewhat pulled down by the
catching of the guide ropes. The car touches the waves, but like a
giant ball the balloon rebounds, and when some sand bags are thrown
out (nine bags, each weighing about 42 pounds), it rises until it reaches
a height of about 3,000 feet. Then flying free, it continues at the height
of about 3,000 feet, first in a northeasterly direction over Danes’ Gate
and toward the southern cape of Amsterdam Island. Thisit passes, and
then turns toward the north, keeping over the sound between Amster-
dam Island and Fogelsang. After a while it again turns toward the
northeast aud passes the northern cape of Fogelsang. Then it dis-
appears in a cloud. But in a short while it reappears in a north-north-
easterly direction, between Fogelsang and Cloven Cliff, then changes
toward the west, and finally disappears altogether—about an hour
after the ascension.”

LETTERS FROM STRINDBERG’S FATHER.

Nils Strindberg’s brother in New York received from his father in
Sweden a number of letters written about the time the expedition
AOS LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY.

started and a little after that give interesting information regarding it
and its members. We print here the important parts of these letters,
no portion of which has been published before:

“On Saturday [May 8] we have a few of Nils’s friends for dinner to
say good-bye. But we are not able to have Andrée with us, because
his mother died a few days ago from paralysis of the heart, and he is
now down to her funeral.”

‘‘Nils was calm all the time |May 15] except when he was leaving
the house, when he burst out weeping for a few moments. He is
indeed a man, for he left the dearest he has on earth [his fiancée] to
carry out a great idea, and therefore I do think we shall see him back
again, after a successful trip. Andrée was as calm as a summer sea.”

‘““It was so strange [when a picture of the ascension reached them];
all the time one could imagine the ‘Ornen’ soaring away over the ice
and snow toward the unknown—to land where? and when? and how?

eAnd then?”

“The day after Anna [Miss Chaslier, Strindberg’s fiancée] accom-
panied ine into the city to meet Svedenborg. Of course it was inter-
esting to hear eyewitnesses relate the story, although not much was
told that had not been in the papers. Both Anna and myself had let-
ters from Nils written the morning of the ascension day; calm and
sure aS always. It was Nils who called out, ‘Long live old Sweden’
when the balloon rose out of the house. The last words Andrée
was heard to utter were ‘What was that?’ when the balloon caught
somewhere for a moment. Svedenborg had saved, and presented to
Anna, the sand bag Nils cut off at the start. I got another. Anna
also got the pigeon, in a small cage, with the message. It was
brought out in the country and well cared for; but when we moved to
the city, she followed my advice and had it killed and stuffed—and
soon she will have it back in flying position as a permanent souvenir
from the dearest she has, poor thing.”

“And so one has to goon and hope for a year at least; and even
after that don’t draw too unfavorable conclusions, for they may have
long distances to walk before they reach inhabited places.”

‘At present I read Nansen’s book with great interest, and in my
thoughts I place ‘the three’ in the same or similar situations. Since
they have rifles and sufficient ammunition and the necessaries for a
journey over the ice and a stay over the winter, I suppose they can do
it, although with difficulties to overcome.”

“Andrée and Nils, whom I know best, are such characters that, if
possible, they make the impossible possible; and they have surely
intelligence enough to figure out the best way of getting out of their
emergencies. Andrée’s ideas and Nils’s Anna are two mighty levers
and self-protections, and the love of life will help along, too.”

I was the chemist of the expedition which fitted out Andrée for his
North Pole journey. I made the gas which carried his balloon away
to the north. I kept a diary of all the events that happened from the
time the expedition was first assembled in Sweden until Andrée and
his companions disappeared beyond Fogelsang on the northern horizon.
From what I have seen printed in the papers both here and abroad I
do not think that all of the happenings of the departure can be known
to the public at large. For instance, it may not be known generally
that Andrée was very reluctant to depart on his voyage on that rather
memorable July 11. His own wish was to defer the start to the next day.
I do not believe he would have gone on the 11th had he not been urged
to go by his companions. He is very painstaking and careful as a
rule, and in his middle age far more discreet than the youth of his
companions allowed them to be. But Strindberg and Frankel had
waited so long and hoped so much for a breeze from the south that
they were eager to be off. They were afraid the breeze would die away
and the expedition would be left stranded on Danes’ Island, as it was
in 1896,

I remember very well the morning of the 11th. Strindberg and I
occupied the same cabin on board the Swedish gunboat which carried
us up tothe island. Strindberg came running to me that morning and
awoke me in my bunk, crying, “‘ The breeze! the breeze! We shall sail
to-day. The wind is from the south.” I laughed at him, for I did not
believe it was possible. But when I came out on the deck I found that
the preparations for the start had already begun. Andrée was doubt-
ful. In his mind this southerly wind might be a false alarm. He
thought they had better wait a day or so and see if it would continue.
A conference was held on the vessel, after which, reluctant as yet,
Andrée went ashore to the balloon house to see if the breeze was quite
as Strong there as it was on board the gunboat. During the morning
he had been making meteorological observations, and the results added
force to the pleadings of his companions. He came on board the ves-
sel again, and a second conference was held. It was finally decided
to go that day, and immediately the order to knock down the front
section of the balloon house was given. This was at 10.30 a.m. At
2.30 in the afternoon the balloon sailed away.

Andrée went away with the impression that the balloon would float
at least six weeks. Indeed, it was his idea in 1896 that he could keep
in the air for a year or more if necessary, but the trouble we had with
escaping gas soon dispelled this notion. I think that even after he
found how impossible it was to confine the gas he overrated the time
he would be able to keep afloat. The expert from the balloon factory

410 LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY.

and I made a minute calculation of how long the gas would remain in
the bag, taking into consideration its slow escape through the minute
interstices which we found it impossible to close up. Our calculation
was that the balloon would remain afloat, barring accidents, not longer
than fifteen days. The ‘‘Ornen” probably was the tightest balloon
bag ever made, but we could not close up some of the holes. I invented
a process for detecting the escape of the gas. After the balloon was
inflated we spread long strips of sheeting saturated with acetate of
lead over the top. The confined hydrogen sulphide as it escaped
would, on coming in contact with the sheeting, cause the latter to
become discolored. Thus the exact location of every hole could be
ascertained. °

Even so, although we varnished and revarnished the silk inside and
out, we could not prevent the almost imperceptible holes. The great-
est trouble was in the seams where the sections of the great bag were
joined. The finest needle hole was sure to show a leak, even after the
stitching had been done as neatly as possible. It may not be known
that the successive varnishings could be done satisfactorily only on the
upper part of the bag, against which the greatest outward pressure of
the confined gas was exerted. Of course we would have done the
lower part of the balloon more thoroughly, but we had not time. The
aeronauts were eager to sail with the first good south wind, and we
had to let them go. Strindberg had made some experiments to reduce
the outflow of the gas, but they were without success. The constant
smearing on of the gutta-percha which we used was really the best we
could do. Our estimate of fifteen days’ duration for the gas, small as
it was, would provide for its retention twice the length of time that
gas has ever before been confined in a balloon. I believe that no bal-
loon heretofore has floated longer than a week.

Andrée was handicapped at the start by the loss of two-thirds of
his drag ropes, upon which he depended to steer his balloon. The acci-
dent was a curious one, and while it could not have been foreseen, yet
the conditions under which it happened might have been avoided if
different arrangements had been made. The drag ropes of the balloon,
which were about 1,000 feet long, were in three sections, and were
joined together by metal screw couplings. ‘The couplings could be
screwed apart, the inference being, I suppose, that if Andrée wanted
to do so he could unscrew and east off any part of the drag rope. Why
he could not just as easily have cut them apart I do not know. Now,
when the balloon was ready to start, the drag ropes attached to the
lower side of the basket were allowed to trail up over the top edge of
the balloon house and down again to the beach along which they were
trailed, so as to be clear of all obstructions and ready to follow the
balloon out to sea when it rose out of its nest.

But the heavy weight of the ropes defeated this purpose. The part
of the ropes which lay outside on the beach offered an immense friction,
LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY. 411

which the balloon seemed unable to overcome. Instead of following
the bag out of the house, uncoiling as they went, the upper sections of
the drag ropes twisted, and under the severe strain the couplings
unscrewed. For a moment it seemed that the balloon would not get
away; that the friction of the heavy ropes would hold her to the shore.
Then, to our astonishment, the couplings parted and the airship
darted upward.

The question whether or not the loss of these ropes would prevent
Andrée from steering the balloon has been openly discussed. It is
impossible to tell, of course, though he may have remedied the defect
by putting out another drag rope composed of the rope which hung
from the basket and which for the time being was used as ballast.

When the balloon rose out of the house some portion of it caught on
the structure of the balloon house. Andrée was heard to exclaim
“What was that?” Then we heard Strindberg srying, “Long live
old Sweden!” A boat had pulled out from the shore, and as the bag
tore away Andrée grabbed a speaking trumpet and shouted to those
in the boat. From his motions every one believed he was trying to
say something about the loss of the drag ropes, but no one could
understand what he said, and as the balloon got farther and farther
away, the difficulty of making himself understood became greater
and greater.

Andrée lost much ballast and much gas before the balloon passed out
of sight. After its first jump upward from the balloon house it was
depressed toward the water by the air current coming down from the
mountains behind us. It got so near the surface of the water that for
a moment we wondered whether the expedition wasn’t going to end
right there. Nobody spoke, but everybody was filled with excitement
all the more intense because no sound was uttered. Then the balloon-
ists began throwing out ballast, 9 bags of sand, weighing about 378
pounds. After that the balloon went upward. It reached over 3,000
feet in height; then it went forward again. Later on it was depressed,
evidently through the escape of gas, which the aeronauts permitted to
flow through the valves. Finally, when it rose over Vogelsung, more
ballast must have been dispensed with in order to accomplish the
purpose.

Of course it is impossible to surmise where the explorers are at
present, if they have escaped the bad effects of Arctic exposure. It
is naturally impossible for the balloon to have floated until this time,
and in reasoning out any course of safety for the balloonists we must
presuppose that they descended safely on some land. We know from
the message received by means of the carrier pigeons that were shot
in the rigging of the sealing vessel Alken in the vicinity of Spitzbergen,
that Andrée did not continue northward. According to the dispatch
he was headed in an easterly direction, after having gone 145 geograph-
ical miles to the north. He had already gone 45 miles to the eastward
412 LETTERS FROM THE ANDREE PARTY.

when the pigeon was released. Andrée started on a wind which ear-
ried his balloon along at the rate of 25 or 30 miles an hour. Had he
continued northward at this rate he would have reached the Pole in
less than two days. But I believe when these southern winds strike
the northern ice, and become colder, they also become slower. There-
fore, the rate of progress of his balloon would be greatly lessened
as he proceeded northward. However, we know that he was going
toward the east when last heard from.

If the balloonists managed to land safely on Franz Josef land, they
may have been able to pull through the winter by erecting a hut and
by hunting for food, as has been pointed out. It may be that they
have gone too far north to sustain themselves in this manner. On the
other hand, they may have descended into the ocean, although in the
latter event they had one meager chance left open to them. It has
been said that Andrée acted in an ill-advised manner when he placed
his provisions in packages up in the ropes of his balloon rather than
in the basket in which he and his companions were to live. It has .
been said that if the basket had been overturned the balloonists would
have been spilled out, and the balloon, relieved of their weight, would
immediately bound in the air and carry away with it their precious
food. But Andrée’s conclusions in this matter showed him to have
been more far-sighted than his critics. His idea was that the balloon
might descend into the sea, in which case he and his companions would
be compelled to take to those very ropes themselves. Then, by cutting
loose the basket beneath them, the balloon would rebound into the air
and carry upward not only the aeronauts, but their precious food as
well.

So itis all highly problematical. Under fortunate circumstances the
explorers might exist several years in the Arctic regions. Everything
that could be done to insure the success of the trip was done before
they started. They were provided with every necessary of life; they
had provisions, arms, ammunition, Sledges, and a boat. They might,
if they are on the mainland, gradually journey southward, in which
case we Shall hear of them before long. If they dropped into the
ocean, they are lost. If they have reached the Polar cap and wrecked
their balloon, they undoubtedly have found the great spot which so
many have striven to find; but whether they will ever be able to tell
its mysteries to the world is another question which I would rather not
be asked to answer.

SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC
EXPEDITION.!

Dr. MuRRAY’s Address.

‘From a scientifie point of view the advantages to be derived from a
well-equipped and well-directed expedition to the Antarctic would, at
the present time, be manifold. Every department of natural knowledge
would be enriched by systematic observations as to the order in which
phenomena coexist and follow each other in regions of the earth’s sur-
face about which we know very little or are wholly ignorant. It is one
of the great objects of science to collect observations of the kind here
indicated, and it may be safely said that without them we can never
arrive at a right understanding of the phenomena by which we are
surrounded, even in the habitable parts of the globe.

Before considering the various orders of phenomena concerning
which fuller information is urgently desired it may be well to point out
a fundamental topographical difference between the Arctic and Ant-
arctic. In the Northern Hemisphere there is a polar sea almost com-
pletely surrounded by continental land, and continental conditions for
the most part prevail. In the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand,
there is almost certainly a continent at the South Pole, which is com-
pletely surrounded by the ocean, and in those latitudes the most sim-
ple and extended oceanic conditions on the surface of the globe are
encountered.

THE ATMOSPHERE.

One of the most remarkable features in the meteorology of the globe
is the low atmospheric pressure at all seasons in the Southern Hemi-
sphere south of latitude 45° S., with the accompanying strong westerly
and northwesterly winds, large rain and snow fall, all round the South
Polar regions. The mean pressure seems to be less than 29 inches,
which is much lower than in similar latitudes in the Northern Hemi-
sphere. Some meteorologists hold that this vast cyclonic system and
low-pressure area continues south as far as the Pole, the more southerly
parts being traversed by secondary cyclones. There are, however,

Address by Dr. John Murray, F. R. S., and subsequent speeches, delivered at a
special meeting of the Royal Society, London, February 24, 1898. Printed in Nature,
No. 1479, vol. 57, March 3, 1898.

418

many indications that the extreme South Polar area is occupied by a
vast anticyclone, out of which winds blow toward the girdle of low
pressure outside the ice-bound region. In support of this view it is
pointed out that Ross’s barometric observations indicate a gradual rise
in the pressure south of the Jatitude 75° S., and all Antarctic voyagers
agree that when near the ice the majority of the winds are from the
south and southeast, and bring clear weather with fall of temperature,
while northerly winds bring thick fogs with rise of temperature.

All our knowledge of the meteorological conditions of the Antarctic
is limited to a few observations during the midsummer months, and
these indicate that the temperature of the snow-covered Antarctic con-
tinent is even at that time much lower than that of the surrounding
sea. The anticyclonic area at the South Pole appears therefore to be
permanent, and when in winter the sea ice is for the most part continu-
ous and extends far to the north the anticyclonic area has most prob-
ably a much wider extension than insummer. ‘This is indicated by the
- southeasterly winds, which at times blow toward the southern point of
the American continent in June and July.

All observations in high southern latitudes indicate an extremely low
summer temperature. In winter we have no direct observations. The
mean of Ross’s air temperatures south of latitude 63° 8S. was 28.74° F.,
which is about the freezing point of sea water, and his maximum tem-
perature was 43.5° F. Both Wilkes and D’Urville observed pools of
fresh water on several icebergs, and, when sailing along the ice barrier,
Ross saw “gigantic icicles depending from every projecting point of its
perpendicular cliffs,”! soit is probable that extensive melting sometimes
takes place.

In the latitude of the Antarctic Circle the air is frequently at or near
the point of saturation, and precipitation takes place in the form of
rain, sleet, snow, or hail. Most of the observations near the ice-covered
land show, however, a much drier atmosphere, and in all probability
precipitation over the Antarctic continent takes place in the form of
fine snow crystals, such as is recorded in the interior of Greenland.

There would appear, then, to be good reasons for believing that the
region of the South Pole is covered by what may be regarded practi-
cally as a great permanent anticyclone, with a much wider extension in
winter than in summer. It is most likely that the prevailing winds
blow out from the Pole all the year round toward the surrounding sea,
as in the case of Greenland; but, unlike Greenland, this area is prob-
ably seldom traversed by cyclonic disturbances.

But what has been stated only shows how little real knowledge we
possess concerning the atmospheric conditions of high southern lati-
tudes. It is certain, however, that even two years’ systematic observa-
tions within these regions would be of the utmost value for the future
of meteorological science.

ANTARCTIC ICE.

From many points of view it would be important to learn something
about the condition and distribution of Antarctic sea ice during the
winter months, and especially about the position and movements of
the huge table shaped icebergs at this and other seasons of the year.
These flat-topped icebergs, with a thickness of 1,200 or 1,500 feet, with
their stratification and their perpendicular cliffs, which rise 150 or 200
feet above and sink 1,100 or 1,400 feet below the level of the sea, form
the most striking peculiarity of the Antarctic Ocean. Their form and
structure seem clearly to indicate that they were formed on an extended
land surface, and have been pushed out over low-lying coasts into
the sea.

Ross sailed for 300 miles along the face of a great ice barrier from
150 to 200 feet in height, off which he obtained depths of 1,800 and 2,400
feet. This was evidently the sea front of a great creeping glacier or
ice cap just then in the condition to give birth to the table-shaped
icebergs, miles in length, which have been described by every Antarc-
tic voyager.

All Antarctic land is not, however, surrounded by such inaccessible
clifts of ice, for along the seaward faces of the great mountain ranges
of Victoria Land the ice and snow which descend to the sea apparently
form cliffs not higher than 10 to 20 feet, and in 1895 Kristensen and
Borchgrevink landed on a pebbly beach occupied by a penguin rookery
at Cape Adare without encountering any land ice descending to the
sea. Where a penguin rookery is situated we may be quite sure that
there is occasionally open water for a considerable portion of the year,
and that consequently landing might be effected without much difficulty
or delay; and further, that a party, once landed, might with safety
winter at such a spot, where the penguins would furnish an abundant
supply of food and fuel. A properly equipped party of observers
situated at a point like this on the Antarctic Continent for one or two
winters might carry out a most valuable series of scientific observations,
make successful excursions toward the interior, and bring back valuable
information as to the probable thickness of the ice-cap, its temperature
at different levels, its rate of accumulation, and its motions, concerning
all which points there is much difference of opinion among scientific
men.

ANTARCTIC LAND.

Is there an Antarctic Continent? It has already been stated that
the form and structure of the Antarctic icebergs indicate that they were
built up on and had flowed over an extended land surface. As these
bergs are floated to the north and broken up in warmer latitudes they
distribute over the floor of the ocean a large quantity of glaciated rock
fragments and land detritus. These materials were dredged up by the
Challenger in considerable quantity, and they show that the rocks over
416 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

which the Antarctic land ice moved were gneisses, granites, mica-schists,
quartziferous diorites, grained quartzites, sandstones, limestones, and
shales. These lithological types are distinctively indicative of conti-
nental land, and there can be no doubt about their having been
transported from land situated toward the South Pole. D’Urville
describes rocky islets off Adélie Land composed of granite and gneiss.
Wilkes found on an iceberg near the same place bowlders of red
sandstone and basalt. Borchgrevink and Bull have brought back
fragments of mica-schists and other continental rocks from Cape Adare.
Dr. Donald brought back from Joinville Island a piece of red jasper
or chert containing Radiolaria and sponge spicules. Captain Larsen
brought from Seymour Island pieces of fossil coniferous wood, and also
fossil shells of Cuculleea, Cytherea, Cyprina, Teredo, and Natica, hav-
ing a close resemblance to species known to occur in lower Tertiary
beds in Britain and Patagonia. These fossil remains indicate in these
* areas a much warmer cllmate in past times. Weare thus in possession
of abundant indications that there is a wide extent of continental land
within the ice-bound regions of the Southern Hemisphere.

It is not likely that any living land fauna will be discovered on the
Antarctic continent away from the penguin rookeries. Still, an Ant-
arctic expedition will certainly throw much light on many geological
problems. Fossil finds in high latitudes are always of special impor-
tance. The pieces of fossil wood from Seymour Island can hardly be
the only relics of plant life that are likely to be met with in Tertiary and
even older systems within the Antarctic. Tertiary, Mesozoic, and
Paleozoic forms are tolerably well developed in the Arctic regions,
and the occurrence of like forms in the Antarctic regions might be
expected to suggest much as to former geographical changes, such as
the extension of the Antarctic continent toward the north, and its con-
nection with, or isolation from, the northern continents, and also as to
former climatic changes, such as the presence in pre-Tertiary times of
a nearly uniform temperature in the waters of the ocean all over the
surface of the globe. :

MAGNETIC AND PENDULUM OBSERVATIONS, GEODETIC MEASURE-
MENTS, TIDES AND CURRENTS.

In any Antarctic expedition magnetic observations would, of course,
form an essential part of the work to be undertaken, and the impor-
tance of such observations has been frequently dwelt upon by eminent
physicists and navigators. Should a party of competent observers be
stationed at Cape Adare for two years, pendulum observations could
be carried out there and at other points within the Antarctic, or even
on icebergs and on the interior ice cap. It might be possible to
measure a degree on the Antartic continent or ice cap, which would be
a most useful thing todo. By watching the motions of the icebergs
and ice from land at Cape Adare, much would be learned about oceanic
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 417

currents, and our knowledge of the tides would be increased by a
systematic series of tidal observations on the shores of Antarctica,
where we have at present no observations. The series of scientific
observations here mentioned, and others that might be indicated, would
fill up many gaps in our knowledge of the physical conditions of these
high southern latitudes.

DEPTH OF THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN.

In regard to the depth of the ocean immediately surrounding the :
Antarctic continent we have at present very meager information, and
one of the objects of an Antarctic expedition would be to supplement
our knowledge by an extensive series of soundings in all directions
throughout the Antarctic and Southern oceans. It would in this way
be possible, after a careful consideration of the depths and marine
deposits, to trace out approximately the outlines of the Antarctic con-
tinent. At the present time we know that Ross obtained depths of 100
to 500 fathoms all over the great bank extending to the east of Victoria
Land, and somewhat similar depths have been obtained extending for
some distance to the east of Joinville Island. Wilkes sounded in
depths of 500 and 800 fathoms about 20 or 30 miles off Adélie Land.
The depths found by the Challenger in the neighborhood of the Antarctic
circle were from 1,300 to 1,800 fathoms, and farther north the Chal-
lenger soundings ranged from 1,260 to 2,600 fathoms. To the south-
west of South Georgia, Ross paid out 4,000 fathoms of line without
reaching bottom. In the charts of depth which I have constructed I
have always placed a deep sea in this position; for it appears to me that
Ross, who knew very well how to take soundings, was not likely to have
been mistaken in work of this kind.

The few indications which we thus possess of the depth of the ocean
in this part of the world seem to show that there is a gradual shoaling
of the ocean from very deep water toward the Antarctic continent, and,
so far as we yet know, either from soundings or temperature observa-
tions, there are no basins cut off from general oceanic circulation Ly
barriers or ridges, similar to those found toward the Arctic.

DEPOSITS OF THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN.

The deposits which have been obtained close to the Antarctic conti-
nent consist of blue mud, containing glauconite, made up for the most
part of detrital matters brought down from the land, but containing a
considerable admixture of the remains of pelagic and other organisms.
Farther to the north there is a very pure diatom ooze, containing a con-
siderable quantity of detrital matter from icebergs, and a few pelagic
foraminifera. This deposit appears to form a zone right round the
earth in these latitudes. Still farther to the north the deposits pass in
deep water, either into a Globigerina ooze or into a red clay with
manganese nodules, sharks’ teeth, ear bones of whales, and the other

SM 97——27
A188 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

materials characteristic of that deep-sea deposit. Since these views,
however, as to the distribution of deep sea deposits throughout these
high southern latitudes are founded upon relatively few samples, it
can not be doubted that further samples from different depths in the
unexplored regions would yield most interesting information.

TEMPERATURE OF THE ANTARCTIC OCEAN.

The mean daily temperature of the surface waters of the Antarctic,
as recorded by Ross, to the south of latitude 63°S.in the summer
months, varies from 27.3° to 33.6°, and the mean of all his observations
is 29.85°. As already stated, his mean for the air during the same
period is somewhat lower, being 28.74°. In fact, all observations seem
to show that the surface water is warmer than the air during the
Summer months.

The Challenger observations of temperature beneath the surface indi-
cate the presence of a stratum of colder water wedged between warmer
water at the surface, and warm water at the bottom. This wedge-
shaped stratum of cold water extends through about 12° of latitude,
the thin end terminating about latitude 53° S., its temperature varying
from 28° at the southern thick end to 32.5° at the northern thin end,
while the temperature of the overlying water ranges from 29° in the
south to 38° in the north, and that of the underlying water from 32° to
35°, This must be regarded as the distribution of temperature only
during the summer, for it is improbable that during the winter months
there is a warmer surface layer.

In the greater depths of the Antarctic, as far south as the Antarctic
circle, the temperature of the water varies between 32° and 35° F., and
is not, therefore, very different from the temperature of the deepest
bottom water of the tropical regions of the ocean. The presence of
this relatively warm water in the deeper parts of the Antarctic Ocean
may be explained by a consideration of general oceanic circulation.
The warm tropical waters which are driven southward along the east-
ern coasts of South America, Africa, and Australia, into the great all-
encircling Southern Ocean, there become cooled as they are driven to
the east by the strong westerly winds. These waters, on account of
their high salinity, can suffer much dilution with Antarctic water, and
still be denser than water from these higher latitudes at the same tem- -
perature. Here the density observations and the sea-water gases indi-
cate that a large part of the cold water found at the greater depths of
the ocean probably leaves the surface and sinks toward the bottom in
the Southern Ocean, between the latitudes of 45° and 56°S. These
deeper, but not necessarily bottom, layers are then drawn slowly north-
ward toward the tropics, to supply the deficiencies there produced by
evaporation and southward-flowing surface currents, and these deeper
layers of relatively warm water appear likewise to be slowly drawn —
southward to the Antarctic area to supply the place of the ice-cold
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 419

currents of surface water drifted to the north. This warm underlying
water is evidently a potent factor in the melting and destruction of the
huge table-topped icebergs of the southern hemisphere. While these
views as to circulation of oceanic water appear to be well established,
still a fuller examination is most desirable at different seasons of the
year, with improved thermometers and sounding machines. Indeed,
all deep-sea apparatus has been so much improved as a result of the
Challenger explorations, that the labor of taking salinity and all other
oceanographical observations has been very much lessened.

PELAGIC LIFE OF THE ANTARCTIC OCHAN.

In the surface waters of the Antarctic there is a great abundance of
diatoms and other marine alge. These floating banks or meadows form
primarily not only the food of pelagic animals, but also the food of the
abundant deep-sea life which covers the floor of the ocean in these
south polar regions. Pelagic animals, such as copepods, amphipods,
mollusks, and other marine creatures, are also very abundant, although
species are fewer than in tropical waters. Some of these animals seem
to be nearly, if not quite, identical with those found in high northern

_latitudes, and they have not been met with in the intervening tropical
zones. The numerous species of shelled Pteropods, Foraminifera,
Coccoliths, and Rhabdoliths, which exist in the tropical surface waters,
gradually disappear as we approach the Antarctic circle, where the
shelled Pteropods are represented by a small Limacina, and the Fora-
minifera by only two species of Globigerina, which are apparently
identical with those in the Arctic Ocean. A peculiarity of the tow-net
gatherings made by the Challenger expedition in high southern lati-
tudes, is the great rarity or absence of the pelagic larvee of benthonic
organisms, and in this respect they agree with similar collections from
the cold waters of the Arctic seas. The absence of these larve from
polar waters may be accounted for by the mode of development of
benthonic animals to be referred to presently. It must be remembered
that many of these pelagic organisms pass most of their lives in water
of a temperature below 32° F., and it would be most interesting to
learn more about their reproduction and general life history.

BENTHOS LIFE OF THE ANTARCTIC OCHAN.

At present we have no information as to the shallow-water fauna of
the Antarctic Continent; but, judging from what we do know of the
off-lying Antarctic Islands, there are relatively few species in the shal-
low waters in depths less than 25 fathoms. On the other hand, life in
the deeper waters appears to be exceptionally abundant. The total
number of species of Metazoa collected by the Challenger at Kerguelen
in depths less than 50 fathoms was about 130, and the number of addi-
tional species known from other sources from the shallow waters of the
Same island is 112, making altogether 242 species, or 30 species less
4?() SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

than the number obtained in eight deep hauls with the trawl and dredge
in the Kerguelen region of the Southern Ocean, in depths exceeding
1,260 fathoms, in which eight hauls 272 species were obtained. Obser-
vations in other regions of the Great.Southern Ocean, where there is a
low mean annual temperature, also show that the marine fauna around
the land in high southern latitudes appears to be very poor in species
down to a depth of 25 fathoms, when compared with the number of
species present at the mud line about 100 fathoms, or even at depths
of about 2 miles.

In 1841 Sir James Ross stated that the animals he dredged off the
Antareti¢e continent were the same as those he had dredged from similar
depths in the Arctic seas, and he suggested that they might have
passed from one pole to the other by way of the cold waters of the deep
sea.! Subsequent researches have shown that, as with pelagic organ-
isms, many of the bottom-living species are identical with, or closely
allied to, those of the Arctic regions, and are not represented in the
intermediate tropical areas. For instance, the most striking character
of the shore-fish fauna of the Southern Ocean is the reappearance of
types inhabiting the corresponding latitudes of the Northern Hemi-
sphere and not found in the intervening tropical zone. This interruption
of continuity in the distribution of shore fishes is exemplified by species
as well as genera, and Dr. Giinther enumerates eleven species and
twenty-nine genera as illustrating this method of distribution. The
following are among the species: Chimera (Chimera monstrosa), two
species of dogfish (Acanthias vulgaris and A. blainvillt), the monkfish
(Rhina squatina), John Dory (Zeus faber), angler (Lophius piscatorius),
bellows-fish (Centriscus scolopax), sprat (Clupea sprattus). The genus
by which the family Berycidée is represented in the southern temperate
zone (Trachichthys) is much more nearly allied to the northern than to
the tropical genera. ‘As in the northern Temperate Zone, so in the
southern, * * * thevariety of forms is much less than between the
Tropics. This is especially apparent on comparing the number of
species constituting a genus. In this zone genera composed of more
than ten species are the exception, the majority having only from one
to five.” ‘“ * * * Polyprionis one of those extraordinary instances
in which a very specialized form occurs at almost opposite points.of the
globe, without having left a trace of its previous existence in, or of its
passage through, the intermediate space.”

Speaking of the shore fishes of the Antarctic Ocean, Giinther says:
“The general character of the fauna of Magelhaen’s Straits and Ker-
guelen’s Land is extremely similar to that of Iceland and Greenland.
As in the Arctic fauna, Chondropterygians are scarce, and represented
by Acanthias vulgaris and species of Raja. * * * As to Acanthop-
terygians, Cataphracti and Scorpzenide are represented as in the
Arctic fauna, two of the genera (Sebastes and Agonus) being identical.

! Antarctic Voyage, page 207.
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 421

The Cottidz are replaced by six genera of Trachinide, remarkably
similar in form to Arctic types. * * * Gadoid fishes reappear, but
are less developed; as usual, they are accompanied by Myxine. The
reappearance of so specialized a genus as Lycodes is most remarkable.” !

These statements with reference to shore fishes might, with some
modifications, be repeated concerning the distribution and character of
all classes of marine invertebrates in high northern and high southern
latitudes. The Challenger researches show that nearly 250 species
taken in high southern latitudes occur also in the Northern Hemisphere,
but are not recorded from the tropical zone. Fifty-four species of sea-
weed have also been recorded as showing a similar distribution.’ Bipo-
larity in the distribution of marine organisms is a fact, however much
naturalists may differ as to its extent and the way in which it has
originated.

All those animals which secrete large quantities of carbonate of lime
greatly predominate in the tropics, such as Corals, Decapod Crustacea,
Lamellibranchs, and Gasteropods. On the other hand, those animals
in which there is a feeble development of carbonate of lime structures
predominate in cold polar waters, such as Hydroida, Holothuroidea,
Annelida, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Tunicata. This difference is in
direct relation with the temperature of the water in which these organ-
isms live, carbonate of lime being thrown down much more rapidly and
abundantly in warm than in cold water by ammonium carbonate, one
of the waste products of organic activity.

In the Southern and Subantarctic Ocean a large proportion of the
Echinoderms develop their young after a fashion which precludes the
possibility of a pelagic larval stage. The young are reared within or upon
the body of the parent, and have a kind of commensal connection with her
till they are large enough to take care of themselves. A similar method
of direct development has been observed in eight or nine species of
Echinoderms from the cold waters of the northern hemisphere. On
the other hand, in temperate and tropical regions, the development of
a free-swimming larva is so entirely the rule that it is usually described
as the normal habit of the Echinodermata. This similarity in the mode
of development between Arctic and Antarctic Echinoderms (and the
contrast to what takes place in the tropics) holds good also in other
classes of Invertebrates, and probably accounts for the absence of free-
swimming larve of benthonic animals in the surface gatherings in
Arctic and Antarctic waters.

What is urgently required with reference.to the biological problems
here indicated is a fuller knowledge of the facts, and it can not be
doubted that an Antarctic expedition would bring back collections
and observations of the greatest interest to all naturalists and physi-

ologists, and without such information it is impossible to discuss with
success the present distribution of organisms over the surface of the
globe, or to form a true conception of the antecedent conditions by
which that distribution has been brought about.

CONCLUDING REMARKS.

There are many directions in which an Antarctic expedition would
earry out important observations besides those already touched on in
the foregoing statement. From the purely exploratory point of view
much might be urged in favor of an Antarctic expedition at an early
date; for the further progress of scientific geography it is essential to
have a more exact knowledge of the topography of the Antarctic
regions. This would enable a more just conception of the volume rela-
tions of land and sea to be formed, and in connection with pendulum
observations some hints as to the density of the suboceanic crust and
the depth of the Antarctic ice cap might be obtained. In case the
above sketch may possibly have created the impression that we really
know a great deal about the Antarctic regions, it is necessary to restate
that all the general conclusions that have been indicated are largely
hypothetical, and to again urge the necessity for a wider and more
solid base for generalizations. The results of a successful Antarctic
expedition would mark a great advance in the philosophy—apart from
the mere facts—of terrestrial science.

No thinking person doubts that the Antarctic will be explored. The
only questions are, When? and by whom? I should like to see the
work undertaken at once, and by the British Navy. I should like to
see a sum of £150,000 inserted in the estimates for the purpose. The
Government may have sufficient grounds for declining to send forth
such an expedition at the present time, but that is no reason why the
scientific men of the country should not urge that the exploration of
the Antarctic would lead to important additions to knowledge, and that,
in the interests of science among English-speaking peoples, the United
Kingdom should take not only a large but a leading part in any such
exploration. @

THE ANTARCTIC ICE SHEET: DUKE OF ARGYLL.

Scientific men generally feel, I think, that they do not need to give
detailed reasons in connection with particular subjects of inquiry to
Justify their unanimous desire for an Antarctic expedition. Itis enough,
surely, for them to point out the fact that a very large area of the sur-
face of our small planet is still almost unknown to us. That it should
be so seems almost a reproach to our civilization. As to detailed
reasons, it may almost be said with truth that there is hardly one of the
physical sciences on which important light may not be cast by Antarctic
exploration. Oceanic circulation, meteorology, magnetism, distribu-
tion of animal and vegetable life—not only in the present, but in the
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 423

past—geology, mineralogy, volcanic action under special conditions—
all of these are subjects on which the phenomena of the Antarctic
regions are sure to bear directly.

If, however, I am asked to specify more particularly the qnestion on
which I look for invaluable evidence which can be got nowhere else, I
must name, above all others, the most difficult questions involved in
quaternary geology. Geologists are nearly all agreed that there has
been, very recently, a glacial age—an age in which glacial conditions
prevailed over the whole northern hemisphere to a much lower latitude
than they prevail now. But geologists differ widely and fundamentally
from each other as to the form which glacial agencies took during that
period. In particular, many geologists believe in what they call an
“ice sheet”— that is to say, in the northern world having been covered
by an enormous mass of ice several thousand feet thick, which, as they
assert, ‘“‘flowed” over mountain areas as well as over plains, and filled
up the bed of seas of a considerable depth. Other geologists disbelieve
in this agency altogether. They deny that even such a body of ice ever
existed; it could not possibly have moved in the way which the theory
assumes. They affirm, also, that the facts connected with glaciated
surfaces do not indicate the planing down by one universal sheet of
enormous weight and pressure; but, on the contrary, the action of small
and lighter bodies of ice, which have acted partially and unequally on
different surfaces differently exposed.

We might have hoped that this controversy could be settled by the
facts connected with the only enormous ice sheet which exists in the
northern hemisphere, viz, that which covers the great continent of
Greenland. But that ice sheet, enormous though it be, does certainly
not do what the ice sheet of the Glacial Age is supposed to have done.
That is to say, it does not flow out from Greenland, fill the adjacent
seas, or override the opposite coasts, even in so narrow a sheet as
Smith’s Sound. But this evidence is negative only. In the Antarctic
continent we have reason to believe that there is a larger ice sheet, and
it certainly does protrude into the adjacent seas, not merely by sending
out broken, floating fragments, but in unbroken ice cliffs of great height.
Now, we want to know exactly under what conditions this protrusion
takes place. Dr. Murray speaks of it as “creeping” seawards—a
more cautious word than “flowing.” But is it certain that it does
even creep? May it not simply grow by accretion or aggregation till it
reaches a depth of water so great as to break it off by flotation? Does
it or does it not carry detritus when no detritus has been dropped on
its surface? Or does it pick up detritus from its own bed? Or does
it push foreign matter before it? Does the perfectly tabular form of
the Antarctic icebergs indicate any differential movement in the
parent mass at all; or does it not indicate a condition of immobility
until their buoyancy lifts great fragments off? What is the condition
of the rocks on which they rest? Is there any thrust upon the mass
A424 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

from the mountain ranges on which the gathering ground lies; or is the
whole country one vast gathering ground from the continual excess of
precipitation over melting? These questions, and a hundred others,
have to be solved by Antarctic discovery, and until they are solved
we can not argue with security on the geological history of our own
now temperate regions. The Antarctic continent is unquestionably the
region of the earth in which glacial conditions are at their maximum,
and therefore it is the region in which we must look for all the informa-
tion attainable toward, perhaps, the most difficult problem with which
geological science has to deal.

SIR JOSEPH HOOKER’S VIEWS.

Dr. Murray’s admirable summary of the scientific information obtain-
able by an organized exploration of the Antarctic regions, leaves nothing
further to be said under that head. I can only record the satisfaction
with which I heard it, and my earnest hope that it will lead to action
being taken by the Government in the direction indicated.

Next to a consideration of the number and complexity of the objects
to be obtained by an Antarctic expedition, what dwells most in my
imagination is the vast area of the unknown region which is to be the
field for investigation—a region which, in its full extension, reaches
from the latitude of 60° S. to the southern pole, and embraces every
degree of longitude. This is a very considerable portion of the surface
of the globe, and it is one that has been considered to be for the most
part inaccessible to man; I will, therefore, ask you to accompany the
scientific explorer no farther than to the threshold of the scenes of his
labors, that you may see how soon and how urgently he is called upon
to study some of those hitherto unsolved Antarctic problems that he
will there encounter.

In latitude 60° S. an open ocean girdles the globe without break of
continuity. Proceeding southward in it, probably before reaching the
Antarctic circle, he encounters the floating ice fields, which form a cir-
cumpolar girdle known as “The Pack,” approximately concentric with
the oceanic, interrupted in one meridian only, that south of Cape Horn,
by the northern prolongation of.Grahams Land. Pursuing his south-
ward course in search of seas or lands beyond, after the novelty of his
position in the Pack has worn off, he asks where and how the compo-
nent parts of these great fields of ice had their origin, how they arrived
at and maintain theif present position, what are their rate of progress
and courses, and what their influence on the surrounding atmosphere
and ocean. I believe I am right in thinking that to none of these ques-
tions can a fuller answer be given than that they originated over exten-
Sive areas of open water in a higher latitude than they now occupy, that
they are formed of frozen ocean water and snow, and that winds and eur-
rents have brought them to where we now find them; but of the position
of the southern open waters, with the exception of the comparatively
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 425

diminutive sea east of Victoria Land,! we know nothing, nor do we
know anything of the relative amount of snow and ice of which they
are composed, or of their age, or of the winds and currents that have
carried them to a lower latitude.

The other great glacial feature of the Antarctic area is ‘The Barrier”
which Ross traced for 300 miles in the seventy-eighth and seventy-ninth
degrees of south latitude, maintaining throughout its character of an
inaccessible precipitous ice cliff (the sea front of a gigantic glacier) of
150 to 200 feet in height. This stupendous glacier is no doubt one
parent of the huge table-topped ice islands that infest the higher lati-
tudes of the Southern Ocean; but as in the case of the Pack, we do not
know where the Barrier has its origin, or anything further about it
than thatit in great part rests upon a comparatively shallow ocean bot-
tom. It probably abuts uvon land, possibly on an Antarctic continent;
but to prove this was impossible, on the occasion of Ross’s visit, for the
height of the ship’s crow’s-nest above the sea surface was not sufficient
to enable him to overlook even the upper surface of the ice. Nor dol
foresee any other method of settling this important point, except by the
use of a captive balloon, an implement with which I hope that future
expeditions may be supplied. There were several occasions in which
such an implement might advantageously have been used by Ross
when near the Barrier, and more when it would have greatly facilitated
his navigation of the Pack.

I have chosen the Antarctic ice as the subject upon which to address
this most important meeting, not only because it is one of the very first
of the phenomena that demand the study of the explorer, but because
it is the dominant feature in Antarctic navigation, where the Pack is
ever present or close by, demanding, whether for being penetrated or
evaded, all the commander’s fortitude and skill, and all his crew’s
endurance.

It may be expected that I should allude to those sections of Dr. Mur-
ray’s Summary that refer to the Antarctic fauna and flora; they are
most important, for the South Polar Ocean swarms with animal and
vegetable life. Large collections of these, taken both by the tow net
and by deep-sea soundings, were made by Sir J. Ross, who was an ardent
naturalist and threw away no opportunity of observing and preserving;
but unfortunately, with the exception of the Diatomaceze (which were
investigated by Ehrenberg), very few of the results of his labor in this
direction have been published. A better fate, I trust, awaits the treas-
ures that the hoped-for expedition will bring back; for so prolific is
that ocean that the naturalist need never be idle, no, not even for one
of the twenty-four hours of daylight throughout an Antarctic summer,

1T refer to the ‘‘pancake” ice, which, in that sea, on several occasions formed with
great rapidity around Ross’s ship, in lat. 76° to 78° S. in February, 1842, and which
arrested their progress. Such ice, augmented by further freezing of the water and
by snowfalls, may be regarded as a genesis of fields that, when broken up by gales.
are carried to the north and contribute to the circumpolar pack.

and I look to the results of a comparison of the oceanic life of the Arctic
and Antaretic regions as the heralding of an epoch in the history of
biology.

THE PRACTICABILITY. OF ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.

Dr. Nansen said a great Antarctic expedition should be undertaken
by the British nation. Heconfined his observations to the great impor-
tance of a land expedition in the Antarctic Continent. It would cer-
tainly be of the bighest importance to have it in connection with a
naval expedition, which would afford an excellent basis for such a land
expedition. Dr. Murray had already mentioned the possibilities, and,
perhaps, probabilities, that there was a large Antarctic continent cov-
evered by an ice cap. They did not quite know yet. It might be that
there were large islands, and there might be sounds in between covered
with floating ice. Whether that was so or not, it was certain there
must be one or several huge ice caps inside this unknown territory in
the south, and he felt certain that the exploration of these would give
scientific information of the greatest importance. There were many
problems to solve, and the only place they could try to solve them
in was the polar regions. Greenland had already given them much
information about the ice sheet, but Greenland was too small, when
compared with the big ice sheets in the glacial packs. They should
look to the much more extensive ice sheets which they might find in
the unknown territory. He did not think it would be very difficult to
reach the Antarctic Continent. They must remember they knew a
great deal more about ice investigation than in the days of Ross. They
had much better ships, and had steam, and were not afraid to push
the ships into an ice pack. They knew that if they were exposed to
pressure and some hard times, they had the means to get out of it
again; and his opinion was that in the Southern Sea they were sur-
rounded by much open water all round, and a ship would not run the
risk of being shut up in ice as long as in the Arctic regions, where the
seas were shut up by land round about. So far as he understood it,
they would not run so much risk in that way in the south as in the
Arctic. The ice generally opened in calm weather, and that was exactly
when sailing vessels would not be able to make use of the opportunity
to getin. So he thought with their modern steamships it would not be
difficult to get into the Antarctic. It had been said that the ice sheet
in the Antarctic continent was difficult to get at. It was difficult to
ascend. Ofcourse, when they went along the Barrier, as Ross did, it
was difficult to get through, and probably the only way would be by
captive balloons. He believed captive balloons would be of the great-
est use for exploration in polar regions. With regard to the probable
thickness of the ice sheet in the Antarctic, some put it at 2,000 feet,
some at 10,000 feet, but he would rather put it at 20,000 feet. The
height might present considerable difficulty to any land expedition.
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 427

This enormous ice sheet must have an important influence upon the
climatology of the whole world, and valuable information might be
obtained as to meteorological conditions through an Antarctic expedi-
tion. If such a great naval expedition as had been suggested were
sent from this country, Norway would gladly join in the work and
send out another expedition to take part in the land work, and it would
be of the greatest importance if there could be international coopera-
tion in these expeditions, because simultaneous observations could then
be made in these Antarctic regions, and they could lay their plans in a
more scientific way.

DR. NEUMAYER ON GRAVITY AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

A gravity survey is, in connection with a thorough geographical
survey of the Antarctic, one of the most urgent requirements of the
science of our earth. There are no measurements of the gravity con-
stant within the Antarctic region; indeed, they are very scarce in the
Southern Hemisphere south of latitude 30° S., and they are so closely
connected with the theory of the figure of our earth that it is hardly
possible to arrive at any conclusive results in this all-important matter
without observations within the Antarctic region. It is impossible to
foretell what effect an exact gravity survey in that region might exert
upon our views with regard to all physical elements which depend upon
the radius of our earth. Apart from that consideration, we may hope
for another important enlargement of the knowledge bearing upon the
connection between terrestrial magnetism and gravity. Gravity obser-
vations have been so much simplified of late, by Von Herack’s ingen-
ious apparatus, that it does not offer a serious difficulty to multiply
gravity determinations within the Antarctic region, so that we may
well be able to speak of a “gravity survey.” The all-important ques-
tion of the distribution of land within the South Polar region is closely
connected with it. The International Geodetic Permanent Commission
expressed it as their conviction that a gravity survey within that region
would be of the greatest benefit for higher geodetic theories.

The probable connection between gravity and terrestrial magnetism
has already been referred to. But apart from this, a magnetic survey
of the Antarctic region is of the greatest importance from other points
of view. As, since the time of Ross, no other observations of the values
of the magnetic elements have been made, we are perfectly ignorant of
the values of the secular variations south of latitude 50°, though this
information is urgently needed for the construction of trustworthy
magnetic charts required in navigation. Of the situation of the south-
ern magnetic pole, and of its motion during the last fifty years, we are
equally ignorant, though the facts are so highly important according
to Gauss’s theoretical deductions.

Much as the mathematical theory of terrestrial magnetism has been
developed, of the physical theory of that mysterious force in nature we
428 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

are yet in perfect ignorance. This defect is certainly to some consid-
erable degree caused by the want of our knowledge in higher latitudes.
It seems as if the magnetic character of the South Polar region is such
as would afford all facility for a sound investigation when compared
with the magnetic conditions of the North Polar region. <A glance at
a magnetic map shows how entirely different is the distribution of the
magnetic action in both polar regions.

There is the interesting fact to be noticed in the south that the two
foci of total intensity are situated on the side toward the south of the
Australian continent and nearly on the same meridian. The magnetic
action which makes itself manifest by magnetic storms or disturbances
reaches its highest degree likewise south of the Australian continent,
whereas to the south of South America the storms become very scarce
and of a similar magnitude to those in middle latitudes. This was
most strikingly proved by the observations in Orange Bay and South
Georgia during the period of international observations in 1882-83.
Of course, the magnetic South Pole and the situation of the foci above
mentioned are in close connection with these facts, but the reason of
their distribution remains unexplained. A discussion of all observa-
tions on southern polar lights also shows a connection between their
frequency and the maximum region of magnetic disturbance.

Though the examination of these few facts ought to prompt the insti-
tution of a vigorous examination of the South Polar regions, the series
is far from being exhausted: there is the question of the geoid defor-
mation, the phenomena of the tides, and the structure of the ice and
its drifting. ‘

The resolution of the Sixth International Geographical Congress that
the present century should not be allowed to expire without unveiling
the mysteries of the South Polar regions ought to be carried into effect.
All scientific institutions and societies trust that such will take place
without any further delay.

SIR CLEMENTS MARKHAM ON ANTARCTIC GEOGRAPHY.

I need scarcely say how fully I concur in every word that has fallen
from Dr. Murray on the subject of the scientific results, and more espe-
cially of the geographical results of an Antarctic expedition.

It is sufficient to point out the vast extent of the unknown area, and
that no area of like extent on the surface of the earth ever failed to
yield results of practical as well as of purely scientific interest by its
exploration. a

But there is much more to be said in the present instance, because
the little that we do know of the Antarctic regions points unerringly
to the very great importance and interest of the results that are certain
to attend further research.

The ice barrier, discovered by Sir James Ross, is known to be the
source of the immense ice islands of the southern polar sea. But it —
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 429

has only been seen for a distance of 300 miles. It requires far more
complete examination before any approach to an adequate knowledge
can be obtained respecting the extent and nature of the supposed ice
cap in its rear.

We know that the southern continent is a region of actual volcanic
activity; but the extent, nature, and effect of that activity remain to
be ascertained.

On the Antarctic Circle land has been reported at numerous points,
south of Australia and the Indian Ocean, but it is unknown whether
what has been seen indicates islets and rocks, or a continuous coast
line.

Dr. Murray has pointed out that the whole southern continent is cer-
tainly not bounded by such an ice wall as was seen by Sir James: Ross,
and is not covered by an ice cap. But the extent alike of the ice cap
and of the uncovered land is unknown.

We are ignorant of the distribution of land and sea, and of ice and
water in summer, and of the causes which influence such distribution.

These are some of the geographical problems to be solved. The
investigation of each one of them will lead to further discoveries as
yet undreamt of, which must needs be of the deepest interest to
geographers.

There are eminent men présent who will no doubt refer to the resuits
of Antarctic exploration as regards other branches of science. Com-
bined together they make the discovery of the unknown parts of the
Antarctic region the greatest and most important work that remains
for this generation of explorers to achieve.

METEOROLOGY AND ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION.

Dr. Alexander Buchan stated that the remarks he was about to make
would have exclusive reference to the first two paragraphs of Dr. Mur-
ray’s address, under the heading of “The Atmosphere;” or, rather,
more immediately to the relation between mean atmospheric pressure
and prevailing winds. He supposed he had been asked to speak on
this occasion, from the extensive and minute knowledge of the subject
he had necessarily acquired in the preparation of the reports on atmos-
pheric and oceanic circulation which were published as two of the
reports of the scientific results of the voyage of H. M.S. Challenger.

The former of these reports, on atmospheric circulation, is accompa-
nied by twenty-six maps, showing by isobars for each month and the
year the mean pressure of the atmosphere, and by arrows the prevail-
ing winds of the globe, on hypsobathymetric maps, or maps showing
by shadings the height of the land and the depth of the sea; first on
Gall’s projection, and second on north circumpolar maps on equal sur-
face projection. Theisobars are drawn from mean pressures calculated
_ for 1,366 places, and the winds from even a larger number of places,
distributed as well as possible over the whole globe. It is also of
430 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

importance to note that averages of pressure and prevailing winds are
published with the report—an accompaniment to the maps of mean
atmospheric pressure and prevailing winds of the globe not yet given
in any other series of maps of mean pressure and prevailing winds.

This, then, is the work undertaken and published in these reports,
which occupied seven years in preparing, as time could be spared from
official duties. The result of the charting of the pressure and prevail-
ing winds is this: Stand with your back to the wind, then the center of
lowest pressure that causes the wind will be to the left in the Northern
Hemisphere and to the right hand in the Southern Hemisphere, a
relation well known as Buys Ballot’s law. In charting the 1,366 pres-
sures and the relative prevailing winds, no exception was found in any
of the two hemispheres. This is one of the broadest generalizations
science can point to.

Some years ago a theory of atmospheric circulation was published by
the late Professor Ferrel, which, as it is not accordant with the broad
- results arrived at in the report of atmospheric circulation in the Chal-
lenger reports, calls for serious consideration on account of its bearing
on any attempt proposed to be undertaken for the exploration of the
Antarctic regions.

One of the more recent expositors of this theory is Professor Davis,
of Harvard College, who, in his Elementary Meteorology, gives an
admirable exposition of the results now arrived at by the various
workers in meteorology, and of the opinions and theories promulgated
by different meteorologists in different departments of the science.
The book is largely used in secondary schools and colleges of the
United States, and these views are all but universally held there, and
are now spreading over other countries.

The following extract from Davis’s book fairly represents these views
as generally entertained: :

“The surface winds of the temperate latitudes and the high-level
currents above them, sliding swiftly along on their steep poleward
gradients, must all be considered together. They combine to form a
vast aerial vortex or eddy around the pole. In the Northern Hemis-
phere this great eddy is much interrupted by continental high pressure
in winter or low pressure in summer, and by obstruction from mountain
ranges, as well as by irregular disturbances of the general circulation
in the form of storms” (p. 110).

Now the facts of observation do not support the theory of the exist-
ence, at any season of the year, of a low barometric pressure, or an
eddy of winds, round or in the neighboring regions of the North Pole.
Observations do not show us any prevailing winds blowing homeward
to the North Pole at any time of the year. Further, no low barometric
pressure occupies the immediate polar region in any month; but,
instead, the opposite holds good for the four months from April to
July. In April and May the mean atmospheric pressure is higher in
the region of the pole than it is anywhere in the northern hemisphere
SCIENTILIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 431

north of latitude 43° N.; and in June and July, also higher than it is
anywhere north of latitude 55° N. Now the higher pressure in these
four months necessitates the existence of upper currents in order to
maintain this high pressure about the North Pole. These upper cur-
rents toward the pole are exactly opposed to the requirements of the
theory which intimates that the upper currents in the region of the pole
must necessarily biow, not toward but from, the pole.

The actual center in this hemisphere, north of the tropics, toward
which the winds on or near the surface of the earth blow, is not the
North Pole; but, in the winter months the low barometric depressions
in the north of the Atlantic and Pacific, respectively, and in the summer
months the low barometric depressions in the Eurasian and North Ameri-
can continents; and the sources out of which the prevailing winds blow,
in the winter months, the high pressure regions in Siberia and North
America; and in the summer months the high pressure regions lying
northward of these continents, which, as already explained, are virtu-
ally the polar region itself. These are the facts in all regions where
the winds, according to the theory, become winds blowing over the
earth’s surface.

As regards the southern hemisphere, Professor Davis states that—

‘‘In the southern hemisphere the circumpolar eddy is much more
symmetrically developed.” Again, “the high pressure that should
result from the low polar temperatures is therefore reversed into low
pressure by the excessive equatorward centrifugal force of the great
circumpolar whirl; and the air thus held away from the polar regions
is seen in the tropical belts of high pressure” (pp. 110, 111.)

The interpretation of this is that the remarkable low-pressure region
of the southern hemisphere is continued southward to the South Pole
itself, the pressure diminishing all the way; and that in the region of
the South Pole the air currents poured thitherwards along the surface
of the earth ascend, and thence proceed northward as upper currents
of such enormous intensity and volume that they pile up in the tropi-
eal region of the southern hemisphere a mean sea-level atmospheric
pressure about an inch and a half more than the sea-level pressure near
the South Pole whence it starts. Now, to bring the matter to the busi-
ness which this meeting of the Royal Society has taken in hand—if
this theory be true and supported by the facts of observation, it is
plain that no meteorologist could signify his approval of any scheme
that could be proposed for exploring the Antarctic regions, it being
obvious that these strong west-northwesterly winds, if they blow vorti-
cally round and in upon the pole, heavily laden as they necessarily
would be with the aqueous vapor they have licked up from the Southern
Ocean, would overspread Antarctica with a climate of all but continu-
ous rain, sleet, and snow, which no explorer, however intrepid and
enthusiastic, could possibly face.

But is this the state of things? Let it be at once conceded that, as
far south as about latitude 55° S., the prevailing winds and the steadily
432 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

diminishing mean pressures on advancing southward fairly well sup-
port the theory. South of this, however, southerly and southeasterly
winds begin to increase in frequency until, from latitude 60° S. into
higher latitudes, they become the prevailing winds. This is abundantly
shown from the winds charted on the maps of the Challenger report, as
well as from the unanimous experience of all those who have navigated
this region from Ross to the present time. Thus the poleward-blowing
winds from west-northwest in these summer months stop short at least
30 degrees of latitude from the South Pole.

These prevailing south-southeast winds necessarily imply, as has
been shown in the case of the North Pole, the existence of a more or
less pronounced anticyclone overspreading Antarctica; which in its
turn necessarily implies the existence of upper currents from the north-
ward, blowing toward and in upon the polar region to make good the
drain caused by the surface out-blowing southeasterly winds. It may
therefore be concluded that both the surface winds and the upper aerial
currents are diametrically opposed to the requirements of this theory.

What is now urgently called for is a well-equipped Antarctic expe-
dition to make observations which will enable meteorologists to settle
definitely the distribution of atmospheric pressure and the prevailing
winds of this great region. Were this done the position in the Southern
Ocean of the great ring of lowest pressure that encircles the globe
could be mapped out; and since it is toward this low-pressure ring that
the wind-driven surface currents of the ocean flow, a contribution would
thereby be made to oceanography of an importance that can not be
overestimated, particularly as regards the great question of oceanic
circulation.

SIR ARCHIBALD GEIKIE ON ANTARCTIC GEOLOGY.

Hardly anything is yet known of the geology of the Antarctic regions.
By far the most important contributions to our knowledge of the sub-
ject were made by the expedition under Sir James Ross. But as he
was unable to winter with his ships in the higher latitudes, and could
only here and there with difficulty effect a landing on the coast, most
of the geological information brought home by him was gathered at a
greater or less distance from the land, with the aid of the telescope.
Within the last few years several sealing vessels have brought home
some additional scraps of intelligence, which only increase the desire
for fuller knowledge.

As regards the land, merely its edges have here and there been seen.
Whether it is one great continent or a succession of islands and archi-
pelagos may possibly never be ascertained. We know that in Victoria
Land it terminates in a magnificent mountain range with peaks from
10,000 to 15,000 feet high, but that elsewhere it is probably compara-
tively low, shedding its ice cap in one vast sheet into the sea. :

The rocks that constitute the land are still practically unknown.
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 433

The dredgings of the Challenger expedition brought up pieces of granite,
gneiss, and other continental rocks, and detritus of these materials was
observed to increase on the sea floor southward in the direction of the
Antarctic land. More recently several sealing vessels have brought
home from the islets of Graham Land, to the south of the South Shet-
lands, pieces of different varities of granite, together with some volcanic
rocks and fossiliferous limestones. So far as these rocks have been
studied they do not appear to differ from similar rocks all over the
globe. The granites have been found by Mr. Teall to be just such
masses as might have come from any old mountain group in Europe or
America.

Among the specimens sent to me by Captain Robertson, of the Active,
from Joinville and Dundee islands, which form the northeastern termi-
nation of Graham Land, there was one piece of reddish jasper which
at once attracted my attention from its resemblance to the “ radiolarian
cherts” now found to be so widely distributed among the older Paleozoic
rocks, both in the Old World and in the New. On closer examination,
this first impression was confirmed, and a subsequent microscopic study
of thin slices of the stone by Dr. Hinde proved the undoubted pres-
ence of abundant radiolaria. The specimen was a loose pebble picked
up on the beach of Joinville Island. We have no means of telling
where it came from or what is its geological age. But its close resem-
blance to the radiolarian cherts so persistent in the Lower Silurian
formations of the United Kingdom raises the question whether there
are not present in the Antarctic regions rocks of older Paleozoic age.

It would be of the utmost interest to discover such rocks in situ, and
to ascertain how far their fossils agree with those found in deposits of
similar antiquity in lower latitudes, or whether, as far back as early
Paleozoic time, any difference in climate had begun to show itself
between the polar and other regions of the earth’s surface.

Among the specimens brought home by Dr. Donald and Captain
Larsen from Seymour Island, in the same region, are a few containing
some half dozen species of fossil shells which have been named and
described by Messrs. Sharmon and Newton, who suggest that they
point to the existence of Lower Tertiary rocks, one of the organisms
resembling a form found in the old Tertiary formations of Patagonia.
Large well-developed shells of Cucullea and Cytherea undoubtedly
indicate the former existence of a far milder climate in these Antarctic
seas than now prevails.

If a chance landing for a few hours on a bare islet could give us these
interesting glimpses into the geological past of the South Polar regions,
what would not be gained by a more leisurely and well-planned expe-
dition? ;

But perhaps the geological domain that would be most sure to gain
largely from such exploration would be that which embraces the wide
and fascinating field of voleanic action. In the splendid harvest of

SM 97 23

434 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

results brought home by Sir James Ross one of the most thrilling
features was the discovery of a snowy volcanic cone rising amid the
universal snows of Victoria Land to a height of more than 12,000 feet,
and actively discharging “flame and smoke,” while other lofty cones
near it indicated that they too had once been in vigorous eruption.
toss landed on one or two islands near that coast, and brought away
some pieces of volcanic rocks.

If we glance at a terrestrial globe, we can readily see that the volcanic
ring or “cirele of fire,” which nearly surrounds the vast basin of the
Pacific Ocean, is prolonged southward into New Zealand. The few
observations that have been made in the scattered islands farther south
show that the Auckland, Campbell, and Macquarrie groups consist of,
or at least include, materials of volcanic origin. Still farther south,
along the same general line, Mr. Borchgrevink has recently (1894-95)
made known the extension of Ross’s voleanic platform northward to
Cape Adare, the northern promontory of Victoria Land. He noticed
there the apparent intercalation of lava and ice, while bare snowless
peaks seemed still further to point to the continued activity of the vol-
canic fires. Some specimens brought by his expedition from Possession
Island were found by Mr. Teall to be highly vesicular hornblende
basalt, while one from Cape Adare was a nepheline tephrite. This
region is probably one of the most interesting volcanic tracts on the
face of the globe. Yet we can hardly be said to know more of it than
its mere existence. The deeply interesting problems which it suggests
can not be worked out by transitory voyagers. They must be attacked
by observers stationed on the spot. Ross thought that a winter station
might be established near the foot of Mount Erebus, and that the
interior could easily be traversed from there to the magnetic pole.

Sut it is not merely in Victoria Land that Antarctic volcanoes may
be studied. Looking again at the globe, we observe that the American
voleanic band is prolonged in a north and south line down the western
side of the southern continent. That it has been continued into the
chain of the South Shetlands and Graham Land is proved by the
occurrence there of old sheets of basalt, rising in terraces over each
other, sometimes to a height of more than 7,000 feet above the sea.
These denuded lavas may be as old as those of our western isles—
Faroe, Iceland, and Greenland. But that voleanic activity is not
extinct there has recently been found by Captain Larsen, who came
upon a group of small volcanoes forming islets along the eastern coast
line of Graham Land. It is tantalizing to know no more about them.

Another geological field where much fresh and important information
might be obtained by Antarctic exploration is that of ice and ice action.
Our northern hemisphere was once enveloped in snow and ice, and
though for more than half a century geologists have been studying the
traces of the operations of this ice covering, they are still far from
having cleared up all the difficulties of the study. The Antarctic ice
SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION. 435

cap is the largest in the world. Its behavior could probably be watched
along many parts of its margin, and this research would doubtless
afford great help in the interpretation of the glaciation of the northern
hemisphere.

To sum up: Geologists would hail the organization and dispatch of
an Antarctic expedition in the confident assurance that it could not
fail greatly to advance the interests of their science. Among the ques-
tions which it would help to elucidate mention may be made of the
following:

The nature of the rocks forming the land of the Antarctic region,
and how far these rocks contain evidence bearing on the history of
terrestrial climates.

The extent to which the known fossiliferous formations of our globe
can be traced toward the poles; the gaps which may occur between
these formations and the light which their study may be able to throw
on the evolution of terrestrial topography.

The history of volcanic action in the past, and the conditions under
which it is continued now in the polar regions; whether in high lati-
tudes vulcanism, either in its internal magmas or superficial eruptions,
manifests peculiarities not observable nearer to the equator; what is
the nature of the volcanic products now ejected at the surface; whether
a definte sequence can be established from the eruptions of still active
volcanoes back into those of earlier geological periods in Antarctic
Jands; and whether among the older sheets leaf beds or other intercal-
ations may be traceable, indicating the prolongation of a well-developed
terrestrial flora toward the South Pole.

The influence of the Antarctic climate upon the rocks exposed to its
action; the effects of contact with ice and snow upon streams of lava;
the result of the seaward creep of the ice cap in regard to any lava
sheets intercalated in the ice. It is conceivable that portions of lava
Streams might be broken off by the onward motion of the ice which they
overspread, and might thus be carried out to sea, intercalated in or cap-
ping icebergs.

ANTARCTIC FAUNA.

Although an ardent advocate of Antarctic exploration, Mr. Seclater
acknowledged that, as regards the higher vertebrates, with which he
was most conversant, there was little chance of the discovery of new forms
of animal lifein the South Polarcontinent. The Antarctic mammalsand
birds (of the latter of which about twenty species were known) were
exclusively of marine forms. Nota single land mammal or land bird
had been yet obtained in Antarctica. As regards the class of fishes and
the marine invertebrates, the case was quite different, and great dis-
coveries might be anticipated in these groups, where very little had yet
436 SCIENTIFIC ADVANTAGES OF AN ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.

been done. The most promising zoological subject of Antarctic explo-
ration seemed to him, however, to be the further investigation of the
extinet fauna. The few fossil remains already obtained indicated the
former existence in the South Polar area of a very different climate
from that which now prevailed there, and further researches on this
point might lead to most important results.

Prof. D’Arey W. Thompson said that all we knew of the deep-sea life
of the Antarctic came from eight hauls of the dredge, which hauls were,
by common consent of the naturalists of the Challenger, the most pro-
ductive of the whole cruise. The fauna of every ocean urgently
demanded further exploration, for we knew now no more about the fauna
of the deep sea than was known a hundred years ago of the fauna of the
shore. But the circumpolar fauna of the south, at the meeting of all
the great oceans, presented problems of peculiar importance. He con-
sidered Dr. Murray’s theory of a ‘‘bipoiar fauna,” closely akin both in
the Arctic and Antarctic, as not proven; but he believed that there were
many remarkable cases of continuous distribution, especially along the
cold waters of the western American coast from the Antarctic into the
North Pacific, and even to Japan. If the “bipolar hypothesis” were
broken down, Antarctic exploration would lead to new generalizations,
not less interesting, to take its place.

Admiral Sir William Wharton said that an Antarctic expedition must
be under naval discipline. He hoped that such an expedition would
not be far off, and he felt sure there would be a rush of officers and men
to join it.

Sir John Evans, in briefly samming up the discussion, said it had
maintained a high level, and that the meeting had been prolonged to
an unprecedented hour in the Royal Society. All were agreed as to
the immense advantages of an expedition, and he was sure it would
find a warm advocate in the hydrographer to the Admiralty.
RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY!

By MICHAEL FOSTER,
Secretary of the Royal Society.

We who have come from the little island on the other side of the
great waters to take part in this important gathering of the British
Association have of late been much exercised in retrospection. We
have been looking back on the sixty years’ reign of our beloved Sover-
eign and dwelling on what has happened during her gracious rule.
We have, perhaps, done little in calling to mind the wrongs, the
mistakes, and the failures of the Victorian era, but our minds and our
mouths have been full of its achievements and its progress; and each
of us, of himself or through another, has been busy in bringing back
to the present the events of more than half a century of the past. It
was while J, with others, was in this retrospective mood that the duty
of preparing some few words to say to you to-day seemed suddenly to
change from an impalpable cloud in the far distance to a heavy burden
pressing directly on the back, and in choosing something to say I have
succumbed to the dominant influence. Before putting pen to paper,
however, I recovered sufficiently to resist the temptation to add one
more to the many reviews which have appeared of the progress of
physiology during the Victorian era. I also rejected the idea of doing
that for which I find precedents in past presidential addresses, namely,
of attempting to tell what has been the history of the science to which
a section is devoted during the brief interval which has elapsed since
the section last met; to try and catch physiology, or any other science,
as it rushes through the brief period of some twelve months seemed to
me not unlike photographing the flying bullet without adequate appara-
tus; the result could only be either a blurred or a delusive image.
But I bethought me that this is not the first—we hope it will not be the
last—time that the British Association has met in the Western Hemi-
sphere; and though the events of the thirteen years which have slipped
by since the meeting at Montreal in 1884 might seem to furnish a very

slender oat on which to pipe a presidential address, I have hoped that
I might be led to sound upon it some few notes which might be
listened to.

And, indeed—though perhaps when we come to look into it closely
almost every period would seem to have a value of its own—the past
thirteen years do, in a certain sense, mark a break between the physi-
ology of the past and that of the future. When the association met at
Montreal in 1884, Darwin, whose pregnant ideas have swayed physi-
ology in the limited sense of that word, as well as that broader study
of living beings which we sometimes call biology, as indeed they have
every branch of natural knowledge, had been taken from us only some
two years before, and there were still alive most of the men who did
the great works of physiology of the middle and latter half of this cen-
tury. The gifted Claude Bernard had passed away some years before,
but his peers might have been present at Montreal. Bowman, whose
classic works on muscle and kidney stand out as peaks in the physio-
logical landscape of the past, models of researches finished and com-
plete so far as the opportunities of the time would allow, fruitful
beginnings and admirable guides for the labors of others. Brown-
Sequard, who shares with Bernard the glory of having opened up the
great modern path of the influence of the nervous system on vascular,
and thus on nutritional, events, and who, if he made some mistakes,
did many things which will last for alltime. Briicke, whose clear judg-
ment, as shown in his digestive and other work, gave permanent value
to whatever he put forth. Du Bois Reymond, who, if he labored in a
narrow path, set a brilliant example of the way in which exact physical
analysis may be applied to the phenomena of living beings, and in other
ways had a powerful influence on the progress of physiology. Donders,
whose mind seemed to have caught something of the better qualities of
the physiological organ to which his professional life was devoted, and
our knowledge of which he so largely extended, so sharply did he focus
his mental eye on every physiological problem to which he turned—and
these were many and varied. Helmholtz, whose great works on vision
and hearing, to say nothing of his earlier distinctly physiological
researches, make us feel that if physies gained much, physiology lost
even more when the physiologist turned aside to more distinctly
physical inquiries. Lastly, and not least, Ludwig, who by his own
hands or through his pupils did so much to make physiology the exact
science which it is to-day, but which it was not when he began his
work. I say lastly, but I might add the name of one who, though
barred by circumstances from contributing much directly to physiology
by way of research, so used his powerful influence in many ways in aid
of physiological interests as to have helped the science onward to no
mean extent, at least among English-speaking people—I mean Huxley.
All these might have met at Montreal. They have all left us now.
Among the peers of the men I have mentioned whose chief labors were
RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY. A39

carried on in the forties, the fifties, and the sixties of the century, one
prominent inquirer alone seems to be left, Albert von Kolliker, who in
his old age is doing work of which even he in his youth might have
been proud. The thirteen years which have swept the others away seem
tomark a gulf between the physiological world of to-day and that of the
time in which most of their work was done.

They are gone, but they have left behind their work and their names.
May they of the future, as I believe we of the present are doing, take
up their work and their example, doing work other than theirs but
after their pattern, following in their steps.

In the thirteen years during which these have passed away physiology
has not been idle. Indeed, the more we look into the period the more
it seems to contain.

The study of physiology, as of other sciences, though it may be stim-
ulated by difficulties (and physiology has the stimulus of a special form
of opposition unknown to other sciences), expands under the sunshine
of opportunity and aid. And it may be worth while to compare the
opportunities for study of physiology in 1884 with those in 1897. At
this meeting of the British Association I may fitly confine myself, | was
going to say, to British matters; but I feel at this point, as. others
have felt, the want of a suitable nomenclature. We who are gathered
here to-day have, with the exception of a few honored guests from the
Kastern Hemisphere, one common bond, one common token of unity,
and, so far as I know, one only; I am speaking now ofoutward tokens;
down deeper in our nature there are, I trust, yet others. We all speak
the English tongue. Some of us belong to what is called Great Britain
and Ireland, others to that which is sometimes spoken of as Greater
Britain. But there are others here who belong to neither; though
English in tongue, they are in no sense British. To myself, to whom
the being English in speech is a fact of far deeper moment than any
political boundary, and who wish at the present moment to deal with
the study of physiology among all those who speak the English tongue,
there comes the great want of some word which will denote all such.
I hope, indeed I think, that others feel the same want too. The term
Anglo-Saxon is at once pedantic and incorrect, and yet there is none
other; and, in the absence of such a better term, I shall be forgiven if
I venture at times to use the seemingly narrow word English as really
meaning something much broader than British in its very broadest
sense.

Using English in this sense, I may, I think, venture to say that the
thirteen years which separate 1884 from to-day have witnessed among
English people a development of opportunities for physiological study
such as no other like period has seen. It is not without significance
that only a year or two previous to this period, in. Hngland proper, in
little England, neither of the ancient universities of Oxford and Cam-
bridge, which, historically at least, represent the fullest academical
440 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

aspirations of the nation, possessed a chair of physiology. The present
professors, who are the first, were both appointed in 1883. Up to that
time the science of physiology had not been deemed worthy, by either
university, of a distinctive professorial mechanism. ‘The act of these
ancient institutions was only a manifestation of modern impulses,
shared also by the metropolis and by the provinces at large. Whereas
up to that time the posts for teaching physiology, by whatever name
they were called, had been in most cases held by men whose intellectual
joins were girded for other purposes than physiology, and who used the
posts as stepping stones for what they considered better things, since
that time, as each post became vacant, it has almost invariably been
filled by men wishing and purposing at least to devote their whole
energies to the science. Scotland, in many respects the forerunner of
England in intellectual matters, had not so much need of change; but
she, too, has moved in the same direction, as las also the sister island.

And if we turn to this Western Continent we find in Canada and in
the States the same notable enlargement of physiological opportunity,
or even a still more notable one. If the English-speaking physiologist
dots on the nap each place on this Western Hemisphere which is an
academic focus of lis science, he may well be proud of the opportuni-
ties now afforded for the development of English physiology; and the
greater part of this has come within the last thirteen years.

Professorial chairs or their analogues are, however, after all but a
small part of the provision for the development of physiological science.
The heart of physiology is the laboratory. It is this which sends the
life blood through the frame, and in respect to this, perhaps, more than
to anything else, has the progress of the past thirteen years been strik-
ing. Doubtless on both sides of the waters there were physiological
laboratories, and good ones, in 1884; but how much have even these
during that period been enlarged and improved, and how many new
ones have been added? In how many places, even right up to about
1884, the professor or lecturer was fain to be content with mere lecture
experiments and a simple course of histology, with perhaps a few chem-
ical exercises for his students. Now each teacher, however modest his
post, feels and says that the authorities under whom he works are
bound to provide him with the means of leading his students along the
only path by which the science can be truly entered upon—that by which
each learner repeats for himself the fundamental observations on which
the science is based.

But there is a still larger outcome from the professorial chair and the
physiological laboratory than the training of the student. These are
opportunities not for teaching only, but also for research. And per-
haps in no respect has the development during the past thirteen years
been so marked as in this. Never so clearly as during this period has
it become recognized that each post for teaching is no less a post for
learning, that among academic duties the making knowledge is as
RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY. pe AAS

urgent as the distributing it, and that among professorial qualifications
the gift of garnering in iew truths is at least as needful as facility in
the didactic exposition of old ones. Thirteen years has seen a great
change in this matter, and the progress has been perhaps greater on
this side of the water than on the other, so far as English-speaking
people are concerned. We on the other side have witnessed with envy
the establishment on this side of a university, physiology having in it
an honored place, the keynote of which is the development of criginal-
research. It will, I venture to think, be considered a strong confirma-
tion of my present theme that the Clark University at Worcester was
founded only ten years ago.

And here, as an English-speaking person, may I be allowed to point
out, not without pride, that these thirteen years of increased oppor-
tunity have been thirteen years of increased fruitfulness? In the his-
tory: of our science, among the names of the great men who have made
epochs, English names, from Harvey onward, occupy no mean place;
but the greatnéss of such great men is of no national birth; it comes
as it lists, and is independent of time and of place. If we turn to the
more everyday workers, whose continued labors more slowly build up
the growing edifice and provide the needful nourishment for the great-
ness of which I have just spoken, we may, I will dare to say, affirm
that the last thirteen years have brought contributions to physiology,
made known in the English tongue, which, whether we regard their
quantity or their quality, significantly outdo the like contributions
made in any foregoing period of the same length. Those contribu-
tions have been equally as numerous, equally as good, on this side as
on the other side of the waters. And here I trust I shall be pardoned
if personal ties and affection lead me to throw in a personal word.
May I not say that much which has been done on this side has been
directly or indirectly the outcome of the energy and gifts of one whom
I may fitly name on an oceasion such as this, since, though he belonged
to the other side, his physiological life was passed and his work was .
done on this side, one who has been taken from us since this associ-
ation last met—Henry Newell Martin?

Yes; during these thirteen years, if we put aside the loss of com-
rades, physiology has been prosperous with us and the outlook is
bright; but, as every cloud has its silver lining, so shadow follows all
sunshine, success brings danger, and something bitter rises up amid
the sweet of prosperity. The development of which I have spoken is
an outcome of the progressive activity of the age, and the dominant
note of that activity is heard in the word “commercial.” Noblemen
and noblewomen open shop, aud everyone, low as well as high, presses
forward toward large or quick profits. The very influences which
have made devotion to scientific inquiry a possible means of livelihood,
and so fostered scientific investigation, are creating a new danger.
The path of the professor was in old times narrow and straight, and
442 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

only the few who had a real call cared to tread it. Nowadays there is
some fear lest it become so broad and so easy as to tempt those who
are in no way fitted for it. There is an increasing risk or men under-
taking a research, not because a question is erying out to them to be
answered, but in the hope that the publication of their results may
win for them a lucrative post. There is, moreover, an even greater
evil ahead. The man who lights on a new scientific method holds the
key of a chamber in which much gold may be stored up, and strong
is the temptation for him to keep the new knowledge to himself until
he has filled his fill, while all the time his brother inquirers are wan-
dering about in the dark through lack of that which he possesses.
Such a selfish withholding of new scientific truth is beginning to be
not rare in some branches of knowledge. May it never come near us!

Now I will, with your permission, cease to sound the provincial note,
and ask your attention for a few minutes while I attempt to dwell on
what seem to me to be some of the salient features of the fruits of
physiological activity, not among English-speaking people only, but
among all folk, during the past thirteen years.

When we review the records of research and discovery over any
lengthened period we find that in every branch of the study progress
is irregular; that it ebbs and flows. At one time a particular problem
occupies much attention; the periodicals are full of memoirs about it,
aud many of the young bloods flesh their maiden swords uponit. Then
again, for a while it seems to lie dormant and unheeded. But quite
irrespective of this feature, which seems to belong to all lines of
inquiry, we may recognize two kinds of progress. On the one hand,
in such a period, in spite of the waves just mentioned, a steady
advance continually goes on in researches which were begun and
pushed forward in former periods, some of them being of very old
date. On the other hand, new lines of investigation, starting with
quite new ideas or rendered possible by the introduction of new
methods, are or may be begun. Such naturally attract great attention
and give a special character to the period.

In the past thirteen years we may recognize both these kinds of
progress. Of the former kind I might take, as an example, the time-
honored problems of the mechanics of the circulation. In spite of the
labor which has been spent on these in times of old, something always
remains to be done, and the last thirteen years have not been idle.
The researches of Hiirthle and Tigerstedt, of Roy and Adami, not to
mention others, have left us wiser than we were before. So, again,
with the also old problems of muscular contraction, progress, if not
exciting, has been real; we are some steps measurably nearer an
understanding what is the exact nature of the fundamental changes
which bring about contraction and what are the relations of those
changes to the structure of muscular fiber. In respect to another old
problem, too, the beat of the heart, we have continued to creep nearer
RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 443

and nearer to the full light. Problems again, the method of attacking
which is of more recent origin, such as the nature of secretion and the
allied problem of the nature of transudation, have engaged attention
and brought about that stirring of the waters of controversy which,
whatever be its effects in other departments of life, is never in science
wholly a waste of time, if indeed it be a waste of time at all, since in
matters of science the tribunal to which the combatants of both sides
appeal is always sure to give a true judgment in the end. In the con-
troversy thus arisen the last word has perhaps not yet been said, but
whether we tend at present to side with Heidenhain, who has continued
into the past thirteen years the brilliant labors which were perhaps the
distinguishing features of physiological progress in preceding periods,
and who in his present sufferings carries with him, I am sure, the sym-
pathies if not the hopes of all his brethren, or whether we are more
inclined to join those who hold different views, we may all agree in
saying that we have, in 1897, distinctly clearer ideas of why secretion
gathers in an alveolus or lymph in a lymph space than we had in 1884.

I might multiply such examples of progress on more or less old lines
until I wearied you, but I will try not to do so. I wish rather to dwell
for a few minutes on some of what seem to be the salient new features
of the period under review.

One such feature is, [ venture to think, the development of what
may perhaps be called the new physiological chemistry. We always
are, and for a long time always have been, learning something new
about the chemical phenomena of living beings. During the years
preceding those immediately recent, great progress, for which we have
especially, perhaps, to thank Kiilhne, was made in our knowledge of
the bodies which we speak of as proteids and their allies. But while
admitting to the full the high value of all these researches and the
great light which they threw on many of the obscurer problems of the
chemical changes of the body, such, for instance, as the digestive
changes and the clotting of blood, it could not but be felt that their
range was restricted and their value limited. Granting the extreme
usefulness of being able to distinguish bodies through their solution or
precipitation by means of this or that salt or acid, this did not seem to
promise to throw much light on the all-important problem as to what
was the connection between the chemical constitution of such bodies
and their work in the economy of a living being. For it need not be
argued that this is an all-important problem. To-day, as yesterday
and as in the days before, the mention of the word vitalism or its
equivalent separates aS a war cry physiologists into two camps, one
contending that all the phenomena of life can, and the other that they
can not, be explained as the result of the action of chemico-physical
forces. For myself, | have always felt that while such a controversy,
like other controversies, as I ventured to say just now, is useful as a
stirring of the waters, through which much oxygen is brought home to
444 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

many things and no little purification effected, the time for the final
judgment on the question will not come until we shall more clearly
understand than we do at present what we mean by physical and
chemical, and may perhaps be put off until somewhere near the end of
all things, when we shall know as fully as we ever shall what the forces
to which we give these names can do and what they can not. Mean-
while the great thing is to push forward, so far as may be, the chemical

analysis of the phenomena presented by living beings. Hitherto the
physiological chemists, or the chemical physiologists, as perhaps they
ought rather to be called, have perhaps gone too much their own gait
and have seemed to be constructing too much a kind of chemistry of
their own. But that, may i say, has in part been so because they did
not receive from their distinctly chemical brethren the help of which
they were in need. May I go so far as to say that to us physiologists
these our brethren seemed to be lagging somewhat behind, at least along
those lines of their science which directly told on our inquiries? That
is, however, no longer the case. They are producing work and giving |
us ideas which we can carry straight into physiological problems. The
remarkable work of Emil Fischer on sugars, one of the bright results
of my period of thirteen years, may fully be regarded as opening up a
new era in the physiology of the carbohydrates, opening up a new era
because it has shown us the way how to investigate physiological
problems on purely and distinctively chemical lines. Not in the carbo-
hydrates only, but in all directions, our younger investigators are
treating the old problems by the new chemical methods; the old
physiological chemistry is passing away; nowhere, perhaps, is the out-
look more promising than in this direction; and we may at any time
receive the news that the stubborn old fortress of the proteids has
succumbed to the new attack.

Another marked feature of the period has been the increasing atten-
tion given to the study of the lower forms of life, using their simpler
structures and more diffuse phenomena to elucidate the more general
properties of living matter. During the greater part of the present
century physiologists lave, as a rule, chosen as subjects of their ~
observations almost exclusively the vertebrata; by far the larger part
of the results obtained during this time have been gained by inquiries
restricted to some half a dozen kinds of backboued animals; the frog
and the myograph, the dog and the kymograph have almost seemed
the alpha and the omega of the science. This has been made a reproach
by some, but, I can not help thinking, unjustly. Physiology is, in its
broad meaning, the unraveling of the potentialities of things in the ~
condition which we call living. In the higher animals the evolution by
differentiation has brought these potentialities, so to speak, near the
surface, or even laid them bare as actual properties capable of being
grasped. In the lower animals they still lie deep buried in primeval
Sameness; and we may grope among them in vain unless we have a
RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 445

clew furnished by the study of the higher animal. This truth seems to
have been early recognized during the progress of the science. In the
old time observers such as Spallanzani, with but a moderate amount
of accumulated knowledge behind them and a host of problems before
them, with but few lines of inquiry as yet definitely laid down, were
free to choose the subjects of their investigation where they pleased,
and in the wide field open to them prodded, so to speak, among all
living things, indifferent whether they possessed a backbone or not.
But it soon became obvious that the study of the special problems of
the more highly organized creature was more fruitful, or at least more
easily fruitful, than that of the general problems of the simpler forms;
and hence it came about that inquiry, as it went on, grew more and
more limited to the former. But an increasing knowledge of the laws
of life as exemplified in the differentiated phenomena of the mammal
is increasingly fitting us. for a successful attack on the more general
phenomena of the lowly creatures possessing little more than that
molecular organization, if such a phrase be permitted, which alone sup-
plies the conditions for the manifestation of vital activities. And
though it may be true that in all periods men have from time to time
labored at this theme, I think that I am not wrong in saying that the
last dozen years or so mark a distinct departure both as regards the
number of researches directed to it, and also, what is of greater moment,
as regards the definiteness and clearness of the results thereby obtained.
One has only to look at the results recorded in the valuable treatises
of Verworn and Biedermann, whether obtained by the authors them-
selves or by others, to feel great hope that in the immediately near
future a notable advance will be made in our grasp of the nature of
that varying collection of molecular conditions, potencies and changes,
slimy hitherto to the intellectual no less than to the physical touch,
which we are in the habit of denoting by the more or less magical word
protoplasm. And perhaps one happy feature of such an advance will
be one step in the way of that reintegration which men of science
fondly hope may ultimately follow the differentiation of studies now so
fierce and attended by many ills; in the problems of protoplasm the
animal physiologist touches hands with the botanist, and both find that
under different names they are striving toward the same end.

Closely allied to and indeed a part of the above line of inquiry is the
study of the physiological attributes of the cell and of their connection
with its intrinsic organization. This is a study which, during the last
dozen years, has borne no mean fruits; but it is an old study, one which
has been worked at from time to time, reviving again and again as new
methods offered. new opportunities. Moreover, it will probably come
directly before us in our sectional work, and therefore I will say nothing
more of it here.

Still another striking feature of the past dozen years has been the
advance of our knowledge in regard to those events of the animal body

<
AAG RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

which we have now learned to speak of as ‘internal secretion.” This
knowledge did not begin in this period. The first note was sounded long .
ago in the middle of the century, when Claude Bernard made known
what he called “the glycogenic function of the liver.” Men, too, were
busy with the thyroid body and the suprarenal capsules long before the
meeting of the British Asseciation at Montreal. But it was since then,
namely, in 1889, that Minkowski published his discovery of the diabetic
phenomena resulting from the total removal of the pancreas. That, I
venture to think, was of mcmentous value, not only as a valuable dis-
covery in itself, but especially, perhaps, in confirming and fixing our
ideas as to internal secretion, and in encouraging further research.

Minkowski’s investigation possessed this notable feature, that it was
clear, sharp, and decided, and, moreover, the chief factor, namely, sugar,
was subject to quantitative methods. The results of removing the
thyroid body had been to a large extent general, often vague, and in
some cases uncertain; so much so as to justify, to a certain extent, the
doubts held by some as to the validity of the conclusion that the symp-
toms witnessed were really and simply due to the absence of the organ
removed. The observer who removes the pancreas has to deal with a
tangible and measurable result, the appearance of sugar in the urine.
About this there can be no mistake, no uncertainty. And the confi-
dence thus engendered in the conclusion that the pancreas, besides
secreting the pancreatic juice, effects some notable change in the blood
passing through it, spread to the analogous conclusions concerning the
thyroid and the suprarenal, and moreover suggested further experimen-
tal inquiry. By those inquiries all previous doubts have been removed ;
it is not now a question whether or no the thyroid carries on a so-called
internal secretion; the problem is reduced to finding out what it
exactly does and how exactly it does it. Moreover, no one can at the
present day suppose that this feature of internal secretion is confined
to the thyroid, the suprarenal, and the pancreas; it needs no spirit of
prophecy to foretell that the coming years will add to physiological
science a large and long chapter, the first marked distinctive verses of
which belong to the dozen years which have just passed away.

The above three lines of advance are of themselves enough to justify
acertain pride on the part of the physiologist as to the share which his
science is taking in the forward movements of the time. And yet I
venture to think that each and all of these is wholly overshadowed. by
researches of another kind, through which knowledge bas made, dur-
ing the past dozen years or so, a bound so momentous and so far-
reaching that all other results gathered in during the time seem to
shrink into relative insignificance.

It was a little before my period, in the year 1879, that Golgi published
his modest note, “Un nuovo processo di technica microscopica.”! That
was the breaking out from the rocks of a little stream which has since

‘Rendicorti del reale Istitulo Lombardo, Vol. XII, page 206,
RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 447

swollen into a great flood. It is quite true that long before a new erain
our knowledge of the central nervous system had been opened up by the
works of Ferrier and of Fritsch and Hitzig. Between 1870 and 1880
progress in this branch of physiology had been continued and rapid.
Yet that progress had left much to be desired. On the one hand the
experimental inquiries, even when they were carried out with the safe-
guard of an adequate psychical analysis of the phenomena which pre-
sented themselves, and this was not always the case, sounded a very
uncertain note, at least when they dealt with other than simply motor
effects. ‘They were, moreover, not unfrequently in discord with clinical
experience. In general the conclusions which were arrived at through
them, save such as were based on the production of easily recognized
and often measurable movements, were regarded by many as conelu-
sions of the kind which could not be ignored, which demanded respect-
ful attention, and yet which failed to carry conviction. It seems to be
risking too much to trust too implicitly to the apparent teaching of the
results arrived at; something appeared wanting to give these their full
validity, to explain their full and certain meaning by showing their
connection with what was known in other ways and by other methods.
On the other hand, during nearly all this time, in spite of the valuable
results acquired by the continually improving histological technique, by
the degeneration method, and by the developmental method, by the
study of the periods of myelination, most of us, at all events, were sit-
ting down, as our forefathers had done, before the intricate maze of
encephalic structure, fascinated by its complexity, but wondering what
it all meant. Even when we attempted to thread our way through the
relatively simple tangle of the spinal cord, to expect that we should
ever see our way so to unravel out the strands of fibers, here thick,
there thin, now twisting and turning, and anon running straight, or so
to set out in definite constellations the seeming milky way of star-like
cells, so to do this as to make the conformation of the cord explain the
performances of which it is capable, appeared to be something beyond
our reach. And when we passed from the cord to those cerebral struc-
tures the even gross topography of which is the despair of the beginner
in anatomical studies, the multiple maze of gray and white matter
seemed to frame itself into the letters graven on the gateway of the
city of Dis, and bid us leave all hope behind.

What a change has come upon us during the past dozen years, and
how great is the hope of ultimate success which we have to-day. Into
what at the meeting at Montreal seemed a cloudy mass, in which most
things were indistinct and doubtful, and into which each man could
read images of possible mechanisms according as his fancy led, the
method of Golgi has fallen like a clarifying drop, and at the present
moment we are watching with interest and delight how that vague
cloud is beginning to clear up and develop into a sharp and definite
picture, in which lines objectively distinct and saying one thing only
448 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

reveal themselves more and more. This is not the place to enter into
details, and I will content myself with pointing out as illustrative of
my theme the progress which is being made in our knowledge of how
we hear and how sounds affect us. A dozen years ago we possessed
experimental and clinical evidence which led us to believe that auditory
impulses sweeping up the auditory nerve became developed into audi-
tory sensations through events taking place in the temporosphenoidal
convolution, and we have had some indications that as these passed
upward through the lower and middle brain the striw acustice and the
lateral fillet had some part to play. Beyond this we knew but little.
To-day we can with confidence construct a diagram which he who runs
can read, showing how the impulses undergoing a relay in the tuber-
culum acusticum and accessory nucleus pass by the striz acustice and
trapezoid fibers to the superior olive and trapezoid nucleus, and onward
by the laterai fillet’ to the posterior corpus quadrageminum and to the
cortex of the temporosphenoidal convolution. And if much, very
much, yet remains to be done even in tracking out yet more exactly the
path pursued by the impulses while they are still undeveloped impulses,
not as yet lit up with consciousness, and in understanding the fune-
tional meaning of relays and apparently alternate routes, to say noth-
ing of the deeper problems of when anid how the psychical element
intervenes, we feel that we have in our hands the clue by means of
which we may hope to trace out clearly the mechanisms by which,
whether consciousness plays its part or no, sounds affect so profoundly
and so diversely the movements of the body, and haply some time or
other to tell, in a plain and exact way, the story of how we hear. I
have thus referred to hearing because the problems connected with this
seemed, thirteen years ago, so eminently obscure; it appeared so pre-
eminently hard a task, that of tracing out a path of an auditory impulse
through the confused maze of fiber and cell presented by the lower and
middle brain. Of the mechanism of sight we seemed even then to have
better knowledge, but how much more clearly do we, so to speak, see
vision now? So, also, with all other sensations, even those most obscure
ones of touch and pain; indeed, all over the nervous system light
seems breaking in a most remarkable way.

This great and significant progress we owe, I venture to say, to Golgi—
to the method introduced by him; and I for one can not help being
glad that this important contribution to science, as well as another
contingent and most valuable one, the degeneration method of Marchi,
should be among the many tokens that Italy, the mother of all sciences
in times gone by, is now once more taking her right place in scientific
no less than in political life. We owe, I say, this progress to Golgi in
the sense that the method introduced by him was the beginning of the
new researches. We owe, moreover, to Golgi not the mere technical
introduction of the method, but something more. He himself pointed
out the theoretical significance of the results which his method pro-
RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY. 449

duced; and if in this he has been outstripped and even corrected by
others, his original merit must not be allowed to be forgotten. Those
others are many, in many lands; but two names stand out conspicuous
among them. If rejuvenescent Italy invented the method, another
ancient country, whose fame, once brilliant in the past, like that of
Italy, suffered in later times an eclipse, produced the man who, above
all others, has shown us how to useit. At the meeting at Montreal a
voice from Spain telling of things physiological would have seemed a
voice crying out of the wilderness; to-day the name of Ramon-y-Cayal
is in every physiologist’s mouth. That is one name, but there is yet
another. Years ago, when those of us who are now veterans and see
signs that it is time for us to stand aside were spelling out the primer
of histology, one name was always before us as that of a man who
touched every tissue and touched each well. It is a consoling thought
to some of us elder ones that histological research seems to be an anti-
dote to senile decay. As the companion of the young Spaniard in
the pregnant work on the histology of the central nervous system done
in the eighties and the nineties of the century must be named the
name of the man who was brilliant in the fifties, Albert von Kolliker.

When I say that the progress of our knowledge of the central nervous
system during the past thirteen years has been largely duc to the appli-
cation of the method of Golgi, I do not mean that it, alone and by itself,
has done what has been done. That is not the way of science. Almost
every thrust forward in science is a resultant of concurrent forces
working along different lines; and in most cases at least significant
progress comes when efforts from different quarters meet and join
hands. And especially as regards methods it is true that their value
and effect depend on their coming at their allotted times. As I said
above, neither experimental investigation nor clinical observation nor
histological inquiry by the then known methods had been idle before
1880. They had, moreover, borne even notable fruits, but one: thing
was lacking for their fuller fruition. The experimental and clinical
results all postulated the existence of clear, definite paths for impulses
within the central nervous system—of paths, moreover, which, while
clear and sharp, were manifold and, under certain conditions, alternate
or even vicarious, and were so constructed that the impulses as they
swept along them underwent from time to time—that is, at some place
or other—transformations or at least changes in nature. But the
methods of histological investigations available before that of Golgi,
though they taught us much, failed to furnish such an analysis of the
tangle of gray and white matter as would clearly indicate the paths
required. This the method of Golgi did, or rather is doing. Where
gold failed silver has succeeded, and is succeeding. Thanks to the
black tract which silver when handled in a certain way leaves behind
it in the animal body, as indeed it does elsewhere, we can now trace
out, within the central nervous system, the pathway afforded by the

SM 97——29

450 RECENT PROGRESS IN PHYSIOLOGY.

nerve cell and the nerve cell alone. We see its dendrites branching
out in various directions, each alert to dance the molecular dance
assigned to it at once by the more lasting conditions which we call
structural, and the more passing ones which we call functional, so soon
as some partner touch its hand. We see the body of the cell with its
dominant nucleus ready to obey and yet to marshal and command the
figure so started. Wesee the neuraxon prepared to carry that figure
along itself—it may be to far distant parts, it may be to near ones—or
to divert it along collaterals—it may be many, or it may be few—or to
spread out at once among numerous seemingly equipollent branches.
And whether it prove ultimately true or no that the figure of the danc-
ing molecules sweeps always onward along the dendrites toward the
nucleus, and always outward away from the nucleus along the neu-
raxon, or whatever way in the end be shown to be the exact differences
in nature and action between the dendrites and the neuraxon, this at
least seems sure, that cell plays upon cell only by such a kind of con-
tact as seems to afford an opportunity for change in the figure of the
dance—that is to say, in the nature of the impulse—and that in at least
the ordinary play it is the terminal of the neuraxon (either of the main
core or a collateral) of one cell which touches with a vibrating touch
the dendrite or the body of some other cell. We can thus, I say, by
the almost magic use of a silver token—I say magic use, for he who for
the first time is shown a Golgi preparation is amazed to learn that it
is such a sprawling thing as he sees before him which teaches so much, °
and yet when he comes to use it acquires daily increased confidence in
its worth—it is by the use of such a silver token that we have been
able to unravel so much of the intricate tangle of the possible paths of
nervous impulses. By themselves, the acquisition of a set of pictures
of such black lines would be of little value. But—and this I venture to
think is the important point—to a most remarkable extent, and with
noteworthy rapidity, the histological results thus arrived at, aided by
analogous results. reached by the degeneration method—especially by
the newer method akin to that of Golgi, that of Marchi—have confirmed
or at times extended and corrected the teachings of experimental
investigation and clinical observation. It is this which gives strength
to our present position; we are attacking our problems along two inde-
pendent lines. On the one hand we are tracing out anatomical paths,
and laying bare the joints of histological machinery ; on the other hand,
beginning with the phenomena, and analyzing the manifestations of
disorder, whether of our own making or no, as well as of order, we are
striving to delineate the machinery by help of its action. When the
results of the two methods coincide, we may be confident that we are
on the road of all truth; when they disagree, the very disagreement
serves as the starting point for fresh inquiries along the one line or the
other.

Fruitful as have been the labors of the past dozen years, we may

.

rightly consider them as but the earnest of that which is to come; and
those of us who are far down on the slope of life may wistfully look for-
ward to the next meeting of the association on these Western shores,
wondering what marvels wil then be told.

Physiology, even in the narrower sense to which, by emphasis on the
wavering barrier which parts the animal from the plant, it is restricted
in this section, deals with many kinds of being, and with many things in
each. But,somewhat as man, in one aspect a tiny fragment of the world,
still more of the universe, in another aspect looms so great as to over-
shadow everything else, so the nervous system, seen from one point of
view, is no more than a mere part of the whole organism, but, seen from
another point of view, seems by its importance to swallow up all the
rest. As man is apt to look upon all other things as mainly subserving
his interests and purposes, so the physiologist, but with more justice,
may regard all the rest of the body as mainly subserving the welfare of
the nervous system; and, aS man was created last, so our natural
knowledge of the working of that nervous system has been the latest
in its growth. But, if there be any truth in what I have urged to-day,
we are witnessing a growth which promises to be as rapid as it has
seemed to be delayed. Little spirit of prophecy is needed to foretell
that in the not so distant future the teacher of physiology will hurry
over the themes on which he now dwells so long, in order that he may
have time to expound the most important of all the trutns which he
has to tell, those which have to do with the manifold workings of the
brain.

And I will be here so bold as to dare to point out that this develop-
ment of his science must, in the times to come, influence the attitude of
the physiologist toward the world, and ought to influence the attitude
of the world toward him. ILimagine that if a plebiscite, limited even to
instructed—I might almost say scientific—men, were taken at the present
moment, it would be found that the most prevalent conception of phys-
iology is that it is a something which is in some way an appendage to
the art of medicine. That physiology is, and always must be, the basis
of the science of healing, is so much a truism that I would not venture
to repeat it here were it not that some of those enemies, alike to science
and humanity, who are at times cailed antivivisectionists, and whose
zeal often outruns, not only discretion, but even truth, have quite recently
asserted that I think otherwise. Should such an hallucination ever
threaten to possess me, I should only have to turn to the little we yet
know of the physiology of the nervous system and remind myself how
great a help the results of pure physiological curiosity —I repeat the
words, pure physiological curiosity, for curiosity is the mother of
science—have been, alike to the surgeon and the physician, in the
treatment of those in some way most afflicting maladies, the diseases
of the nervous system. No, physiology is, and always must be, the
basis of the science of healing; but it is something more. When phys-

iology 18 eaung with those parts of the body which we call musemar,
vascular, glandular tissues and the like, rightly handled she points out
the way not only to mend that which is hurt, to repair the damages of
bad usage and disease, but so to train the growing tissues and to guide
the grown ones as that the best use may be made of them for the pur-
poses of life. She not only heals, she governs and educates. Nor does
she do otherwise when she comes to deal with the nervous tissues.
Nay, it is the very prerogative of these nervous tissues that their life
is above that of all the other tissues, contingent on the environment,
and susceptible of education. If increasing knowledge gives us increas-
ing power so to mold a muscular fiber that it shall play to the best the
part which it has to play in life, the little knowledge we at present pos-
sess gives us at least much confidence in a coming far greater power
over the nerve cell. This is not the place to plunge into the deep waters
of the relation which the body bears to the mind; but this at least
stares us in the face, that changes in what we call the body bring about
changes in what we call the mind. When we alter the one, we alter the
other. If, as the whole past history of our science leads us to expect,
in the coming years a clearer and clearer insight into the nature and
conditions of that molecular dance which is to us the material token of
nervous action, and a fuller, exacter knowledge of the laws which govern
the sweep of nervous impulses along fiber and cell, give us wider and
directer command over the molding of the growing nervous mechanism
and the maintenance and regulation of the grown one, then assuredly
physiology will take its place as a judge of appeal in questions not only
of the body, but of the mind; it will raise its voice not in the hospital
and consulting room only, but also in the senate and the school.

One word more. We physiologists are sorely tempted toward self-
righteousness, for we enjoy that blessedness which comes when men
revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you
falsely. In the mother country our hands are tied by an act which was
defined by one of the highest legal authorities as a “penal” act; and
though with us, as with others, difficulties may have awakened activity,
our science suffers from the action of the State. And some there are
who would go still further than the State has gone, though that is far—
who would take from us even that which we have, and bid us make
bricks wholly without straw. To go back is always a hard thing, and
we in England can hardly look to any great betterment for at least
many years to come. But unless what I have ventured to put before
you to-day be a mocking phantasm, unworthy of this great association
and this great occasion, England in this respect at .east offers an
example to be shunned alike by her offspring and her fellows.
THE FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION FROM A
BOTANICAL STANDPOINT.!

THE SURVIVAL OF THE UNLIKE.

We all agree that there has been and is evolution; but we probably
all disagree as to the exact agencies and forces which have been and
are responsible for it. The subject of the agencies and vehicles of
evolution has been gone over repeatedly and carefully for the animal
creation, but there is comparatively little similar research and specula-
tion for the plant creation. This deficiency upon the plant side is my
excuse for calling your attention, in a popular way, to a few suggestions
respecting the continuing creation of the vegetable world, and to a
somewhat discursive consideration of a number of illustrations of the
methods of advance of plant types.

1. NATURE OF THE DIVERGENCE OF THE PLANT AND ANIMAL.

It is self-evident that the development of life upon our planet has
taken place along two divergent lines. These lines originated at a
common point. This common life-plasma was probably at first more
animal-like than plant-like. The stage in which this life-plasma first
began to assume plant-like functions is closely and possibly exactly
preserved to us in that great class of organisms which are known as
mycetozoa when studied by zoologists and as myxomycetes when
studied by botanists. At one stage of their existence these organisms
are amceba-like, that is, animal-like, but at another stage they are
sporiferous or plant-like. The initial divergencies in organisms were
no doubt concerned chiefly in the methods of appropriating food, the
animal-like organisms apprehending their food at a more or less
definite point, and the plant-like organisms absorbing food through-
out the greater or even the entire part of their periphery. It is not
my purpose to trace the particular steps or methods of these diver-
gencies, but to call your attention to what I believe to be a funda-
mental distinction between the two lines of development, and one

Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. XXXV, 1896.

which I do not remember to have seen stated in the exact form in
which it lies in my mind.

Both lines probably started out with a more or less well-marked cir-
cular arrangement of the parts or organs. This was consequent upon
the peripheral arrangement of the new cells in the development of the
multicellular organism from the unicellular one. <A long line of animal
life developed in obedience to this peripheral or rotate type of organi-
zation, ending in the echinoderms and some of the mollusks. 'This line
long ago reached its zenith. No line of descent can be traced from
them, according to Cope. The progressive and regnant type of animal
life appeared in the vermes or true worms, forms which are character-
ized by a two-sided or bilateral, and therefore more or less longitudinal,
structure. The animal-like organisms were strongly developed in the
power of locomotion, and it is easy to see that the rotate or centrifugal
construction would place the organism at a comparative disadvantage,
because its seat of sensation is farthest removed from the external
stimuli. But the worm-like organisms, ‘‘being longitudinal and bilat-
eral,” writes Cope, ‘one extremity becomes differentiated by first con-
tact with the environment.” In other words, the animal type has
shown a cephalic or head-forming evolution in consequence of the
bilateralism of structure. The individual has become concentrated.
Out of this worm-form type, therefore, all the higher ranges of zootypic
evolution have sprung, and one is almost tempted to read a literal
truth into David’s lamentation that “I am a worm and no man.”

If, now, we turn to plants we find the rotate or peripheral arrange-
ment of parts emphasized in all the higher ranges of forms. The most
marked bilateralism in the plant world is among the bacteria, des-
mids, and the like, in which locomotion is markedly developed; and
these are also among the lowest plant types. But plants soon became
attached to the earth, or, as Cope terms them, they are “ earth para-
sites.” They therefore found it to their advantage to reach out in
every direction from their support in the search for food. Whilst the
centrifugal arrangement has strongly tended to disappear in the animal
creation, it has tended with equal strength to persist and to augment
itself in the plant creation. Its marked development among plants
began with the acquirement of terrestrial life, and with the consequent
evolution of the asexual or sporophytic type of vegetation. Normally
the higher type of plant bears its parts more or less equally upon all
sides, and the limit to growth is still determined by the immediate
environment of the given individual or of its recent ancestors. Its
evolution has been acephalic, diffuse, or headless, and the individual
plant or tree has no proper concentration of parts. For the most part
it is filled with unspecialized plasma, which, when removed from the
parent individual (as in cuttings and grafts), is able to reproduce
another like individual. The arrangements of leaves, branches, the
parts of the flower, and even of seeds in the fruit, are thus rotate or
circular, and in the highest type of plants the annual lateral increments
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. A455

of growth are disposed in like fashion; and it is significant to observe
that in the composite, which is considered to be the latest and highest
general type of plant form, the rotate or centrifugal arrangement is
most emphatically developed. The circular arrangement of parts is the
typical one for higher plants, and any departure from this form is a
specialization, and demands explanation.

The point I wish to urge, therefore, is the nature of the obvious or
external divergence of plant-like and animal-like lines of ascent. The
significance of the bilateral structure of animal types is well understood,
but this significance has been drawn, so far as I know, from a compar-
ison of bilateral or dimeric animals with rotate or polymeric animals.
I want to put a larger meaning into it by making bilateralism the symbol
of the onward march of animal evolution and circumlateralism (if I may
invent the term) the symbol of plant evolution. The suggestion, how-
ever, applies simply to the general arrangement of the parts or organs
of the plant body, and has no relation whatever to functional attributes
or processes. It is a suggestion of analogues, not of homologues. We
may therefore contrast these two great lines of ascent, which, with so
many vicissitudes, have come up through the ages, as Dipleurogenesis
and Centrogenesis.

The two divergent directions of the lines or phyla of evolution have
often been the subject of comment, but one of the sharpest contrasts
between the two was made in 1884 by Cope, when he proposed that the
vegetable kingdom has undergone a degenerate or retrogressive evolu-
tion. ‘The plants in general,” he then wrote, ‘in the persons of their
protist ancestors, soon left a free-swimming life and became sessile.
Their lives thus became parasitic, more automatic, and, in one sense,
degenerate.” The evolution of the plant creation is, therefore, held to
be a phenomenon of catagenesis or decadence. This, of course,is merely
a method of stating a comparison with the evolution of the animal line
or phylum, and is therefore of the greatest service. For myself, how-
ever, I dislike the terms retrogressive, catagenetic, and the like, as
applied to the plant creation, because they imply intrinsic or actual
degeneracy. ‘True retrogressive or degenerate evolution is the result
of loss of attributes. Cope holds that the chief proof of degeneracy
in the plant world is the loss of a free-swimming habit, but it is possible
that the first life-plasma was stationary; at any rate, we do not know that
it was motile. Degeneracy is unequivocally seen in certain restricted
groups where the loss of characters can be traced directly to adaptive
changes, as in the loss of limbs in the serpents. Retarded evolution
expresses the development of the plant world better than the above
terms, but even this is erroneous, because plant types exhibit quite as
complete an adaptation to an enormous variety of conditions as animals
do, and there has been rapid progress toward specialization of structure.
As a matter of fact, the vegetable world does not exhibit, as a whole,
any backward step, any loss of characters once gained, nor any station-
456 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

ary or retarded periods; but its progress has been widely unlike that
of the animal world and it has not reached the heights which that line
of ascent has attained. The plant phylum can not be said to be cata-
genetic, but suigenetic. Or, in other words, it is centrogenetic as
distinguished from dipleurogenetic.

The hearer should be reminded, at this point, of the curious alterna-
tion of generations which has come about in the plant world. One
generation develops sexual functions, and the product of the sexual
union is an asexual generation, and this, in turn, gives rise to another
sexual generation like the first. In the lowest sex plants, as the
alge, the sexual generation—or the gametophyte, as it is called—gen-
erally comprises the entire plant body, and the asexual generation or
sporophyte develops as a part of the fructifying structure of the
gametophyte, and is recognizable as a separate structure only by
students of special training. In the fungi, which are probably of cat-
agenetic evolution, alternation of generations is very imperfect or
wanting. In the true mosses the gametophyte is still the conspicuous
part of the plant structure. It comprises all that part of the moss which
the casual observer recognizes as “the plant.” The sporophytic gener-
ation is still attached to the persistent gametophyte, and it is the
capsule with its stem and appendages. In the ferns, however, the
gametophytic stage is of short duration. It is the inconspicuous
prothallus, which follows the germination of the spore. Therefrom
originates ‘‘the fern,” all of which is sporophytic, and the gametophyte
perishes. With the evolution of the flowering plants the gametophyte
' becomes still more rudimentary, while the sporophyte is the plant,
tree, or bush as we see it. The gametophytic generation is associated
with the act of fertilization, the male prothallus or gametophyte devel-
oping from the pollen grain and soon perishing, and the female pro-
thallus or gametophyte developing in the ovule and either soon
perishing or persisting in the form of the albumen of the seed. The
great development of the sporophyte in later time is no doubt a conse-
quence of the necessity of assuming a terrestrial life; and with this
development has come the perfection of the centrogenic form.

2, THE ORIGIN OF DIFFERENCES.

The causes which have contributed to the origin of the differences
which we see in the organic creation have been and still are the sub-
jects of the most violent controversy. Those persons who conceive
these differences to have come into existence full formed, as they exist
at the present time, are those who believe in the dogma of special crea-
tions, and they usually add to the doctrine a belief in design in nature.
This doctrine of special creation receives its strongest support when
persons contrast individual objects in nature. Certainly nothing can
seem more unlike in very fundamental character than an insect and:an
elephant, a starfish and a potato, a man and an oak tree. The
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. ABT

moment one comes to study the genealogies of these subjects or
groups, however, he comes upon the astonishing fact that the ancestors
- are more and more alike the farther back they are traced. In other
words, there are great series of convergent histories. Every naturalist,
therefore, is compelled to admit that differences in nature have some-
how been augmented in the long processes of time. It is unnecessary,
therefore, that he seek the causes of present differences until he shall
have determined the causes of the smallest or original differences. It
is thus seen that there are two great and coordinate problems in the
study of evolution—the causes of initial differences and the means by
which differences are augmented. These two problems are no doubt
very often expressions of the same force or power, for the augmenta-
tion of a difference comes about by the origination of new degrees of
difference; that is, by new differences. It is very probable that the
original genesis of the differences is often due to the operation of the
very same physiological processes which gradually enlarge the differ-
ence into a gulf of wide separation.

In approaching this question of the origin of unlikenesses the inquirer
must first divest himself of the effects of all previous teaching and
thinking. We have reason to assume that all beings came from one
original life- plasma, and we must assume that this plasma had the power
of perpetuating its physiological identity. Most persons still further
assume that this plasma must have been endowed with the property of
reproducing all its characters of form and habit exactly, but such
assumption is wholly gratuitous and is born of the age-long habit of
thinking that like produces like. We really have no right to assume
either that this plasma was or was not constituted with the power of
exact reproduction of all its attributes, unless the behavior of its
ascendants forces us to the one or the other conclusion. Inasmuch as
no two individual organisms ever are or ever have been exactly alike,
so far as we can determine, it seems to me to be the logical necessity to
assume that like never did and never can produce like. The closer we
are able to approach to plasmodial and unspecialized forms of life in
our studies of organisms, the more are we impressed with the weakness
of the hereditary power. Every tyro in the study of protoplasm knows
that the amceba has no form. The shapes which it assumes are indi-
vidual and do not pass to the descendants. ‘To my mind, therefore, it
is a more violent assumption to suppose that this first unspecialized
plasma should exactly reproduce all its minor features than to suppose
that it had no distinct hereditary power and therefore, by the very
nature of its constitution, could not exactly reproduce itself. The
burden of proof has been thrown upon those who attempt to explain —
the initial origin of differences, but it should really be thrown upon
those who assume that life matter was originally so constructed as to
rigidly recast itself into one mold in each succeeding generation. I
see less reason for dogmatically assuming that like produces like than
I do for supposing that unlike produces unlike.
458 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

I advanced this proposition a year ago in my Plant Breeding (pp. 9,
10), and I am now glad to find, since writing the above paragraph, that
H.S. Williams has reached similar conclusions in his new Geological
Biology. He regards mutability as the fundamental law of organisms,
and speaks of the prevalent notion that organisms must necessarily
reproduce themselves exactly as “‘one of the chief inconsistencies in
the prevalent conception of the nature of organisms.” ‘While the
doctrine of mutability of species has generally taken the place of immu-
tability,” he writes, ‘the proposition that like prodaces like in organic
generation is still generally, and I suppose almost universally, accepted.
It therefore becomes necessary to suppose that variation is exceptional,
and that some reason for the accumulation of variation is necessary to
account for the great divergencies seen in different species. * * *
The search has been for some cause of the variation; it is more proba-
ble that mutability is the normal law of organic action, and that per-
manency is the acquired law.” J do not suppose that Professor Wil-
liams makes definite variation an inherent or necessary quality of organic
matter, but that this matter had no original hereditary power, and that
its form and other attributes in succeeding generations have been
molded into the environment, and that the burden of proof is thrown
upon those who assume that life matter was endowed with the property
that like necessarily produces like. At all events, this last is my own
conception of the modification of the streams of ascent.

In other words, I look upon heredity as an acquired character, the
same as form, or color, or sensation is, and not as an original endow-
ment of matter. The hereditary power did not originate until for some
reason it was necessary for a given character to reproduce itself, and
the longer any form or character was perpetuated the stronger became
the hereditary power.

It is now pertinent to inquire what determined the particular differ-
ences which we know to have persisted. The mere statement that some
forms became sessile or attached to the earth, and that others became
or remained motile, is an assumption that these differences were direct
adaptationstoenvironment. Every little change in environment incited
a corresponding change in the plastic organization; and the greater and
more various the changes in the physical attributes of the earth with the
lapse of time, the greater became the modifications in organisms. I
believe, therefore, that the greater part of present differences in organ-
isms are the result directly and indirectly of external stimuli, until we
come into those higher ranges of being in which sensation and volition
have developed, and in which the effects of use and disuse and of
psychological states have become increasingly more important as factors
of ascent. The whole moot question, then, as to whether variations
are definite or multifarious, is aside from theissue. They are as definite
as the changes in the environment, which determine and control their
existence. More differences arise than can persist, but this does not

ae
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 459

prove that those which are lost are any the less due to the impinging
stimuli. Those who write of definite variation usually construe the
result or outcome of some particular evolution into a measure of the
variation which is conceived to have taken place in the group. Most
or all of the present characters of any group are definite because
they are the survivals in a process of elimination; but there may have
been, at various times, the most diverse and diffuse variations in the
very group which is now marked by definite attributes. As the lines
of ascent developed, and generation followed generation in countless
number, the organization waS more and more impressed with the
features of ancestral characters, and these ancestral characters are the
more persistent as they have been more constant in the past. But
these characters, which appear as heredity or atavistic variations in
succeeding generations, were no doubt first, at least in the plant crea-
tion, the offspring, for the most part, of the environment reacting upon
the organism. As life has ascended in the time seale and has become
increasingly complex, so the operation of any incident force must ever
produce more diverse and unpredictable results. What I mean to say
is that, in plants, some of the variations seem to me to be the resultants
of a long line of previous incident impressions, or have no immediate
inciting cause. Such variation is, to all appearances, fortuitous. It is,
therefore, evident that the study of the effects of impinging environ-
ments at the present day may not directly elucidate the changes which
similar conditions may have produced in the beginning.

While the steadily ascending line of the plant creation was fitting
itself into the changing moods of the external world, it was at the same
time developing an internal power. Plants were constantly growing
larger and stronger or more specialized. The accumulation of vital
energy iS an acquired character the same as peculiarities of form or
structure are. It is the accumulated result of every circumstance
which has contributed to the well-being and virility of the organism.
The gardener knows that he can cause the plant to store up energy
in the seed, so that the resulting crop will be the larger. Growth is
itself but the expression or result of this energy which has been picked
up by the way through countless ages. Now, mere growth is variation.
It results in differences. Plants can not grow without being unlike.
The more luxuriant the growth, the more marked the variation. Most
plants have acquired or inherited more growth force than they are able
to use because they are held down to certain limitations by conditions _
in which they are necessarily placed by the struggle for existence. I
am convinced that many of the members of plants are simply out-
growths resulting from this growth pressure, or, as Bower significantly
speaks of them,! the result of an “eruptive process.” The pushing out
of shoots from any part of the plant body, upon occasion, the normal
production of adventitious plantlets upon the stems and leaves of some

460 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

begonias (especially Begonia phyllomaniaca), bryophyllum, some ferns,
and many other plants, are all expressions of the growth force which
is a more or less constant internal power. This growth force may give
rise to more definite variations than impinging stimuli do; but the
growth force runs in definite directions because it, in its turn, is the
survival in a general process of elimination. Many of the characters
of plants which—for lack of better explanation—we are in the habit of
calling adaptive, are no doubt simply the result of the eruption of
tissue. Very likely some of the compounding of leaves, the pushing
out of some kinds of prickles, the duplication of floral organs, and the
like are examples of this kind of variation. We know that the char-
acters of the external bark or cortex upon old tree trunks are the result
of the internal pressure in stretching and splitting it. This simply
shows how the growth force may originate characters of taxonomic
significance when it is expressed as mere mechanical power acting
upon tissue of given anatomical structure. This power of growth is
competent, I think, to originate many and important variations in
plants. I suppose my conception of it to be essentially the same as
that of the bathmism of Cope, and the Theory of the Organic Growth,
of Eimer.

We have now considered two general types of forces or agencies
which start off variations in plants—purely external stimuli, and the
internal acquired energy of growth. There is still a third general fac-
tor, crossing, or, as Eimer writes it, “‘sexual mixing.” The very reason
for the existence of sex, aS we now understand it, is to originate differ-
ences by means of the union of two parents into one offspring. This
sexual mixing can not be considered to be an original cause of unlike-
nesses, however, since sex itself was at first a variation induced by
environment or other agencies, and its present perfection in higher
organisms is the result of the process of continuous survival in a
conflict of differences.

The recent rise of Lamarckian views seems to have been largely the
result of an attempt to discover the vera causa of variations. Darwin’s
hypothesis of natural selection assumes variability without inquiring
into its cause, and writers have therefore said that Darwin did not
attempt to account for the cause of variations. Nothing can be further
from his views. Yet some of our most recent American writings upon
organic evolution repeat these statements. Cope, in his always admi-
rable Primary Factors of Organic Evolution, writes that ‘‘ Darwin only
discussed variation after it came into being.” Yet Darwiw’s very first
chapter in his Origin of Species contains a discussion of the ‘‘Causes
of variability,” and the same subject is gone over in detail in “ Variation
of animals and plants under domestication.” Darwin repeatedly
refers the cause or origin of variation to ‘changed conditions of life,”
which is essentially the position maintained by the Lamarckians; and
he as strenuously combats those who hold that definite variation is an
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 461

innate attribute of life. ‘But we must, I think, conclude” * * *
writes Darwin in the latter book, “that organic beings, when subjected
during several generations to any change whatever in their conditions,
tend to vary.” He discussed at length the particular agencies which
he considered to be most potent in inducing variability, and enumerated
amongst other factors the kind and amount of food, climate, and cross-
ing. ‘Changes of any kind in the conditions of life,” he repeats,
“even extremely slight changes, often suffice to cause variability.
Excess of nutriment is perhaps the most efficient single exciting cause.”
Cope, in his discussion of the “Causes of variation,” starts out with
the proposition “to cite examples of the direct modifying effect of
external influences on the characters of individual animals and plants,”
and he closes with this paragraph: “I trust that I have adduced evi-
dence to show that the stimuli of chemical and physical forces, and also
molar motion or use and its absence, are abundantly sufficient to pro-
duce variations of all kinds in organic beings. The variations may be
in color, proportions, or details of structure, according to the conditions
which are present.” This is, in great part, the thesis to which Darwin
extended the proofs of a most laborious collection of data from garden-
ers and stock-breeders and from feral nature. It has been the great
misfortune of the interpretation of Darwin’s writings that his hypoth-
esis of natural selection has so completely overtopped everything else
in the reader’s mind that other important matters have been overlooked.

While the one central truth in the plant creation is the fact that
differences arise as a result of variations in environment, there are
nevertheless many exceptions to it. There are various types of differ-
ences which are merely incidental or secondary to the main stem of
adaptive ascent. Some of these are such as arise from the cessation
of the constructive agencies, and others are mere correlatives or accom-
paniment of type differences. As an example of the former, we may
cite the behavior of the potato. By high cultivation and careful breed-
ing, the plant has been developed to produce enormous crops of very
large tubers, so heavy a crop that the plant has been obliged to spare
some of its energy from the production of pollen and berries for the
purpose of maintaining the subterranean product. It is evident that
this high state of amelioration can be maintained only by means of
high cultivation. The moment there is a let-down in the factors which
have bred and maintained the plant, there is a tendency toward a
breaking up and disappearance of the high-bred type. Thisis an illus-
tration of the phenomenon of panmixia, as outlined by Weismann, except
that the force which has ceased to act is human selection rather than
natural selection. ‘This suspension of the preserving influence of
natural selection,” Weismann writes, ‘may be termed Panmixia.” In
his opinion, ‘‘the greater number of those variations which are usually
attributed to the direct influence of external conditions of life are to
be attributed to panmixia. For example, the great variability of most
462 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

domesticated animals and plants essentially depends upon this princi-
ple.” In other words, certain differences are preserved through the
agency of natural selection, and certain differences are lost; if the
organism is removed from this restraining and directing agency, all
variations have the chance of asserting themselves. ‘All individuals
can reproduce themselves,” Weismann explains, ‘and thus stamp their
characters upon the species, and not only those « hich are in all respects,
or in respect to some single organ, the fittest.” Iam convinced that
this term expresses a very important truth, and one which, as Weis-
mann Says, is particularly apparent in domestic animals and plants;
but panmixia does not express an incident force. If new differences
arise in consequence of the cessation of the directive agency of natural
selection, it is because they were first impressed upon the organization
by some unaccountable agency; or, if there is simply a falling away
from accumulated characters, the residuary or secondary features which
appear are probably the compound and often deteriorated result of
various previous incident forces. In short, panmixia is a name for a
class of phenomena, and it can not be considered as itself an original
cause of variation. It is, to my mind, largely the unrestrained expres-
sion or unfolding of the growth-force consequent upon the removal of
the customary pressure under which the plant has lived.

3. THE SURVIVAL OF THE UNLIKE.

The one note of the modern evolution speculations which has
resounded to the remotest corner of civilization, and which is the chief
exponent of current speculation respecting the origin and destiny of
the organic world, is Spencer’s phrase, ‘“‘The survival of the fittest.”
This epigram is an epitome of Darwin’s law of natural selection, or
“the preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess
any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct.” In most writ-
ings, these two phrases—“‘natural selection” and ‘the survival of the
fittest”’—are used synonymously; but in their etymology they really
stand to each other in the relation of process and result. The opera-
tion of natural selection results in the survival of the fittest. One
must not be too exact, however, in the literal application of such sum-
mary expressions as these. Their particular mission is to afford a con-
venient and abbreviated formula for the designation of important
principles, for use in common writing and speech, and not to express a
literal truth. Darwin was himself well aware of the danger of the lit-
eral interpretation of the epigram “natural selection.” “The term
‘natural selection,’” he writes, ‘is in some respects a bad one, as it
seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be disregarded after
a little familiarity.” This technical use of the term “natural selec-
tion” is now generally accepted unconsciously; and yet there have
been recent revolts against it upon the score that it does not itself
express a literal principle or truth. If we accept the term in the sense
in which it was propounded by its author, we are equally bound to
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 463

accept ‘survival of the fittest ” as a synonymous expression, because
its author so designed it. ‘By natural selection or survival of the
fittest,” writes Spencer, ‘“‘ by the preservation in successive generations
of those whose moving equilibria happen to be least at variance with
the requirements, there is eventually produced a changed equilibrium
completely in harmony with the requirements.”

It should be said that there is no reason other than usage why the
phrase “survival of the fittest” should not apply to the result of
Lamarckian or functional evolution as well as of Darwinian or select-
ive evolution. It simply expresses a fact, without designating the
cause or the process. Cope has written a book upon the Origin of
the Fittest, in which the argument is Lamarckian. The phrase
implies a conflict, and the loss of certain contestants and the salvation
of certain others. It asserts that the contestants or characters which
survive are the fittest, but it does not explain whether they are fit
because endowed with greater strength, greater prolificness, completer
harmony with surroundings, or other attributes. I should like to sug-
gest, therefore, that the chiefest merit of the survivors is unlikeness,
and to call your attention for a few minutes to the significance of the
phrase—which I have used in my teaching during the last year—the
survival of the unlike.

This phrase—the survival of the unlike—expresses no new truth,
but I hope that it may present the old truth of vicarious or nondesigned
evolution in a new light. It defines the fittest to be the unlike. You
will recall that in this paper I have dwelt upon the origin and progress
of differences rather than of definite or positive characters. I am so
fully convinced that, in the plant creation, a new character is useful to
the species because it is unlike its kin, that the study of difference
between individuals has come to be, for me, the one absorbing and
controlling thought in the contemplation of the progress of life. These
differences arise as a result of every impinging force—soil, weather,
climate, food, training, conflict with fellows, the strain and stress of
wind and wave and insect visitors—as a complex resultant of many
antecedent external forces, the effects of crossing, and also as the result
of the accumulated force of mere growth; they are indefinite, non
designed, an expression of all the various influences to which the pass-
ive vegetable organism is or has been exposed; those differences which
are most unlike their fellows or their parents find the places of least
conflict, and persist because they thrive best and thereby impress
themselves best upon their offspring. Thereby there is a constant
tendency for new and divergent lines to strike off, and these lines, as
they become accented, develop into what we, for convenience sake,
have called species. There are, therefore, as many species as there are
unlike conditions in physical and environmental nature, and in propor-
tion as the conditions are unlike and local are the species well defined.
But to nature, perfect adaptation is the end; she knows nothing, per
Se, as species or as fixed types. Species were created by John Ray,
not by the Lord; they were named by Linnzus, not by Adam,
464 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

IT must now hasten to anticipate an objection to my phrase which may
arise in your minds. I have said that when characters are unlike exist-
ing characters they stand a chance of persisting; but I do not desire
to say that they are useful in proportion as they are unlike their kin.
I want to express my conviction that mere sports are rarely useful.
These are no doubt the result of very unusual or complex stimuli, or of
unwonted refrangibility of the energy of growth, and not having been
induced by conditions which act uniformly over a course of time, they
are likely to be transient. I fully accept Cope’s remark that there is
‘no ground for believing that sports have any considerable influence
on the course of evolution. * * * The method of evolution has
apparently been one of successful increment and decrement of parts
alone definite lines.” Among domestic animals and plants the selec-
tion and breeding of sports, or very unusual and marked variations,
has been a leading cause of their strange and diverse evolution. In
fact, it is in this particular thing that the work of the breeder and the
gardener is most unlike the work of nature. But in feral conditions,
the sport may be likened to an attribute out of place; and I imagine
that its chief effect upon the phylogeny of a race—if any effect it have—
is in giving rise in its turn to a brood of less erratic unlikenesses. This
question of sports has its psychological significance, for if the way
becomes dark the wanderer invokes the aid of this ignis fatuus to cut
short his difficulties. Sir William Thompson supposes that life may first
have come to earth by way of some meteor, and Brinton proposes that
man is a sport from some of the lower creation. It is certainly a strange
type of mind which ascribes a self-centered and self-sufficient power to
the tree of life, and then, at the very critical points, adopts a wholly
extraneous force and one which is plainly but a survival of the old cat-
aclysmic type of mind; and it is the stranger, too, because such type of
explanation is not suggested by observation or experiment, but simply
by what is for the time an insuperable barrier of ignorance of natural
processes. If evolution is true at all, there is reason to suppose that it
extends from beginning to finish of creation, and the stopping of the
process at obscure intervals is only a temporary satisfaction to a mind
that is not yet fully committed to the eternal truth of ascent. The tree
of life has no doubt grown steadily and gradually, and the same forces,
variously modified by the changing physical conditions of the earth,
have run on with slow but mighty energy until the present time. Any
radical change in the plan would have defeated it, and any mere acci-
dental circumstance is too trivial to be considered as a modifying influ-
ence of the great onward movement of creation, particularly when it
assumes to account for the appearing of the very capstone of the whole
mighty structure.

Bear with me if I recite afew specific examples of the survival of the
unlike, or of the importance, to organic types, of gradually widening
differences. Illustrations might be drawn from every field of the
organic creation, but I choose a few from plants because these are the
most neglected and I am most familiar with them. ‘These are given to
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 465

illustrate how important external stimuli are in originating variation
and how it is that some of these variations persist.

Let me begin by saying that a good gardener loves his plants. Now,
a good gardener is one who grows good plants, and good plants are
very unlike poor plants. They are unlike because the gardener’s love
for them has made them so. The plants were all alike in November;
in January the good gardener’s plants are strong and clean, with large
dense leaves, a thick stem, and an abundance of perfect flowers; the
poor gardener’s plants are small and mean, with curled leaves, a thin
hard stem, and a few imperfect flowers. You will not believe now that
the two lots were all from the same seed pod three months ago. The
good gardener likes to save his own seeds or make his own cuttings;
and next year his plants will be still more unlike his neighbor’s. The
neighbor tries this seed and that, reads this bulletin and that, but all
avails nothing simply because he does not grow good plants. He does
not care for them tenderly, as a fond mother cares for a child. The
good gardener knows that the temperature of the water and the air,
the currents in the atmosphere, the texture of the soil, and all the little
amenities aud comforts which plants so much enjoy, are just the factors
which make his plants successful; and a good crop of anything, whether
_ wheat or beans or apples, is simply a variation.

And do these unlikenesses survive? Yes, verily! The greater part
of the amelioration of cultivated plants has come about in just this
way—by gradual modifications in the conditions in which they are
grown, by means of which unlikenesses arise; and then by the selec-
tion of seeds from the most coveted plants. Even at the present day
there is comparativaly little plant breeding. The cultivated flora has
come up with man, and if it has departed immensely from its wild pro-
totypes, so has man. The greater part of all this has been unconscious
and unintended on man’s part, but it is none the less real.

As an illustration of how large the factors of undesigned choice and
selection are in the amelioration of the domestic flora, let me ask your
attention to the battle of the seed bags. In the year 1890 the census
records show for the first time the number of acres in the United States
devoted to the growing of seed. I give the acreage of three repre-
sentative crops, and these figures I have multiplied by the average
seed yields per acre in order to arrive at an approximate estimate of
the entire crop produced and the number of acres which the crop
would plant. I have used low averages of yields in order to be on the
safe side, and I have likewise used liberal averages of the quantity of
seed required to plant an acre when making up the last column:

The last column in this table has particular interest because it shows
the enormous acreage which these seeds, if all planted, would cover.
We are now curious to know if such areas really are planted to these
species, and if they are not, it will be pertinent to inquire what becomes
of the seeds. Unfortunately, we have no statistics of the entire acre-
ages of these various truck-garden crops, but the same census gives
the statistics of the commercial market gardens of the country.
Inquiry of seed merchants here has convinced me that about one-
fourth of all the seeds sold in any year go to market gardeners. I
have therefore multiplied the census figures of market gardens by four
for tle purpose of arriving at an estimate of the total acreage of the
given crops in the United States; and I have introduced the last
column from the above table for purposes of comparison:

It will thus be seen that there are enough cabbage seeds raised in
this country each year, if the census year is a fair sample, to plant
nearly three-quarters of a million acres more than actually are planted ;
about the same surplus of cucumber seeds, and a surplus of tomato
seeds sufficient to plant over one and a quarter million acres. It is
possible, of course, that the figures of actual acreage of these crops
are too low; but such error, if it occur, must be much overbalanced by
the large quantities of home-grown and’ imported seeds which are used
every year. These startling figures would not apply so well to many
other crops which are detailed in the census bulletin. For instance,
the pease raised in this country would plant only about 46,000 acres,
while there are over 100,000 acres actually grown; but this discrepancy
is probably accounted for by the fact that the larger part of the seed
pease are grown in Canada, and therefore do not figure in our census.
There is a somewhat similar discrepancy in the watermelon, but in this
crop the seeds are very largely home saved by the heavy planters in
the South and West. I do not give these figures for their value as
statistics, but simply for the purpose of graphically expressing the fact
that many more seeds are raised by cultivators each average year than
are ever grown into plants, and that the struggle for existence does
not necessarily cease when plants are taken under the care of man.

What, now, becomes of this enormous surplus of seeds? Let us take
a rough survey of the entire seed crop of any year. In the first place,
a certain percentage of the seeds is laid aside by the seedsman as a
surety against failure in the year tocome. Much of this old stock never
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 467

finds its way into the market and is finally discarded. We will estimate
this element of waste as 20 per cent. Of the 80 per cent which is actually
sold, perhaps another 10 per cent is never planted, leaving about 70
per cent which finds its way into the ground. These two items of loss
are pure waste and have no effect upon the resulting crop. Now, of
the seeds which are planted, not more than 75 per cent can be expected
to germinate; that is, there is certainly an average loss of 25 per cent
in nearly all seeds, and much more in some, due to inherent weakness,
and 75 per cent represents the survival in a conflict of strength. We
have now accounted for about half of the total seed product of any year.
The remaining half produces plants; but here the most important part
of the conflict begins. In the crops mentioned above much less than
half of the seeds which are grown ever appear in the form of a crop.
We must remember, moreover, that in making the estimate of the num-
ber of acres which these seeds would plant I have used the customary
estimates of the quantity of seeds required to plant an acre. Now,
these estimates of seedsmen and planters are always very liberal.
Every farmer sows from five to twenty times more seeds than he needs.
Some years ago I sowed seeds according to the recommendation of one
of our best seedsmen, and I found that pease would be obliged to stand
four-fifths of an inch apart, beets about twenty to the foot, and other
vegetables in like confusion. I suppose that of all the seeds which
actually come up not more than one in ten or a dozen, in garden vege-
tables, ever give mature plants. What becomes of the remainder?
They are thinned out for the good of those which are left.

This simple process of thinning out vegetables has had a most power-
ful effect upon the evolution of our domestic flora. It is a process of
undesigned selection. This selection proceeds upon the differences in
the seedlings. The weak individuals are disposed of, and those which
are strongest and most unlike the general run are preserved. Itisa
clear case of the survival of the unlike. The laborer who weeds and
thins your lettuce bed unconsciously blocks out his ideas in the plants
which he leaves. But all this is a struggle of Jew against Jew, not of
Jew against Philistine. Itis a conflict within the species, not of species
against species. It therefore tends to destroy the solidarity of the
specific type and helps to introduce much of that promiscuous unlike-
ness which is the distinguishing characteristic of domestic plants.

Let us now transfer this emphatic example to wild nature. There we
shall find the same prodigal production of seeds. In the place of the
gardener undesignedly molding the lines of divergence we find the
inexorable physical circumstances into which the plastic organisms
must grow, if they grow at all. These circumstances are very often the
direct causes of the unlikenesses of plants, for plants which start like
when they germinate may be very unlike when they die. Given time
and constantly but slowly changing conditions, and the vegetable
creation is fashioned into the unlikenesses which we now behold. With
468 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

this conception let us read again Francis Parkman’s picturesque
description of the forest of Maine in his Half Century of Conflict.

‘Hor untold ages Maine had been one unbroken forest, and it was so
still. Only along the rocky seaboard, or on the lower waters of one or
two great rivers, a few rough settlements had gnawed slight indenta-
tions into this wilderness of woods, and a little farther inland some
dismal clearing around a blockhouse or stockade let in the sunlight to
a soil that had lain in shadow time out of mind. This waste of savage
vegetation survives, in some part, to this day, with the same prodigality
of vital force, the same struggle for existence and mutual havoc that
mark all organized beings, from men to mushrooms. Young seedlings
in millions spring every summer from the black mold, rich with the
decay of those that had preceded them, crowding, choking, and killing
each other, perishing by their very abundance; all but a scattered few,
stronger than the rest, or more fortunate in position, which survive by
blighting those about them. They in turn, as they grow, interlock their
boughs, ard repeat in a season or two the same process of mutual suffo-
cation. The forest is full of lean saplings dead or dying with vainly
stretching toward the light. Not one infant tree in a thousand lives
to maturity; vet these survivors form an innumerable host, pressed
together in struggling confusion, squeezed out of symmetry and robbed
of normal development, aS men are said to be in the level sameness of
democratic society. Seen from above, their mingled tops spread in a
sea of verdure basking in light; seen from below, all is shadow, through
which spots of timid sunshine steal down among legions of dark, mossy
trunks, toadstools and rank ferns, protruding roots, matted bushes,
and rotten carcasses of fallen trees. A generation ago one might find
here and there the rugged trunk of some great pine lifting its verdant
spire above in the distinguished myriads of the forest. The woods of
Maine had their aristocracy; but the ax of the woodman has laid them
low, and these lords of the wilderness are seen no more.”

In such bold and generalized examples as this the student is able to
discern only the general fact of progressive divergency and general
adaptation to conditions, without being able to discover the particular
directive forces which have been at the bottom of the evolution. It is
only when one considers a specific example that he can arrive at any
just conclusions respecting initial causes of modification. Of adaptive
modifications, two general classes have been responsible for the ascent
of the vegetable kingdom, one a mere molding or shaping into the
passive physical environments, the other the direct result of stress or
strain imposed upon the organism by wind and water and by the neces-
sities of a radical change of habit from aquatic to terrestrial life, and
later on by the stimuli of insects upon the flowers. One of the very
best examples of the mere passive ascent is afforded by the evolution
of the root as a feeding organ; and a like example of development as
a result of strain is afforded by the evolution of the stem and vascular
or fibrous system. Our present flora, like our present fauna, is an
evolution from aquatic life. The first sessile or stationary plants were
undoubtedly stemless. As the waters increased in depth and plants
were driven farther and farther from their starting points by the
struggle for place and the disseminating influence of winds and waves,
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 469

the plant body became more and more elongated. While the plant
undoubtedly still absorbed food throughout its entire periphery, it
nevertheless began to differentiate into organs. The area chiefly con-
cerned in food gathering became broadened into a thallus, a constricted
or stem-like portion tended to develop below, and the entire structure
anchored itself to the rock by a holdfast or grapple. This holdfast,
or so-called root, of most of our present seaweeds is chiefly a means of
holding the plant in place, and it probably absorbs very little food.
As plants emerged into amphibian life, however, the foliar portion was
less and less thrown into contact with food, and there was more and
more demand upon the grapple which was anchored in the soil. The
foliage gradually developed into organs for absorbing gases and the
root was forced to absorb the liquids which the plant needed. Ido not
mean to say that there is any genetic connection between the seaweeds
and the higher plants, or that the roots of the two are homologous;
but to simply state the fact that, in point of time, the holdfast root
developed before the feeding root did, and that this change was plainly
one of adaptation. Specialized forms of flowering plants which inhabit
water still show a root system which is little more than an anchor, and
the foliage actively absorbs water. The same environmental circum-
stances are thus seen to have developed organs of similar physiolog-
ical character in widely remote times and in diverse lines of the plant
evolution. ‘As the soil slowly became thicker and thicker,” writes
‘King in his book upon The Soil, ‘as its water-holding power increased,
as the soluble plant food became more abundant, and as the winds and
the rains covered at times with soil portions of the purely superficial
and aerial early plants, the days of sunshine between passing showers,
and the weeks of drought intervening between periods of rain, became
the occasions for utilizing the moisture which the soil had held back
from the sea. These conditions, coupled with the universal tendency
of life to make the most of its surroundings, appear to have induced.
the evolution of absorbing elongations, which, by slow degrees and
centuries of repetition, come to be the true roots of plants as we now
know them.” Some aquatic flowering plants are, as we have seen, still
practically rootless, and they absorb the greater part of their food
directly by the foliar parts; but the larger number of the higher plants
absorb their mineral food by means of what has come to be a subter-
ranean feeding organ and the foliar parts have developed into gas-
absorbing organs and they take in water only when forced to do so
under stress of circumstances.

But as a mere feeding organ the root requires no fibrous structure.
It is still a holdfast or grapple and its mechanical tissue has developed
enormously, along with that of the stem, in order to preserve the plant
against the strain of the moving elements and to maintain its erectness

in aerial life. When this self poised epoch arrives, the vegetable world
begins its definite and steady ascent in centrogenic form. While the
A470 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

animal creation leaves its centrogenic arrangement early in its own
time scale, the plant creation assumes such arrangement at a compara-
tively late epoch in its time seale.

Perhaps the best illustration which I can bring you of the origin of
the unlike by means of environmental conditions and the survival of
some of this unlikeness in the battle for life, is the development of the
winter quiescence of plants. What means all this bursting verdure of
the liquid April days? Why this annually returning miracle of the
sudden expansion of the leaf and flower from the lifeless twigs? Were
plants always so? Were they designed to pass so much of their exist-
ence in the quiescent and passive condition? No. The first plants
had no well-defined cycles, and they were born to live, not to die.
There were probably no alternations of seasons in the primordial world.
Day alternated with night, but month succeeded month in almost
unbroken sameness age after age. As late as the Carboniferous time,
according to Dana, the globe ‘‘ was nowhere colder than the modern
temperate zone, or below a mean temperature of 60° F.” The earth
had become wonderfully diverse by the close of the Cretaceous time,
and the cyeads and their kin retreated from the poles. Plants grew
the year round; and as physical conditions became diverse and the
conflict of existence increased, the older and the weaker died. Soa
limit to duration, that is, death, became impressed upon the individuals
of the creation; for death, as seen by the evolutionist, is not an original
property of life matter, but is an acquired character, a result of the
survival of the fittest. The earth was perhaps ages old, even after life
began, before it ever saw a natural death; but without death all things
must have finally come to a standstill. When it became possible to
sweep away the old types, opportunity was left for new ones; and so
the ascent must continue so long as physical conditions, which are not
absolutely prohibitive of life, shall become unlike.

Species have acquired different degrees of longevity, the same as
they have acquired different sizes and shapes and habits—by adapta-
tion to their conditions of life. Annual plants comprise about half of
the vegetable kingdom, and these are probably all specializations of
comparatively late time. Probably the greater part of them were origi-
nally adaptations to shortening periods of growth; that is, to seasonal
changes. The gardener, by forceful cultivation and by transferring
plants toward the poles, is able to make annuals of perennials. Now,
a true annual is a plant which normally ripens its seeds and dies before
the coming of frost. Many of our garden plants are annuals only
because they are killed by frost. They naturally have a ionger season
than our climate will admit, and some of them are true perennials in
their native homes. These plants are, with us, plur-annuals, and
among them are the tomato, red pepper, eggplant, potato, castor
bean, cotton, lima bean, and many others. But there are some varieties
of potatoes and other plants which have now developed into true
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 471

annuals, normally completing their entire growth before the approach
of frost. It is all the result of adaptation to climate, and essentially
the same phenomenon is the development of the annual and biennial
flora of the earth from the perennial. An interesting example of the
effect of climate upon the seasonal duration of plants is the indeter-
minate or prolonged growth of plants in England as compared with
the same plants in America. The cooler summer aud very gradual
approach of winter in England develop a late and indefinite maturity
of the season’s growth. When English plants are grown in America,
they usually grow until killed by fall frosts; but after a few genera-
tions of plants, they acquire the quick and decisive habit of ripening
which is so characteristic of our vegetation. I once made an extended
test of onions from English and American seeds (Bull. 31, Mich. Agric.
College), and was astonished to find that nearly all of the English
varieties continued to grow until frost and failed “to bottom,” while
our domestic varieties ripened up in advance of freezing weather. This
was true even of the Yellow Danvers and Red Wethersfield, varieties
of American origin, and which could not have been grown very many
years in England. LEvery horticulturist of much experience must have
noticed similar unmistakable influences of climate upon the duration of
plants.

A most interesting type of examples of the quick influence of cli-
mate upon plants—not only upon their duration, but upon habit and
structural characters—is that associated with the growing of ‘stock
seed” by seedsmen. Because of uncertainties of weather in the East-
ern States, it is now the practice to grow seeds of onions, lima beans,
and other plants in California or other warm regions; but the plants so
readily acquire the habit of long-continuing growth as to be thereafter
grown with difficulty in the Northeastern States. It is, therefore,
necessary that the seedsman shall raise his stock seed every year in
his own geographical region, and this seed is each year sent to Calli-
fornia for the growing of the commercial seed crop. In other words,
the seed of California-grown onions is sold only for the purpose of
growing onion bulbs for market, and is not planted for the raising of a
successive crop of seed. This results in growing only a single genera-
tion of the crop in the warm country. Onion seed from stock which
has been grown in California for several years produces onions which
do not “bottom” well, much as I found to be the case with the English
onion seed.

But many plants, in geologic time, could not thus shorten up their
life history to adjust themselves to the oncoming of the seasons. They
ceased their labors with the approach of the cold or the dry, tucked up
their tender tissues in buds and resigned themselves to the elements.
If a man could have stood among those giant mosses and fern forests
of the reeking Carboniferous time, and could have known of the refrig-
eration which the earth was to undergo, he would have exclaimed
472 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

that all living things must utterly perish. Consider the effects of a
frost in May. See its widespread devastation. Yet, six months hence
the very same trees, which are now so blackened, will defy any degree
of cold. And then, to make good the loss of time, these plants start
into activity relatively much earlier in spring than the same species do
in frostless climates. This very day, when frosts are not yet passed,
our own New York hillsides are greener with surface vegetation than
the lands of the Gulf States are, which have been frostless for two
months and more. The frogs and turtles, the insects, the bears and
foxes, all adjust themselves to a climate which seems to be absolutely
prohibitive of life, and some animals may actually freeze during their
hibernation, and yet these April days see them again in heyday of life
and spirits! What a wonderful transformation is all this! This
enforced period of quiesence is so impressed upon the organization
that the habit becomes hereditary in plants, and the gardener says
that his begonias and geraniums and callas must have a “rest,” or they
will not thrive. But in time he can so far break this habit in most
plants as to force them into activity for the entire year. These budding
days of April, therefore, are the songs of release from the bondage of
winter which has come on as the earth has grown aged and cold.

I must bring still one more illustration of the survival of the unlike,
out of the abundance of examples which might be cited. It is the fact
that, as a rule, new types are variable and old types are inflexible.
The student of fossil plants will recall the fact that the liriodendrons,
ginkgos, sequoias, sassafrasses, and other types came into existence
with many species and are now going out of existence with one or two
species. Williams has considered this feature, for extinct animal forms,
at some length in his new Geological Biology. ‘Many species,” he
writes, ‘‘which by their abundance and good preservation in fossil
state give us sufficient evidence in the case, exhibit greater plasticity
in their characters at the early stage than in later stages of their his-
tory. A minute tracing of lines of succession of species shows greater
plasticity at the beginning of the series than later, and this is expressed,
in the systematic description and tabulation of the facts, by an increase
in the number of the species.” ‘When species are studied historically,
the law appears evident that the characters of specific value * * *
present a greater degree of range of variability at an early stage in the
life period of the genus than in the later stages of that period.” So
marked is this incoming of new types in many cases that some students —
have supposed that actual special creation of species has occurred at
these epochs. It should be said that there is apt to be a fallacy in
observation in these instances, because the records which are, to our
vision, simultaneous in the rocks may have extended over ages of
time; but it is nevertheless true that some important groups seem to
have come in somewhat quickly with many or several species and
to have passed out with exceeding slowness.
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 473

To my mind, all thisis but the normal result of the divergence of
character, or the survival of the unlike. A new type finds places
of least conflict, it spreads rapidly and widely, and thereby varies
immensely. It is a generalized type, and therefore adapts itself at
once to many and changing conditions. A virile plant is introduced
into a country in which the same or similar plants are unknown, and
immediately it finds its opportunity and becomes a weed, by which we
mean that it spreads and thrives everywhere. Darwin and Gray long
ago elucidated this fact. The trilobites, spirifers, conifers, ginkgos,
were weed types of their time, the same as the composites are to-day.
They were stronger than their contemporaries, the same as our own
weeds are stronger than the cultivated plants with which they grow.
After a time the new types outran their opportunity, the remorseless
struggle for existence tightened in upon them, the intermediate unlike-
nesses had been blotted out, and finally only one or two types remained,
struggling on through the ages, but doomed to perish with the con-
tinuing changes of the earth. They became specialized and inelastic;
and the highly specialized is necessarily doomed to extinction. Such
remnants of a vanquished host remain to us in our single liriodendron,
the single ginkgo, and sassafras, and the depleted ranks of the conifers.

My attention was first called to this line of thought by contemplating
upon the fact that cultivated plants differ widely in variability, and I
was struck by the fact that many of our most inextricably variable
groups—as the cucurbits, maize, citrus, and the great tribes of com-
posites—are still unknown in a fossil state, presumably because of their
recent origin. Many other variable genera, to be sure, are well repre-
sented in fossil species, as roses (although these are as late as the
Eocene), pyrus, prunus, and musa; but absolute age is not so signifi-
cant as the comparative age of the type, for types which originated very
far back may be yet in the comparative youth of their development.
The summary conclusions of a discussion of this subject were presented
to the American Association for the Advancement of Science two years
ago.! A modification of these points, as I now understand them, would
run something as follows:

1. There is a wide difference in variability in cultivated plants. Some
species vary enormously, and others very little.

2. This variability is not correlated with age of cultivation, degree of
cultivation, or geographical distribution.

3. Variability of cultivated plants must be largely influenced and
directed, therefore, by some antecedent causes.

4, The chief antecedent factor in directing this variability is probably
the age of the type. New types in geologic time, are polymorphous;
old types are monomorphous and are tending toward extinction. The
most flexible types of cultivated plants are such as have probably not
yet passed their zenith, as the cucurbits, composites, begonias, and the

‘Proc. A. A. A. S, 1894, 255; Botanical Gazette, XIX, 381.
ATA4 FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION.

like. The varieties of cereals, which are old types, are so much alike
that expert knowledge is needed to distinguish them.

5. New types are more variable and flexible because less perfectly
molded into and adjusted to the circumstances of life than the old types
are. They have not yet reached the limits of their dissemination and
variation. They are generalized forms.

The reader will please observe that I have here regarded the origin
and survival of the unlike in the plant creation in the sense of a plastic
material which is acted upon by every external stimulus, and which must
necessarily vary from the very force of its acquired power of growth,
and the unlikenesses are preserved because they are unlike. I have no
sympathy with the too prevalent idea that all the attributes of plants
are direct adaptations, or that they are developed as mere protections
from environment and associates. There is a type of popular writings
which attempts to evolve many of the forms of plants as a mere protec-
tion from assumed enemies. Perhaps the plant features which have
been most abused in this manner are the spines, prickles, and the like,
and the presence of acrid or poisonous qualities. As a sample of this
type of writing, I will make an extract from Massee’s Plant World:

‘Amongst the most prominent and general modes of protection of
vegetative parts against the attacks of living enemies may be mentioned
prickles, as in roses and brambles, which may either be straight, and
thus prevent the nibblings of animals, or, im more advanced species,
curved, thus enabling the weak stem to climb and carry its leaves out
of harm’s way. Spines that are sharp-pointed abortive branches, serv-
ing the same purpose as prickles, as in the common sloe or blackthorn
(Prunus spinosa). Rigid hairs on leaves and stem, as in the borage
(Borago officinalis) and comfrey (Symphytum officinale). Stinging hairs,
as in the common nettles (Urtica dioica and U. wrens). In these cases
the stinging hairs are mixed on the leaves and stem with ordinary rigid
hairs, of which they are higher developments, distinguished by the lower
or basal swollen portion of the hair containing an irritating liquid that
is ejected when the tip of the hair is broken off. Bitter taste, often
accompanied by a strong scent, as in wormwood (Artemisia vulgaris),
chamomile (Anthemis nobilis), and the leaves and fruit of the walnut
(Juglans regia). Poisonous alkaloids, as in the species of Strychnos,
which contain two very poisonons alkaloids, strychnine and brucine, in
the root and the seeds; decoctions of species of Strychnos are used by
the Javanese and the natives of South America to poison their arrows.
Some of the species, as Strychnos nux vomica, are valuable medicines,
depending on the strychnine they contain, which acts as a powerful
excitant of the spinal cord and nerves; thus the most effective pro-
tective arrangements evolved by plants can be turned to account, and
consequently lead to the destruction of the individuals they were
designed to protect. Our common arum (Arum maculatum), popularly
known as ‘Lords and Ladies,’ has an intensely acrid substance present
in the leaves, which effectually protects it from the attacks of mammals
and caterpillars, but not from the attacks of parasitic fungi, which
appear to be indifferent to all protective contrivancesexhibited by plants,
nearly every piant supporting one or more of these minute pests, the
effects of which will be realized by mentioning the potato disease,
‘rust’ and ‘smut’ in the various cereals, and the hop disease, all due
to parasitic fungi.”
FACTORS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION. 475

Now, this is merely a gratuitous and ad captandum species of argu-
ment, one which is designed to please the fancy and to satisfy those
superficial spirits who are still determined to read the element of design
into organic nature. Itdoes not account for the facts. These particu.
lar attributes of plants are specialized features, and it is always unsafe
to generalize upon specializations. Each and every one of such spe-
cialized features must be investigated for itself. Probably the greater
number of spinous processes will be found to be the residua following
the contraction of the plant body; others are no doubt mere correla-
tives of the evolution of other attributes; and some may be the erup-
tions of the growth force; and the acrid and poisonous properties are
quite as likely to be wholly secondary and useless features. The attempt
to find a definite immediate use and office for every attribute in the
creation is superficial and pernicious. There are many attributes of
organisms which are not only useless, but positively dangerous to the
possessor, and they can be understood only as one studies them in con-
nection with the long and event*ul history of the line of ascent.

Vhe thought which I want to leave with you, therefore, is that unlike-
nesses are the greatest facts in the organic creation. These unlikenesses
in plants are (1) the expressions of the ever-changing environmental
conditions in which plants grow, and of the incidental stimuli to which
they are exposed; (2) the result of the force of mere growth; (3) the
outcome of sexual mixing. They survive because they are unlike,
and thereby enter fields of least competition. The possibility of the
entire tragic evolution lay in the plasticity of the original life-plasma.
The plastic creation has grown into its own needs day by day and age
by age, and it is now just what it has been obliged to be. It could
have been nothing else.

THE LAW WHICH UNDERLIES PROTECTIVE COLORATION:!

By Apsorr H, THAYER.

This article is intended to set forth a beautiful law of nature which,
so far as I can discover, has never been pointed out in print. It is the
law of gradation in the coloring of animals, and is responsible for most
of the phenomena of protective coloration except those properly called
mimicry.

Naturalists have long recueeedl the fact that the coloring of many
animals makes them difficult to distinguish, and have called the whole
phenomenon protective coloration, little guessing how wonderful a fact
lay hidden under the name.

Mimicry makes an animal appear to be some other thing, whereas
this newly discovered law makes him cease to appear to exist at all.
The following are some examples of true mimicry. The screech owl,
when startled, makes himself tall and slim,and with eyes shut to a
narrow line simulates a dead stub of the tree on which he sits. Certain
herons stretch their necks straight upward, and with head and green
beak pointed at the zenith pass themselves off for blades of sedge grass.
Certain harmless snakes spread their heads out flat, in imitation of
their poisonous cousins, and rattle with their tails in the leaves. Many
butterflies have stone or bark colored under sides to théir wings, which
make them look like a bit of bark or lichen when they sit still on a
stone or tree trunk with wings shut over their backs.

The newly discovered law may be stated thus: Animals are painted
by nature darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the
sky’s light, and vice versa.

_ The accompanying diagram illustrates this statement. Animals are
colored by nature as in A, the sky lights them as in B, and the two
effects cancel each other asin C. The result is that their gradation of
light and shade, by which opaque solid objects manifest themselves to
the eye, is effaced at every point, the cancellation being as complete at
one point as another, as in C of the diagram, and the spectator seems
to see right through the space Healy dugainted by an oprae animal,

478 THE LAW WHICH UNDERLIES PROTECTIVE COLORATION.

Figure 1, of a ruffed grouse, shows this arrangement of color and
light. This bird belongs to the class in which the arrangement is
found in its simplest form, the color making a complete gradation from
brown above to silvery white beneath, and conforming to every slight-
est modeling. For instance, it grows light under the shelving eyebrow
and darker again on the projecting cheek.

When he stands alive on the ground, as in figure 2, his obliteration
by the effect of the top light is obvious.

Writers say ‘“‘he is so nearly like the color of his surroundings that
you can not see him.” Figure 3 is to show that they ascribe the con-
cealment to the wrong cause. I merely'took the bird shown in figure 2
and accurately tinted his under parts with brown to match his back, and
in less degree tinted his sides, till I had reduced him to uniformity of
color all over; but I did not, of course, change his upper surfaces at
all. In short, I extended his ‘‘ protective” color all over him.

a=W Vl am

Now observe the effect on replacing him in a life-like position. He
is completely unmasked. The reader has but to compare the distance
at which he can distinguish a bird in No. 2 and in No. 3, respectively,
to see whether simple ‘‘protective coloration,” as ordinarily defined, is
the true cause of this concealment, or whether this compound gradation
of color and light is the true cause.

Figures 4 and 5 show that his colors are powerless to conceal him in
any position except the upright one which he holds when alive, and
figures 6 and 7 do the same for the woodcock.

In figures 5 and 6, notwithstanding the fact that we have even the
strongest “protective” colors toward us, the bird is by no means
concealed.

The woodcock series corresponds to that of the ruffed grouse.
Figure 8 shows a female on her nest, very difficult to find. In figure 9
the bird has been treated exactly as I treated the ruffed grouse in fig-
ure 3. Observe that she is essentially more conspicuous, though not a
feather of her upper parts has been artificially painted. The reason of
her visibility is that I have artificially extended her top colors down
her sides, thereby destroying her counter gradation and forcing her
solidity to manifest itself.

The reader, I think, must try these experiments for himself before he
can believe that in figures 3 and 91 tinted the under surfaces exactly
as dark as the upper, and no darker. But I beg him to look at any
horizontal branch in the woods which is either on the level of his eye
or below it. He will see that, although it has exactly the color of its
surroundings, it is not in the least concealed, because, being of uni‘orm
color above and below, like the birds after I had painted their under
sides, it wears that universal attribute of a solid, namely, a gradation
of shading from its light side to its dark side.

I leave to the reader the pleasure of discovering for himself that this
principle of gradation in color is almost universal in the animal kingdom.
In certain classes of birds and of flying insects, however, the principle
gives place, more or less, to the device pointed out by Bates, namely,
the employment of strong arbitrary patterns of color which tend to
canceal the wearer by destroying his apparent continuity of surface.
This makes, for instance, the mallard’s dark-green head tend to detach
itself from his body and to join the dark green of the shady sedge, or
the ruby of the humming bird to desert him and to appear to belong to
the glistening flower which he is searching. Yet many other cases of
color applied apparently at random conform essentially to the law
stated above. The dark patches are on top, the light ones beneath.!
The dark breast mark, so widely used by nature on birds, usually has
the effect of putting out a conspicuous and shining rotundity of some
bright or light color, as in the meadow lark and the flicker, because it
comes just where the breast, in its usual position, rounds upward and
faces the sky. The dark collars of the males of most species of duck
are absolute counter shading to the light from the sky, when the birds
sit in their characteristic positions. For most female ducks nature
uses the complete gradation, like that of grouse and sandpipers.
Ground birds in general, such as grouse, sandpipers, and sparrows, are
usually clothed throughout in colors graded according to this principle.
But the males of many species of pheasant are notable exceptions to
this last statement.

Now there is still one more very beautitul phenomenon to record. If
the animal itself is obliterated by this mechanism of nature, for what
useful purpose beyond considerations of sexual selections do his mark-
ings exist, since they are not obliterated? The answer is that the
markings on the animal become a picture of such background as one
might see if the animal were transparent. They help the animal to
coalesce, in appearance, with the background which is visible when the
observer looks past him. In many birds, for instance, those colors which
would be seen by an enemy looking down upon them are laid on by
nature in coarser and more blotchy patterns than are the colors on

1T have proved, by experiments with painted decoys, that even brilliant top
colors, however strongly contrasted to surroundings, scarcely tend to betray the
wearer if his ensemble be a gradation from dark above to light below.
480 THE LAW WHICH UNDERLIES PROTECTIVE COLORATION.

their sides, so that when you look down on them you see that their
backs match the mottled ground about them; whereas, when you
assume a lower point of view nearer their level, and see more and more
of their sides, you find them painted to match the more intricate
designs of the vegetation which is a little farther off, and which, from
this new standpoint of the observer, now forms the background. In
this latter position the head of the animal, being the highest part of
its body, is seen against the most distant part of the background, whose
details are still more reduced by perspective. 'To correspond with this
reduction of strength in the more distant background, the details on
the sides of the animal’s head are likewise reduced in their emphasis,
and like the more distant details are smaller in pattern.

It is a most significant fact that throughout the animal kingdom the ~
highest development of the arrangement of color and light described
in this article, and the highest development of the habit of standing or
crouching motionless in full daylight to avoid discovery, seem to coin-
cide very closely. For instance, gallinaceous birds, most waders, and
the cat tribe have both the color arrangement and the standing or the
crouching habit highly developed. Contrasted with these, for example,
are the skunks and the bears. Neither of these quadrupeds has the
gradation of color nor the standing or crouching habit. They are both
nocturnal, aud therefore do not need either gradation or crouching for
concealment.

It is plain, then, that while nature undeniably completes the conceal-
ment of animals by pitching their whole color gradation in a key to
match their environment, the real magic lies in the gradation itself
from darkest above to lightest below, wherever this gradation is found.
This is why it is so hard to see the partridge in the tree, the sandpiper
on the mud, or the tiger crouching in the jungle.

FURTHER REMARKS ON THE LAW WHICH UNDERLIES PROTECTIVE
j COLORATION.

Since writing my article on protective coloration in the April Auk I
have alighted on the means of still more complete ocular demonstra-
tion of the law of protective coloration.

I made some wooden eggs about the size of a woodcock’s body, and
provided them with wire legs to poise them 6 inches above the ground.

Most of these I colored in imitation of the color gradation of a
grouse or hare—earth color above, to pure white beneath—while to two
others I gave a coat of earth color all over, above and below; then set
the whole like a flock of “shore birds” on the bare ground in a city
lot.!

I then summoned a naturalist and let him begin at 40 or 50 yards
to look for them. He saw immediately the two monochrome ones, but

1'To give the gradation its complete effect, the painting of the wooden eggs should
be done after they are placed on the ground and of course by an artist.

although told exactly where to look, failed to find any of the others
until within 6 or 7 yards, and even then only by knowing exactly
where to look.

I had also painted bright blue and red spots as big as a silver quar-
ter of a dollar on the brown back of one of the graded eggs. These
spots the naturalist saw, when we had come pretty near, though they
only passed for details of the ground beyond the egg.

It was to this latter experiment that I alluded in a footnote when I
said that brilliant top colors scarcely tend to interfere with the graua-
tion’s power. This statement does not apply, however, to creatures in
which, as in a bluejay, the bright color so predominates as to form a
silhouette shaped like the creature, but only when the bright pattern
goes, as it were, its own way, not accompanying the animal’s form.

Yet, even in the jay’s case, his gradation down to white under throat
and belly diminishes so greatly his conspicuousness in the dim forest
shade that he may be suspected of great indebtedness to this arrange-
ment of color as he skulks among the leaves. He must often be much
helped, also, by the fact that whenever his gradation works its charm
and denies his substantiality his blue is likely, at least, to appear to
belong to whatever surface, far or near, forms his background for the
beholder’s eye at the moment; as, for instance, a bit of blue distance
seen through the leaves. And often, when he is not concealed to this
degree, his ghostly appearance still tends to cause the beholder to think
him farther off than he is, which may be sometimes equivalent to con-
cealment. The reader should compare a graded blue egg with one blue
all over, both seen in deep woods. Let me urge the reader to under-
stand these color phenomena, which are the open door into a new world
of most charming study of special cases of protective coloration hith-
erto misunderstood.

One must remember that by far the greater part of the objects he
espies as he walks are first caught sight of out of the side of his eye;
and it is this faint seeing against which all this faint appearing is so
potent in countless cases where the animal could not elude the direct
eye. In my former article I omitted to emphasize the device of nature
by which she accomplishes, in the only possible way, the bringing the
top, sides, throat, and belly of an animal to the exact color of the sur-
rounding earth, as well as to the same degree of darkness.

The animal’s top is brown like the ground about him, and from this
brown his color grades steadily colder till it becomes cold white on his
under surfaces. The latter, being in shadow and bathed in a yellow
reflection from the earth, has the exact color as well as degree of dark-
ness of his top; since, obviously, earth-brown bathed in sky light
equals sky light (color of the auimnells belly) bathed in earth-yellow
and shadow, i. e., brown.

This grading hi white under surfaces is precisely what would result
if daylight tended to brown animals’ coats and its lack to bleach them.

sm 97——31
482 THE LAW WHICH UNDERLIES PROTECTIVE COLORATION.

And, from this, one might fancy the whole phenomenon to be the result
of such browning and bleaching. But to those who believe in natural
selection it must be obvious that the gradation’s protecting power
proves it a result of such selection. As to a bleaching and browning
theory, many facts suggest that light does not tend to darken the coats
of animals. Notice, for instance, the pale inhabitants of treeless
regions, Such as sandy beaches, ete., compared with wood dwellers.
But this discussion is outside my present purpose.

As an epigrammatic lash to my entire thesis on protective coloration,
it is important to say that no other conceivable arrangement of light
and dark colors could effect the intrinsic unsubstantiality of appear-
ance guaranteed by the gradation therein set forth.

LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS.!
By Prof. L. C. MIAuL, F. BR. 8S.

It has long been my conviction that we study animals too much as
dead things. We name them, arrange them according to our notions
of their likeness or unlikeness, and record their distribution. Then per-
haps we are satisfied, forgetting that we could do as much with minerals
or remarkable boulders. Of late years we have attempted something
more; we now teach every student of zoology to dissect animals and to
attend to their development. This is, I believe, a solid and lasting
improvement. We owe it largely to Huxley, though it is but a revival
of the method of Dollinger, who may be judged, by the eminence of his
pupils and by the direct testimony of Baer, to have been one of the
very greatest of biological teachers. But the animals set before the
young zoologist are all dead; it is much if they are not pickled as well.
When he studies their development, he works chiefly or altogether
upon continuous sections, embryos mounted in balsam, and wax models.
He is rarely encouraged to observe live tadpoles or third-day chicks
with beating hearts. As for what Gilbert White calls the life and con-
versation of animals—how they defend themselves, feed, and make
love—this is commonly passed over as a matter of curious but not very
important information; it is not reputed scientific, or at least not
eminently scientific.

Why do we study animals at all? Some of us merely want to gain
practical skill before attempting to master the structure of the human
body; others hope to qualify themselves to answer the questions of
geologists and farmers; avery few wish to satisfy their natural curiosity
about the creatures which they find in the wood, the field, or the sea.
But surely our chief reason for studying animals ought to be that we
would know more of life, of the modes of growth of individuals and
races, of the causes of decay and extinction, of the adaptation of living
organisms to their surroundings. Some of us even aspire to know in
outline the course of life upon the earth, and to learn, or, failing that,
to conjecture, how life originated. Our own life is the thing of all

others which interests us most deeply, but everything interests us
which throws even a faint and reflected light upon human life. Per-
haps the professor of zoology is prudent in keeping so close as he does
to the tacts of structure, and in shunning the very attempt to interpret,
but while he wins safety he loses his hold upon our attention. Mor-
phology is very well; it may be exact; it may prevent or expose serious
errors. But morphology is not an end in itself. Like the systems of
zoology, or the records of distribution, it draws whatever interest it
possesses from that life which creates organs and adaptations. To
know more of life is an aim as nearly ultimate and self-explanatory as
any purpose that man can entertain.

Can the study of life be made truly scientific? Is it not too vast,
too inaccessible to human faculties? If we venture into this alluring
field of inquiry, shall we gain results of permanent value, or shall we
bring back nothing better than unverified speculations and curious but
unrelated facts?

The scientific career of Charles Darwin is, I think, a sufficient answer
to such doubts. Ido not lay it down as an article of the scientific faith
that Darwin’s theories are to be taken as true; we shall refute any or
all of them as soon.as we know how; but it is a great thing that he
raised so many questions which were well worth raising. He set all
scientific minds fermenting, and not only zoology and botany, but
paleontology, history, and even philology bear some mark of his activity.
Whether his main conclusions are in the end received, modified, or
rejected, the effect of his work can not be undone. Darwin was a bit
of a sportsman and a good deal of a geologist; he was a fair anatomist
and a working systematist; he keenly appreciated the value of exact
knowledge of distribution. I hardly know of any aspect of natural
history, except synonymy, of which he spoke with contempt. But he
chiefly studied animals and plants as living beings. They were to him
not so much objects to be stuck through with pins, or pickled, or dried,
or labeled, as things to be watched in action. He studied their diffi-
culties, and recorded their little triumphs of adaptation with an admir-
ing smile. We owe as many discoveries to his sympathy with living
nature as to his exactness or his candor, though these too were illus-
trious. 1t is not good to idolize even our greatest men, but we should
try to profit by their example. I think that a young student, anxious
to be useful but doubtful of his powers, may feel sure that he is not
wasting his time if he is collecting or verifying facts which would have
helped Darwin.

Zoologists may justify their favorite studies on the ground that to
know the structure and activities of a variety of animals enlarges our
sense of the possibilities of life. Surely it must be good for the student
of human physiology, to take one specialist as an example of the rest,
that he should know of many ways in which the same functions can be
discharged. Let him learn that there are animals (starfishes) whose
LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS. 485

nervous system lies on the outside of the body, and that in other ani-
mals it is generally to be found there during some stage of development;
that there are animals whose circulation reverses its direction at fre-
quent intervals either throughout life (tunicata) or at a particular
crisis (insects at the time of pupation); that there are animals with eyes
on the back (Oncidium, scorpion), on the shell (some chitonidz), on
limbs or limb-like appendages, in the brain cavity, or on the edge of a
protective fold of skin; that there are not only eyes of many kinds with
lenses, but eyes on the principle of the pin-hole camera without lens at
all (Nautilus) and of every lower grade down to mere pigment spots;
that auditory organs may be borne upon the legs (insects) or the tail
(Mysis); that they may be deeply sunk in the body, and yet have no
inlet for the vibrations of the sonorous medium (many aquatic ani-
mals). It is well that he should know of animals with two tails
(Cercaria of gasterostomum) or with two bodies permanently united
(Diplozoon); of animals developed within a larva which lives for a
considerable time after the adult has detached itself (some starfishes
and nemertines); of animals which lay two (Daphnia) or three kinds
of eggs (rotifera); of eggs which regularly produce two (Lumbricus
trapezoides) or éven eight embryos apiece (Praopus!); of males which
live parasitically upon the female (cirripedes), or even undergo their
transformations, as many as eighteen at a time, in her gullet (Bonellia) ;
of male animals which are mere bags of sperm cells (some rotifera,
some Ivodes, parasitic copepods), and of female animals which are mere
bags of eggs (Sacculina, Entoconcha). The more the naturalist knows
of such strange deviations from the familiar course of things the better
will he be prepared to reason about what he sees, and the safer will he
be against the perversions of hasty conjecture.

If a wide knowledge of animals is a gain to physiclogy and every
other branch of biology, what opportunities are lost by our ignorance
of the early stages of so many animals! They are often as unlike to
the adult in structure and function as if they belonged to different
genera, or even to different families. Zoologists have made the wildest
mistakes in classifying larvee whose subsequent history was at the time
unknown. The naturalist who devotes himself to life histories shares
the advantage of the naturalist who explores a new continent. A
wealth of new forms is opened out before him. Though Swammerdam,
Réaumur, De Geer, Vaughan Thompson, Johannes Miiller, and a crowd
of less famous naturalists have gone before us, so much remains to be
done that no zealous inquirer can fail to discover plenty of untouched
Subjects in any wood, thicket, brook, or sea.

Whoever may attempt this kind of work will find many difficulties
and many aids. He will, of course, find abundant exercise for all the
anatomy and physiology that he can command. Ue will need the

486 LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS.

systems of descriptive zoology, and will often be glad of the help of pro-
fessed systematists. The work can not be well done until it is exactly
known what animal is being studied. For want of this knowledge,
hardly attainable one hundred and fifty years ago, Réaumur sometimes
tells us curious things which we can neither verify nor correct; at
times we really do not know what animal he had before him. The
student of life histories will find a use for physics and chemistry, if
he is so lucky as to remember any. Skill in drawing is valuable,
perhaps indispensable.

If by chance I should be addressing any young naturalist who thinks
of attending to life histories, | would beg him to study his animals alive
and under natural conditions. To pop everything into alcohol and
make out the names at home is the method of the collectors, but life
histories are not studied in this way. Itis often indispensable to isolate
an animal, and for this purpose a very small habitation is sometimes
to be preferred. The teacup aquarium, for instance, is often better
than the tank. But we must also watch an animal’s behavior under
altogether natural circumstances, and this is one among many reasons
for choosing our subject from the animals which are locally common.
Let us be slow to enter into controversies. After they have been hotly
pursued for some time, it generally turns out that the disputants. have
been using words in different senses. Discussion is excellent, contro-
versy usually barren. Yet not always; the Darwinian controversy
was heated, and nevertheless eminently productive; ali turns upon the
temper of the men concerned, and the solidity of the question at issue.
One more hint to young students. Perhaps no one ever carried through
a serious bit of work without in some stage or other longing to drop it.
There comes a time when the first impulse is spent, and difficulties
appear which escaped notice at first. Then most men lose hope. That
is the time to show that we are a little better than most men. J remem-
ber as a young man drawing much comfort from the advice of a col-
league, now an eminent chemist, to whom I had explained my diffieul-
ties and fears. All that he said was, “Keep at it,” and I found that
nothing more was wanted.

I greatly believe in the value of association. Itis good that two men
should look at every doubtful structure and criticise every interpre-
tation. It is often good that two talents should enter into partnership,
such as a talent for description and a talent for drawing. It is often
good that-an experienced investigator should choose the subject and
direct the course of work, and that he should be helped by a junior,
who can work, but can not guide. It seems to me that friendiy criti-
cism before publication is often a means of preventing avoidable mis-
takes. Jam sorry that there should be any kind of prejudice against
cooperation, or that it should be taken to bea sign of weakness. There
are, I believe, very few men who are so strong as not to be the better
for help. One difficulty would be removed if known authors were
LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS. A87

more generous in acknowledging the help of their assistants. They
ought not to be slow to admit a real helper to such honor as there may
be in joint authorship.

Among the most important helps to the student of life histories must
be mentioned the zoological stations now maintained by most of the
great nations. The parent of all these, the great zoological station at
Naples, celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary last April, so that the
whole movement belongs to our own generation. How would Spallan-
zani and Vaughan Thompson and Johannes Miiller have rejoiced to
see such facilities for the close investigation of the animal life of the
sea! The English-speaking nations have taken their fair share of the
splendid work done at Naples, and it is pleasant to remember that
Darwin subscribed to the first fund, while the British Association, the
University of Cambridge, and the Smithsonian Institution have main-
tained their own tables at the station.' The material support thus
given is small when compared with the subsidies of the German
Government, and not worth mention beside the heroic sacrifices of the
director, Dr. Anton Dohrn, but as proofs of lively interest in a purely
scientific enterprise they have their value. Marine stations have now
multiplied to such a point that a bare enumeration of them would be
tedious. Fresh-water biological stations are also growing in number.
Forel set an excellent example by his investigation of the physical and
biological phenomena of the Lake of Geneva. Dr. Anton Fritsch, of
Prag, followed with his movable station. There is a well equipped
station at Plon among the lakes of Holstein, and a small one on the
Miiggelsee near Berlin. The active station of Illinois is known to me
only by the excellent publications which it has begun toissue. France,
Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland all have their fresh-water biological
stations, and I hope that England will not long remain indifferent to so
promising a sphere of investigation.

Biological work may answer many useful purposes. It may be help-
ful to industry and public health. Of late years the entomologist has
risen into sudden importance by the vigorous steps taken to discourage
injurious insects. I have even known a zoological expert summoned
before a court of law in order to say whether or not a swordfish can
sink a ship. I would not on any account run down the practical appli-
cations of biology, but I believe that the first duty of the biologist is
to make science, and that science is made by putting and answering
questions. We are too easily drawn off from this, which is our main
business, by self-imposed occupations, of which we can often say noth-
ing better than that they do no harm except to the man who undertakes
them. There are, for example, a good many lists of species which are
compiled without any clear scientific object. We have a better pros-
pect of working to good purpose when we try to answer definite
questions. I propose to spend what time remains in putting and

answering as well as I can a few of the questions which occur to any
naturalist who occupies himself with life histories. [ven a partial
answer, even a mistaken answer, is better than the blank indifference
of the collector who records and records, but never thinks about his
facts.

The first question that I will put is this: Why do some animals
undergo transformation while others do not? It has long been noticed!
that as a rule fresh-water and terrestrial animals do not go through
transformation, while their marine allies do. Let us take half a dozen
examples of each:

Fluviatile or terrestrial, without trans- Marine, with transformation:

formation: Crab,
Crayfish, Polygordius,
Earthworm, Doris, Holis,
Helix, Oyster,
Cyclas, Most hydrozoa, etc.

Hydra, ete.

We get a glimmer of light upon this characteristic difference when
we remark that in fresh-water and terrestrial species the eggs are often
larger than in the allied marine forms A large egg favors embryonic
as opposed to larval development. An embryo which is formed within
a large egg may feed long upon the food laid up for it and continue its
development to a late stage before hatching. But if there is little or
no yolk in the egg the embryo will turn out early to shift for itself. It
will be born as a larva, provided with provisional organs suited to its
small size and weakness. Large eggs are naturally fewer than small
ones. Does the size depend on the number or the number on the size?
To answer in a word, I believe that the size generally depends on the
number and that the number is mainly determined by the risks to
which the species are exposed. At least so many eggs will in general
be produced as can maintain the numbers of the species in spite of
losses, and there is some reason to believe that in fresh waters the risks
are less than in the shallow seas or at the surface of the ocean.? In
most parts of the world the fresh waters are of small size and much
cut up. Every river basin forms a separate territory. Isolation, like
every other kind of artificial restriction, discourages competition and
impedes the spread of successful competitors. In the shallow seas or

1 Darwin, Origin of Species, Chap. XIII; Fritz Miiller, Fiir Darwin, Chap. VII.

2 Indications are given by the survival in fresh waters of declining groups, e. g.,
ganoid fishes, which, when dominant, maintained themselves in the sea, and by the
not uncommon case of marine animals which enter rivers to spawn. I do not attempt
to count among these indications the supposed geological antiquity of fluviatile as
compared with marine animals. Some marine genera are extremely ancient (Lingula,
Nucula, Trigonia, Nautilus); a perfectly fair comparison is almost impossible, and
great persistence does not necessarily imply freedom from risks. In the mollusca,
which afford a good opportunity of testing the effect of habitat upon the number of
the eggs, marine species seem to produce more eggs as a rule than fluviatile, and
these many more than terrestrial species.

at the surface of the ocean conquering forms have a free course; in
lakes and rivers they are soon checked by physical barriers.

A large proportion of animals are armor clad and move about with
some difficulty when they have attained their full size. The dispersal
of the species is therefore in these cases effected by small and active
larve. Marine animals (whether littoral or pelagic) commonly produce
vast numbers of locomotive larvee, which easily travel to a distance.
Floating is easy and swimming not very difficult. A very slightly
built and immature larva can move about by cilia or take advantage
of currents, and a numerous brood may be dispersed far and wide
while they are mere hollow sacs, without mouth, nerves, or sense
organs. Afterwards they will settle down and begin to feed. In fresh
waters armor is aS common, for all that | know, as in the sea, but
locomotive larve are rare.' There is no space for effective migration.
Even a heavy-armored and slow-moving crustacean or pond snail can
cross a river or lake, and to save days or hours is unimportant. In
rivers, aS Sollas has pointed out, free-swimming larve would be subject
to a special risk—that of being swept out to sea. This circumstance
may have been influential, but the diminished motive for migration is
probably more important. At least an occasional transport to a new
area is indispensable to most fresh-water organisms, and very unex-
pected modes of dispersal are sometimes employed, not regularly in
each generation, but at long intervals, as opportunity offers.

Early migration by land is nearly always out of the question. Walk-
ing, and still more flying, are difficult exercises, which call for muscles
of complex arrangement and a hard skeleton. A very small animal,
turned out to shift for itself on land, would in most cases perish with-
out a struggle. There might be just a chance for it if it could resist
superficial drying and were small enough to be blown about by the
wind (infusoria, rotifera, and certain minute crustacea) or if it were
born in a wet pasture, like some parasitic worms.

We can define two policies between which a species can make its
choice. It may produce a vast number of eggs, which will then be
pretty sure to be small and ill furnished with yolk. The young will
hatch out early, long before their development is complete, and must
migrate at once in search of food. They will, especially if the adult is
slow moving or sedentary, be furnished with simple and temporary
organs of locomotion, and will generally be utterly unlike the parent.
The majority will perish early, but one here and there will survive to
carry on the race.

Or the parent may produce a few eggs at a time, stock them well
with yolk, and perhaps watch over them, or even hatch them within

! Dreyssensia and Cordylophora are examples of animals which seem to have quite
recently become adapted to fresh-water life and have not yet lost their locomotive
larvee. Many instances could be quoted ‘of marine forms which have oewonn: fluvia-
tile. The converse is, I believe, comparatively rare.
490 LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS.

her own body. The young will in such cases complete their devel-
opment as embryos, and when hatched will resemble the parent in
everything but size.

Which policy is adopted will largely depend upon the number of the
family and the capital at command. There are animals which are like
well-to-do people, who provide their children with food, clothes, school-
ing, and pocket money. Their fortunate offspring grow at ease and
are not driven to premature exercise of their limbs or wits. Others
are like starving families, which send the children, long before their
growth is completed, to hawk matches or newspapers in the streets.

In biology we have no sooner laid down a principle than we begin to
think of exceptions. The exceptions may be apparent only; they
may, when fully understood, confirm instead of disturbing the general
principle. But this rarely happens unless the principle is a sound one.
Execeptio probat regulam; it is the exception which tests the rule, to
give a new application to an old maxim.

Parasites form one group of exceptions to our rule. Whether they
pass their free stages in air, water, or earth, whether their hosts are
marine, fluviatile, or terrestrial, they are subject to strange transforma-
tions, which may be repeated several times in the same life history.
The change from one host to another is often a crisis of difficulty.
Many fail to accomplish it. Those which succeed do so by means of
some highly peculiar organ or instinct, which may be dropped as
quickly as it is assumed. The chances of failure often preponderate
to such an extent that an enormous number of eggs must be liberated.
Even a brief parasitism may produce a visible effect upon the life
history. The young Unio or Anodon attaches itself for a short time to
some fish or tadpole. To this temporary parasitism is due, as I sup-
pose, the great number of eggs produced, and a degree of metamor-
pbosis unusual in a fresh-water mollusk.

The cephalopoda, which are wholly marine, and the vertebrates,
whatever their habitat, very rarely exhibit anything which can be
called transformation. Some few cases of vertebrate transformation
will be discussed later. Cephalopods and vertebrates are large, strong,
quick-witted animals, able to move fast, and quite equal in many cases
to the defense of themselves and their families. They often produce
few young at a time and take care of them (there are many examples
to the contrary among cephalopods and fishes). They are generally
able to dispense with armor, which would have indirectly favored
transformation.

Echinoderms, which are all marine, develop with metamorphosis.
There is an interesting exception in the echinoderms with marsupial
development, which develop directly and give an excellent illustration
of the effect of parental care.

Insects, which as terrestrial animals should lay a few large oggs,
and develop directly, furnish the most familiar and striking of all

transformations. I have already discussed this case at greater length
than is possible just now.'! I have pointed out that the iess specialized
insect larvee, e. g., those of orthoptera, make a close approach to some
wingless adult insects, such as the thysanura, as well as to certain
myriopods. Fritz Miiller seems to me to be right in saying that the
larve of nonmetamorphic insects come nearer than any winged insect
to primitive tracheates. The transformation of the bee, moth, or blow-
fly is transacted after the stage in which the normal tracheate structure
is attained, and I look upon it as a peculiar adult transformation, hav-
ing little in common with the transformations of echinoderms, mollusks,
or crustaceans.

In the same way I believe that some amphibia have acquired an
adult transformation. Frogs and toads, having already as tadpoles
attained the full development of the more primitive amphibia, change
to lung-breathing, tailless, land-traversing animals, able to wander
from the place of their birth to seek out mates from other families, and
to lay eggs in new sites.

Meduse furnish a third example of adult transformation which
seems to find its explanation in the sedentary habit of the polyp,
which probably nearly approaches the primitive adult stage. But
here the case is further complicated, for the polyp still proceeds from
a planula, which is eminently adapted for locomotion, though per-
haps within a narrower range. We have two migratory stages in the
life history. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. ‘The
planula, from its small size, is less liable to be devoured, or stranded,
or dashed to pieces, but it can not travel far; the medusa may cross
wide seas, but it is easily captured and is often cast up upon a beach
in countless multitudes.

Adult transformation may be recognized by its occurrence after the
normal structure of the group has been acquired, and also by its spe-
cial motive, which is egg laying and all that pertains to it; the special
motive of larval transformation is dispersal for food.

The reproduction of the common eel has been a mystery ever since
the days of Aristotle, though a small part of the story was made out
- even in ancient times. It was long ago ascertained that the eel, which
seeks its food in rivers. descends to the sea in autumn or early winter,
and that it never spawns, nor even becomes mature, in fresh waters.
The eels which descend to the sea never return, but young eels or
elvers come up from the sea in spring, millions at atime. The elvers
have been seen to travel along the bank of ariver in a continuous band
or eel-rope, which has been known to glide upward for fifteen days
together. It was of course concluded that spawning and early devel-
opment took place in the sea during the interval between the autumn
and spring migration, but no certain information came to hand till
1896. Meanwhile this gap in our knowledge was a perplexity, almost a

492, LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS.

reproach to zoologists. The partially-known migration of the eel could
not be harmonized with the ordinary rule of migratory fishes. We
tried to explain the passage of marine fishes into rivers at spawning
time by the supposition (a true supposition, as I think) that the river is
less crowded than the shallow seas, and therefore a region in which
competition is less severe. The river is to some migratory fishes what
the tundras of Siberia are to some migratory birds, places compara-
tively free from dangerous enemies, and therefore fit for the rearing of
the helpless young. But the eel broke the rule and cast doubt upon
the explanation. The salmon, sturgeon, and lamprey feed and growin
the sea and enter rivers to spawn. The eel feeds and grows in rivers
but enters the sea to spawn. What possible explanation could meet
cases thus diametrically opposite?

This was the state of matters when Grassi undertook to tell us that
part of the history of the eel which is transacted in the sea. When it
leaves the river it makes its way to very deep water and there under-
goes achange. The eyes enlarge and become circular instead of ellip-
tical; the pectoral fins and the border of the gill cover turn black; the
reproductive organs, only to be discovered by microscopic search before
this time, enlarge. The eels, thus altered in appearance and structure,
lay their eggs in water of not less than 250 fathoms depth. The upper
limit of the spawning ground is nearly three times as far from sea level
as the 100-fathom line, which we arbitrarily quote as the point at which
the deep sea begins. The eggs, which are large for a fish (2.7 millime-
ters diameter), float, but do not rise. The young which issue from them
are quite unlike the eels of our rivers; they are tapelike, transparent,
colorless, devoid of red blood, and armed with peculiar teeth. A num-
ber of different kinds of such fishes had been previously known to the
naturalist as Leptocephali. Giinther had conjectured that they were
abnormal larvee, incapable of further development. Grassi has, how-
ever, succeeded in proving that one of these Leptocephali (L. breviros-
tris) is simply a larval eel; others are larvee of congers and various
murenoid fishes. He has with infinite pains compared a number of
Leptocephali, and coordinated their stages, making out some particu-
larly important ones by the direct observation of live specimens.

You will not unnaturally ask how Grassi or anybody else can tell
what goes on in the sea at a depth of over 250 fathoms. His inquiries
were carried on at Messina, where the local circumstances are very
fortunate. Strong currents now and then boil up in the narrow strait,
Sweeping to the surface eggs, larvee, and a multitude of other objects,
which at ordinary seasons lie undisturbed in the tranquil depths. Fur-
ther information has been got by dredging, and also by opening the
body of a sunfish (Orthagoriscus mola), which at certain times of the
year is taken at the surface and is always found to contain a number
of Leptocephali. When a Leptocephalus has completed its first stage
ot growth it ceases to feed, loses bulk, and develops pigment on the
surface of the body. At the same time the larval teeth are cast and
LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS. = AYR

the larval skeleton is replaced. Then the fish begins to feed again,
comes to the surface, enters the mouth of a river, and, if caught, is
immediately recognized as an elver or young eel. It is now a year old
and about 2 inches long.

This history suggests a question. Are the depths of the sea free
from severe competition? The darkness, which must be nearly or alto-
gether complete, excludes more than the bare possibility of vegetation.
A seanty subsistence for animals is provided by the slowly decomposing
remains of surface life. When the dredge is sunk so low, which does
not often happen, it may bring up now and then a peculiar and specially
modified inhabitant of the dark and silent abyss. There can not, we
should think, be more than the feeblest competition where living things
are so few and the mode of life so restricted. Going a step further, we
might predict that deep-sea animals would lay few eggs at a time, and
that these would develop directly—i. e., without transformation. The
risk of general reasoning about the affairs of living things is so great
that we shall hold our conjectures cheap unless they are confirmed by
positive evidence. Happily, this can be supplied. The voyage of the
Challenger has yielded proof that the number of species diminishes
with increasing depth, and that below 300 fathoms living things are few
indeed.! Dr. John Murray gives us the result of careful elaboration of
all the facts now accessible, and tells us that the majority of the abyssal
species develop directly.’

We seem, therefore, to have some ground for believing that the depths
of the sea resemble the fresh waters in being comparatively free from
enemies dangerous to larvie. The eel finds a safe nursery in the depths,
and visits them for the same reason that leads some other fishes to
enter rivers. It may be that the depths of the sea are safer than
' rivers, in something like the same degree and for the same reasons that
rivers are safer than shallow seas. But we must be careful not to go
too fast. It may turn out that deep recesses in the shallower seas—
holes of limited extent in the sea bottom—enjoy an immunity from
dangerous enemies not shared by the great and continuous ocean floor.?

After this short review of the facts I come to the conclusion that the
general rule which connects the presence or absence of transformation
with habitat is well founded, but that it is apt to be modified and even
reversed by highly special circumstances. The effect of habitat may,
for instance, be overruled by parasitism, parental care, a high degree
of organization, or even by a particular trick inegg laying. The direct
action of the medium is probably of little consequence. Thus the
difference between fresh and salt water is chiefly important because it
prevents most species from passing suddenly from one to the other.

But the abyssal and the fluviatile faunas have much in common, as
also have the littoral and the pelagic faunas. Relative density and
continuity of population seem to be of vital importance, and it is chiefly
these that act upon the life history.

In zoology, as in history, biography, and many other studies, the
most interesting part of the work is only to be enjoyed by those who
look into the details. To learn merely from text-books is notoriously
dull. The text-book has its uses, but, like other digests and abridg-
ments, it can never inspire enthusiasm. It is the same with most lec-
tures. Suppose that the subject is that well-worn topic, the alternation
of generations. The name recalls to many of us some class room of
our youth, the crudely colored pictures of unlikely animals which hung
on the walls, and the dispirited class, trying to write down from the
lecture the irreducible minimum which passes a candidate. The lec-
turer defines his terms and quotes his examples; we have Salpa, and
Aurelia, and the fern, and as many more as time allows. How can he
expect to interest anybody in a featureless narrative, which gives no
fact with its natural circumstances, but mashes the whole into pemmi-
can? What student goes away with the thought that it would be good
and pleasant to add to the heap of known facts? The heap seems
needlessly big already. And yet every item in that dull mass was
once deeply interesting, moving all naturalists and many who were not
naturalists to wonder and delight. The alternation of generations
worked upon men’s minds in its day like Swammerdam’s discovery of
the butterfly within the caterpillar, or Trembley’s discovery of the bud-
divg Hydra, which, when cut in two made two new animals, or Bonnet’s
discovery that an Aphis could bring forth living young without having
ever met another individual of its own species. AJ] these wonders of
nature have now been condensed into glue. But we can at any time
rouse in the minds of our students some little of the old interest if we
will only tell the tale as it was told for the first time.

Adalbert Chamisso, who was in his time court page, soldier, painter,
traveler, poet, novelist, and botanist, was the son of a French nobleman.
When he was 9 years old he and all the rest of the family were driven
out of France by the French Revolution. Chamisso was educated any-
_ how, and tried many occupations before he settled down to botany and
light literature. In 1815 he embarked with Eschscholtz on the Russian
voyage round the world, commanded by Kotzebue. The two natura-
lists (for Chamisso is careful to associate Eschscholtz with himself, and
even to give him priority) discovered a highly curious fact concerning the
Salpe, gelatinous tunicates which swim at the surface of the sea, some-
times in countless numbers. There are two forms in the same species,
which differ in anatomical structure, but especially in this, that one is
solitary, the other composite, consisting of many animals united into a
chain which may be yards long. Chamisso and Eschscholtz ascer-
tained that the solitary form produces the chain form by internal bud-
ding, while the chain form is made up of hermaphrodite animals which
LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS. 495

reproduce by fertilized eggs.! There is thus, to use Chamisso’s own
words, ‘“‘an alternation of generations. * * * It is as if a cater-
pillar brought forth a butterfly, and then the butterfly a caterpillar.”
Here the phrase “bring forth” is applied to two very different processes,
viz, sexual reproduction and budding. Chamisso’s phrase, ‘“ alterna-
tion of generations,” is not exact. Huxley would substitute ‘“ alterna-
tion of generation with gemmation,” and if for shortness we use the old
term, it must be with this new meaning. Subsequent investigation,
besides adding many anatomical details, has confirmed one interesting
particular in Chamisso’s account, viz, that the embryo of Salpa is
nourished by a vascular placenta.? The same voyage yielded also the
discovery of Appendicularia, a permanent tunicate tadpole, and the first
tadpole found in any tunicate.

Some ten years after the publication of Chamisso’s alternation of
generations in Salpa, a second example was found in a common jelly-fish
(Aurelia). Not a few hydrozoa had by this time been named, and
shortly characterized. Some were polyps, resembling the Hydra of our
ponds, but usually united into permanent colonies; others were meduse,
bell-shaped animals which swim free in the upper waters of the sea.
It was already suspected tliat both polyps and medusz had a common
structural plan, and more than one naturalist had come very near to
knowing that medusz may be the sexual individuals of polyp colonies.

This was the state of matters when an undergraduate in theology of
the University of Christiania, named Michael Sars, discovered and
described two new polyps, to which he gave the names, now familiar to
every zoologist, of Scyphistoma and Strobila. In the following year
(1830) Sars settled at Kinn, near Bergen, as parish priest, and betook
himself to the lifelong study of the animals of the Norwegian seas. He
soon found out that his Scyphistoma was merely an earlier stage of his
Strobila. Scyphistoma has a Hydra-like body less than half an inch
long and drawn out into a great number of immensely long tentacles.
It buds laterally like a Hydra, sending out stolons or runners, which
bear new polyps, and separate before long, the polyps becoming inde-
pendent animals. In the midst of the tentacles of the seyphistoma is
a prominence which bears the mouth.. This grows upward into a tall
column, the strobila, which is supported below by the scyphistoma.
When the strobila is well nourished it divides into transverse slices,
which at length detach themselves and swim away.’ These are the

'Brooks maintains that the solitary Salpa, which is female, produces a chain of
males by budding, and lays an egg in each. These eggs are fertilized while the
chain is still immature, and develop into females (solitary Salp). The truth of
this account must be determined by specialists.

?Cuvier had previously noted the fact.

3Leuckart (Zeits. f. wiss. Zool., Bd. THI, p. 181) remarks that elongate animals
tend to divide transversely or to bud axially, while broad animals tend to divide
longitudinally or to bud laterally. The question has been raised more than once
whether the division of the strobila is not really a case of budding. Leuckart shows
that budding and fission can not be separated by any definition; they pass insensibly
into one another. (Wagner’s Handb. d. Physiol., art. ‘“‘ Zeugung.’’)
496 LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS.

ephyre, which had been found in the sea before Sars’s time, and were
then counted as a particular kind of adult medusze. They are small,
flat discs with eight lobes or arms, all notched at the extremity. A
pile of ephyre is produced by the transverse constriction and division
of the strobila in a fashion which reminds us of the rapid production of
the animals in a Noah’s ark by the slicing of a piece of wood of suitable
sectional figure. It was thus ascertained that the scyphistoma, strobila,
and ephyra are successive stages of one animal, but for a time no one
could say where the scyphistoma came from, nor what the ephyra
turned to. At length Sars, aided by the anatomical researches of
Ehrenberg and Siebold, was able to clear up the whole story. The
ephyra is gradually converted by increase of size and change of form
into an Aurelia, a common jelly-fish which swarms during the summer
‘in European seas. The aurelia is of two sexes, and the eggs of the
female give rise to ciliated embryos, which had been seen before Sars’s
time, but wrongly interpreted as parasites or diminutive males. These
ciliated embryos, called planulz, swim about for a time and then settle
down as polyps (scyphistomata). There is thus a stage in which
aurelia divides without any true reproductive process, and another
stage in which it produces fertile eggs. ‘There is alternation of genera-
tions in aurelia as well as in salpa, and Sars was glad to fortify by a
fresh example the observations of Chamisso, on which doubts had been
cast.

It was not long before the alternation of generations was recognized
in hydromeduse also, and then the ordinary hydrozoan colony was seen
to consist of at least two kinds of polyps, one sexual, the other merely
nutrient, both being formed by the budding of a single polyp. The
sexual polyp, or medusa, either swims away or remains attached to the
colony, producing at length fertilized eggs, which yield planule, and
these in turn the polyps which found new colonies.

Those of us who are called upon to tell this story in our regular course
of teaching should not forget to produce our scyphistoma, strobila, and
ephyra. The interest is greatly enhanced it they are shown alive. It is
not hard to maintain a flourishing marine aquarium, even in an inland
town, and a scyphistoma may be kept alive in an aquarium for years.
budding out its strobila every spring.

Alternation of generations when first announced was taken to be a
thing mysterious and unique. Chamisso brought in the name, and
explained that he meant by it a metamorphosis accomplished by suc-
cessive generations, the form of the animal changing not in the course
of an individual life, but from generation to generation (forma per gen-
erationes, nhequaquam in prole seu individuo, mutata). Sars adopted
Chamisso’s name and definition. Steenstrup a little later collected and
discussed all the examples which he could discover, throwing in a
number which have had to be removed again as not fairly comparable
with the life histories of Salpa and Aurelia. He emphasized the alter-

nation of budding with egg production and the unlikeness .n form of
the asexual and sexual stages. Like Chamisso, he carefully distin-
guished between development with metamorphosis and alternation of
generations. All three naturalists, Chamisso, Sars, and Steenstrup,
laid stress on this point. In an insect, they would have said, there is
development with metamorphosis. The same animal passes from larva
to pupa, and from pupa to imago. In Aurelia or Salpa, however, the
animal which lays eggs is not the animal which buds, but its progeny.
The cycle of the life history includes two generations and many
individuals.
This view has spread very widely, and if we were to judge by what
is commonly taught I think that we should recognize this as the doce-
trine now prevalent. It is, however, in my opinion, far inferior as an
explanation of the facts to that adopted by Leuckart, Carpenter, and
Huxley, who regard the whole cycle, from egg to egg, as one life
history. Huxley and Carpenter, differing in this from Leuckart, do
not shrink from calling the whole product of the egg an animal, even
though it consists of a multitude of creatures which move about and
seek their food in complete independence of one another. Rather than
ignore the unity of the life history of Aurelio or Salpa, they would
adopt the most paradoxical language. This attitude was forced upon
them by the comparative method. ‘They refused to study Aurelia, for
example, as an animal apart. It had its near and its remoter relatives.
Among these is the fresh-water Hydra, which develops without trans-
formation, buds off other hydras when food is plentiful, and at length
becomes sexually mature. Budding is here a mere episode, which
may be brought in or left out, according to circumstances. The same
individual polyp which buds afterwards produces eggs. The life
history of Salpa can not be traced with equal facility to a simple
beginning, for it presents points of difficulty on which the learned
differ. In the polychet worms, however, we find a beautiful gradation
leading up to alternation of generations. We begin with gradual
addition of new segments and increasing specialization of the two ends
of the body, the fore end becoming nonreproductive and the hinder
end reproductive. Then we reach a stage (syllis) in which the repro-
ductive half breaks off from the fore part and forms (after separation)
a new head, while the fore part adds new segments behind. In Auto-
lytus the new head forms before separation, and many worms may
cohere for a time, forming a long chain with heads at intervals. In
Myrianida the worms break up first and afterwards become sexually
mature. We should gather from these cases that alternation of gen-
erations may arise by the introduction of a budding stage into a devel-
opment with transformation. The polyp or worm buds while young
and lays eggs at a later time. The separation of the two processes of
reproduction often becomes complete, each being restricted to its own
place in the life history. As arule the worm or polyp will bud while

its structure is uncomplicated by reproductive organs. It is easy to
propagate some plants by cutting one of the leaves into sections and
making every section root itself and grow into a new plant, but we can
seldom do the same thing with a flower. There may, therefore, be a
distinct advantage to particular animals and plants in dividing the
life history into two stages—an earlier budding and a later egg-laying
stage.

The advantage to be drawn from budding is easily seen in those
animals which find it hard to gain access to a favorable site. Thus a
Tenia! is very lucky when it establishes itself in the intestine. Once
there, it goes on budding indefinitely. It is harder to trace the
advantage in the case of many polyps, though some (Cunina, etc.)
admit of the same explanation as Tania. There are yet other cases
(some worms, salpz, etc.) in which our ignorance of the conditions of
life renders a satisfactory explanation impossible at present.

The budded forms often differ in structure from the budding forms
which produce them, and many writers and teachers make this differ-
ence part of the definition of alternation of generations. I think that
Leuckart has suggested a probable explanation in his essay of 1851,”
which is still thoroughly profitable reading. He attributes the pecul-
larities of the larva mainly to the circumstance that it is turned out at
an early age to shift for itself. In the budded forms there is no such
necessity. The parent has established itself on a good site which com-
mands a sufficiency of food. Until it has done this, it does not bud at
all. The young which it produces asexually need not disperse in
infancy, at least until crowding sets in. The tradesman who has
founded a business puts his elder boys into the shop; perhaps the
younger ones may be obliged to try their luck in a distant town. The
budded forms, reared at the cost of the parent, may therefore omit the
early larval stages at least, and go on at once to a later or even to the final
stage. Thus the head of Tenia, when it has fixed itself in the intestine,
produces sexual segments; the redia of Distomum produces cercarize
or more rediz, omitting the locomotive embryo; the scyphistoma pro-
duces ephyre. The saving of time must often be great, and the days
saved are days of harvest. Think how much a tree would lose if in
the height of summer it were unable to bud, and could only propagate
by seeds. If the budded forms are sexual, while the budding forms are
not, there is an obvious explanation of the difference in form. Even
where there is no such fundamental difference in function, the circum-
stances of early life are very different, and may well produce an unlike-
ness upon which natural selection may found a division of labor.

No one who tries to trace origins can rest satisfied with Steenstrup’s

account of alternation of generations. He makes no effort to show how
it came about. Instead of considering alternation of generations as a
peculiar case of development with metamorphosis, complicated by
asexual reproduction,! he considers asexual reproduction as a peculiar
case of alternation of generations.? He ignores all the facts which show
that the alternation may have been gradually attained, an omission
which is only excusable when we note that his treatise is dated 1842.
He asserts dogmatically that there is no transition from metamorphosis
to alternation of generations.

It is impossible to think much on this subject without falling into
difficulties over the word generation. For my own part I believe that
such words as generation, individual, organ, larva, adult can not be
used quite consistently in dealing with a long series of animals whose
life histories vary gradually and without end. Ordinary language,
which was devised to meet the familiar and comparatively simple course
of development of man and the domestic animals, is not always appro-
priate to lower forms, with complex and unusual histories. If we are
resolved at all hazards to make our language precise and uniform, we
either fall into contradictions, or else use words in unnatural senses.

Certain recent discussions render it necessary to point out that there
can be no alternation of generations without increase by budding. If
a single larva produces a single sexual animal, as when a pluteus
changes to an echinus, there is development with transformation, but
not alternation of generations.

It is, | think, of importance to be able to resolve so peculiar a phe-
nomenon as alternation of generations into processes which are known
to occur separately, and which may have arisen imperceptibly, becoming
eradually emphasized by the steady action of the conditions of life.
Kvery startling novelty that can thus be explained extends the applica-
tion of that principle which underlies the theory of naturai selection—
I mean the principle that a small force acting steadily through a long
time may produce changes of almost any magnitude.

The hydrozoa yield innumerable and varied examples of develop-
ment with transformation and also of buddizg. They yield also the
most admirable examples of division of labor. We have hydrozoan
colonies, such as a budding Hydra, in which all the members are pretty
much alike, but we soon advance to differentiation of the feeding and
the reproductive members. In the siphonophora the colony becomes
pelagic, and floats at the surface of the sea. Then the meduse no
longer break off and swim away, but are harnessed to the colony, and
drag it along. The colony may contain feeding polyps, which procure
and digest food for the rest; swimming bells, which are attached
meduse; perhaps a float, which is a peculiar kind of swimming bell;

1 This is a convenient short account of alternation of generations, but it will not
apply to every case. In Hydra, for instance, there is an ill-detined alternation of
generations, but no metamorphosis.

defensive polyps (which may be either batteries of nettling cells or
covering organs); and reproductive individuals. As the individuals
become subordinated to the colony, and lose essential parts of the
primitive structure, they pass insensibly into organs.

The life histories of invertebrates abound in complications and para-
doxes. Thus Hucharis, one of the ctenophors, becomes sexually mature
as a larva, but only in warm weather. This happens just after hatch-
ing, when the animal is of microscopic size. Then the sexual organs
degenerate, the larva, which has already reproduced its kind, grows to
full size, undergoes transformation, and at length becomes sexually
mature a second time.’ There is often a striking difference between
the early stages of animals which are closely related, or a strong adapt-
ive resemblance between animals which are of very remote blood rela-
tionship. In the hydrozoa similar polyps may produce very different
medusz, and dissimilar polyps meduse that can hardly be distinguished.
There are insects so like in their adult state that they can only be dis-
tinguished by minute characters, such as the form and arrangement of
the hairs on the legs, and yet the larve may be conspicuously different.’
Annelids and echinoderms yield fresh examples of the same thing. In
lepidoptera and sawflies the larve are very similar, but the winged
insects quite different. New stages may be added in one species, while
closely allied species remain unaffected. In Cunina and the diphyidee
we get combinations which strain the inventive powers of naturalists
even toname. Natural selection seems to act upon the various stages
of certain life histories almost as it acts upon species.

But the history is not always one of growing complexity. Some-
times, for example, a well-established medusa stage is dropped. First it
ceases to free itself, then the tentacles and marginal sense organs dis-
appear, then the mouth closes. In the fresh-water Cordylophora the
medusa is replaced by a stalked sac filled with reproductive elements
or embryos. The lucernarize present a single stage which seems to be
polyp and medusa in one. Hydra has no medusa. It is not always
clear whether such hydrozoa as these are primitive or reduced. Even
the hydroid polyp, the central stage in the normal hydrozoan life his-
tory, may be suppressed, and certain medusz in both of the chief
groups develop direct from the egg or planula (Pelagia, Geryonia,
Aigina, Oceania). There is no Binal common to all hydrozoa except
the egg. The same thing may be said of the tunicates.

The life history of many arthropods is to all appearance quite sim-
ple. There emerges from the egg a spider, scorpion, or centipede (in
most chilopoda) which merely grows bigger and bigger till it is adult.
But if, as in most crustacea, the circumstances of the species call for a

2Some species of Chironomus are referred to.

*Baron Osten Sacken (Berl. Entom. Zeits., Bd. XXXVII, page 465) gives two cases
of diptera, in which ‘almost similar larvee produce imagos belonging to different
families.”
LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS. - 501

migratory stage, such a stage will be added. In certain decapod crus-
tacea (Peneus, Leucifer) a nauplius and as many as five other stages
may intervene before the final or adult stage. Some of these larval
stages are common to a great many crustacea, but none, aS we now
think, belong to the original phylogeny. Ifa resting or a winged stage
is wanted, it is Supplied just as easily—witness the holometabolic insects.
Here again, so far as we know, there is nothing absolutely new.! The
stages which seem new are merely exaggerations for special purposes
of sections of the life history, which were originally marked out by
nothing more important than a change of skin and a swelling out of the
body. Let us not suppose for a moment that it is a law of insect devel-
- opment that there should be larva, pupa, and imago, or that it is a law
of crustacean development that there should be six distinct stages
between the egg and the adult. Any of these stages may be dropped,
if it proves useless—either totally suppressed, or telescoped, so to
speak, into the embryonic development. Lost stages are indicated by
the embryonic molts of some centipedes and spiders, Limulus, many
crustacea, and Podura. The parthenogenetic reproduction of some
immature insects, such as Miastor, shows a tendency to suppress later
stages. Perhaps the wingless thysanura are additional examples,
but here, as in the case of Hydra and Lucernaria, we do not certainly
know whether they are primitive or reduced. It seems to be easy
to add new stages, when circumstances (and especially parasitism)
call for them. Meloe, Sitaris, and Epicauta are well-known examples.
In some ephemeride the molts, which are potential stages, become
very numerous, but as a curious exception to a very general rule, the
last molt of all, which is usually so important, may be practically
suppressed. The fly of an Hphemera may mate, lay eggs, and die,
while still enveloped in its last larval skin.

Among the many cases of what one is inclined to call rapid adapta-
tion to circumstances (the chief indications of rapidity being the very
partial and isolated occurrence of remarkable adaptive characters) are
those which Giard? has collected and compared, and which he refers to
a process called by him pecilogony. A number of very different ani-
mals* produce according to habitat, or season, or some other condition
closely related to nutrition, eggs of more than one sort, which differ in
the quantity of nourishment which they contain and in the degree of °
transformation which the issuing larva is destined to undergo. The
analogy with the summer and winter eggs of Daphnia, etc., can not
escape notice, and Giard connects with all these the pedogenesis
of Miastor and Chironomus, and many cases of heterogony. For
our immediate purpose it is sufficient to remark that the reproductive

processes and the course of development are as liable to vary for motives
of expediency as the form of a leg or fin. The supposed constancy (the
necessary constancy according to some naturalists) of the embryonic
stages throughout large groups would not be hard to break down, if it
were to be again asserted. Probably the doctrine is now totally aban-
doned; it belongs to that phase of zoological knowledge in which Meckel
could declare that every higher animal passes in the course of its devel-
ment through a series of stages which are typified by adult animals of
lower grade, and when an extreme partisan, far inferior to Meckel both
in experience and caution, could affirm that the human embryo omits
no single lower stage.

The tadpole larva, which is common in lower vertebrates and their
allies, shows the influence of adaptation as strongly as any larva that
we know. We may describe the tadpole as a long-tailed chordate,
which breathes by gills and has a suctorial mouth disk, at least during
some part of its existence. It is a cheap form of larva, when reduced
to its lowest terms, requiring neither hard skeleton, nor limbs, nor neck,
yet it can move fast in water by means of its sculling tail. Sucha
tadpole appears in many life-histories, and plays many parts. ‘The tad-
pole is the characteristic tunicate larva, and in this group commonly
ends by losing its tail, and becoming fixed for life. But Salpa, which
is motile when adult, has lost its tadpole. Appendicularia has lost the
normal adult stage if it ever had one, and its tadpole becomes sexually
mature. The same thing seems to have happened to many amphibia,
whose tadpoles acquire legs, become sexually mature, and constitute
the normal adult stage. The lamprey, as Balfour and others have
recognized, is another kind of sexually mature tadpole. Thus the tad-
pole may act as larva to a sea squirt, fish (Acipenser, Lepidosteus,
Amida), or frog; it may also constitute the only remaining stage in the
free life-history.

The lower and smaller animals seem to show beyond others the prev-
alence of adaptive features. They offer visible contrivances of infinite
variety, while they are remarkable for the readiness with which new
stages are assumed or old ones dropped, and for their protean changes
of forms, which are so bewildering that many worms, for instance, can
not as yet be placed at all, while many larve give no clue to their
' parentage. These lower and smaller animals show beyond others a
tendency to multiply rapidly, and to break away from one another in
an early stage. The tendency is so strong in the microscopic protozoa
that it enters into the definition of the group. J ission, budding, alter-
nation of generations, and spore formation (as in Gregarina) are ulti-
mately due to the same tendency.

Weak animals are almost inevitably driven to scatter, and to make
up by their insignificance, their invisibility, and their powers of evasion
for the lack of power to resist. It is a great thing to a hydrozoan
colony that if one polyp is bitten off, others remain, that no enemy can
LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS. 503

possibly devour all the medusz liberated from one colony, or all the
planule liberated from one medusa. Low organization gives very
special facilities for extreme division. There are animals and plants
which multiply greatly as a consequence of being torn to pieces or
chopped small (chigoe, some fungi, etc.).

Small animals are usually short-lived. Many complete their life-
history in a few weeks. Those which last for so long as a year are
often driven, like annual plants, to adapt every detail of their existence
to the changing seasons. The naturalist who explores the surface
waters of the sea with a tow net soon learns that the time of year
determines the presence or absence of particular larve. It is probably
as important to an Aurelia as to a butterfly that it should tide over the
storms of winter by means of a sedentary and well-protected stage.
Any one who keeps scyphistoma in an aquarium will remark how small
it 1s, how it creeps into crevices or the hollows of dead shells.- But
when the depth of winter is past it pushes out its strobila, which in
spring liberates ephyre. These rapidly enlarge, and by August have
grown from microscopic disks to jelly-fishes a foot across.

The intelligence of many small animals is very low. They go on
doing the thing that they have been used to do, the thing that has
commended itself to the experience of many generations. They are
governed by routine, by that inherited and unconscious power of
response to external stimulus which we call instinet. But there are
some notable exceptions. Of all small animals. insects seem to show
the greatest flexibility of intelligence.

There is one large group of animals which is in striking contrast to
nearly all the rest. Vertebrates, and especially the higher vertebrates,
are usually big and strong. They rely upon skill, courage, or some
other product of high organizations rather than upon numbers and
fertility. Vertebrates swallow many other animals, together with their
living parasites, but are rarely swallowed alive or fresh by invertebrates.
This fact of nature has led to many consequences, among others to this,
that many parasites which pass their earlier stages in the bodies of
invertebrates only attain sexual maturity in a vertebrate host. The
complexity of the structure of a vertebrate precludes the possibility of
multiplication by breaking-up or budding, and they multiply only by
egg-laying or strictly analogous processes. The higher vertebrates live
so long that the accidents of a particular year or a particular season
are not of vital importance. Hence seasonal transformation is almost
unknown; the quadruped or bird may choose the warm months for
rearing the family, or celebrate the pairing season by getting a new suit
of feathers, or grow a thicker coat against the cold of winter, but that
is all. No vertebrates perish regularly at the approach of winter,
leaving only batches of eggs to renew the species in spring, nor is their
structure profoundly modified by the events of the calendar (the frog
is a partial exception). One minor cause of transformation, which
504. LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS.

affects the life history of many polyps, worms, and insects is thus
removed. Vertebrates often take care of their young, and the higher
vertebrates bring forth few at atime. For this reason, among others,
they rarely afford examples of free larve. Such vertebrate larve as
we do find conform to the vertebrate type. It is often impossible to
predict what adult will develop from an invertebrate larve, but no one
could hesitate to rank an Ammocoetes, a Leptocephalus, or a tadpole
among the vertebrates.

It accords with this strength and mastery that vertebrates, and
especially the higher vertebrates, should be more stable, more conserv-
ative, less experimental than. other animals. They retain ancient
structures long after they have ceased to be useful. The gill clefts,
gill arches, and branchial circulation are good examples. Though not
functional in sauropsida and mammalia, they never fail to appear in
the course of the development. Yet the sauropsida and the mammalia
are positively known to go back to the earliest secondary and late pale-
ozoic times. [ver since the beginning of the secondary period at least,
every reptile, bird, and mammal has continued to pass through a stage
which seems obviously piscine, and of which no plausible explanation
has ever been offered, except that remote progenitors of these animals
were fishes. Could not natural selection, one is tempted to ask, have
straightened the course of development during lapses of time so vast
and have found out less roundabout ways of shaping the tongue bone
and the ossicles of the ear? Hither it costs nothing at all to pursue
the old route, or it costs nothing which a higher vertebrate will ever
miss. The second alternative seems to me the more likely. The sau-
ropsida and mammalia, in comparison with other animals, are particu-
larly well off, and like wealthy housekeepers they do not care what
becomes of the scraps. It is, I fancy, different with many fishes, which
show by their numerous eggs, the occasional presence of peculiar imma-
ture stages, and some other slight hints, that their life is a hard one.

The presence in the developing reptile, bird, or mammal of piscine
structures which are no longer useful has been ascribed to a principle
called recapitulation, and Haeckel lays it down as a fundamental bio-
genetical law that the development of the individual is an abbreviated
recapitulation of the developmentof therace. If I had time to discuss
the recapitulation theory, I should begin by granting much that the
recapitulationist demands—for instance, that certain facts in the devel-
opment of animals have an historical significance, and can not be
explained by mere adaptation to present circumstances; further, that
adaptations tend to be inherited at corresponding phases both in the
ontogeny and the phylogeny. I amonmy guard when he talks of laws,
for the term is misleading, and ascribes to what is a mere general state-
ment of observed facts the force of acommand. The so-called laws of
nature (a phrase to be avoided) may indeed enable us to predict what
will happen in a uew case, but only when the conditions are uniform
LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF ANIMALS. 505

and simple—a thing which is common in physics, but very rare in biol-
ogy. I diverge from him when he says that “each animal is compelled
to discover its parentage in its own development,” that ‘‘ every animal
in its own development repeats this history, and climbs up its own
genealogical tree.” When he declares that ‘the proof of the theory
depends chiefly on its universal applicability to all animals, whether
high or low in the zoological scale, and to all their parts and organs,” !
I feel persuaded that, if this is really so, the recapitulation theory will
never be proved at all. The development, so far as it has yet been
traced, of a Hydra, Peripatus, beetle, pond mussel, squid, Amphioxus,
chick, or mammal, tells us very little indeed of the history of the races
to which they belong. Development tells us something, I admit, and
that something is welcome, but it gives no answer at all to most of the
questions that we put. The development of a mammal, for instance,
brings to light what I take to be clear proof of a piscine stage; but the
stage or stages immediately previous can only be vaguely described as
vertebrate, and when we go back farther still all resemblance to par-
ticular adult animals is lost. The best facts of the recapitulationist
are striking and valuable, but they are much rarer than the thorough-
going recapitulationist admits; he has picked out all the big strawber-
ries, and put them at the top of the basket. I admit no sort of neces-
sity for the recapitulation of the events of the phylogeny in the devel-
opment of the individual. Whenever any biologist brings the word
“must” into his statement of the operations of living nature I look out
to see whether he will not shortly fall into trouble.

This hasty review of animal transformation reminds me how great is
the part of adaptation in nature. To many naturalists the study of
adaptations is the popular and superficial side of things; that which
they take to be truly scientific is some kind of index making. But we
should recognize that comparatively modern adaptations may be of
vital importance to the species, and particularly luminous to the stu-
dent because at times they show us nature at work.

I am accustomed to refer such adaptations to the process of natural
selection, though if. anyone claimed to explain them by another process
I should, for present purposes, cheerfully adopt a more neutral phrase.
There are, I believe, no limits to be assigned to the action of natural
selection upon living plants and animals. Natural selection can act
upon the egg, the embryo, the larva, and the resting pupa as well as
upon the adult capable of propagation. It can even influence the race
through individuals which are not in the line of descent at all, such as
adults past bearing or the neuters of a colony. The distinction
between historical and adaptive, palingenetic and ccenogenetic, is rela-
tive only, a difference not of kind but of degree. All features are

and skill.

adaptive, but they may be adapted to a past rather than to a present
state of things; they may be ancient, and deeply impressed upon the
organization of the class.

In biology facts without thought are nothing; thought without facts
is nothing; thought applied to concrete facts may come to something _
when time has sorted out what is true from what is merely plausible.
The reports of this association will be preserved here and there: in
great libraries till a date when the biological speculations of 1897 are
as extinct as the ptolemaic astronomy. If many years hence some
one should turn over the old volumes and light upon this long-forgotten
address, I hope that he will give me credit for having seen what was
coming. Except where the urgent need of brevity has for the moment
been too much for scientific caution I trust that he will find nothing
that is dogmatic or overconfident in my remarks.
THE ROYAL MENAGERIE OF FRANCE AND THE NATIONAL
MENAGERIE ESTABLISHED ON THE 14th OF BRUMAIRE
OF THE YEAR IT (NOVEMBER 4, 1793).

By Dr. E. T. Hamy.!

GENTLEMEN: It was a hundred years ago, within a few days, that
the National Convention, on a motion made by its committee on public
instruction, founded the Museum of Natural History. It was the 10th
of June, 1793; the proscribed Girondins were arousing the provinces,
the Vendean bands had taken possession of Saumur after a bloody day,
and the imperial army of Austria was bombarding Valenciennes and
reducing Condé. Yet, in the midst of these frightful disasters, at a
time when everything seemed irrevocably lost, there were found some
indomitable men, like Joseph Lakenal and Daubenton, sufficiently reso-
lute to brave the existing storm, sufficiently clear-sighted to prepare for
the future. The decree, of which they were the joint authors, profoundly
transformed the old Royal Garden of medicinal plants that Louis XIII
had formally created. In a short time, thanks to the feverish activity
_of the corps of professors that carried on the rejunevated establish-
ment, there was organized an extensive scheme of special instruction, |
embracing in its twelve courses the entire range of natural history and
its applications; a large library was brought together, a menagerie was
improvised, and at last the new galleries were ready to receive collec-
tions of every kind, found in convents or in the houses of émigrés, nota-
bly at Chantilly, at the Palais Royal, and at Saint- Victor.

These various developments of the new museum, which had been
planned as far back as 1790 by a group of scientific men composed of
Daubenton, Fourcroy, Thouin, Jussieu, and others, rapidly formed upon
this foundation a sort of metropolis of natural sciences.

All of its institutions have been copied in the various countries of the
globe, but one of them has caused the others to be almost forgotten.
This one has remained up to the present time one of the best known
and the most popular in France. It is at once suggested when we speak
of the Jardin des Plantes: I refer to the menagerie of Etienne Geoftroy-
Saint-Hilaire and of Frederic Cuvier.

It is concerning this celebrated institution that I wish to speak to
you. It is its beginning that I propose to recall on the occasion of the

centennial of the foundation of the museum of which it constitutes one
of the most important branches.

A menagerie, in the modern and scientific sense of the word, is above
all a vast laboratory in which, under conditions which he himself deter-
mines, the naturalist comes to observe and experiment. He studies, in
the animal whose external characteristics are already well known to
him, the manifestations of intelligence or instinct, the degree of docil-
ity, the kind of alimentation, its endurance of captivity or of climate,
everything that may by careful observation lead to an extension of the
boundaries of human knowledge.' He studies also the modifications
due to age and sex, and those which are due to a change of environ-
ment continued for a considerable time. He may, by appropriate
unions, fix a useful or curious character; or he may, by crossing species
or races, produce hybrids or mongrels, and thus approach a solution of
great zoological problems which occasion much controversy at the
present time. ;

By his side the artist will reproduce, with the pencil, the brush, the
modeling stick, the forms and attitudes of the animals that are living
before his eyes in the cages or in the paddocks, and when they finally
die the anatomist comes to complete with his scalpel, and above all with
his microscope, the descriptions and the comparisons of his predecessors,
while the taxidermist seeks in studying the relief of the muscular masses
the sure means of establishing for the museum collections the true forms
of the animals.

Such is the course of affairs in modern scientific establishments of
which the centenarian menagerie of the museum is the prototype.

I hardly need to say that it is only by gradual degrees, because of
the slow progress of biology, that an establishment of so deeply a
scientific character as this has been enabled to prevail.

The first centuries of our history knew no other collections of animals
than those of the troops of savage beasts that the Romans, and after
them the Franks, used in the arena.” Methodically starved, artfully
irritated, these unhappy captives rushed at each other in furious com-
bats, to the great joy of the brutal and blood-thirsty spectators.

The taste for combats of animals lasted quite a long time in France;
the last of the Valois still had lion fights, and it was in one of these
fights, ordered by Francis I, that the brave Sieur de Lorges * descended
into the ring, cloak in hand and sword drawn, to pick up the glove
which the lady of his affections had dropped among the beasts in
order to test his valor.’

These lions and other exotic animals, collected only to satisfy a vain
love of display, were huddled together in some outbuilding belong-
ing to the royal residence. Philip VI, in 1333, had obtained in
the northeast corner of the old Louvre! a barn in which to keep his
wild beasts. There was under Charles V some “oyseaulx et bestes
estranges” at Conflans, an aviary and a menagerie at Tournelles, and
the rue des Lions-Saint-Paul has preserved the remembrance of its
noisy. guests, who at that time lodged in an annex to the hotel of that
name.”

With the fifteenth century more catholic tastes began to appear.
Animals of far-away countries were sought for parks, and the duc de
Berry, whom our regretted Jiuuce had named the Curious, possessed,
among other rare species at the chateau of Mehun-sur- Yévre, a drome-
dary, a chamois, and an ostrich.

The last years of Louis XI were fraught with something better for
practical zoology. In his gloomy manor of Touraine, where he was
confined by the disorder that was soon to destroy him, the sad King
attempted to enliven his solitude, and surrounded himself with new or
little-known animals that he caused to be brought together from all
parts. Commines explains these purchases made by his redoubtable
master by the need which he felt of making people talk of him and of
spreading abroad the good opinion which was prevalent concerning his
health and his strength. But Louis XI knew, when he thought proper,
how to direct his efforts to more effective ends than those which his
councillor attributes to mere caprice, and the very choice of the animals
brought to the royal menagerie—elk and reindeer from Scandinavia,
horses and mules from Spain and Sicily, Spanish or Barbary dogs,
Tunisian ostriches and falcons, canary birds and turtle doves from
Africa—shows that it was something more than meaningless curiosity
that animated the inhabitant of the manor at Plessis-les-Tours.

Louis XI had, as it seems to me, wider and more lofty views. I
imagine that that great mind thought, in its isolation, that it might be
possible to enrich the kingdom of France with some of those interesting
and useful animals of which numerous and choice specimens were
brought him at great expense from the south and north by Guillaume
Moire, Gabriel Bertran, Robert Sanze, and his other purveyors. Death
Surprised him in the midst of these efforts, and the only result of these
attempts at acclimation was the acquisition of that gentle musician, the
joy of the mansard, the popular singer from the Canaries, a quite unex-
pected legacy from the sad recluse of the manor of Plessis-les-Tours.?

Anne de Beaujeu had, it is said, all the tastes of her father; she was
fond of living animals, preferring those that were odd and strange; thus

it was, .n 1489, that she tried to obtain from Lorenzo de Medicis a
giraffe which Malfota, envoy of the Sultan of Egypt, Kaitbai, had two
years before brought to Florence. ‘‘C’est la beste du monde que j’ay
plus grand désir de veoir,” she pleasantly wrote to the prince, who had
promised her by letter this curious animal. Lorenzo did not keep his
word, and Anne had to content herself with seeing the giraffe—in a
picture.

The princely courts of Italy vied with each other in maintaining rare
and curious animals; it was one of the characteristic traits of the luxury
of that epoch. ‘A great prince,” writes Matarazzo, ‘‘ought to have
horses, dogs, mules, hawks, and other birds, buftoons, singers, and ani-
mals from distant lands.” And the great princes of France did as those
of Italy, whom they wished to imitate in everything—they kept buffoons,
singers, and animals. The menagerie was again established near the
Louvre, and there were sent out to great distances, to Tunis, Fez, etc.,
special missions to bring back horses, greyhounds, camels, ostriches, a
lion, an ounce, and a large number of birds intended for the chase and
for ornament. A consulin Egypt sent young leopards, and there were
also obtained bulls, bears, ete.

Natural history had just been revived in the west. Those who pur-
sued it in France doubtless profited by the varied instruction which
could be afforded by the royal collection, which grew richer every day.
And yet one fine morning, the 2lst of January, 1583, the entire
menagerie disappeared in a lamentable catastrophe.

The sick mind of the last of the Valois, filled with strange visions,
saw in a dream lions, bears, and dogs tearing his palpitating members.
Henry III then went and partook of the sacrament with the Bonshommes
of Nigeon, near Chaillot, and, returning to the Louvre, had all the lions,
bulls, bears,’ ete., killed with shots of arquebus. Thus ended, without
any profit to science or art, that royal menagerie that might have
served as a center for zoological studies in our country. It was more
than a century before there arose anyone to continue the work of Pierre
Gilles and Belon de Mans.

Henry IV eared littJe for wild animals. He only kept an elephant
that had been given him, and all his collection of 1591 could be put
upon the back of a horse.” Later, the Grand Seigneur having sent him
a tiger that strangled one of his dogs, he disposed of the ferocious beast,
which was exhibited for two sols, in the rue de la Harpe in May, 1607.
Louis XIII, on the contrary, had, at his hunting lodge at Versailles,
some animals, and especially birds, a collection that suggested later to
his son the construction of the celebrated Menagerie du Pare, illustrated
by the works of Perrault, Duverney, Oudry, and Desportes. It was
in 1663 that Louis XIV commented the first work upon this magnificent

establishment, and as early as 1664 had the Nuncio Chigi and the Doge
of Genoa visit the still-unfinished buildings.

At that time the menagerie was reached by the left branch of the
Traverse du Canal, leading from the Trianon. At the end of a fine
avenue of trees there was an entrance to a first court, which led to a
second one of an octagonal form, in the midst of which there arose the
little chateau of the Dauphine, with its grand salon, its subterranean
grotto, and two rich apartments. Around this radiated seven other
courts, closed with grills united with termini representing ‘‘some sub-
ject of metamorphosis.” There was the court of the Ostrich; the court
of the Aviary, in which there was an aviary “of extraordinary beauty
and magnificence;”” the court of Pelicans, with its reservoir quite filled
with fish; then again the court of the Basin or of the Pond, the court
of the Well, etc.; and beyond these symmetrical courts yet other courts,
called those of the Stags, of the Lion, of the Fowls, cages for ferocious
animals, an enormous dovecot that contained 3,000 pigeons, and at last
a farmhouse, with its dependencies and various buildings that served
as servants’ quarters.

As early as 1671 the menagerie began to be filled with the most
curious and varied animals. There was a certain Mosnier, or Le Mos-
nier, of Montpellier, who was the principal purveyor, while the officers
of the royal navy, the consuls (particularly the one at Cairo), governors
(like the one at Madagascar), sent in whatever they could find that was
curious.

A single consignment, for example, that arrived in 1688 comprised 194
animals from the Levant—13 ostriches and 137 of those sultana fowls
that we were trying vainly at that time to acclimate in France; a pelican,
Egyptian geese, egrets, etc., and finally 6 goats from the Thebaide.*

The menagerie at Versailles then possessed several thousand animals
more or less rare; an elephant, dromedaries, gazelles, a cassowary, and
later a number of wild beasts which had been brought from Vincennes,
then abandoned.

_ Oudry and Desportes took the portraits of the most curious of these
foreign guests at Versailles, and the Louvre possesses an enormous col-
lection of studies painted from nature by order of the King.

If an interesting animal died, Colson seized it for the museum, and
Claude Perrault made of it the most minute dissections; Perrault,
whom the scornful Boileau treated as a learned boaster, and who was
one of the most erudite physicians of his age and one of the founders
of comparative anatomy; Perrault, who, unappalled by the rigors of
one of the most severe winters that France had ever known, studied
the numerous victims that perished from cold in the cages at Versailles,

and who died at the age of 75 years a martyr to science from dissecting
a dromedary that had died of a contagious disease.

Duverney succeeded Perrault; he also was an anatomist of the first
rank, and the work of these two masters comprises documents of real
value to-day.

The sudden death of the Dauphine, who, at the close of the reign of
the grand monarch, was almost the only one who took any interest in the
menagerie, caused a neglect of this fine establishment and its exotic
inhabitants. Forty years later, when Rouille, minister of marine,
ottered to Louis XV a living bird of a new species, the court showed
some desire to see again the establishment that had been abandoned.
The Due de Luynes, who then visited it (1750), found it worth making
more use of, in good order, and with many animals.

It was no longer so when Louis XV, in his latter days, made a visit
to that quarter. A sort of superintendent who had charge of the
courts was then raising turkeys at the expense of the King. ‘Sir,”
said the monarch, ‘if that flock does not disappear I pledge my word
that I will break you at the head of your regiment!”

Other not less crying abuses were introduced into the menagerie,
forgotten at the foot of the park at Versailles. If we may believe
Mercier,! a dromedary, a sober dromedary, such as is found in the
deserts of Africa, cost the public every day six bottles of Burgundy
wine. And the common people of Paris, returning on the evening of
Whitsuntide by the boat from Sevres, after having seen the princes,
the procession of cooks, the park, and the menagerie, told the story of
a Swiss guard who had petitioned for the place left vacant by the death
of a dromedary.

These tales of the turkeys, the dromedary, and the Swiss guard
certainly contributed in a large degree to excite the popular fury
against the menagerie, which was pillaged from top to bottom during
the days of October, 1789.

Seven years earlier (July, 1782) Buffon had tried unsuccessfully to
transfer the last of its inhabitants to the Jardin du Roi, in which there
were only a few aquatic birds. It required a number of unforeseen and
peculiar circumstances to effect, one fine morning in November, 1793, a
concentration in a corner of the Jardin des Plantes of a group of
animals which formed the provisional menagerie of the new museum, a
menagerie soon after made permanent.

After the devastations of 1789 there remained at Versailles five
living animals that the pillagers had thought proper to leave alone—a
lion of Senegal and its companion a Dalmatian hound, an Indian
rhinoceros, a quagga from the Cape, and a bubalus sent by the Dey of
Algiers. There had also been saved from the disaster a very beautiful
crown pigeon from the Molluceas.

Couturier, the registrar general of the domains of Versailles, Marly,

and Meudon, wrote on the 19th of September, 1792, to Bernardin de
Saint Pierre, who had been appointed intendant of the Jardin des
Plantes two months and a half before, to inform him that the old
Menagerie was going to be destroyed,’ saying that the minister had
authorized him to send to the intendant anything he might want of
the few animals that were still alive, and it seemed necessary for him
to journey to Versailles. Bernardin set out, in fact, with Thouin and
Desfontaines, and visited in their courts the subjects whose skins and
skeletons had been offered him for mounting. He saw that a better
use could be made of them, and appropriating as his own one of the
most recent ideas of the council of officers of the Jardin du Roi, of
the month of August, 1790, he proposed to transport what he calls a
“nublic show” into ‘‘a place set aside for the study of nature, in the
interests of sciences and the liberal arts, for scientists and for artists.”

Such was the subject of the ‘‘Memoir on the necessity of uniting
the menagerie with the national Jardin des Plantes at Paris,” which
appeared at the end of January, 1793. In it the author shows at
length the services which an establishment of this kind might render,
dissertating meanwhile, so as not to get out of the habit of it, on the
influence captivity has on the character of living beings; on the socia-
bility of the lion and the rhinoceros; on the interbreeding of wild and
domestic animals; on the migration and acclimatization of animals; on
the connection that ought to exist between a garden and a menagerie,
etc. Then, after having easily refuted some objections that he himself
raised, he concludes by proposing to take the animals, together with
the cages they occupy, and to install the whole at the Nouveaux Con-
vertis, that ancient monastery of which the maison Cheyvreul is the last
vestige.

Vhe Mémoire sur la Ménagerie was at the same time a request
addressed to the convention; it helped perhaps to bring the Jardin des
Plantes to the attention of some members of that assembly who were
friends of science. But whatever we may say of that pamphlet, it was
not that which a few days later started, in a strange and unexpected
manner, the formation of the menagerie,’ formally established twenty
months later. I will recount the facts as they are given in the original
documents.

On the 13th of Brumaire of the year II (November 3, 1793) a decree
was issued by the department of the police, signed by the administra-
tors Baudrais and Soules, directing that the living animals then being
exhibited on the Place de la Revolution and at some other places in
Paris be immediately taken to the Jardin des Plantes, where they
would be purchased, together with the cages which contained them.

1They were going to make of it a breeding stable.

514 THE ROYAL MENAGERIE OF FRANCE.

The owners were also to receive an indemnity which would enable them
“to get a living in some other manner.”

Toussaint Charbonnier, commissary of police of the section of the
Tuileries received the next day, the 14th of Brumaire (November 4),
the first order of execution, and accompanied by the commissary of the
civil committee for the section went to the Place de la Revolution.
There, ‘‘on the left after leaving the Pont Tournant,” he found in a
booth the said Dominique Marchini, who was exhibiting a sea lion, a
leopard, a civet cat, and a little monkey, and after having noted the
observations of the said Marchini and those of his boy, Remi Amet, he
conducted the animals and men to the committee and turned all of them
over to the citizen corporal of the guard at the station of Rue St.
Nicaise to be taken after the manner of a caravan to the Jardin des
Plantes. .

Great flutter was at the Museum, where no inquiries had been made,
and where no one had been warned of the approach of these unexpected
guests. The professor in charge of the Museum was a young man, 21
years old, appointed five months before, who was just beginning his
career in both science and teaching, Etienne Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire.
Being a man of action, he rose to the occasion and began arranging the
cages one after the other under the windows of the Museum, while
awaiting the orders of the committee of public instruction.’ This was
his first menagerie. _

Desfontaines, the secretary of the Museum, wrote next day to the
president of the committee to ask instructions. ‘There is, under the
galleries,” he said, ‘‘a place where these animals can be provisionally
lodged while we are preparing suitable quarters for them, and this
place is even large enough to hold a greater number, if others are
brought, and if the committee of public instruction should think proper
to keep them. There is no doubt,” adds the secretary, “but that a
collection of living animals would be an advantage for the instruction
of the public and for the progress of natural history, and-that it would
be the means of acquiring and multiplying, within the territory of the
Republic, many useful species that now exist only in foreign countries.
But it is left to the committee to consider, in its wisdom, whether these
advantages can be made compatible with the present needs of the
Republic.” The four animals obtained from Marchini were to cost 12
livres per day, including the salaries of their keepers, and it was impos-
sible to meet this expense from the funds of the establishment.

Desfontaines had not finished his letter before two other menageries
arrived in their turn, that of Louzardi and that of Henry, containing
a tiger cat, a white bear, two mandrill monkeys, two agoutis, two eagles,
and a vulture. These were lined up with the animals of Marchini in
the court of the establishment.

froy-Saint-Hilaire, Paris, page 49.
THE ROYAL MENAGERIE OF FRANCE. 515

The committee of public instruction answered by a series of questions
concerning the installation of the animals, their value, the daily expense
they would involve, and even the purchase of adjoining land in case
the convention should decide to form a menagerie. The professors
redoubled their efforts to furnish without delay this very diversified
information, while at the same time they decided to grant a daily
indemnity to the proprietors of the confiscated animals. Their esti-
mates were sent to the committee as early as the 17th of Frimaire
(December 7, 1793), and their communication, giving details upon which
it would be useless to enter here, ended by asking for the final posses
sion “of all the materials and utensils belonging to the menageries of
Versailles and Chantilly.”

Then, while the committee was deliberating, the council of professors

considered the most suitable means ‘for constructing temporary cages”
and for transporting the poor animals from Versailles. The cages were
finished the 16th of Ventose (March 3), and toward the end of Germinal
the three survivors of the royal menagerie enjoyed the modest hospi-
tality of the republican museum.!
- The animals of the park at Rainey were put at the disposal of the
Government by Crassous, a member of the convention (29th Germinal;
21st March). In short, when the citizens Billaud-Varennes, Barrére,
and Priem (of la Marne) came to visit the museum to see with their
own eyes what enlargements were necessary, Daubenton, who re-
ceived them at the head of the professors, could show them a national
menagerie already quite presentable.

The new institution was definitely established by the adoption of the
report of Thibaudeau, read in the convention on the 21st of Frimaire
of the year III (December 11, 1794), and Etienne Geoffroy, its founder,
could then begin the works which have since immortalized his name.

In the course of the century, which it has just completed, the menag-
erie of the Museum of Paris has had some fine days. The arrival of
ten cases (14th of Fructidor, year VI; August 31, 1796), escorted by
fourteen guards, in which there was brought from Holland the animals
and birds confiscated from the Stadhouder; the receipt of the male and
female elephants from the same collection; the purchase of tigers, lynxes,
and other carnivorous animals brought from London by Pembroke
(1800); the arrival of a gnu, a zebra, etc., by the ships of Baudin (1804);
the installation of the bear pits, in which dynasties of bruins, white
or black, perform the same tricks before a crowd that is constantly
renewed; the acquisition of the animals of King Louis, brother of
Napoleon; the opening of the new houses for wild animals, which seemed
in 1821 so finely arranged, and which appear to-day so mean and close;
the arrival of the first hippopotamus, the first chimpanzee, the first
gorilla—all these were marked events in the life of the establishment.

_1 All these details are taken from the Proces-Verbaux of the Council of the Profes-
sors (Arch. du Museum, Proce. Verb. Reg. I, pass.).
516 THE ROYAL MENAGERIE OF FRANCE.

Perhaps, however, none of these had the importance of the solemn
entrance, on June 30, 1827, of dame giraffe into the good city of Paris.
Everyone wished to see her, all the newspapers were full of her,
articles and songs were written about her, and fashion, that other dis-
penser of glory, used her forms and colors to make the giraffe dress,
the giraffe hat, the giraffe comb. Nevers had polychromic crockery;
Epinal, illuminated images that represented the celebrated visitor.
Even politics meddled with her, and some amateurs possess in their
collections a bronze medal upon which is seen the giraffe addressing
the country in terms similar to the historic words used by the Comte
d’ Artois in 1814,! ‘Nothing is changed in France; thereisonly * * *
one beast more.” I need not explain why this medal quickly became
very rare.

Giraffe, hippopotamus, chimpanzee, etc., all these animals assembled
together, sometimes to the number of 1,300 to 1,400, have constituted a
special school of instruction that for one hundred years has played a
most important part. As Isidore Geoffroy-Saint- Hilaire wrote in 1860,
if the menagerie had not existed and had not been enriched from the
very first with a great number of rare species, Cuvier would never have
been able at the beginning of our century to publish his Comparative
Anatomy and to prepare in this way a new life for zoology and the
birth of paleontology; and Etienne Geoffroy would not in his turn,
twenty years later, have written his Philosophical Anatomy. I will
add, that if it had not been for the menagerie Isidore Geoffroy himself,
Blainville, Duvernoy, H.-Milne Edwards, P. Gervais, Gratiolet, and
many others would not have brought together the materials for the
memoirs with which they have enriched science.

Without the menagerie Frederic Cuvier, who was an aid there as
early as 1805, would not have written his studies on the instinct and
intelligence of animals, ete. Without the menagerie the remarkable
studies of M. Alphonse-Milne Edwards would not have been concluded,
and we would doubtless be unacquainted with the conditions of hybrid-
ization among the pithecoid apes, the equide, the bovidee, etc.” With-
out the menagerie many species of herbivore and a number of useful
birds would not be acclimated in our country, and the museum would
not have been able to renew, in a degree, the great fauna of our forests.*

1Tt is now known that this saying was ascribed to the Comte d’Artois by Beugnot.
‘(Memoires, pages 112-114; Paris, 1886.)

2 Hybrids have been obtained at the museum by crossing the magot with the
macaque, the magot with the cynocephalus, the macaque with various pouched
monkeys, the horse with the onager, the horse with the zebra, the zebra with the
onager, the ass with the onager, the zebra with the ass, the yak with the cow (the
male is infertile, the female fertile), etc. -

’'The names of some of the species acclimated in the Jardin are as follows: The
onager and the sambur deer brought by Dussumier, the pig deer, the sika deer of
Japan, the muntjak deer of China, the gnu, the moufflon of the Atlas Mountains,
the Egyptian goose, the black swan, the emeu which we owe to Péron, the nandou,
the Chinese crane introduced by Montigny, numerous pheasants, etc.
THE ROYAL MENAGERIE OF FRANCE 517

Finally, without the menagerie French art would not be able to add
to its list some of the most illustrious names of modern times, that of
Barye, for example, or of Fremiet, his successor.

The menagerie furnishes each year a great number of subjects to the
scalpel of the anatomist, and those of you gentlemen who represent
zoological studies in the provinces know to what an extent the museum
has aided, thanks to its menagerie, the enrichment of public collections.

All these results have been obtained since 1793, in spite of quite
unfavorable conditions, in confined quarters, badly protected against
the rigors of winter, with limited means, and an insufficient force of
employees. What a renewal of progress may we not hope, now that
a rejuvenated staff, active and above all competent, makes its kindly
influence felt everywhere in the museum, and the public administra-
tors make known each year, by voting subsidies for long-wished-for
improvements, their interest in the institution founded by the national
convention.

Much has been done at the Jardin des Plantes for science and for the
country during the century now ending; no less labor and devotion will
be given in the century about to begin. And without doubt the chroni-
cler who a hundred years hence shall take the place at this tribune that
the kindness of the committee has to-day accorded to me will have the
honor and the pleasure of celebrating before a select audience other
great names and great events.
BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY.!

By WILLIAM TRELEASE.

In selecting a subject for the first presidential address before the
Botanical Society of America, which you have done me the honor of
requiring of me, I have deviated somewhat from the customary lines of
such addresses, inasmuch as I have not attempted to present an abstract
of recent general progress in botany, nor any results of my own inves-
tigation. Such topics, indeed, are more likely than the one I have
chosen to interest an assemblage of specialists like this society; but as
the society is supposed :to have as a principal object the promotion of
research, the present has seemed a fitting occasion to address, through
the society, the large and growing number of young botanists who may
be expected to look to this society for a certain amount of help and
inspiration in the upbuilding of their own scientific careers; hence it
comes that I have selected as my subject ‘‘ Opportunity.”

Let us for a moment compare the conditions under which scientific
work is done to-day with those prevalent in the past. From a purely
utilitarian, and, for a time, perhaps almost instinctive knowledge of
plants and their properties, beginning, it nay be, defore our race can
be said to have bad a history, through the pedantry of the Middle
Ages with their ponderous tomes, botany, almost within our memory,
stands as the scientific diversion or pastime of men whose serious busi-
ness in life was of a very different nature. Such training as the earlier
botanists had was obtained as being primarily useful in other pursuits
_than pure research, though there is abundant evidence that the master
often enjoined upon the pupil the possibilities of botanical study, and
no doubt he stretched the limits of botanical instruction deemed neces-
Sary, just as is done to-day in technical schools,in the hope that the
surplus might be so used as to increase the general store of knowledge;
but, at best, training was limited, and research was recreation and
relaxation. |

But our predecessors, even the generation immediately before us,
lived under conditions which made it possible for a man to hold high
place in the business or professional world, to accumulate wealth in

America, at Buffalo, N. Y., August 21, 1896. From the Botanical Gazette, Vol. XIII.

520 BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY.

commerce, and at the same time to devote much time to the study of
nature. To-day the man who is not entirely a business man is better
out of business, and, with few exceptions, the man who is not entirely
a student is little better than a dilettante in science. Concentration is
the order of the day, and specialization is the lot of most men. But
specialization, the keynote of progressive evolution, is always intimately
associated with a division of labor. Fortunately, the men who enter
and win in the great game of commerce and manufacture see in a more
or less clear way that nearly every great manufacturing or commercial
advance has grown out of a succession of obscure discoveries made by
the devotee tu pure science, often considered by him, indeed, only as so
many more words deciphered in the great and mysterious unread book
of nature, but sooner or later adapted and applied for the benefit of all
men by the shrewd mind of a master in the art of money-making. ‘To
these men, successful in business, we owe it that to-day not only are
some men able to devote their entire time to scientific research and the
propagation of knowledge, but that their work is done under favorable
conditions, and with a wealth of aids and adjuncts that would hardly
have been thought of a generation ago.

Instead of a smattering of systematic botany and organography,
given as an adjunct to chemistry, medicine, or engineering, the student
who wishes may to-day equip himself for a life of research in botany,
by a considerable amount of preparatory work in the lower schools,
beginning, perhaps, even in the kindergarten, and by devoting the
larger part of his undergraduate time in college to the elements of
the subject in the broadest and, if he wish, technical scope, having the
benefit of marvelously detailed appliances and a broad knowledge of
general facts. If he can and will work for a higher university degree, -
thus equipped, he may delve into the depths of the most limited
specialty, guided for a time by those who have already broken soil
there, and left at last with a rich and unexplored vein for his own
elaboration. With this training, if he be fortunate in securing a posi-
tion offering opportunity for research, or if he enjoy independent
means, he may hope for a lifetime of more or less uninterrupted oppor-
tunity for unearthing the wealth of discovery that lies just within his
reach.

Considering the prevalent conditions, my subject naturally divides
itself into two quite distinct parts: the opportunity of institutions and
of individuals. We stand to-day, apparently, at a transition point.
Most of the active workers of the present time are college professors,
who have done the research work that has made their names known,
during the leisure that could be found in the year’s routine of instruc-
tion or during their long vacations, and with facilities nominally secured
for class use, or, in many instances, like those of a generation ago, the
private property of the investigator. Even when appreciated at some-
thing like its true value, their original work, for the most part, has been
closely watched to prevent it from encroaching upon the first duty,
BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY. 521

class work; and in most cases the facilities that they have been able
to bring together are in direct proportion to the number of students
attracted to their departments, and therefore in inverse ratio to their
own leisure for research. But, as I have already stated, the feeling is
growing among men able to foster such enterprises, that research is a
thing worthy of being promoted, and we have before our eyes the
spectacle of a gradually unfolding class of institutions in which investi-
gation is not only tolerated but expected, either as an adjunct to
instruction, as in the greater number of colleges, as a concomitant of
educational displays, as in botanical museums and gardens, or, at least
nominally, as a basis for technical or economic research, as in several
of the larger drug houses, and, notably, in various agricultural experi-
ment stations and the national Department of Agriculture. Perhaps
the time has not yet come when laboratories of botanical research can
stand out quite alone and justify their existence without reference to
other ends, the utility of which is more generally understood and con-
ceded, but it seems safe to predict that the next decade will see their
complete evolution.

Opportunity, for institutions, lies primarily in equipment, and secon-
darily in its use. The problem of equipment for research is a com-
plicated and difficult one. So long as there were no laboratories
specially designed for this purpose, it was natural that the instruce-
tional laboratory should be furnished with appliances for demonstra-
tion, and that these should be amplified, as far as possible, for the
repetition of experiments, in the first place, and afterwards for their
extension; and it is no doubt true that a number of the smaller educa-
tional laboratories are to-day over-equipped when account is taken of
the possible use to which they can be put. With a specialization such
aS we now See in progress, it may be questioned whether the ordinary
collegiate equip:vent can not be reduced in scope in many instances,
with benefit to the institution, by releasing money often badly needed
in other directions, either in the same or different departments. On
the other hand, it is certain that the equipment of the broader research
laboratories, whether connected with universities or independent, must
be made much more comprehensive than any which to-day exists in
this country.

Under the stimulus of the last two decades, botany has come to the
front in most colleges as a study well calculated to develop the powers
of observation and the reasoning faculties. Where it still occupies the
place of a fixed study of a few terms’ duration in a prescribed under-
graduate course, it is evident that the necessary equipment of the
department is expressible in the simplest terms: for each course, that
which is needed to exemplify by the most direct object lessons the sub-
ject selected and enough general and collateral material and litera-
ture to complement the work. But the case is somewhat different
when, as is now frequent, a considerable option is allowed the student in
the courses taken for the baccalaureate degree. Here the temptation
522 BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY.

exists to secure equipment for the broadest possible series of elec-
tives, and it is too often yielded to for the best interests of the insti-
tution. However liberal one may be in the matter of electives, it is
evident, in most instances, that the student can not afford to devote
more than about one-half of his undergraduate time to a single study
like botany, and in this time he can cover only a definite amount of
eround, While there is a certain seductiveness in the perusal of long
lists of electives in a college catalogue, the serious contemplation of
them shows that few, if any, students can hope to take all of the
courses of such a list, and as, for the most part, they are garnished out
in an attractive form, there is likely to be embarrassment in the wealth
of subjects, so that, if left to himself, the student is very likely to
select a series of disconnected but pleasing fragments, rather than the
proper links in an educational chain. Experience shows the wisdom
of limiting the list of electives to those that there is reasonable proba-
bility that the student can take, and of making the list a consistent
whole, fairly opening up the entire field of botany in such a manner as
to pave the way for a piece of advanced thesis work at the end, and for
specialization after graduation. So far as undergraduate instruction
is concerned, where, as is usually the case, funds are limited, it is here
desirable, as in the other instance, to limit the scope of the depart-
mental equipment quite closely to the requirements of the courses
offered. As the senior thesis work is almost certain to be a further
study of some one of the subjects already elected, the provision for it,
in nearly every instance, is easily and quickly effected by a compara-
tively inexpensive addition, in each case, to the standard library and
laboratory equipment. Such research work as the head of the depart
ment and his assistants find time for, as well as such post-graduate
work as may be undertaken, can then be provided for in the same man-
ner, piece by piece, with the exception of the final touches, demanding
the use of the largest reference libraries or collections, the provision
for which is not likely to be far to seek in the stronger research
centers within a very few years.

Great herbaria, broad reference libraries, and large stores of appa-
ratus and living or preserved material, are possible only to few universi-
ties and to the still fewer fiatoreeoms specially endowed for research,
to which alone, indeed, they seem strictly appropriate. For the latter,
every shade of breadth of foundation is possible, from the laboratory
and library limited to the narrowest specialty, to the institution
founded and equipped for research in any branch of pure or applied
botany. Fairly perfect equipment of the former class it is possible to
find here and there, to-day, but though the seed is sown in several
places, the broadest institutions, in their entirety, are still to be
developed.

No doubt the first requisite in any such institution is a library of
scope comparable with its own. Whatever may be said against the
prevalent nomenclature discussions, it must be admitted that they are
BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY. 523

having the effect of bringing to the front the half-forgotten work of
many of our predecessors, some of which, at least, is well worthy of
resurrection, and, incidentally, this is stocking our larger libraries with
a class of books which have confessedly been too much neglected of
late. Without for a moment losing sight ‘of the fact that botany is a
study of one branch of nature, an object-study, we must recognize
that its prosecution beyond the merest elements is not only greatly
promoted by but almost dependent upon a knowledge of what has
already been done.

~ Where an institution is located in a literary or scientific center,
closely associated with large general libraries, learned bodies, and the
like, it is usually relieved of the necessity for purchasing and keeping
up the long files of such serial publications as the journals, proceedings
of societies, etc., of mixed contents, which prove expensive alike in
cost, binding, and space which for a given subject are used but seldom,
and which, nevertheless, are the most valuable part of a large reference
library, since they are the hardest to duplicate. But where a botanical
institution stands in absolute or comparative isolation, it must carry
this burden in addition to that of maintaining a library of treatises on
botany alone. And, moreover, no sooner is research begun in any direc-
tion, than the necessity of following up divergent threads running in
many directions becomes evident; for so close and complex are the inter-
relations between things in organic nature, that no single subject can be
pursued far without drawing in others at first sight having no possible
bearing on it. After the serials, which from their expensiveness can
be possessed by only the larger libraries, stand undoubtedly the general
classics in the several subdivisions of botany, followed by the more
restricted memoirs, and among these, for convenience of use, should
be found, whenever possible, separates and reprints from the journals
and series of proceedings, even when the latter are complete on the
Shelves.

Next to books, material preserving records, or available for study,
forms the great foundation in any research institution. A generation
ago, or evep less, this expression would have been taken as synonymous
with an herbarium, perhaps associated with a garden of greater or less
extent; but to-day the most comprehensive of museum possibilities
must be added, so greatly has the subject broadened and increased the
needs. [or a broadly planned institution, with ample means, no doubt
the scope of the herbarium should be as great as that of the library,
comprising every group of plants, representing a wide range of geo-
graphical distribution, the effects of cultivation, etc.; and, however
limited they may be at first, such museum accessories as alcoholic
material, large wood and fruit specimens, and sections for microscopic
study are sure to accumulate quite as rapidly as they can be cared for
Suitably, and to prove in time a very important part of the equipment.
Though some of the best botanical work has been performed entirely in
the herbarium, there has long been a growing conviction that for certain
524 BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY.

groups of plants, even for purposes of description and classification,
field observation is absolutely necessary, while it is self-evident that
for all studies of biology living material is essential. Side by side with
the herbarium, then, and virtually as a part of the same general collec-
tion, stands the experimental garden, with its greenhouses and other
appliances.

While many of the most useful studies are made with but few aids
beyond the library and collections referred to, there is a large class of
subjects, now being closely followed by some of the keenest investigators,
which demand a special instrumental equipment. However it may be
with library and collections, there seems little doubt that, as a rule,
apparatus should be obtained only as it is needed for direct use.
Except for the rotting of the bindings observed in the libraries of manu-
facturing cities and where illuminating gas is used, books, when once
classified and indexed, are easily and cheaply kept in a usable condi-
tion. Ifa fewsimple rules are followed herbarium material is also pre-
served safely for generations at a very small cost; and even sections
and specimens in fluid, if properly preserved in the first place, may be
kept for many years without great deterioration. Instruments designed
for research, as a general thing, represent a considerable sum of money,
since, excepting microscopes, microtomes, and balances, they are rarely
made in numbers allowing any great economy in the labor of manufac:
ture. Each of them is also, unfortunately, with few exceptions, calcu-
lated for a restricted class of experiments and likely soon to be greatly
modified. Apparatus, moreover, is usually of a delicacy of adjustment
calling for the greatest care in handling it and the most perfect protec-
tion possible against rusting, etc., so that, as a general thing, a case of
instruments 10 years old is merely a historical curiosity, in part entirely
out of date, and for the rest so badly out of order as to be nearly or
quite useless. Except for a few standard instruments, I think itis now
generally recognized that this part of the facilities, however costly it
may be, should be regarded as transient, perishable material, rather
than a permanent equipment. The history of the most successful
physiological laboratories, in which delicate apparatus is chiefly used,
furthermore shows that the most important results, as a rule, are not
obtained by the use of commercial instruments, but by simple appara-
tus designed by the investigator to meet the precise needs of the prob-
lem with which he is busied, and usually constructed by him or his
laboratory mechanic at very little cost.

Although it seems comparatively easy to decide on the proper limits
of library, herbarium, and instrumental equipment for a given institu-
tion, knowing its scope, situation, and resources, it is very difficult to
arrive at as satisfactory a conclusion concerning the extent of the
research garden. Asa general thing such gardens are also intended
to be useful in college work, or to afford pleasure and instruction to the
public, so that they are likely to be heterogeneous almost of necessity,
and usually they are made far too comprehensive. More than any
BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY. 525

other class of facilities, garden plants require constant and expensive
attention if they are to be kept in usable condition; and, with all of the
care that can be given them, they are forever performing the most inex-
plicable and unexpected gyrations with their labels, so that the collec-
tions grown in botanical gardens (because of their variety) are notori-
ously ill named, though it would naturally be supposed that they, of
all collections, would be above suspicion in this respect.

My object being to speak of facilities for research, this rather than

education or entertainment, I ought to pass by this part of the subject
with a mere mention, but I can hardly dismiss it without comment.
Where the only object is to supplement the facilities for undergraduate
work, the scope of a garden can be very small or moderately large, accord-
ing to the courses it is to help elucidate. It may be confined to what
may be called a propagating bed for plants needed in quantity, either
in season or out of season, for class use, to an exemplification of the
natural affinities of plants, or to various other instructive synopses,
representing medicinal plants, fiber plants, forage plants, fruits, vegeta-
bles, timber trees, nut trees, shade trees, carnivorous plants, climbing
plants, the sleep of plants, pollination, dissemination, etc., or it may be
devoted to several of these combined. If it is to be a pleasure ground
as well, not only should the art of the landscape architect be invoked
in the arrangement of the plants, but it is necessary to add collections
‘of decorative shrubbery and a large variety of purely ornamental flor-
ists’ forms of herbaceous plants. If research is added to its aims, the
collection must be further augmented by specially selected groups
cultivated from time to time as needed for study.

Unfortunately, few if any gardens are so richly endowed that they can
cover, in a satisfactory manner, the entire field indicated, or even any
large part of it. From what has been said of the peculiar difficulties
pertaining to the maintenance of botanical gardens, it is evident that
in no other line of securities, whether for pure research or not, isa wise
restriction so necessary aS here. Once properly prepared, a species is
represented in the herbarium on one or more sheets of paper safely
and economically stowed away in a pigeonhole; but in the garden it is
a constant source of care and expense as long as it lasts. Hence it is
possible for one of the larger herbaria to contain representatives of
more than half of the 200,000 species, more or less, of phanerogams,
and a considerable, if smaller, proportion of cryptogams, while it is
absolutely impossible for anything like this number to be represented
in a living state in the best garden. No doubt the local requirements
of every institution will do more to influence the exact scope of its liv-
ing collections than any theoretical considerations, but it is certain
that in most cases the greatest usefulness combined with the minimum
expenditure will be reached by adapting the synopses chosen to the
chief aims of the institution as closely as possible, and very rigidly
restricting the species cultivated to the smallest number capable of
adequately expressing the facts to be shown. Perhaps it is safe to say
526 BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY.

that an institution able to maintain an herbarium of half a million
specimens, representing one-fifth as many species, is doing exceedingly
well if it has in cultivation at any one time 10,000 species of the higher
plants, and there are very few gardens which actually grow half of this
number, while no inconsiderable percentage of the plants cultivated
are so deformed, distorted, dwarfed, and imperfect, as a general thing,
that they can scarcely be said to represent the species whose name they
bear either in appearance or technical characters.

This leads to the conclusion that not only class gardens but research
gardens should be kept within reasonably narrow bounds so far as
permanent planting is concerned, while allowing sufficient elasticity
for rapid and ample temporary expansion in certain directions along
which work is planned. This does not necessarily mean that any con-
siderable amount of land not used in the permanent plantation need
be reserved for special expansion. As a rule, the more important gar-
dens are situated in or near large cities, and the high price of land
alone would prevent such reservation in most instances; but the
impure atmosphere of many of the larger cities is a further and even
stronger reason for selecting, for any large experimental undertaking,
a suitably located and oriented tract of farming land easily rented for
one or several years at a relatively low figure.

Granting the wisdom of such temporary adjuncts to a research garden,
a step further leads to a recognition of the possibility of securing the
most varied climatic conditions by establishing branch gardens, located
where particular kinds of study can best be carried on. In no other
way can gardens be made to contribute to the fullest extent to the
study of marine or seaside plants, alpines, or the great class of succu-
lents, etc., characteristic of the arid regions of our Southwestern States
and Territories, and in no other way, except in the field, can these
groups be studied satisfactorily, even from the standpoint of the clas-
Sificatory botanist.

Undoubtedly, too, the research institution of the future will count
as a part of its legitimate equipment the provision, as needed, of very
liberal opportunities for its staff to visit even distant regions for the
Study, in their native homes, of plants which can not be cultivated
even in special gardens in such a manner as to be fully representative.

If the entire equipment here sketched in outline is not only appro-
priate but essential to the great centers of botanical investigation that
are making their appearance as results of the specialization and divi-
sion of labor that are now manifesting themselves in the endowment
of research, it by no means follows that every institution, even of this
class, should try to develop from the start on all of the lines which,
intertwined, compose the complex tissue of botany. With ample
means, the ideal development is that which, from the beginning, rec-
ognizes all branches as of value, and classifies and develops them
alike in proportion to their relative importance. But to secure the
greatest return for the money expended, it is desirable to equip fairly
BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY. 527

well before increasing the force of salaried men much beyond what is
needed for the care and arrangement of the material accumulating.
This principle, if followed out, almost forces an overdevelopment in
the branches of special interest to the earlier employees—a departure
from the ideal symmetry which is sure to be justified by the perform-
ance of more work in these hypertrophied specialties, with reference to
the sum invested, than in other directions. From this may also be
drawn the seemingly just inference that where the means are limited,
it is far better to concentrate the entire equipment on the specialties of
the persons who can use it than to allow them to work at a disadvant-
age through an effort, however commendable it may at first appear, to
secure a Symmetrical equipment.

With the evolution of centers of pure research will appear new prob-
lems. Just as the attendance of a large number of students in the
botanical department of a college has heretofore been found to justify
the acquisition of facilities beyond the power of their immediate use,
it will be found that where research institutions exist, in close con-
nection with a university of recognized standing, their equipment
will be utilized more or less fully in postgraduate work done toward
the acquisition of the doctor’s degree, so that, like the undergraduate
equipment, it will be more or less satisfactorily accounted for by the
number of candidates for such degree; but with broadly grounded
and well endowed research institutions not so situated, it is inevitable
that as they take permanent form on the lines calculated to make them
available for advanced research in any line of botany, they will sooner
or later come to represent a very large sum of invested money, of
which only a part is usefully employed at any given time, the remainder
being held as a necessary but temporarily unproductive re-erve. The
same thing is seen, to a certain extent, in all large libraries and muse-
ums; but, unlike the general library, of interest to the entire reading
public, or the collection of historical or political works, referred to by
many people of ordinary intellectual attainments, the advanced equip-
ment in botany, for the most part, is useful and interesting only to
botanists, so that, while it may possess a passing interest for the gen-
eral student, its serious use is limited to a very restricted class. How
to increase this use to the maximum may well demand our best thought.

No doubt, just as many colleges now offer scholarships, making their
advantages available to men who otherwise could not enjoy them, and
some of our universities offer fellowships, opening their own post grad-
uate courses or those of foreign universities to deserving students, the
evolution of research institutions will witness some such provisions for
enabling students who have partially completed pieces of research work
to visit and utilize these centers without encroaching too far on the
limited savings from the small salaries which, as a rule, are drawn by
the botanists of the country. After all, however, the great opportunity
of attainment for such institutions, whether or not connected with col-
leges or universities, lies in the performance of research work by their
528 BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY.

own employees, and while, except in a few instances already referred
to, and notably in the national Department of Agriculture, to-day there
is some hesitancy in recognizing the employment of a staff of investi-
gators as a legitimate part of the maintenance expense of an establish-
ment which does not use a large part of their time in instruction or
necessary curator’s routine, it is quite certain that within a very few
years opinion will have so changed that a considerable number of sala-
ried positions for research work in pure or applied botany will exist,
and as these positions will compete with the professorships in the best
universities, it seems probable that the salaries pertaining to them will
be approximately those paid at the larger colleges.

In addition to bringing together facilities for research and rendering
them easily accessible to competent investigators, and maintaining
their own corps of workers, engaged in such study, institutions of
research have no small field of usefulness opened up as publishers of
the results of the work they have promoted. I shall have occasion
later to speak of the means of publication from the standpoint of the
student who is seeking to bring out his work in the best form, but it
also demands consideration from the point of view of the institution.
Much difficulty is experienced in looking up the literature of a subject
because of the large number of journals, etc., in which references must
be sought, and it is probable that at some time or other most workers
have impatiently wished that publication could be confined to one or a
few channels. Simple as this would render the bibliography of botany,
it is obviously impossible, and the amount of work deserving or demand-
ing publication is so great and so rapidly increasing as to leave no doubt
that means of effecting the latter must be considerably augmented. To
publish the results of good work well is no less commendable or helpful
than to facilitate or perform such work. Nor is it less appropriate to
an institution such as I have in mind. The object of publication being
the adequate preservation and diffusion of a record of the results
of research, however, it is easily seen that harm may be done by inju-
dicious or ill-considered publication. While a volume of homogeneous
contents may be so published almost anywhere as to accomplish its
purpose, a serial publication ought to be started only when there is
reasonable probability that it will persist for a considerable length
of time. Granting this probability, a research institution with adequate
funds forms one of the most satisfactory and effective agencies of pub-
lication, since it can place its proceedings or reports in all of the prin-
cipal libraries of the world, a thing which the journals do not always
accomplish; and not only can it thus amplify its field legitimately, but
almost of necessity it must assume the duty of publication if it is to
accomplish the greatest results possible from its direct investigation.

One has only to pass a short time in the library of one of the largest
scientific institutions to be convinced that a great deal of activity is
manifested in the botanical world. Each month and each week bring

many additions to the literature of the science, and so numerous, varied,
and widely scattered are these contributions that one feels the greatest
hesitancy in publishing on even the most restricted subject, lest others
should have antedated his discoveries. Yet, notwithstanding the
variety and number of botanical publications, and the great progress
which is undeniably made every year, it is a matter of frequent com-
ment that the progress made is by no means so much greater than that
of our predecessors as might be expected, considering the greater
advantages under which work is prosecuted to-day. While it must be
borne in mind that the seizing of the general features of a landscape is
far easier than the working out of its detailed topography, that the
outlining of the field of botany or of its principal divisions could not
fail to proceed more rapidly, even under unfavorable conditions, than
the elaboration of the details of the many specialties into which it is
now broken up, so that less prompt and voluminous results are natu-
rally to be expected now than a generation ago, there is reason to
question whether the present returns can not be increased. How to
secure the greatest possible results from the large number of trained
men holding or soon to hold salaried positions, and from the large
equipment in laboratories, libraries, herbaria, and gardens, is a subject
‘deserving of the most careful study, whether viewed from the stand-
point of the endower or administrator of an institution of education or
research or from that of the botanist whose reputation is built up in
the performance of the duties assigned to him in such an institution.

While there is every reason to expect large returns from the endow-
ment of such independent departments of research, freedom from the
duties of the class room, while leaving more time available for investi-
gation, will not prove an unmixed blessing. I believe it to be the
experience of the best investigators in this country that research is
promoted by the necessity of imparting some or all of its results in the
class room. In no other way, after specializing to the small field in
which it seems necessary for most of us to confine ourselves, can one
make sure of preserving the breadth of view needed for the investiga-
tion of even a limited specialty in the most successful manner. It must
be admitted further that the power of application and concentration
varies with different men, so that up to a certain point the interruptions
introduced by limited teaching or looking after collections in many cases
may give fresh zest to the pursuit of knowledge in the time remaining
_ for research. And it may be that at this very point lies the greatest
difficulty to be met and surmounted in the development and manage-
ment of research institutions.

Though there is no doubt that some supervision and pressure are
conducive to the performance of the greatest possible amount of inves-
tigation, as of other work, since they insure consistent planning and
close application, it can not be overlooked that this is the extent to
which scientific work can profitably be crowded. To require more of

an investigator than that he shall be reasonably busy with thought

fully planned study is and has always been antagonistic to the perform-
ance of his best work; and the requirement of some institutions that a
bulletin shall emanate from each department at stated intervals, while
it insures quantity in publication, generally does so at the expense of
quality of attainment. As a rule, genius, which, left to itself, now and
then leaps to the most unexpected accomplishments, is most effectively
repressed by close supervision. It is tolerant of guidance, but not of
the goad; and yet, on the whole, perhaps, both guided and driven, if
this is done wisely, it accomplishes most, for in harness it becomes plod-
ding research, which is dull, to be sure, but, if persevering, productive
of cumulative results which become of incalculable importance. In
fact, whether fortunately or unfortunately I shall not attempt to say,
the world has come to recognize the slow but sure progress of research
as in the main more desirable than the irregular and intermittent leaps
of genius, though the two are closely akin—patient labor over endless
facts, on the one hand, and broad observation and untrammeled thought,
on the other.

If, everything considered, it is slow and persistent investigation,
rather than sudden inspiration, to which we must look for the accom-
plishment of the greatest collective results in botany, it is equally true
that the individual student is more likely to build his reputation on the
summation of the small accomplishments of many days of close appli-
cation than to arrive at some great discovery by a leap; and this, quite
aside from the fact that the latter result is entirely impossible to many
aman who in the other way may still hope to be of great usefulness.
It has been said that there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken
at the flood, leads on to fortune, and no doubt what is true in the mili-
tary, literary, and commercial world is equally true in the smalier
realm of science. In fact, I faney that each member of my audience
has in mind some one preeminent occasion which may have looked
small or large at the moment, but the seizing or neglect of which he
now sees marked a turning point in his scientific career. But, it will
be seen, it is not of the one great opportunity that I would now speak.
Improving it always has marked and always will mark the turning
point of life, but unfortunately the bridge can not be crossed before it
is reached, and great as the value of a true and wise friend’s counsel
then is, it can not be replaced by any generalities in advance; there-
fore it is to the countless lesser opportunities, repeated with almost
every day that dawns for us, that I turn, in the hope that something
helpful may be said of them, and in the firm belief that in them lies
the making of any intelligent and indefatigable young man.

To the investigator, breadth of foundation is even more necessary
than to the institution founded for his use, for while the latter should
endure for centuries, and may be remodeled and improved at any time,
he is limited toa single lifetime and can rarely in mid life or later
repair the deficiencies of ill advised or defective training. Not only
BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY. 531

should his powers of observation be well developed, but he should be
given more discipline in reasoning than is now customary, though the
botanists of a generation ago counted among their number several men
who are even more widely known as philosophers.

Equipped for the work, and enabled to use the material facilities
that have been brought together against the day of his need, much
depends on the early and wise formation of the investigator’s plans.
Except for the tasks set by a teacher, and really long contemplated by
him and carried out by his intelligence, if through the eyes and hands
of pupils, few pieces of valuable research are taken up on the spur of
the moment, without previous thought on the part of the investigator.
They are usually the outgrowth of reflection started, perhaps, by some
casual observation or the remark of another, and turning and return-
ing until it ultimately shapes itself into a definite plan. Simple as it
may be in theory, few things are more difficult in practice than the
formation and inception in early life, inexperienced, and often without
certainty of the power of continuance for any great length of time, of
a plan for a single piece of research work worthy of the devotion of a
lifetime; and few and fortunate are the men, even among those who
have outlined and entered upon such a task, who are not forced from
the path by side issues, or whose lives are not unduly short. More
commonly one must be content to choose several smaller subjects, for
their own sakes somewhat closely related to one another, if possible,
and to follow these up in succession. It is surprising how blind even .
the sharpest eyed among us are to all that does not directly interest
us, and it is an equal surprise to see how quickly one’s eyes open to
things which he has once begun to think of and look for. If for no
other reason than this, | would again urge breadth of early training,
as giving the first impulse to many a series of special observations to
be followed up in later life.

Once a subject is chosen, observations accumulate with surprising
rapidity, and next to the selection of a subject nothing is so important
as system in pursuing it. If we do not see it in ourselves, each one of
us can see in others a great waste of energy, resulting from shiftless
and ill-considered methods of procedure, by which the mind is so dis-
tracted and the memory so overloaded with unessentials and disasso-
ciated fragments that those which belong together are not matched,
nor the missing bits, in plain view, gathered. How often do we have
to return, time after time, and review partial work that we have had to
dismiss temporarily from the mind, in which, meantime, has been lost
the connection between the completed portion and the continuation
awaiting our leisure. A phenomenal memory may enable one to work
in this disjointed fashion without the production of scrappy results or
the review of all that has been done each time that the task is resumed;
but for those not so gifted, order and method are absolutely necessary.
and next to a clear idea of the end aimed at I should place the imme-
diate making of full and exact notes as their most essential part
532 BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY.

Some years since I was privileged to assist Dr. Gray in collecting and
republishing the botanical writings of Dr. Engelmann, and it was a
matter of surprise to us both, as it has been to others, to see how volu-
minous these were. Had Dr. Engelmann devoted his entire life to
botany, they would have been as creditable in quantity as in quality,
but for the leisure-hour productions of a busy professional man they
were truly marvelous. Some years later, when his herbarium and
library having found a resting place at the botanical garden, in the
development of which he had felt an interest for many years, it fell to
my lot to arrange in form for permanent preservation Dr. Engelmann’s
manuscript notes, sketches, etc., | was far more surprised at the extent
of these than I had been on collecting his printed works, for when
mounted and bound they form sixty large volumes. In addition to their
intrinsic value, these are of more than usual interest as showing the
methodical manner in which Dr. Engelmann worked. On his table
seems to have been always a bundle of plants awaiting study. Aseach
specimen was examined its salient features were noted and sketched on
the back of the ever-ready prescription blank. When interrupted he
laid his unfinished sketch away with the specimen to resume his obser-
vation and complete his study at the first opportunity, without any
doubt as to what had been seen in the first instance. And so from
individual to variety, from variety to species, from species to genus, and
from genus to family, his observations were preserved in memoranda
that facilitated the resumption of interrupted work at any time and
after any lapse of time. In no other way could the odd moments
between the daily calls and occupations of a busy physician have con-
tributed so much to botanical knowledge; in no other way could his
seemingly small opportunity for investigation have been converted into
a great one.

Almost as important as the early selection of a worthy subject for
study and the adoption of a method insuring the preservation and use
of even the most trivial information bearing on it, is the adoption of
suitable library methods. The student whose specialty is small and
little explored has mainly the task of observing and reasoning from the
facts before him; but in the departments that have long been the sub-
ject of study, while a part of the work is already done to his hand, and
the prospect is that he can go much further than on entirely new ground,
the task of ascertaining and profiting by what his predecessors have
done is often a difficult one. Not infrequently the literature of a sub-
ject is so scattered as to make it next to impossible to pass it all in
review, and at best the task of finding the fragments is one ealling for
a special faculty. One or more attempts have been made to form gen-
eral bureaus of scientific information, to which one need only turn if he
would be possessed of references to the principal literature of any sub-
ject in which he chanced to be interested. Perhaps as library facilities
accumulate at the great centers of research, some method may be found
of supplementing them with the skill of expert librarians who shall be
BOTANICAL OPPORTUNITY. 533

able and willing to carry the contents of the library, at least in skeleton
form, to those who can not come to it; but the time has hardly yet come
when any American library is complete enough in all branches to offer
this aid with a reasonable chance of doing what it promises, or so
manned as to make such assistance possible except at the sacrifice of
more valuable direct research.

For the present, then, the investigator must be content to do his own
delving into the literature of his predecessors. Fortunately, much of
the earlier literature has been sought out by some of the writers on
any branch that has been the subject of earlier study, so that, starting
with a memoir of recent date, one is guided to others, each of which
may bring further references, until, if he have access to the works,
almost the entire earlier literature is unearthed. On the other hand,
the most recent literature of a subject is always the most difficult to
find and use. After a study has been gotten well under way, so that
the student is keenly alert to every observation or published item in
any way bearing on it, if he have access to a library receiving the
principal current journals he is not likely to overlook any important
publication on his specialty which then appears. As arule, all of the
larger papers, at least, are noticed in Just’s Jahresbericht, generally
not more than a year later than that for which the volume purports to
be compiled; but as the Jahresbericht is always some three years in
arrears, it is difficult to prevent notes extending over a period of this
duration from being defective, at least for the earlier part of the time,
and there is at present no means of removing this difficulty, though
the plan proposed to zoologists a year ago, and, I suppose, tested dur-
ing the present season, if successful, would be equally applicable to
botany.

So tar as the final result is concerned, perhaps the manner in which
one’s work is published is almost as important as the subject selected
or the method adopted for its investigation. Alphonse de Candolle, in
one of the most helpful treatises ever published in the hope of render-
ing botanical work methodical and productive,! lays a great deal of
stress on the early selection of a form of publication for the results of
each important study. This done, the work continually shapes itself
to this end. Frequently there is much difficulty in securing the publi-
cation of a monograph or memoir in precisely the form and place
desired by the author, but there is seldom an insuperable obstacle in
the way of publishing any really meritorious work in about the manner
wished, provided it is suitably prepared.

In general, it is desirable that works of a given class should be so
published that in seeking one a reader is likely to learn of another.
This appears less important for books than for shorter papers, since the
arrangement of independently issued volumes in a library, and the fact
that they are Ghuelloget by authors, render it peeve) easy to learn

of and have access to them; but even here one finds no little conven-
ience in the recognition that a book by a given author on a given sub-
ject is quite likely to be listed in the catalogue of -a certain publishing
house. Smaller papers, which are usually published in the proceedings
of some society, or in a scientific journal, may almost be said to be
made or ruined by the place selected for their publication. Probably,
as library facilities increase and are more thoroughly classified and
subject indexed, this will become less true than it now is, though the
underlying reason for it will remain. Usually a reader turns to the
popular journals only when looking for popularized science, and is not
likely to seek the original results of research there, so that such papers
are nearly or quite lost for a long time if published in these journals.
Except where they are chiefly devoted to digests and abstracts, few
nominally general journals now exist which do not lean so strongly
toward a specialty that one unconsciously classes them with it, not-
withstanding the extraneous matter that they contain. While nothing
once published is ever absolutely lost, all of this extraneous matter is
likely to be overlooked by the persons most interested in the subjects
considered. No small part of the present confusion and strife in botan-
ical nomenclature arises from the comparatively recent unearthing of -
descriptions and names of plants published in such improbable or inac-
cessible places as to have escaped the attention of those whom they
might have helped most, to be brought to light at a later date as great
mischief makers. From now on, then, it may be concluded that a
decreasing number of special papers are likely to be published in gen-
eral journals, which will become more: and more popular or biblio-
graphie in their nature, with the exception that the necessarily slow
differentiation of learned societies into special sections will for a long
time cause the proceedings of many of the older to continue of the
most miscellaneous character. _Where papers are lengthy, though not
adapted to publication in book form, such proceedings virtually offer
the only means of printing them, and, except by the comparatively
few botanists who enjoy the privilege of membership in purely botan-
ical societies with publishing facilities, they must be accepted for the
present, notwithstanding the attendant disadvantages. Shorter papers,
however, can usually find room in the journals, and except in cases
where they possess a temporary and exceptional value for the columns
of a popular or general journal, or one devoted to another subject to
which, in some manner they are relevant, they are best published in a
periodical exclusively devoted to botany, and in most cases, in one
devoted as closely as may be to their particular branch of botany,
provided it have a fair general circulation, and especially, provided it
reach the principal botanical libraries.

Especially in the earlier years of their work, writers are sometimes
given to distributing their papers among a number of journals. Except
for the purpose of specialization just referred to, this is usually a mis-
take. Knowledge that a certain student has published on a given

subject is often first obtained through incidental reference, lacking
every element of precision. The probability that all of his writings
are to be found in one or a few journals or series of proceedings
greatly simplifies the completion and use of such references, since the
Royal Society’s Catalogue, though perhaps more complete as to titles,
is necessarily even further behind than the Jahresbericht. Where the
subject of an earlier paper is again passed in review by the author,
only the gravest necessity should lead to the selection of anew medium
for the publication of the later paper.

Whether the medium of publication selected or accepted be a journal
or the proceedings of a society, the possibility of having separates
struck off for the mere cost of press work, paper, and stitching makes
it possible for almost any paper to appear as an independent pamphlet,
accredited, to be sure, to the journal from which it is an excerpt, but,
like a book, necessitating author’s citation in catalogues, and admitting
of more ready arrangement in its proper place where the works of a
library are disposed on the shelves according to subject. The time was
when a pamphlet was considered of little value and quite certain not
to be preserved, but one of the characteristics of the modern dibrarian
is a great and growing appreciation of the value of this class of works,
leading to their careful preservation.

No small part of the volume of M. de Candolle, already referred to,
is devoted to very explicit and well-considered directions for preparing
the record of one’s observations for the press ; and the general con-
clusion is reached, after a careful analysis of the subject, that the
maximum value of any manuscript exists at the exact moment of its
completion, indicating this as the most suitable time for its publication.
Though it is probable that the publishing of any important werk should
not be unnecessarily delayed after it has been pushed to what the
author considers completion, at least so far as he can carry it, there
may be reasons in some cases for publishing a preliminary statement
considerably in advance of the completion of the work. Neglecting
the publication of an early abstract of unfinished work as a means of
securing priority, too often a purely personal matter, I may say that
such abstracts, coupled with a request for material or data, not infre-
quently bring to the advanced student the means of greatly increasing
the completeness and value of his work.

Time does not permit me to go into a detailed analysis of the many
ways in which an investigator may use his time so as to make it pro-
ductive of important results for himself and others. Having passed in
somewhat comprehensive, though hasty, review the main factors in the
question, I desire in closing to repeat that for most of us the opportunity
of life does not lie ina great and abrupt change of condition, but that it is
composed of countless minor chances which are great only when viewed
collectively. To see and use them calls for alert senses, a knowledge
and use of the means of ascertaining what has already been done, and,
by exclusion, something of what remains to be done, facilities adequate

to the task in each case, and indomitable perseverance and ceaseless
activity. Great as the value of facilities is, they are merely means to
an end. They accomplish nothing themselves. Hence, though it is
certain that the most voluminous and, perhaps, the most comprehensive
results, and those resulting from the performance of coherent experi-
ments extending through a long series of years, will come from the
great centers of research, there is no reason why qualitative results
equal to the best may not continue to come, as they have in the past,
from isolated workers, to the rounding out and completion of whose
studies the facilities of the larger institutions will be more and more
applicable as the problems of equipment are worked out.
MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE!

By HAVELOCK ELLIS.

It has been known for some years that the Kiowa Indians of New
Mexico are accustomed to eat, in their religious ceremonies, a certain
cactus called Anhalonium Lewinii, or mescal button. Meseal—which
must not be confounded with the intoxicating drink of the same name
made from an agave—is found in the Mexican Valley of the Rio Grande,
the ancestral home of the Kiowa Indians, as well as in Texas, and isa
brown and brittle substance, nauseous and bitter to the taste, composed
mainly of the blunt dried leaves of the plant.. Yet, as we shall see, it
has every claim to rank with haschisch and the other famous drugs
which have procured for men the joys of an artificial paradise. Upon
the Kiowa Indians, who first discovered its rare and potent virtues, it
has had so strong a fascination that the missionaries among these
Indians, finding here a rival to Christianity not yielding to moral
suasion, have appealed to the secular arm, and the buying and selling
of the drug has been prohibited by Government under severe penalties.
Yet the use of mescal prevails among the Kiowas to this day.

It has indeed spread, and the mescal rite may be said to be to-day
the chief religion of all the tribes of the southern plains of the United
States. The rite usually takes place on Saturday night; the men then
sit in a circle within the tent round a large camp fire, which is kept
burning brightly all the time. After prayer the leader hands each
man four buttons, which are slowly chewed and swallowed, and alto-
gether about ten or twelve buttons are consumed by each man between
sundown and daybreak. Throughout the night the men sit quietly
round the fire in a state of reverie—amid continual singing and the
beating of drums by attendants—absorbed in the color visions and
other manifestations of mescal intoxication, and about noon on the
following day, when the effects have passed off, they get up and go
about their business, without any depression or other unpleasant
aftereffect.

There are five or six allied species of cacti which the Indians also
use and treat with great reverence. Thus Mr. Carl Lumholtz has

538 MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE.

found that the Tarahumari, a tribe of Mexican Indians, worship
various cacti as gods, only to be approached with uncovered heads.
When they wish to obtain these cacti, the Tarahumari cense them-
selves with copal incense, and with profound respect dig up the god,
careful lest they should hurt him, while women and children are
warned from the spot. Even Christian Indians regard Hikori, the
cactus god, as coequal with their own divinity, and make the sign of
the cross in its presence. At all great festivals Hikori is made into a
drink and consumed by the medicine man, or certain selected Indians,
who sing as they partake of it, invoking Hikori to grant a ‘“‘beautiful
intoxication;” at the same time a rasping noise is made with sticks,
and men and women dance a fantastic and picturesque dance—the
women by themselves in white petticoats and tunics—before those who
are under the influence of the god.

In 1891 Mr. James Mooney, of the United States Bureau of Eth-
nology, having frequently observed the mescal rites of the Kiowa
Indians and assisted at them, called the attention of the Anthropo-
logical Society at Washington to the subject, and three years later he
brought to Washington a supply of mescal, which was handed over for
examination to Drs. Prentiss and Morgan. These investigators experi-
mented on several young men, and demonstrated, for the first time, the
precise character of mescal intoxication and the remarkable visions to
which it gives rise. A little later Dr. Weir Mitchell, who, in addition
to his eminence as a physician, is a man of marked esthetic tempera-
ment, experimented on himself, and published a very interesting record
of the brilliant visions by which he was visited under the influence of
the plant. In-the spring of the past year I was able to obtain a
small sample of mescal in London, and as my first experiment with
mescal was also, apparently, the first attempt to investigate its vision-
producing properties outside America,’ I will describe it in some
detail, in preference to drawing on the previously published descrip-
tions of the American observers.

On Good Friday I found myself entirely alone in the quiet rooms —
in the Temple which I occupy when in London, and judged the occa- —
sion a fitting one for a personal experiment. I made a decoction (a
different method from that adopted in America) of three buttons, the
full physiological dose, and drank this at intervals between 2.30 and
4.30 p.m. The first symptom observed during the afternoon was a cer-
tain consciousness of energy and intellectual power.’ This passed off,

‘Lewin, of Berlin, indeed, experimented with Anhalonium Lewinii, to which he
gave its name, as early as 1888, and as he found that even a small portion produced
dangerous symptoms, he classed it amongst the extremely poisonous drugs, like
strychnia. He failed to discover its vision-producing properties, and it seems, in
fact, highly probable that he was really experimenting with a different cactus from
that now known by the same name.

*I pass lightly over the purely physiological symptoms which I have described in
some detail in a paper on ‘‘The phenomena of mescal intoxication” (Lancet, June
5, 1897), which, however, contains no description of the visions.
MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE. 539

and about an hour after the final dose I felt faint and unsteady; the
pulse was low, and I found it pleasanter to lie down. TI was still able
to read, and I noticed that a pale violet shadow floated over the page
around the point at which my eyes were fixed. I had already noticed
that objects not in the direct line of vision, such as my hands holding
the book, showed a tendency to look obtrusive, heightened in color,
almost monstrous, while, on closing my eyes, afterimages were vivid
and prolonged. The appearance of visions with closed eyes was very
gradual. At first there was merely a vague play of light and shade
which suggested pictures, but never made them. Then the pictures
became more definite, but too confused and crowded to be described,
beyond saying that they were of the same character as the images of
the kaleidoscope, symmetrical groupings of spiked objects. Then, in
the course of the evening, they became distinct, but still indescribable—
mostly a vast field of golden jewels, studded with red and green stones,
ever changing. This moment was, perhaps, the most delightful of the
experience, for at the same time the air around me seemed to be
flushed with vague perfume—producing with the visions a delicious
effect—and all discomfort had vanished, except a slight faintness and
tremor of the hands, which, later on, made it almost impossible to
guide a pen as I made notes of the experiment; it was, however, with
an effort, always possible to write with a pencil. The visions never
resembled familiar objects; they were extremely definite, but yet always
novel; they were constantly approaching, and yet constantly eluding,
the semblance of known things. I would see thick, glorious fields of
- jewels, solitary or clustered, sometimes brilliant and sparkling, some-
times with a dull rich glow. Then they would spring up into flower-
like shapes beneath my gaze, and then seem to turn into gorgeous
butterfly forms or endless folds of glistening, iridescent, fibrous wings
of wonderful insects; while sometimes I seemed to be gazing into a
vast hollow revolving vessel, on whose polished concave mother-of-
pearl surface the hues were swiftly changing. I was surprised, not
only by the enormous profusion of the imagery presented to my gaze,’
but still more by its variety. Perpetually some totally new kind of
effect would appear in the field of vision; sometimes there was swift
movement, sometimes dull, somber richness of color, sometimes glitter
and sparkle, once a startling rain of gold, which seemed to approach
me. Most usually there was a combination of rich, sober color, with
jewel-like points of brilliant hue. Every color and tone conceivable
to me appeared at some time or another. Sometimes all the dif-
ferent varieties of one color, as of red, with scarlets, crimsons, pinks,
would spring up together, or in quick succession. But in spite of
this immense profusion, there was always a certain parsimony and
esthetic value in the colors-presented. They were usually associated
with form, and never appeared in large masses, or if so, the tone was
very delicate. I was further impressed, not only by the brilliance,
delicacy, and variety of the colors, but even more by their lovely and
540 MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE.

various textures—fibrous, woven, polished, glowing, dull, veined, semi-
transparent—the glowing effects, as of jewels, and the fibrous, as of
insects’ wings, being perhaps the most prevalent. Although the effects
were novel, it frequently happened, as I have already mentioned, that
they vaguely recalled known objects. Thus, once the objects presented
to me seemed to be made of exquisite porcelain, again they were like
elaborate sweetmeats, again of a somewhat Maori style of architecture;
and the background of the pictures frequently reealled, both in form
and tone, the delicate architectural effects as of lace carved in wood,
which we associate with the mouchrabieh work of Cairo. But always
the visions grew and changed without any reference to the character-
istics of those real objects of which they vaguely reminded me, and
when I tried to influence their course it was with very little success.
On the whole, I should say that the images were most usually what
might be called living arabesques. There was often a certain incom-
plete tendency to symmetry, as though the underlying mechanism was
associated with a large number of polished facets. The same image
was in this way frequently repeated over a large part of the field; but
this refers more to form than to color, in respect to which there would
still be all sorts of delightful varieties, so that if, with a certain uni-
formity, jewel-like flowers were springing up and expanding all over
the field of vision, they would still show every variety of delicate tone
and tint.

Weir Mitchell found that he could only see the visions with closed
eyes and in a perfectly dark room. I could see them in the dark with
almost equal facility, though they were not of equal brillianey, when
my eyes were wide open. I saw them best, however, when my eyes
were closed, in a room lighted only by flickering firelight. This evi-
dently accords with the experience of the Indians, who keep a fire
burning brightly throughout their meseal rites.

The visions continued with undiminished brilliance for many hours,
and as I felt somewhat faint and muscularly weak, I went to bed, as
*I undressed being greatly impressed by the red, scaly, bronzed, and
pigmented appearance of my limbs whenever I was not directly gazing
at them. I had not the faintest desire for sleep; there was a general
hyperzesthesia of all the senses as well as muscular irritability, and
every slightest sound seemed magnified to startling dimensions. I
may also have been kept awake by a vague alarm at the novelty of
my condition, and the possibility of further developments.

After watching the visions in the dark for some hours I became a
little tired of them and turned on the gas. Then I found that I was
able to study a new series of visual phenomena, to which previous
observers had made no reference. The gas jet (an ordinary flickering
burner) seemed to burn with great brilliance, sending out waves of
light, which expanded and contracted in an enormously exaggerated
manner. I was even more impressed by the shadows, which were in
all directions heightened by flushes of red, green, and especially violet.
MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE. 541

The whole room, with its white-washed but not very white ceiling,
thus became vivid and beautiful. The difference between the room as
I saw it then and the appearance it usually presents to me was the
difference one may often observe between the picture of a room and
the actual room. The shadows I saw were the shadows which the
artist puts in, but which are not visible in the actual scene under
normal conditions of casual inspection. I was reminded of the paint-
ings of Claude Monet, and as I gazed at the scene it occurred to me
that mescal perhaps produces exactly the same conditions of visual
hyperesthesia, or rather exhaustion, as may be produced on the artist
by the influence of prolonged visual attention. I wished to ascertain
how the subdued and steady electric light would influence vision, and
passed into the next room; but here the shadows were little marked,
although walls and floor seemed tremulous and insubstantial. and the
texture of everything was heightened and enriched.

About 3.30 a. m. I felt that the phenomena were distinctly diminish-
ing—though the visions, now chiefly of human figures, fantastic and
Chinese in character, still continued-—and I was able to settle myself
to sleep, which proved peaceful and dreamless. I awoke at the usual
hour and experienced no sense of fatigue nor other unpleasant remi-
niscence of the experience I had undergone. Only my eyes seemed
unusually sensitive to color, especially to blue and violet; I can, indeed, -
say that ever since this experience I have been more esthetically sen-
sitive than I was before to the more delicate phenomena of light and
shade and color.

It occurred to me that it would be interesting to have the experi-
ences of an artist under the influence of mescal, and I induced an
artist friend to make a similar experiment. Unfortunately no effects
whatever were produced at the first attempt, owing, as I have since
discovered, to the fact that the buttons had only been simply infused
and their virtues not extracted. To make sure of success the experi-
ment was repeated with four buttons, which proved to be an excessive
and unpleasant dose. There were paroxysmal attacks of pain at the
heart and a sense of imminent death, which naturally alarmed the sub-
ject, while so great was the dread of light and dilatation of the pupils
that the eyelids had to be kept more or less closed, though it was
evident that a certain amount of vision was still possible. The symp-
toms came on very suddenly, and when I arrived they were already
at their height. As the experiences of this subject were in many
respects very unlike mine, I will give them in his own words: ‘I
noticed first that as I happened to turn my eyes away from a blue
- enamel kettle at which I had been unconsciously looking, and which
_ was standing in the fender of the fireplace, with no tire in it, it seemed
to me that I saw a spot of the same blue in the black coals of the
grate, and that this spot appeared again, farther off, a little brighter
in hue. But I was in doubt whether I had not imagined these blue
spots. When, however, I lifted my eyes to the mantelpiece, on which
542 MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE.

were scattered all sorts of odds and ends, all doubt was over. I saw
an intensely vivid blue light begin to play around every object. A
square cigarette box, violet in color, shone like an amethyst. I turned
my eyes away and beheld this time, on the back of a polished chair, a
bar of color glowing likea ruby. Although I was expecting some such
manifestation as one of the first systems of the intoxication, I was
nevertheless somewhat alarmed when this phenomenon took place.
Such a silent and sudden illumination of all things around, where a
moment before I had seen nothing uncommon, seemed like a kind of
madness beginning from outside me, and its strangeness affected me
more than its beauty. <A desire to escape from it led me to the door,
and the act of moving had, I noticed, the effect of dispelling the colors.
But a sudden difficulty in breathing and a sensation of numbness at
the heart brought-me back to the arm-chair from which I had risen.
From this moment I had a series of attacks or paroxysms, which I can
only describe by saying that I felt as though I were dying. It was
impossible to move, and it seemed almost impossible to breathe. My
speedy dissolution, I half imagined, was about to take place, and the
power of making any resistance to the violent sensations that were
arising within was going, I felt, with every second.

“The first paroxysms were the most violent. They would come on
with tinglings in the lower limbs, and with the sensation of a nauseous
and suffocating gas mounting up into my head. Two or three times
this was accompanied by a color vision of the gas bursting into flame
as it passed up my throat. But I seldom had visions during the
paroxysms; these would appear in the intervals. They began with a
spurting up of colors; once, of a flood of brightly illuminated green
water covering the field of vision, and effervescing in parts, just as
when fresh water with all the air bubbles is pumped into a swimming
bath. At another time my eye seemed to be turning into a vast drop
of dirty water in which millions of minute creatures resembling tad-
poles were in motion. But the early visions consisted mostly of a
furious succession of colored arabesques, arising and descending or
sliding at every possible angle into the field of view. It would be as
difficult as to give a description of the whirl of water at the bottom of
a waterfall as to describe the chaos of color and design which marked
this period.

‘ Now also began another series of extraordinary sensations. They
set in with bewildering suddenness and followed one another in rapid
succession. These I now record as they occur to my mind at haphaz-
ard: (1) My right leg became suddenly heavy and solid; it seemed,
indeed, as if the entire weight of my body had shifted into one part, —
about the thigh and knee, and that the rest of my body had lost all
substantiality. (2) With the suddenness of a neuralgic pang, the back
of my head seemed to open and emit streams of bright color; this was
immediately followed by the feeling as of a draft blowing like a gale
through the hair in the same region. (3) At one moment the color,
MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE. 543

green, acquired a taste in my mouth; it was sweetish and somewhat
metallic; blue again would have a taste that seemed to recall phos-
phorus; these are the only colors that seemed to be connected with
taste. (4) A feeling of delightful relief and preternatural lightness
about my forehead, succeeded by a growing sensation of contraction.
(5) Singing in one of my ears. (6) A sensation of burning heat in the
palm of my left hand. (7) Heat about both eyes. The last continued
throughout the whole period, except for a moment when I had a sensa-
tion of cold upon the eyelids, accompanied with a color vision of the
wrinkled lid, of the skin disappearing from the brow, of dead flesh, and
finally of a skull.

“Throughout these sensations and visions my mind remained not
only perfectly clear, but enjoyed, I believe, an unusual lucidity. Cer-
tainly I was conscious of an odd contrast in hearing myself talk ration-
ally with H. H., who had entered the room a short time before, and
experiencing at the same moment the wild and extraordinary pranks
that were taking place in my body. My reason appeared to be the
sole survivor of my being. At times I felt that this, too, would go, but
the sound of my own voice would establish aga the communication
with the outer world of reality.

‘Tremors were more or less constant in my lower limbs. Persistent,
also, was the feeling of nausea. This, when attended by a feeling of
suffocation and a pain at the heart, was relieved by taking brandy,
coffee, or biscuit. For muscular exertion I felt neither the wish nor
the power. My hands, however, retained their full strength.

““It was painful for me to keep my eyes open above a few seconds;
the light of day seemed to fill the room with a blinding glare. Yet
every object, in the brief glimpse I caught, appeared normal in color
and shape. With my eyes closed, most of the visions, after the first
chaotic display, represented parts of the whole of my body undergoing
a variety of marvelous changes, of metamorphoses or illumination.
They were more often than not comic and grotesque in character,
though often beautiful in color. At one time I saw my right leg fill-
ing up with a delicate heliotrope; at another, the sleeve of my coat
changed into a dark green material, in which was worked a pattern in
red braid, and the whole bordered at the cuff with sable. Scarcely
had my new sleeve taken shape than I found myself attired in a
complete costume of the same fashion, medieval in character, but
I could not say to what precise period it belonged. I noted that a
chance movement—of my hand, for instance—would immediately call
up a color vision of the part exerted, and that this again would pass,
by a seemingly natural transition, into another wholly dissimilar.
Thus, pressing my fingers accidentally against my temples, the finger-
tips became elongated, and then grew into the ribs of a vaulting or of
a dome-shaped roof. But most of the visions were of a more personal
nature. I happened once to lift a spoonful of coffee to my lips, and
as I was in the act of raising my arm for that purpose a vision
544 MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE.

flashed before my closed (or nearly closed) eyes, in all the hues of the
rainbow, of my arm separated from my body, and serving me with
coffee from out of dark and indefinite space. On another occasion, as
I was seeking to relieve slight nausea by taking a piece of biscuit
passed to me by H. E., it suddenly streamed out into blue flame. For
an instant I held the biscuit close to my leg. Immediately my trousers
caught alight, and then the whole of the right side of my body, from
the foot to the shoulder, was enveloped in waving blue flame. It was
a sight of wonderful beauty. But this was not all. As I placed the
biscuit in my mouth it burst out again into the same colored fire
and illuminated the interior of my mouth, casting a blue reflection on
the roof. The light in the Blue Grotto at Capri, I am able to affirm,
is not nearly as blue as seemed for a short space of time the interior of
my mouth. There were many visions of which I could not trace the
origin. There were spirals and arabesques and flowers, and sometimes
objects more trivial and prosaic in character. In one vision i saw a
row of small white flowers, one against the other like pearls of a
necklace, begin to revolve in the form of a spiral. Every flower,
I observed, had the texture of porcelain. It was at a moment when I
had the sensation of my cheeks growing hot and feverish that I
experienced the strangest of all the color visions. It began with feeling
that the skin of my face was becoming quite thin and of no stouter
cousistency than tissue paper, and the feeling was suddenly enhanced
by a vision of my face, paper-like and semitransparent and some-
what reddish in color. To my amazement I saw myself as though
I were inside a Chinese lantern, looking out through my cheek into
the room. Not long after this I became conscious of a change in the
visions. Their tempo was more moderate, they were less frequent,
and they were losing somewhat in distinctness. At the same time
the feeling of nausea and of numbness was departing. <A _ short
period followed in which I had no visions at all, and experienced
merely a sensation of heaviness and torpor. I found that I was able
to open my eyes again and keep them fixed on any object in the room
without observing the faintest blue halo or prism, or bar of glowing
color, and that, moreover, no visions appeared on closing them. It
was now twilight, but beyond the fact of not seeing light or color,
either without or within, I had a distinct feeling that the action of the
drug was at an end and that my body had become sober suddenly. I
had no more visions, though I was not wholly free from abnormal sen-
sations, and I retired to rest. I lay awake till the morning, and with
the exception of the following night I scarcely slept for the next three
days, but I can not say that I felt any signs of fatigue, unless, per-
haps, on one of the days when my eyes, I noticed, became very sus-
ceptible to any indications of blue in an object. Of color visions, or of
any approach to color visions, there was no further trace; but all sorts
of odd and grotesque images passed in succession through my mind
MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE. 545

during part of the first night. They might have been the dreams of
a Baudelaire or of an Aubrey Beardsley. I would see figures with
prodigious limbs, or strangely dwarfed and curtailed, or impossible
combinations such as five or six fish, the color of canaries, floating
about in air in a gold wire cage. But these were purely mental images,
like the visions seen in a dream by a distempered brain.

“Of the many sensations of which my body had been the theater
during three hours, not the least strange was the feeling I experienced
on coming back into a normal condition. The recovery did not proceed
gradually, but the whole outer and inner world of reality came back, as
it were, with a bound. And for a moment it seemed strange. It was
the sensation—only much intensified—which everyone has known on
coming out into the light of day from an afternoon performance at a
theater, where one has sat in an artificial light of gas and lamps, the
spectator of a fictitious world of action. As one pours out with the
crowd into the street, the ordinary world, by force of contrast with the
sensational scenes just witnessed, breaks in upon one with almost a
sense of unreality. The house, the aspect of the street, even the light
of day appear a little foreign fora few moments. During these moments
everything strikes the mind as odd and unfamiliar, or at least with a
greater degree of objectivity. Such was my feeling with regard to my
old and habitual self. During the period of intoxication the connec-
tion between the normal condition of my body and my intelligence had
broken—my body had become in a manner a stranger to my reason—
so that now on reasserting itself it seemed, with referetce to my reason,
which had remained perfectly sane and alert, for a moment sufficiently
unfamiliar for me to become conscious of its individual and peculiar
character. It was as if I had unexpectedly attained an objective
knowledge of my own personality. I saw, as it were, my normal state
of being with the eyes of a person who sees the street on coming out
of the theater in broad day.

“This sensation also brought out the independence of the mind dur-
ing the period of intoxication. It alone appeared to have escaped the
ravages of the drug; it alone remained sane during a general delirium,
vindicating, so it seemed, the majesty of its own impersonal nature.
It had reigned for a while, I now felt, as an autocrat, without ministers
and their officiousness. Henceforth I should be more or less conscious

of the interdependence of body and brain; a slight headache, a touch
of indigestion, or what not, would be able to effect what a general
intoxication of my senses and nerves could not touch.”

I next made experiments on two poets, whose names are both well
known. One is interested in mystical matters, an excellent subject for
visions, and very familiar with various vision-producing drugs and proc-
esses. His heart, however, is not very strong. While he obtained
the visions, he found the effects of mescal on his breathing somewhat
unpleasant; he much prefers hasheesh, though recognizing that its

sm 97——35

effects are much more difficult to obtain. The other enjoys admirable
health, and under the influence of mescal he experienced scarcely the
slightest unpleasant reaction, but, on the contrary, a very marked state
of well being and beatitude. He took somewhat less than three but-
tons, so that the results were rather less marked than in my case, but
they were perfectly definite. He writes: ‘“‘I have never seen a succes-
sion of absolutely pictorial visions with such precision and such unac-
countability. It seemed as if a series of dissolving views were carried
swiftly before me, all going from right to left, none corresponding with
any seen reality. For instance, I saw the most delightful dragons,
puffing out their breath straight in front of them like rigid lines of
steam, and balancing white balls at the end of their breath! When I
tried to fix my mind on real things, I could generally call them up, but
always with some inexplicable change. Thus, I called up a particular
monument in Westminster Abbey, but in front of it, to the left, knelt a
figure in Florentine costume, like someone out of a picture of Botticelli;
and I could not see the tomb without also seeing this figure. Late in
the evening I went out 6n the Embankment and was absolutely fascei-
nated by an advertisement of ‘Bovril,’ which went and came in letters
of light on the other side of the river. I can not tell you the intense
pleasure this moving light gave me and how dazzling it seemed
tome. Two girls and a man passed me, laughing loudly, and lolling
about as they walked. I realized, intellectually, their coarseness, but
visually I saw them, as they came under a tree, fall into the lines of a
delicate picture; it might have been an Albert Moore. After coming
in I played the piano with closed eyes and got waves and lines of pure
color, almost always without form, though I saw one or two appear-
ances which might have been shields or breastplates—pure gold,
studded with small jewels in intricate patterns. All the time I had no
unpleasant feelings whatever, except a very slight headache, which
came and went. I slept soundly and without dreams.”

The results of music in the case just quoted—together with the
habit of the Indians to combine the drum with mescal rites, and my
own observation that very slight jarring or stimulation of the scalp
would affect the visions—suggested to me to test the influence of music
on myself. I therefore once more put myself under the influence of
mescal (taking a somewhat smaller dose than on the first occasion),
and lay for some hours on a couch with my head more or less in con-
tact with the piano, and with closed eyes directed toward a subdued
light, while a friend played, making various tests, of his own devising,
which were not explained to me until afterwards. I was to watch the
visions in a purely passive manner, without seeking to direct them,
nor was I to think about the music, which, so far as possible, was
unknown to me. The music stimulated the visions and added greatly
to my enjoyment of them. It seemed to harmonize with them, and, as
it were, support and bear them up. A certain persistence and monotony
of character in the music was required in order to affect the visions,
MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE. 5AT

which then seemed to fall into harmony with it, and any sudden change
in the character of the music would blur the visions, as though clouds
passed between them and me. The chief object of the tests was to
ascertain how far a desire on the composer’s part to suggest definite -
imagery would affect my visions. In about half the cases there was
no resemblance, in the other half there was a distinct resemblance,
which was sometimes very remarkable. This was especially the case
with Sehumann’s music, for example, with his Waldscenen and Kin-
derscenen; thus “The Prophet Bird” called up vividly a sense of
atmosphere and of brilliant feathery bird-like forms passing to and fro,
‘A Flower Piece” provoked constant and persistent images of vegeta-
tion, while “Scheherazade” produced an effect of floating white rai-
ment, covered by glittering spangles and jewels. In every case my
description was, of course, given before I knew the name of the piece.
Ido not pretend that this single series of experiments proves much,
but it would certainly be worth while to follow up this indication and
to ascertain if any light is hereby thrown on the power of a composer to
suggest definite imagery, or the power of a listener to perceive it.

It would be out of place here to discuss the obscure question as
to the underlying mechanism by which mescal exerts its magic
powers. It is clear from the foregoing descriptions that mescal
intoxication may be described as chiefly a saturnalia of the specific
senses, and, above all, an orgy of vision. It reveals an optical fairy-
land, where all the senses now and again join the play, but the mind
itself remains a self-possessed spectator. Mescal intoxication thus
differs from the other artificial paradises which drugs procure. Under
the influence of alcohol, for instance, as in normal dreaming, the intel-
lect is impaired, although there may be a consciousness of unusual
brilliance; hasheesh, again, produces an uncontrollable tendency to
movement and bathes its victim in a sea of emotion. The mescal
drinker remains calm and collected amid the sensory turmoil around
him; his judgment is as clear as in the normal state; he falls into no
- oriental condition of vague and voluptuous reverie. The reason why
mesceal is of all this class of drugs the most purely intellectual in its
appeal is evidently because it affects mainly the most intellectual of
the senses. On this ground it is not probable that its use will easily
develop into a habit. Moreover, unlike most other intoxicants, it seeins
to have no special affinity for a disordered and unbalanced nervous
system; on the contrary, it demands organic soundness and good
health for the complete manifestation of its virtues.’ Further, unlike
the other chief substances to which it may be compared, meseal does
not wholly carry us away from the actual world, or plunge us into
oblivion; a large ELD of its charm lies in the halo OF Deomay which it

‘Tt is true, as many persons ia, ae ned ‘ie be xoanindled, hath 3 in Peon and
states of overfatigue, symptoms closely resembling the slight and earlier phenomena
of mescal intoxication are not uncommon; but in such cases there is rarely any sense of
well-being and enjoyment.
548 MESCAL: A NEW ARTIFICIAL PARADISE.

casts around the simplest and commonest things. It is the most demo-
cratic of the plants which lead men to an artificial paradise. If it
should ever chance that the consumption of mescal becomes a habit,
the favorite poet of the meseal drinker will certainly be Wordsworth.
Not only the general attitude of Wordsworth, but many of his most
memorable poems and phrases can not—one is almost tempted to say—
be appreciated in their full significance by one who has never been
under the influence of mescal. On all these grounds it may be claimed
that the artificial paradise of mescal, though less seductive, is safe and
dignified beyond its peers.

At the same time it must be remembered that at present we are able
to speak on a basis of but very small experience, so far as civilized
men are concerned. The few observations recorded in America and
my own experiments in England do not enable us to say anything
regarding the habitual consumption of mescal in large amounts. That
such consumption would be gravely injurious I can not doubt. Its
safeguard seems to lie in the fact that a certain degree of robust health
is required to obtain any real enjoyment from its visionary gifts. It
may at least be claimed that for a healthy person to be once or twice
admitted to the rites of mescal is not only an Une baile delight, but
an educational influence of no mean value.
THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIKES.!

By MARQUIS DE NADAILLAC.

All discoveries and prehistoric studies testify to the unity of the
human species in all regions. While the fauna and flora vary from
continent to continent, even from island to island, man rests always
and everywhere the same. All human bones, however different in
origin and epoch, have belonged to man the same as we. In vain have
men sought to attach the skull of Neanderthal or that more recently
discovered at Trinil, in the Island of Java, to a humanity different
from ours. It has been recognized that the first is more modern than
was supposed and that analogous types” have been found belonging
to every epoch; while for the second, pompously decorated with the
name of Pithecanthropus erectus, after having read without prejudice
the remarkable study of Dr. Houzé,’ one is forced to abandon the
ambitious hopes which have been too lightly accepted. It is not from
isolated fragments that one can resolve the question of the existence
of a being intermediate between man and the anthropoids; and until
we can obtain absolute and decisive proofs we have the right to reject
the entire theory.

It is not alone by his bony structure that this identity of man in all
time and in all regions is to be affirmed. In my long anthropological
studies I have been more than once surprised to encounter everywhere
the same manifestation of man’s intelligence—the same creations due
to his initiative. When we visit the prehistoric collections in our
museums we are astonished to see everywhere the same forms and pro-
cesses of work and labor, and these among peoples separated by broad
oceans or by arid deserts.

The arrowheads of the Dakota, Apache, and Comanche Indians
show such curious resemblance to those discovered on the borders of
the Seine and Thames; the nuclei of Scandinavia compare well with

those of Mexico,' and if one exchanges the hatchets or the knives of
flint from Europe with similar objects from America it is difficult for
even experts to separate them, however well versed they may be in -
petrography and prehistoric archeology,? and it will be extremely
difficult to distinguish the races to which they belong.’ Vogt says*
this resemblance is so evident that one can easily confound the imple-
ments coming from entirely different sources. L’Anthropologie has
just published a description of stone instruments recently discovered
by P. Zumoffen in Phenicia. We can cite the same facts for Egypt,
and even in countries of classical antiquity we may find a prehistoric
period marked by productions analogous to our own regions.

What we have just said for the duration of the Paleolithic epoch can
be repeated for the Neolithic and in the aurora of modern times.
Everywhere chipped stone implements gave place to those of polished
stone. The hardest rocks—jasper, jade, jadeite, nephrite, chlorome-
lanite—from deposits in unknown regions, were polished by persevering
labor and became ornaments of ceremony and parade.

It will be easy to persevere and find these comparisons. Pottery
from widely separated regions is made in the same form and by the
same processes of fabrication, and even with the same ornamentation.
The spindle whorls in stone, bone, and pottery, found in settlements
succeeding each other on the hill of Hissarlik, recall those of the Swiss
lake dwellings. Those of Peru, Mexico, and even those in present use
among the Navajoes, are the same as those preserved in our museums,
whether they come from Italy, Germany, the south of France, or the
north of Scandinavia.?

The bow and the sling belonging to the Paleolithic period have been
found in all the countries then occupied. Their origin is unknown;
they date from the beginnings of humanity; their invention was the
first conquest of man, and they clearly mark his superiority over the
animal; they affirm the victory of intelligence over brute force. The
picks of deer horn were utilized in the mines of France and England,
of Spain and Belgium, the same as for the working of copper in Lake
Superior, jasper in Indiana, and petroleum in Ohio. A stone hammer
found at the foot of the Asturias is the same as those coming from the
most ancient American mines.®

In the Grecian Archipelago, as .n the regions known in America by
the name of the Far West, they placed their beams and posts of wood
in the walls in order to avoid the dangerous effects of earthquakes.

manner of construction, antique houses of Syria or Phenicia, and per-
haps the modern habitations of the Caucasus.

This revival of ancient usages among peoples apparently such
strangers to each other is not exceptional. The amentum! is found
among the savages of New Caledonia, and their sling stones in steatite,
still in use, do not differ from the sling stones of prehistoric times.
This fact was apparent at the Exposition of Budapest on the occasion
of the millennium of the Kingdom of Hungary. The river men of Theiss
in fishing employ a staff of very peculiar form, such as is found at the
mouth of the Volga. The sweep net used in Hungary is the same as
that on the shores of the Caspian Sea. The bone awls constantly used
by the shepherds of this country are analogous to those from the turf
pits of Holland. The “strike-a-lights” are the same as the prehistoric
arrowheads. The wooden hooks charged with pieces of metal that
served to lift the fishing lines from the bottom resemble those of the
lake dwellings of Switzerland.”

It would be easy to multiply examples, but I hasten to those still
more striking.

Man has in all times cared for the remains of his dead. Numerous
are the rites which belong to religion and sentiment and a belief in the
future, though sometimes similar rites are attached to curious supersti-
tions. With rare exceptions we can divide these rites into four kinds:
inhumation, cremation, mummification, and the stripping of the flesh
from the bones (décharnement). We will speak only of the-latter.

The stripping of the flesh from the bones after death was practiced
in Neolithic times, possibly at the close of the Paleolithic period, but it
continued during the Bronze Age. We see it in the Middle Ages in
certain parts of Europe, and it persists among certain races of savages
and even among races which we consider more civilized.

‘“‘After the idea that I have obtained from savage races,” says Du-
mont d’Urville, in speaking of the voyage of the Astrolabe, ‘‘ the inter-
ment or inhumation will be only the provisionary state and give the
necessary time to separate from the body its corruptible part, and the
repose does not begin until the bones are deposited in the sepulcher of
the ancestors.” Ido not know if so philosophic an idea has penetrated
the intellect of the Australians or Indians, but it is certain that these
men, entirely barbarous as we suppose them to be, braved fatigues and
even dangers in order to accomplish their duty toward their fel-
lows.? The ossuaries in all countries of Europe, and America as well,

clusion,” says Buckle (Hist. of Civilization, Vol. I, p. 20), ‘that, the actions of men
being determined solely by their antecedents, must have a character of uniformity ;
that is to say, must, under precisely the same circumstances, always issue to precisely
the same results.” But it isnecessary to add that the antecedents must be the same,
which has not been said by the eminent author aforesaid.

552 THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES.

are the sepulchers of a family, often of a tribe. At each new inhuma-
tion they make place for the skeleton by pushing -away the bones of
his predecessor. It is not possible to explain otherwise the mixture
that is found among the bones reposing in the sepulcher of such a
community.

The sepulchral grottoes of the Garenne and Misy are ossuaries in
which are mingled the stripped bones of numerous generations.!

In the first of these grottoes, situated in the Department of Marne,
the débris has been treated with a sort of respect due to an elevated
sentiment, and possibly a desire that the dead should not return to
trouble the living. The grotto measures 6 feet each way. It is paved
with rude calcareous slabs. <A staircase of six steps is at the entrance,
and the rock which forms the ceiling is upheld by eleven pillars. The
bones were arranged in a circle, and each pile, belonging to a separate
individual, was surmounted by his skull. The funeral furniture indi-
eated an epoch more ancient than the disposition of the sepulcher
would lead us to suppose. It comprised a vase of rude pottery fabri-
cated without the wheel, blades of flint and a collar of beads of shell
and certain isolated unios and mussels.

The prehistoric shelter of Sandron, the trou du Frontal at Furfooz,
the grottoes of Chaveau near Namur, are, according to MM. Fraipont
and Tihon, neolithic ossuaries. M. Cartailhac is of the same opinion in
regard to the grotto of Baumes Chaudes and that of Challes in Savoy.
Other archeologists have the same opinion as to the grotto de V/ Homme
Mort and of Boundalaou in Aveyron.? The learned Professor Pigorini
is of the same opinion in regard to certain neolithic sepulchers in Italy.
Similar ossuaries have been recognized in Germany and Spain.’

In 1832, Bruzelius admitted that the bones from the sepulehral mound
of Asa, in Scanie, Sweden, had been stripped of their flesh before
burial,‘ and he compares the mode of burial with the modes in usage
at Tahiti and in the kingdom of Siam. The same fact has been stated
of New Zealand by the Baron de Diiben of Luttra.°

I have said that this funeral rite, which so much wounds our sensi-
bilities and sentiments, has endured for many centuries among even
the most civilized races, and that it persists to our own day. One
could cite many facts demonstrating this, but I will present only a few.
The bones of St. Louis, who died in 1270, at Carthage, were brought to
St. Denis while the flesh and viscera were deposited in the abbey at
Montreal; it was the same thing for the Duke Leopold, of Austria,

1 Matériaux pour l’Histoire de /Homme. 1881, page 178.

?These have been studied by Dr. Prunieres and by M. Riviére (Assn. Franc.
Cong. de Besangon, 1893). Among the objects found was a cylinder made of a piece
of human femur (Acad. des Sciences, June 19, 1893). Was it an amulet or a trophy?

who died in Apulia; the flesh was interred at Mont Cassin and the
bones were transported to his own country by his servants.!

The ossuaries of Palermo are celebrated. The dead, after complete
dessication, were piously transported, and upon féte days their parents
and friends did not forget to visit them.

Mérimée, in his notes of the voyage in the west of France, mentions
the shrine of St. Herbot which belongs to the time of Louis XIV. The
bones of the dead were, after a certain number of years’ inhumation,
gathered and deposited in the shrine. Mérimée adds that the con-
structions destined to the same usage are numerous in different parts of
Brittany, and that no one of them antedates the Gothic period. Atthe
present time in certain parts of Switzerland, after the disappearance
of the flesh, they take the skull out of the earth or grave and place it
in the parish church, inseribed with the name of the deceased and the
date of his death. ‘There are evidences of ancient customs where all
the bones have been disposed in the same fashion.

If we traverse the ocean we will find similar conditions. Pigorini
notes the same thing among the Tahitians, the New Zealanders, the
aborigines of Fly River, the Papuans, the inhabitants of New Guinea,
and other peoples. The profound respect of the dead is one of the
characteristic traits of the Maories, says Quatrefages.’

The tribes remaining independent observe scrupulously the ancient
rites. The dead body is tabooed; they lament during several days
around the dead body before they confide it to the earth. At the end
of a certain time they remove it from its temporary tomb, and the
bones, carefully gathered, are carried to a cavern known only to the
initiated and is extremely tabooed.

In America the examples are not less numerous or less interesting.’
The same rite exists from the St. Lawrence to the Mississippi and in
South America. The death of an Indian, recounted by Sir John Lub-
bock? is followed by particular ceremonies. When the flesh was
detached from the bones they were suspended in the air on a bed of
reeds or interlaced branches, that they might be dried by the sun and
bleached by the rain. The most distinguished women of the tribe are
charged with the duty of drying the bones. During the pious cere-
mony the Indians, covered with long mantles, their faces blackened
with soot, march about, striking the earth with staffs to frighten off the
_valichus (evil spirits) from the corpse. The bones are then loaded upon
the favorite horse of the deceased and carried to the sepulcher of his
ancestors.

Ancient traditions of these customs have been transmitted from gen-
eration to generation. Every twelve years the Hurons celebrated the

HbA THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES.

féte of the dead. Brebceuf has preserved the description of one of
these solemnities at which he was present in 1634.1. The four nations
which formed the confederation of the Hurons placed their dead upon
an elevated scaffolding; when the day of the féte approached, the sad
remains were lowered to the earth and the coverings or envelopes
removed. Hach family recognized its own, stripped off the flesh still
remaining, and, with caresses and embraces, showed the greatest ten-
derness. Then the bones were enveloped in rich furs and borne to the
common ossuary, often a considerable distance, and which was to be
reached by pathways known only to the members of the gens.

Among the Indians of Chiriqui, whenever a member of the family
was dangerously ill, they brought the sukia, the doctor, or the sorcerer,
whichever you would ¢all him. If he gave no hope of recovery the
relatives of the dying individual carried him to the neighboring forest,
suspended his hammock from the trees, and abandoned him, depositing
near by a gourd of water and some green plantains. At the end of a
year, when decomposition had done its work, a member of the tribe
returned to the forest and gathered and cleaned the bones, which were |
then taken to the huacas where reposed the bones of his ancestors.’

The burial of the bones after the removal of the flesh has, therefore,
been a custom widely extended during the centuries. Cremation was
more general than has been thought, and recent researches, if we
accept the opinion of M. Cartailhac, was an excellent mode of removal
of the flesh from the bones, and above all when the burning or crema-
tion was only partial.’

But if the rite rested the same in principle among different peoples,
the processes varied greatly. Among the Patagonians, for example,
the flesh was often artificially removed from the bones. The stria on
the bones made by flint knives was well known and is conclusive testi-
mony of this. Often they were abandoned to natural decomposition,
which produced all that could have been done by a provisional burial
or by prolonged action of atmospheric influences. The Salivas, on the
borders of the Orinoco, had recourse to a more expeditious method.
They plunged the corpse into the river, retaining it by a cord. At the
end of two days the flesh had entirely disappeared from the bones,
having been devoured by the fish. The bones were then gathered in
baskets and suspended from the roofs of houses. Among the Persians
of the sect of Zoroaster inhumation and cremation were both prohib-
ited; so the dead body was suspended in open air and abandoned. It
thus became the prey of the vultures. The Parsees rigorously practice
to this day the same rite, and the lugubrious Towers of Silence near
Bombay contain piles of bones of successive generations, from which
the flesh had been stripped by the birds of heaven. Father Lafitau?

_reports that the South Americans ate the bodies of warriors killed in
combat and afterwards carried their bones in the guise of standards.
This is also the custom among the Indians of North America. In their
frequent migrations they transport with them the bones of their fathers
who have thus perished.! At the present time the Banis, Chams, and
Musulmen of Annam bury the bodies of their dead in a ditch or grave
without a coffin. One or two years afterwards they gather the bones,
which are placed on a small bier and carried to the common cemetery.’

M. Petrie believes that he has discovered the existence of a new race
in Kgypt. This race lived on the west bank of the Nile to the south of
Abydos, and about 30 miles north of Thebes. The tombs contained,
instead of mummies, skeletons in a crouching position. These, accord-
ing to the learned Englishman, were the Lybians who invaded Kgypt
near the end of the ancient empire about three thousand years before
our era. The Lybians are said to have eaten the flesh of their dead,
partially at least. But the facts on which this saying is based inay
also be explained by the removal of the flesh in the open air prior to the
definite burial.’

We will not pursue this lugubrious enumeration. We have said
enough to show that this strange funeral rite is encountered in all parts
of the globe. The identity of these conceptions of man, difficult to
separate from the identity of its origin, is perhaps still more marked
when we find that from the most ancient times the human bones were
colored red before being deposited in their last resting place. The
examples are numerous, and it is necessary to go into details.

The first discovery by which the curious fact was made known is due
to M. Riviére.* In 1872 he discovered in the grotto of Baoussé-Roussé,
near Mentone, the skeleton of an adult, the skull of which was covered
with red patine due to a thin coat of sanguine. The skeleton had upon
the head a string of small shells (nerites). By its side was a poniard
made from the radius of one of the deer kind, about twenty canine
teeth, also from the deer tribe, and other arms and ornaments precious
and destined, without doubt, for the use of the dead in the new world
into which he was about to enter. Among the animal bones scattered
through the cavern were those of the cave tiger (felis spelwus), the
cave bear (Ursus spelwus), rhinoceros, and the hog (Sus scrofa), and still
others belonging to the Quaternary epoch. Three other skeletons were
found in the same cavern, or those adjoining. The bones of the adults
were covered with peroxide of iron, which gave them a strong red color.
Three skeletons of children were also brought to light, none of which
bore any traces of color. We are, therefore, in presence of a rite per-
fectly characterized as being applied only to adults. M. Cartailhac has

concluded from these facts that the corpses were despoiled of their,
flesh probably by a rapid process, for nearly all the bones preserved
their natural position and were still united by their tendons and liga-
meuts.

The later discoveries have gone to confirm those of Baoussé-Roussé.
M. Hardy found at Ramonden, in the commune of Chancelade, Dor-
dogne, a grave containing Peorerane the bones of which were reddened
by oligist.'. They belonged to a man of about fifty-five or sixty years of
age, 5 feet in height, with large head, strongly dolichocephalic, face
large and high, orbits the same, strong under jaw, bones relatively long,
and hands and feet large. The bones were stout and thick, with pro-
nounced muscular attachments. The forehead and the capacity of the
skull resembled those of the highest and most cultivated races.” This
skeleton of Chancelade assuredly can not fill the gap which exists
between man and other zoological groups.’

The right temporal region presented traces of a wound measuring
63 by 50 millimeters, of which the reparatton was well defined, showing
that the individual had survived the wound. With the Bkolewon was
found a baton de commandement in reindeer horn, on which had been
engraved a representation of alca impennis, a pendant with the head of
a mountain sheep, and seven small personages. The industry of the
Madelainien epoch is here definitely characterized.

There was a fireplace or layer of ashes and cinders 144 inches in
thickness. At the base there was a small vein, colored like red brick,
with peroxide of iron. Was it by contact with this small vein that the
bones had taken their red tint, or is it not more probable that the
ferruginous stratum had been applied after the removal of the flesh
and the exposure of the bones? M. Hardy, who studied the conditions
in place, pronounced in favor of the latter hypothesis, although he did
not dissimulate the possibility that during an inundation the red ocher
spread itself throughout the sepulcher and may have covered the skel-
eton, and so each of the bones become impregnated with the coior.

Abbé Tournier and M. Charles Guillon excavated a cavern which
had been occupied by man after the retreat of the quaternary glaciers
near the village of Rossilon, department of Ain, known by the name

tions of Broca, given in Revue d’Anthropologie in 1882 by Dr. Topinard, shows
rarely, but still shows, a cranial capacity clearly more. The skull from Grenelle,
belonging to the epoch of chipped flint, measures 1,552 cubic centimeters; the skulls
of L’Homme Mort cube 1,606 cubic centimeters; one from the grotto of Baye, 1,554
cubic centimeters; that of Vauréal, 1,533 cubic centimeters. The last three belong
to the Neolithic, period. I know only one prehistoric skull, that found by M. Siret,
which surpasses that of Chancelade. It measures 1,716 cubic centimeters.

of Grotto of Hoteaux.! The fireplaces, that is to say, the ashes, cov-
ered an area of about 71 square yards, wherein have been found numer-
ous worked objects. The flakes, scrapers, points, and gravers of
flint, poniards and needles of bone, with divers other ornaments, prin-
cipally of teeth and shell perforated for suspension, and engraved bones,
among which was a baton de commandement of reindeer horn orna-
mented with a figure of adeer. Animal bones abounded. The animals
belonged in general to the fauna of the later quaternary period. Those
of the reindeer (Cervus tarandus) are found in the lower fireplaces or
ash beds; those of the deer (Cervus elaphas) in the upper ones.

The skeleton of a young person, 15 to 18 years of age, was extended
in the midst of the débris and ashes of the oldest fireplace.” The bones
were covered with red ocher, and were in their natural position. MM.
D’Acy and Boule, whose authority in such matters will not be denied,
have classed this burial with the reindeer age. The sepulchers of
Baoussé—Roussé, Raymonden, and Hoteaux, afford certain proofs that
the custom of reddening human bones dates from the Paleolithic period
and, possibly, we ought to assign to the same period the skeletons from
the Grotte des Hommes near St. More (Yonne).’ Further excavations
have, unfortunately, given results not so complete nor conclusive as
those just cited. Most of the débris found was in a fragmentary state
and could not be determined. We have only recognized the human
teeth and phalanges incrusted in calcareous concretions. Many of
these bones have been colored, probably by the action of fire.*

The Neolithic period has furnished other and more interesting exam-
ples. All those interested in prehistoric anthropology know of the
great discoveries of Judge Piette in Mas d’Azil, 1887-88. One must
admire the science with which these excavations were directed, and
the care and exactness with which our learned colleague has described
them.°

If we follow from top to bottom the different strata of the deposit on
the left banks of the Arise, where it enters the cavern (Mas d’Azil), we
will find successively :

A. Blocks of stone, with a varying thickness of from 24 to 6 feet,
fallen from the roof.

B. A layer of ashes 2 feet in thickness containing vast numbers of
snails (Helix nemoralis), and the bones of deer, wild boar, ox, and goat,
and associated with them, flint blades and pieces finely worked, scra-
pers, points and burnishers of bone, walnuts and hazelnuts, acorns,
seeds of the maple, vestiges of chestnuts, nuts of the prune, cheney,

and plum. This bed. says M. Piette, corresponds to the kitchen-
middings. |

©. A third bed or layer, about the same thickness as the preceding,
contained similar implements and bones. We note, however, the pres-
ence of harpoons, perforated and of oval form; and also the numerous
colored waterworn pebbles described by M. Piette.’ It was in this layer
that he found a portion of a human skeleton, the flesh of which had
been removed and the bones reddened with peroxide of iron.? The
strice or lines on one of the femurs made by flint blades was apparent.
The skull and small bones were missing. The long bones were placed
in a pile along with the lower jaw. M. Piette is of the opinion that
these bones were incontestibly contemporary with the colored pebbles,
and that both belonged to the commencement of the Neolithic period.

In the session of the Society of Anthropology, Paris, July 18, 1595,
our colleague showed several of the human bones gathered in the grotto
of Mas d’Azil. The red color remained despite recent washing.

Such is a résumé of the communications of M. Piette to the Society
of Anthropology.’ Since then he has published still another paper in
the same bulletins, wherein he says: ‘‘ I have met in this formation two
skeletons buried after having had the flesh removed and colored red by
peroxide of iron.” M. Boule found in the same layer a small pile of
wheat grain, but which fell to-dust as soon as touched. If the deposit
belonged, as M. Piette thinks, to the beginning of the Neolithic period, .
it will be evident that man then knew to sow, cultivate, gather, and
preserve wheat.

In 1880 Professor Pigorini, at the Congress at Lisbon, pointed out
analogous facts. In a Neolithic tomb, quarried in the travertine near
Anagni in central Italy, there was found the facial portion of a human
skull colored red with cinnabar.t| Two arrow points associated with
these remains were similarly colored. The fact that the coloring was
limited to these three objects nullifies the idea of its having been done
by infiltration, and establishes the fact that it was due to a voluntary
act of man.’ i

A short time after this M. de Rossi discovered the sepulcher of
Sgurgola® and M. Incoronato described the skeleton which was brought
to light. The frontal portion of the skull and upper jaw were painted
a deep red, due to cinnabar.’

The tomb was a little niche dug or quarried in the travertine. It
contained, along with the skeleton, a black hand-made pottery vase,
some arrowheads, a stone hammer, and a bronze lance head.

The grotto of Arene-Candide near Finale-Marina (province of Genoa)
has also furnished human bones sprinkled with iron oligist, due doubt-
less to the red patine with which it had been covered. M. Orsi, whose
long excavations in Sicily have been so fruitful, excavated this and
other caves, some with a diameter of from 6 to 10 feet, wherein had
been laid from twenty to twenty-five dead of the Sikeles, the ancient
inhabitants. It is evident that they were deposited after the flesh had
been stripped from the bones. These bones, notably in the burial
place of Lapaci, near Palermo, bore traces of red paint; and if one
argues aS to their small number, we should not forget that the color
was not fixed by baking, like that on clay or pottery, and would not be
preserved in the dry caves.!

In the Anthropological Congress at Lisbon M. Delgado announced
analogous discoveries in the grotto of Furninha, a cave of Portugal,
occupied by man from the most ancient times.

Professor Pigorini, who has studied this. question with his habitual
skill, believes that the skeletons were placed in their tomb after the
flesh had been removed, and that the bones had been sometimes painted
and colored with red ochre, other times with cinnabar or oligist. Our
knowledge of the state of affairs points to that as the present conclusion.

Passing from the Mediterranean to the shores of the Black Sea we
find the same funeral rite.

According to a communication of M. Antonovitch to the Congress of
Vilna,’ the application of red color to human bones is frequently seen
in the countries belonging to the Russian Empire. The custom exists
in Bessarabia, in New Russia, in Crimea, and the Ukraine, as well as in
Poland, in the provinces of Kiew and Poltava, and in Siberia. This
can be shown by examples.

Professor Wasselowski found in the Crimea two tombs containing—
the first six skeletons, the other but one, all of which were colored red.
Professor Grembler, of Breslau, after examination, attributed them to
the Cimmeriens, who inhabited the Crimea in the time of Herodotus.
The Cimmeriens exposed their dead in elevated places, to the end that
the birds should devour the flesh. The bones, being thus cleaned, were
painted with a mineral.

Three such tombs had been found in the Crimea. They are also.
said to have been found in Central Asia, but have not been sufficiently
studied to be quoted.’ The kourganes (Russian burial mounds) that
contained human bones are generally poor, the excavations having
furnished only a few pieces of pottery, some stone implements, and

occasional traces of bronze. The skeletons were stretched upon the
back, the legs slightly drawn up. M. Antonovitch does not believe
that the bones were cleaned before burial. He thinks that the corpses
were covered with a layer of red ocher, and the soft parts becoming
decomposed, the color impregnated the bones.

This same layer of ocher has been recognized by M. Ossowski in the
kourganes of Ukraine, where it attained the thickness of half a centi-
meter. The discovery in one of these sepulchres of an amphora of
Greek origin allows a great latitude in their date. According to M.
Zaborowski they might vary from the second century Bb. C. to the
third century A. D.!

At Kobrynowa, not far distant from the Dnieper and the Black Sea,
a kourgane (burial mound) contained twelve graves, the bodies laid
near the surface, but without regularity. The graves were trough-like
in form, about 5 feet in length, 28 to 30 inches in width, and 20 to 25
inches in depth. The walls were of clay, well mixed, which had been
originally sustained by joists and boards, all of which, however, had
disappeared centuries ago. These tombs contained fifteen skeletons,
all covered with a coat of red ferruginous paint of a variable thickness.?

M. Lygin anticipated M. Wasselowski in the Crimea. He had exea-
vated numerous kourganes in the districts of Yalta and Theodosia.
He tells us that the skeletons were sometimes extended at full length,
sometimes drawn up, but that the bones were always colored red. In
most of the tombs he found, near the skeleton, a small pottery vase
filled with ashes. This is confirmed by M. Vassilowitz. These repre-
sented, according to one or the other of these explorers, a funeral rite
which they were unable to understand.’ Count Brobinski tells us of
the result of his excavations, in 1887, of fifty-two kourganes in the
Province of Kiew. The bones, and principally the skulls, had been
colored red by the use of peroxide of iron, remnants of which were
found near the skeletons. The tombs dated from the Neolithic period.
The funeral furniture comprised implements of stone and of reindeer
horn. Amoug the animal bones they found those of a rodent-that had
disappeared from the country centuries before.*| M. Ossowski cites
similar discoveries in Poland,® and M. Vitkowski does the same for the
valley of Kitoi, Province of Irkutsk, Eastern Siberia. The dead were
buried with the arms, implements, and ornaments destined for their
use in the new life on which they were then entering. The corpses had
been covered with a thick layer of red ocher mixed with sand. The
decomposition of the flesh had aided the impregnation of the bones.

THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES. 561

In all the Russian Empire, from the Caspian Sea to Poland, and from
the Black Sea to the confines of China, there have been found in the
tombs of antiquity human bones colored red. The question is whether
this was the work of man after the destruction of the flesh, or was
due to impregnation from the layers of ocher or cinnabar with which
the corpses were covered. There was a variation according to the time
and place, and both of them are believed to have been part of the same
funeral rite. The date of these burials is more difficult to fix. The
kourganes were for centuries the habitual mode of burial.' If they
were posterior to the formation of the celebrated layer of black earth,
they certainly dated from a time when stone alone was employed for
arms and implements in the usages of life—that is to say, at the begin-
ning of the Neolithic period, and, we might add, subject to a certain
doubt, that the more ancient of them may have dated from the close of
the Paleolithic period.

M. Rk. von Wenzier] tells us of a series of sepulchers near Lobositz,
a Small town on the Elbe.” One of the tombs or graves in the loess
contained the skeleton of a woman extended on her back, the skull,
subdolichocephalic, bore very apparent traces of a dark-red coloring
matter. Bracelets of shells alternating with teeth of the dog and lynx
were found on the limbs. The neighboring tombs have furnished a
great number of pottery vases, often richly ornamented, polished stone
hatchets, and stone hammers. M. von Wenzierl is of the opinion that
these tombs belong to the Neolithic period. It is necessary to add
that he does not mention any coloration of human bones, other than
above cited.

An analogous discovery has been reported from Brunn (Moravia),
but as no details have been given I can do no more than mention it.

I know of no similar coloration to have been found in England,
whether in the alluvial, the caves, or the barrows (mounds).°

M. Dupont has found fragments of cinnabar in the caverns of the
Lesse, in Belgium, but there is nothing to show whether it was destined
for the toilets of the living or intended for the decoration of the dead.

Africa furnishes but little light upon this question. The difficulty of
excavation is sufficient to explain a gap which probably the future
may fill. Lieutenant Hannezo, of the Algerian sharpshooters, is pur-
suing interesting researches at Mahedia, Tunis.*

Mahedia is an ancient Phenician port which, judging from the num-
ber of burials, was important enough in ancient times. The Phenician
tombs were utilized by the Romans, and the graves of the vanquished
became the resting places of the victors. But of this the determina-
tion is difficult. A well of square or rectangular form served as an

entrance. Steps on the side of the wall led to a door closed by astrong
slab; the slab lifted and it was easy to enter a vast chamber, the walls
of which, in volcanic tufa, were in ledges. On these ledges graves
were cut as in the form of troughs. The floor of the tomb was covered
with fragments of bone and pottery, and the two funeral rites, burial
and cremation, were not infrequently encountered in the same tomb.
Two corpses, or the remains thereof, one buried in a coffin of wood, the
other cremated and in a cinerary urn, would be found placed almost
together on the same ledge. In two tombs the explorers found frag-
ments of skulls colored red on the outside by oligist. The bones were
so decayed that they could not be measured. The capacity of the
skulls was remarkably large. The well evidently belonged to the
Phenicians, for this was their habitual mode of burial. Phenician and
Roman lamps were found together. Despite this fact, Dr. Collignon,
after a profound study of the bones, did not hesitate to attribute them
either to the Phenicians or to the Liby-Phenicians.' Although this
conclusion is supported by excellent arguments, it does not appear
absolutely demonstrated. I content myself with the opinion that the
bones and ashes gathered at Mahedia are of high antiquity.

If we traverse the Atlantic we find the same facts. Dr. Ten Kate, in
a recent exploration in California, gives many examples of human bones
colored red by oxide of iron. These abound in the island of the Holy
Spirit (Hspiritu Santo). M. Diguet reports analogous facts in Lower
California. Some years ago there were presented to the Society of
Anthropology at Paris a mummified head from a burial place in Bolivia.’
The forehead and back of the head were painted red. The explorers
declared the rite to have extended throughout the region.

It is scarcely possible to speak of America without recalling the dis-
coveries of Dr. Marcano in the basin of the upper Orinoco.’ Notably,
he excavated the theretofore unknown cavern d’Ibi-Iboto. He gath-
ered skulls of twenty-four males and twenty-five females. The fore-
head, he said, is retreating, the orbits are strong and powerful, the
glabella voluminous, with heavy projecting eyebrows. Among the
masculine skulls twelve were dolichocephalic, eight were mesaticephalie,
and two only brachycephalic. The average cranial capacity was 1,375
cubic centimeters. The cephalic index of the female skulls were slightly _
greater than 80. Several skulls, representing both sexes, were colored
red. Others, on the contrary, were without any trace of color. This,
therefore, was not a funeral rite common to all the members of the
tribe, and we do not know the circumstances which determined its
adoption. It is difficult to fix the epoch of these burials. The objects
in stone made default, while the pottery was abundant.. The urns,
often filled with ashes, were well made, the covers surmounted by

animal figures—monkeys and crocodiles. The tapirs were rudely exe-
euted. Other vases had Grecian decoration, like meanders, and com-
binations of lines entirely strange to the Indians of South America,
and, if one is permitted a comparison, it is necessary to go as far north
as Yucatan to find them.

Finally, the human bones colored red are encountered frequently in
the ancient sepulchers of Australia,! and we know that this usage was
general among a great number of tribes belonging to the Papuans and
the Melanesian group.

The conclusion of this part of our study is easy. The accumulated
proof renders it incontestable that the funeral rite of cleaning the bones
and coloring them red was practiced in different countries widely sepa-
rated by sea or desert. Thucydides says the history of a people is to
be sought in their tombs. In the cases cited, the tomb has responded
and has thrown a clear light on the earliest origin of- the rite, and at
the same time on the common origin of man. A question arising from
these facts is, whether they relate to religious or funeral rites. But
this is comparatively of small importance. It was surely a custom of
the unknown ancestors of these peoples, transmitted from generation to
generation. These facts do not allow us to say that primitive life was
everywhere the same, nor that if the productions of men are every-
where the same, they are always to satisfy the same needs. In the
strange rite that we have recounted, a rite which has required much
thought and multiplied cares and which one can believe were strange
to barbarous and nomadie races, it is not a question of similar needs
growing out of similar creations. In order to find a solution it is neces-
sary to seek higher and farther; it is the identity of the genius of man
in all times and in all regions that should be inquired of, and it is only
there that it can be found.’

The mysterious Swastika sign, born in undefined regions and rapidly
extended over the entire world, goes to support this hypothesis. We
will seek the lessons it teaches.

For a long time the Swastika (the croix gammée, a greek cross, with
arms bent to the right at right angles) has been regarded as an Aryan
sign, even the Aryan sign par excellence. From this, or from its
apparent place of origin, the name Indian (East Indian) has been given
it, a name difficult at present to maintain because of the daily dis-
coveries of its diffusion or spread among absolute strangers to the
Aryan race.?

°The literature upon the Swastika has increased in late years until it has become a
library. In 1889 Count Goblet d’Alviella made a communication to the Royal Acad-
emy of Belgium entitled La croix gammée, or Swastika. It has since been enlarged
_and published under the title La migration des Symboles, Paris, 1891. An English
translation appeared with an introduction and note by Sir G. Birdwood. Among
564 THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES.

It appears from the researches made during late years that the origin
even of the Swastika sign appears to be contested. Thus we read in
the work of Count Goblet d’Alviella,' one of those who has best studied
the question :

‘The croix grammée (Swastika) appears from prehistoric times among
the peoples originating in the valley of the Danube, who have respec-
tively colonized the Troad and the north of Italy. It extends with the
products of this antique culture, on one side, among the Greeks, Etrus-
eans, Latins, Gauls, Germans, British, and Scandinavians; on the
other side, to Asia Minor, Persia, the Indies, and to China and Japan.”

Such is also the opinion of M. Salomon Reinach.” According to him
the sign of the Swastika already represented in the city of Hissarlik,
prior, according to all probabilities, to the thirteenth century B.C., did
not penetrate the Indies until after that period.’ He continues that
one does not find the symbol in Egypt,* nor in Pheenicia, nor Assyria;
while, on the other hand, it is frequent in northern Italy, in the valley
of the Danube, in Thrace, in Greece, and on the western shores of Asia
Minor. Thence comes his conclusions that we should seek in Europe
for its origin.°

I do not pretend to contradict this, but the first discovery of the
Swastika on the hill of Hissarlik determines that this was not its place
of origin. Whence came this mysterious sign which we see at Troy?
To what rite does it belong? Where did it originate? These are ques
tions we would like to have answered. In the present state of our
knowledge, the question is insoluble. One point excites my interest,
that is the long persistence of the Swastika and its rapid diffusion
throughout such different regions. I see in this an important argument

recent publications were those of Michael Zmigrodzki, Zur Geschichte der Swas-
tika, Brunswick, 1890, and Thomas Wilson, The Swastika, Washington, 1896, Eminent
savants in all countries have been occupied with the question of its origin and
signification, but it appears, nevertheless, that it is not yet entirely cleared, for
Dr. Brinton writes: ‘‘It is easy to read into barbaric scratches the thoughts of later —
times, and we must acknowledge that something more than the figure itself is needed
to prove its symbolic sense.” aoe

°M. Reinach afterwards recognized that the Swastika mentioned by Goblet d’Al-
viella on certain ingots of silver in the form of dominoes, serving as money, and
also those with inscriptions in honor of Acoka, belonged to the third century B. C.
L’Anthropologie, 1894, page 248.

4Flinders Petrie has found at Naukratis certain vases ornamented with the Swas-
tika (Third Memoir Egyptian Exploration Fund), but this pottery appears to have
been imported from Caria or from Cyprus. Stuffs ornamented with the same sign
have also been discovered at Panopolis, Upper Egypt, but these have been attributed
to Greek workmen who were numerous at Coptos, a neighboring village where Cler-
mont Ganneau has recently discovered a Greek inscription. Acad. des Inscriptions,
March 5, 1897 (Iorrer, Die Griiber und Textilfunde von Achmim Panopolis).

5“As for India, everything induces the belief that the Swastika was there intro-
duced from Greece, from the Caucasus, or from Asia Minor, by routes as yet
unknown.” Goblet d’Alviella, La migration des symboles, page 107.

THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN SPECIES. 565

in favor of the unity of the human species. This argument should be
further presented and such facts produced as justify it.

An infant, the child of a savage, might amuse himself by tracing in
the sand or on stone, or on the first object that came under his hand,
squares, circles, crosses, and lines, making all imaginable angles; with
progress the child can reproduce the images of his mind, the scenes
that strike him most, even to bizarre figures which are due only to his
imagination. He will not produce a sign as complicated as the Swas-
tika unless he has, or has had, it before his eye, or unless it shall have
been transmitted to him by his ancestors. It is puerile to explain its
presence in so many and such widely separated regions by the theory
of the identity of the psychologic state among human races which
have the same rudimentary culture.

The mysterious Swastika’ figured on the idols and spindle whorls? of
the ancient Dardania, on the diadem of the daughters of Priam, and
on the numberless objects from the early cities on the hill of Hissarlik,®
in the sacred temples of India, as on the bas relief of Ibriz, attributed
to the Hittites,* on Celtic funeral urns, and on the hut urns of Albano
or Corneto, a curious imitation of the habitations of the living wherein
they have piously deposited the ashes of the dead.’

We see the Swastika on the balustrades of the porticos of the temple
of Athena at Pergamos, on the sculptured ceiling of the Treasury at
Orchomenos, on the vases of Milo and Athena, those of Bologna, the
ancient Felsina of the Htruscans,° of Cxere (Cervetri),’ Cumes,’? Cyprus,?

says has been given the name Suavastika. [Mr. Virchand R. Gandhi reports that
while studying an ancient Sanscrit philosophy, in the British Museum library, he
found the word Suavastika in connection with Swastika.—T. W.]

*The number of these objects casts a doubt upon their use as spindle whorls only.
They may have been religious objects, a sort of ex-voto, for example.

citanias, those strange fortified towns of Portugal, some of which date
from Neolithic times;° Chantre in the tombs in Caucasus,‘ and the
Russian archeologists on the bronze objects from their country in the
Museum of Moscow.

The Swastika has been found in France, in the tumuli (mounds) of
Haguenau, engraved on the cinctures of bronze.’ It is perpetuated on
objects posterior or strange to the Roman domination. For example,
on those taken in the Frankish tombs opened at Colombe (Loire-et-
Cher), on a funeral stele at the Museum of Toulouse, on a vase at the
Museum of Rouen,’ on the cinctures, Gallo-Roman or Merovingian, near
La Feére.”? The Swastika also is found on a Celto-Roman altar erected
at Ambloganna, in England by a Dacian legion in honor of Zeus or
Jupiter! On the right and left are two circles, rayed after the fashion
of stars, which Gaidoz believes to be a representation of the sun.” The
Laplanders still engrave the Swastika on their drums intended to be
used in magic rites.

The Chinese decorate with it their standards, instruments of music,
and their cannon.” The Japanese employ it as a mark on their pottery,
and the Hindus paint it in red on their houses at the beginning of the
New Year, and make it with flour or sacred rice upon a table or stand

when entering a house or church as a sign of good luck or good wishes,
or the occasion ofa wedding or féte.'

The diffusion of a sign so complicated as the Swastika throughout all
‘time and in all countries is something to be remarked, and of which
we should recognize the impurtance. Our astonishment is doubled
when we find the same symbol among the Ashantes on the western
coast of Africa,’ and then see it figured in America among the most
ancient civilization of which we have any knowledge. By what migra-
tion has it crossed the Atlantic, by what migrations has it penetrated
such distant countries and appeared among races of men so different?
And if, as we believe, all these representations are due to an indigenous
art, either Indian or African, where did they obtain their model? Our
ignorance on these points is complete, and the most we can do is to give
a résumé of the principal known facts.

The Swastika has been found engraved on a shell from a mound in
Tennessee which contained 32 human burials,’ on plates (five) of cop-
per from the mounds of Chillicothe, Ohio,‘ a stone hatchet from Pem-
berton, N. J., on an Arkansas vase in the National Museum, on a silver
ornament, the authenticity of which appears incontestable, and which
was shown in 1887 at the reunion of the Association Francaise at
Toulouse.°

Nordenskiold cites numerous examples of the Swastika now engraved
in straight lines, other times indicated by dots, among the cave dwell-
ers of Mesa Verde, and the same is done by Max Miiller in Yucatan
and Paraguay, while cther savants have found it under the huacas of
Peru and among savage tribes of Brazil, where the triangular pieces of
pottery, sometimes bearing the mysterious Swastika sign. often form
the only dress of the women.®

We find it in the paintings of the Navajos’ and on the ornaments of
the Pueblo Indians, while the Sac Indians of the Southwest wear it on

1Tt has been contended by some persons that the triskelion was an evolution from
or to the Swastika. The triskelion consists of three human legs bent at the knee
and joined at the thigh. It isfound on the Lycian coins about 480 B. C., and thence
was carried by Agathocles to Sicily. (Barclay Head, Coins of the Ancients, Pl.
XXXY.) Itisalso found on a vase from Agrigentum. (Waring, Ceramic Art in Remote
Ages, pl. 42.) Newton explains how the symbol (triskelion) is found on the arms of
Sicily, and also those of the Isle of Man. (Atheneum, September, 1892.) The Duke
of Athol, proprietary of the Isle of Man, sold in 1765 his right to the Crown of Eng-
land, but because he had been its sovereign he kept the triskelion in his coat of
arms.

2 Tt is not possible to admit, says Count Goblet d’Alviella (Migration des Symboles,
page 108), that this has been spontaneously conceived and executed. Of all a priori
hypotheses, this is certainly the most difficult to accept.

their collars and garters on occasion of their religious fétes, although
it is not possible that they should know the sense which is attached to
it,' and the Wolpis paint it on their dance rattles.’

I have omitted to treat of numerous figurines ornamented with the
Swastika in the hope to find an explanation of this mysterious symbol.
We find it engraved on a figure of Buddha in the United States
National Museum,’ on the base of a bronze Buddha from Japan, and
on a vase in the Kunsthistorische Museum of Vienna, where it figures
on the breast of Apollo.t| Astarte bears it on her arms and shoulders,’
Adonis on his arms, a follower of Aphrodite, on her robe,° a centaur
from Cyprus on his right shoulder.?. In a rude representation of
Apollo directing the car of the sun it is found on the wheels of the
chariot.? A female statue in lead found at Troy wears a triangular
covering over the vulva, the center of which bears a Swastika.?
Numerous cinetures or girdles worn by women bore this same Swas-
tika sign. Does this not indicate that it may have been regarded as
an emblem of the generative forces of nature?

But we will not venture further in our researches for the signification
of a sign so obscure as is the Swastika. Probably (and the figurines
just mentioned give this hypothesis a semblance of truth) it was a
religious emblem, an amulet consecrated by the varied superstitions of
man, as is the hand with the fingers raised 4 survival of an ancient Chal-
dean symbol which is worn to-day by the Italians, as is the little pig by
theParisians.!° Was it dedicated to the living sun; to Zeus or Baal; to
Astarte or to Aphrodite; to Agni, the god of fire; or to Indra, the god
of rain; or, still further, to Vishnu or to Siva, the Hindu representa-
tives of creation and destruction? All these hypotheses are possible;
more than this, all of them are probable, for the signification of Swas-
tika has singularly varied according to the time and to tradition."
Those persons who in the actual state of our knowledge pretend to
formulate general conclusions are sadly in error.

I approach the end of my task. By the side of the similarity of the

to place the similarity of his genius, as proved by the identity of his
conceptions. The ossuaries which contain the remains of his prede-
cessors, the custom of coloring his bones red after they had been
denuded of their flesh, the mysterious sign to which we have given
the name Swastika, and other conceptions, other almost universal
creations, which it would be easy to add, all tend toward the confirma-
tion of the knowledge given to us by the earliest arms, the first tools

impossible to misapprehend or mistake the multiplied proofs that flow
from modern researches, all of which affirm with an irrefutable elo-
quence the unity of the human species.
RECENT RESEARCH IN EGYPT!

By W. M. FLINDERS PETRIE, D.C. L., LL. D., Ph. D.

Discoveries come so incessantly and the point of view so often
changes in the ever widening interests of Egyptian history that each
year puts out of date a great part of what has been written. Any
general work on EHgyptian history or art needs revision every few
months, so thickly have new subjects and new standpoints come before
us lately. We propose here to show what great changes have arisen
in our ideas during the last three years, taking each age in historical
order.

During all this century in which Egyptian history has been studied
at first hand, 1t has been accepted as a sort of axiom that the begin-
nings of things were quite unknown. In the epitome of the history
which was drawn up under the Greeks to make Egypt intelligible to
the rest of the world, there were three dynasties of kings stated before
the time of the great pyramid builders; and yet of those it has been
commonly said that no trace remained. Hence it has been usual to
pass them by with just a mention as being half fabulous, and then to
begin real history with Senefern or Khufu (Cheops), the kings who
stand at the beginning of the fourth dynasty, at about 4000 B. C.

The first discovery to break up this habit of thought was when the
prehistoric colossal statues of Min, the god of the city of Koptos, were
found in my excavations in his temple. These had carvings in relief
upon them wholly different from anything known as yet in Egypt, and
the circumstances pointed to their being earlier than any carvings yet
found in that country. In the same temple we found also statues of
sacred animals and pottery which we now know to belong to the very
beginning of Egyptian history, many centuries before the pyramids,
and probably about 5000 B.C. or earlier.

The next step was the finding of a new cemetery and a town of the
prehistoric people, which we can now date to about 5000 B. C., within
two. or three centuries either way. This place lay on the opposite side
of the Nile to Koptos—that is to say, about 20 miles north of Thebes.
At first we were completely staggered by a class of objects entirely

different from any yet known in Egypt. We tried to fit them into
every gap in Hgyptian history, but found that it was impossible to
put them betore 3000 B.C. Later discoveries prove that they are
really as old as 5000 B.C. They show a very different civilization
from that of the Egyptians, whom we already know—far less artistic,
but in some respects even more skillful in mechanical taste and touch
than the historical Egyptians. They built brick houses to live in, and
buried their dead in small chambers sunk in the gravels of the water
courses, lined with mats, and roofed over with beams. They show
several points of contact with the early Mediterranean civilization, and
appear to have been mainly north African tribes of Kuropean type.
Their pottery, in its patterns and painting, shows designs which have
survived almost unchanged unto the present day among the Kabyles of
the Algerian Mountains. And one very peculiar type of pottery is
- found spread from Spain to Egypt, and indicates a widespread com-
mercial intercourse at that remote day. The frequent figures upon the
vases of great galley ships rowed with oars, show that shipping was
well developed then, and make the evidences of trading between differ-
ent countries easy to be accepted.

All of the above belongs to the age probably before 4700 B. C., which
is the age given for the first historical king of Egypt by the Greek
history of Manetho. A keystone of our knowledge of the civilization
is the identification of the tomb of Mena, the first name in Egyptian
history, the venerated founder of all the long series of hundreds of
historic kings. This tomb, about 15 miles north of Thebes, was found
by some Arabs, and shown to M. De Morgan, the director of the
Department of Antiquities. It was a mass of about thirty chambers,
built of mud brick and of earth. Hach chamber contained a different
class of objects, one of stone vases, one of stone dishes, one of copper
tools, one of water jars, etc. And among the things are carvings of
lions and vases in rock erystal and obsidian, large hard-stone vases,
slate palettes for grinding paint, pottery vases, and, above all, an ivory
tablet with relief carvings which show the names of the king. ~

Besides this, M. Amelineau has found sixteen tombs of this same
general character at Abydos, which we can hardly now doubt belong
to the early kings of the first three dynasties, and some four or five
have been actually identified with the names of these kings in the
Greek history.

So now instead of treating the first three dynasties as half fabulous
and saying that Egyptian art and civilization begin full blown at 4000
B. C., we have the clear and tangible remains of much of these early
kings back to 4700 B. C., and a stretch of some centuries of the pre-
historic period with a varied and distinctive civilization, well known
and quite ditferent from anything later, lying before 4700 B.C. To put
the earlier part of this to 5500 B. C. is certainly no stretch of probability.

Coming down now into the historical period, a cemetery at Deshasheh
(about 80 miles south of Cairo) was thoroughly worked out last year,

RECENT RESEARCH IN EGYPT. al)

and we preserved all the skeletons and measured them. This belonged
to the middle of the age of the pyramid builders, about 3500 B.C. To
my great surprise, I found that two entirely different systems of treat-
ing the bodies were followed then. While many bodies were wrapped
up and buried in the usual Egyptian style, nearly half of the bodies
were more or less cut to pieces, and some had been elaborately dis-
sected, stripped of all their flesh, and then wrapped up bone by bone
separately in cloth. Thus there were two entirely different customs of
funerals existing side by side. Yet, on measuring the bodies, there
proved to be no distinet difference between them. The population was
completely fused and unified as to ancestry, but had kept up entirely
different customs in different levels of society.

We now pass entirely from these early times, with their fascinating
insight into the beginnings of things, long before any other human
history that we possess, until we reach down to what seems quite mod-
ern times in the record of Egypt, where it comes into contact with the
Old Testament history. On clearing out the funeral temple of King
Merenptah I found in that the upper half of a fine colossal statue of
his, with all the colors still fresh upon it. As this son of Rameses the
Great is generally believed to be the Pharaoh of the exodus, such 4 fine
portrait of him is full of interest. Better even than that—I found an
immense tablet of black granite over 10 feet high and 5 feet wide. It
had been erected over two centuries before and brilliantly carved by
an earlier king, whose temple was destroyed for materials by Merenptah.
He took this splendid block and turned its face inward against the wall
of his temple and carved the back of it with other scenes and long
inscriptions. Most of it isoccupied with the history of his vanquishing
the Libyans, or North African tribes, who were then invading Kgypt.
But at the end he recounts his conquests in Syria, among which occurs
the priceless passage: ‘‘The people of Israel are spoiled; they have no
seed.” This is the only trace yet found in Egypt of the existence of
the Israelites, the only mention of the name, and it is several centuries
earlier than the references to the Israelite and Jewish kings in the
cuneiform inscriptions of Assyria. What relation this has to our bib-
lical knowledge of the Israelites is a wide question, that has several
possible answers. Without entering on all the openings, | may here
state what seems to me to be the most probable connection of all the
events, though I am quite aware that fresh discoveries might easily
alter our views. It seems that either all the Israelites did not go into
Egypt or else a part returned and lived in the north of Palestine before
the exodus that we know, because we here find Merenptah defeating
Israelites at about 1200 B. C. Of his conquest and of those of Rameses
ITI in Palestine there are no traces in the biblical accounts, the absence
of which indicates that the entry into Canaan took place after 1160
B. C., the last war of Rameses III. Then the period of the judges is
given in a triple record—(1) of the north, (2) of the east of Jordan, (3)
of Ephraim andthe west; and these three accounts are quite distinct
574 RECENT RESEARCH IN EGYPT.

and never overlap, though the history passes in succession from one to
another. Thus the whole age of Judges is but little over a century.
And to this agree the priestly genealogies stretching between the
tabernacle and temple periods.

Leaving now all the monumental age, we come lastly to the evidences
of the Christian period, preserved in the papyri or miscellaneous waste
papers left behind in the towns of the Roman times. Last winter my
friends, Mr. Grenfell and Mr. Hunt, cleared out the remains of the town
Behnesa, about 110 miles south of Cairo. There, amid thousands of
stray papers, documents, rolls, accounts, and all the waste sweepings
out of the city offices, they found two leaves which ,are priceless in
Christian literature—the leaf of Logia, or sayings of Jesus, and the
leaf of Matthew’s Gospel.

The leaf of the Logia is already so widely known that it is needless
for me to describe it. But I would rather call attention to some obvi-
ous conclusions to which it awakes us and which render more clear
our grasp of the history of the Gospels. Every great teacher sur-
rounded by disciples has, in the natural order of things, been com-
memorated first by notebooks of his sayings, compiled by his nearest
followers. The “Memorabilia” of Socrates, the ‘‘Teaching” of_Epic- —
tetus, the ‘Table Talk” of Luther, are the most obvious examples of
this. And to suppose that the record of the sayings of Jesus would be
less attended to, less affectionately noted down, less treasured and
preserved, is against all probability. It is a priori almost certain that
collections of sayings must have been made. Where, then, have they
gone? A leaf of such a collection has now turned up, showing that
such did exist. But we can see, when our eyes are thus opened, that a
whole handbook of classified sayings has come down to us in the form
of what we call the Sermon on the Mount, the fifth, sixth, and seventh
chapters of Matthew’s Gospel. That is really the kernel of the whole
Gospel. To that has been added a narrative for the sake of those who
in later years were not familiar by hearsay with all that went on, and
an introduction has been put before it to explain the circumstances.
But the Sermon on the Mount has all the character of a contemporary
handbook in its structure and nature, and the tone of it is entirely
different from all the narratives written years after the events.

Another point to which this mass of papyri opens our eyes is the
importance of the scribe and account keeper. In the East, down to the
present time, the village scribe does all the business and is incessantly
writing for people from morning to night. Itis his profession. So it
was in Roman times, and far the greater part of the writings that
remain were written by the scribe and tax gatherer. When such aman
left his profession his habits of life could not all change; he would
naturally continue to write. And amid the group of fishermen and
peasants gathered about Jesus it is impossible to doubt that Matthew,
the tax gatherer, ready of pen all his life, would continue his old habit
and be the natural scribe of the new way. John, the only other personal
RECENT RESEARCH IN EGYPT. 575

disciple among the gospel writers, certainly wrote far later, when all
his ways had changed from the days of his fisher life on the Sea of
Galilee. Hence there appears no rival to the obvious position of Mat-
thew as the first recorder of the sayings of his Master compiled in the
Sermon on the Mount.

The leaf of Matthew’s Gospel is of great interest in the literary his-
tory of the Gospels. Hitherto we have had no manuscripts older than
the second great ecclesiastical settlement under Theodosius. Now we
have a piece two ages earlier—before the first settlement of things
under Constantine at the council of Nica. Here, in the middle of
the third century, we find that the beginning of the Gospel, the most
artificial, and probably the latest, part, the introductory genealogy and
account of the Nativity was exactly in its present form. This gives
us the greatest confidence that the Gospel as we have it dates from the
time of the great persecutions.

Such are some of the astonishing and far- manele results that Egypt
has given us within three years past. All the most important ages of
history seem to suddenly stand out with a vividness and clearness
which has hardly any parallel in the history of discovery. What may
not three years more show us?

A STUDY FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE: THE IMPORT OF
THE TOTEM.’

By ALiceE C. FLETCHER,’
Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.

In this study of the significance of the Omaha totem, the aim will be
to set forth, as clearly as possible, first, what these Indians believed
concerning their totems, and, secondly, what these totems stood for in
the tribal structure.

There will be no attempt in this paper to treat the subject of totems
in a world sense. The experience of many years of research within a
limited area has shown the writer that close, careful studies of the
various tribes and races of the two hemispheres are as yet too few to
afford sufficient evidence for a final summing up from which to deduce
points held in common, or the equally important lines of divergence,
found in the beliefs and customs involved in the use of totems.

It is proper to call attention at the outset to a few of the perplexities
of a research at first hand in a matter as recondite as that under con-
sideration. There is the difficulty of adjusting one’s own mental atti-
tude, of preventing one’s own mental atmosphere from deflecting and
distorting the image of the Indian’s thought. The fact that the impli-
cations of the totem are so rooted in the Indian’s mentality that he is
unconscious of any strangeness in them, and is unable to discuss them
objectively, constitutes a grave obstacle to be overcome. Explanations
of his beliefs, customs, and practices have to be sought by indirect
rather than by direct methods, have to be eliminated from a tangle of
contradictions and verified by the careful noting of the many little
unconscious acts and sayings of the people, which let in a flood of
light, revealing the Indian’s mode of thought, and disclosing its under-
lying ideas. By these slow processes, with the analysis of his songs,
rituals, and ceremonies, we can at last come upon his beliefs concerning
nature and life, and it is upon these that the totem is based.

578 STUDY FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE: IMPORT OF THE TOTEM.

There were two classes of totems known among the Omahas: The
personal, belonging to the individual, and the social, that of societies
and gentes.

The personal totem.—The question first to arise is, How did the indi-
vidual obtain his totem? We learn that it was not received from an
ancestor, was not the gift of any living person, but was derived through
a certain rite by the man himself.

In the Legend of the Sacred Pole of the Omahas, which has been
handed down from generations, and which gives a rapid history of the
people from the time when ‘‘they opened their eyes and beheld the
day” to the completed organization of the tribe, we are told: ‘The
people felt themselves weak and poor. ‘Then the old men gathered
together and said: Let us make our children cry to Wa-kon/-da.
* * * So all the parents took their children, covered their faces
with soft clay, and sent them forth to lonely places. * * * Theold
men said, You shail go forth to cry to Wa kon/-da. * * * When
on the hills you shall not ask for any particular thing * * * what-
ever is good, that may Wa-kon/da give. * * * Four days and
nights upon the hills the youth shall pray, crying, and when he stops,
shall wipe his tears with the palms of his hands, lift his wet hands to
heaven, then lay them on the earth. * * * ‘This was the people’s
first appeal to Wa-kon/-da.”

This rite, called by the untranslatable name Non’-zhin-zhon, has been
observed up to the present time. When the youth had reached the age
of puberty he was instructed by his parents as to what he was to do.
Moistened earth was put upon his head and face, a small bow and arrows
given him, and he was directed to seek a secluded spot upon the hills
and there to chant the prayer which he had been taught and to lift his
hands, wet with his tears, to heaven and then to lay them upon the
earth; and he was to fast until at last he fell into a trance orsleep. If
in his trance or dream he saw or heard anything, that thing was to
become the special medium through which he could receive supernat-
ural aid. The ordeal over, the youth returned home to partake of food
and to rest. No one questioned him, and for four days he spoke but ~
little, for if within that time he should reveal his vision it would be the
same as lost to him. Afterwards he could confide it to some old man
known to have had a similar manifestation, and it then became the duty
of the youth to seek until he should find the animal he had seen in his
trance, when he must slay it and preserve some part of it (in cases
where the vision had been of no concrete form symbols were taken to
represent it). This memento was ever after to be the sign of his vision,
his totem, the most sacred thing he could ever possess, for by it his
natural powers were to be so reenforced as to give him success as a —
hunter, victory as a warrior, and even the power to see into the future.

Belief concerning nature and life.—The foundation of the Indian’s faith
in the efficacy of the totem rested upon his belief concerning nature

and life. This belief was complex and involved two prominent ideas:
First, that all things, animate and inanimate, were permeated by a com-
mon life, and second, that this life could not be broken, but was con-
tinuous.

The common life.—The idea of a common life was in its turn complex,
but its dominating force was conceived to be that which man recognized
within himself as will power. This power which could make or bring
to pass he named Wa-kon/-da.

The question arises, Did the Omaha regard Wa-kon/-da as a supreme
being? There is no evidence that he did so regard the power repre-
sented by that word, nor is there any intimation that he had ever con-
ceived of a single great ruling spirit.

Anthropomorphism.—The word Wa-kon/-da appears to have expressed
the Indian’s conception of immanent life, manifest in all things. Grow-
ing out of this conception was a kind of anthropomorphism; the char-
acteristics of man were projected upon all nature; the Rock, in the
rituals, was addressed as “Aged One!” sitting with “furrowed brow”
and ‘wrinkled loins ;” the Tree lived a double life in the Indian’s fancy,
as did the Water, the Fire, the Winds, and the Animals. This duality
can be recognized in myths, in legends, in rituals, and in the para-
phernalia of ceremonies, in which there is a constant confusion of the
external aspect and the anthropomorphic conception. All things were
distinct from man, but in the subtle bond of a common life, embodying
the idea of will, or directive energy, they were akin to him, and could
lend him the aid of their special powers, even as he could help or hinder
his fellow-men.

Will power.—We trace the Omaha’s estimate of his own will power
in the act called Wa.zhin’-dhé-dhé (wa-zhin, directive energy; dhé-dhé,
to send), in which, through the singing of certain songs, strength could
be sent to the absent warrior in the stress of battle, or thought and
will be projected to help a friend win a game or a race, or even so to
influence the mind of a man as to affect its receptivity of the super-
natural. Aside from the individual practice of this power there was,
so to speak, a collective energy exercised by the Hon’-he-wa.chi society
in the act of Wa-zhin’-a-gdhe (wa-zhin, directive energy; a-gdhe, to
place upon), where the members so fixed their will upon an obnoxious
person as to isolate him from all helpful relations with men and animals
and leave him to die. <A similar ability to aid or to injure was imputed
to the elements and all natural forms. The Winds could bring health
to man; the Stone insure him long life; the Elk could endow the pur-
sued with speed, and the Hawk make the warrior sure to fall upon his
enemy. But it is to be noticed that, while man’s own will was believed
to act directly, without intervening instrumentality upon his fellows,
the supplementing of man’s powers by the elements and the animals
was obtainable only after an appeal to Wa-kon/-da in the rite of the

vision.
580 sTUDY FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE: IMPORT OF THE TOTEM.

The appeal.—The prayer, which formed a part of the rite of the vision,
was called Wa-kon/-da gi-kon. Gi gi-kon’ is to weep from loss, as that
of kindred; the prefix ‘‘gi” indicates possession. Gi-kon is to weep
from want of something not possessed, from conscious insufficiency, and
the longing for something that could bring happiness or prosperity.
The words of the prayer, ‘‘wa-kon/-da dhe-dhu wah-pa/-dhin a-ton/-he,”
literally rendered, are ‘“‘wa-kon/-da,” ‘“‘here needy I stand.” (A-ton-he is
in the third person and implies the first, as “he stands,” and “I am
he,” a form of speech used to indicate humility.) While this prayer has
been combined with many rites and acts, its inherent unity of name
and words has been preserved through generations of varied experience
and social development of the people.!

Wa-kon/-da was a vague entity to the Omaha, but the anthropomor-
phic coloring was not lacking in the general conception. The prayer
voiced man’s ever-present consciousness of dependence, was a craving
for help, and implied a belief in some mysterious power able to under-
stand and respond to his appeal. The response came in a dream, or
trance, wherein an appearance spoke to the man, thus initiating a rela-
tion between them, which was not established until the man, by his
own effort, had procured a symbol of his visitant, which might be a
feather of the bird, a tuft of hair from the animal, a black stone, or a
translucent pebble. This memento or totem was never an object of
worship; it was the man’s credential, the fragment, to connect its pos-
sessor with the potentiality of the whole species represented by the
form seen in his vision, and through which the man’s strength was to
be reenforced and disaster averted.

_ Basis of the efficacy of the totem.—The efficacy of the totem was based
upon the Omaha’s belief in the continuity of life—a continuity which
not only linked the visible to the invisible and bound the living to the
dead, but which kept unbroken the thread of life running through all
things, making it impossible for the part and the entirety to be disas-
sociated. Thus one man could gain power over another by obtaining
a lock of his hair, which brought the man himself under his influence.
In the ceremony of the first cutting of the child’s hair the severed lock
which was given to the Thunder god placed the life of the child in the
keeping of the god. Again, when a man’s death had been predicted—
by one gifted to see into the future—the disaster could be averted by
certain ceremonies, which included the cutting off a lock of hair from
one side of the head and a bit of flesh from the arm on the opposite
side of the body and casting them into the fire. _ By this sacrifice of a
part the whole was represented, the prediction fulfilled, and the man
permitted to live. From the ritual of the Corn, sung when the priest
distributed the kernels to indicate that the time for planting had come,
we learn that these kernels were the little portions which would draw

to themselves the living corn. In the ritual sung over the Sacred
Buffalo Hide prior to the hunt the same idea is present—that in the
continuity of life the part is ever connected with the whole, and that
the Sacred Buffalo Hide was able to bring within reach the living
animal itself.

Limitation in totems.—The totem opened a means of communication
between man and the various agencies of his environment, but it could
not transcend the power of its particular species; consequently all
totems were not equally potent. Men who saw the Bear in their visions
were liable to be wounded in battle, as the bear was slow of movement,
clumsy and easily trapped, although a savage fighter when brought to
bay. Winged forms, such as the Eagle, having greater range of sight
than the creatures which traveled upon the ground, could bestow upon
the men to whom they came in the dream the gift of looking into the
future and foretelling coming events. Thunder gave the ability to con-
trol the elements and the authority to conduct certain religious rites.

Despite the advantages to be derived from the possession of certain
totems, the inculeations given when the youth was instructed in the
rite of the vision, and taught the prayer he was to sing, forbade him
to ask for any special gift or the sight of any particular thing. Hewas
simply to wait without fear and to accept without question whatever
Wa-kon/-da might vouchsafe to send him. No man was able to choose
his personal totem, but it was the general belief of the people that the
powerful animals and agencies were apt to be drawn toward those who
possessed natural gifts of mind and strength of will.

Nature of the totems.—The totems of the Omahas referred to animals—
the Bear, the Buffalo, the Deer, the Birds, the Turtle, and Reptiles; to
the Corn; to the elements—the Winds, the Earth, the Water, and Thun-
der. There was nothing among them whieh in any way represented the
human family, nor was there any trace of ancestor worship. The rela-
tion between the man and his totem did not lie along the line of natural
kinship, but rested upon the peculiarities in his theory of nature, in
which the will and ability to bring to pass, which he was conscious of
within himself, he projected upon the universe which encompassed him.
The rite of the vision was a dramatization of his abstract ideas of life
and nature, and the totem was the representation of the vision in a con-
crete form.

THE SOCIAL TOTEM AND WHAT iv STOOD FOR IN THE TRIBE.

We have thus far seen the influence of the totem upon the individual.
We are now to trace it as exerted upon groups of people, in the Relig-
ious societies, in the Ton’-won-gdhon or gens, and in the development
and organization of the tribe.

Religious societies.—The totem’s simplest form of social action was
in the Religious societies, whose structure was based upon the grouping
together of men who had received similar visions. Those who had seen
582 STUDY FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE: IMPORT OF THE TOTEM.

the Bear made up the Bear society; those to whom the Thunder or
Water beings had come formed the Thunder or the Pebble society. The
membership came from every kinship group in the tribe. Blood relation-
ship was ignored, the bond of union being a common right in a common
vision. These brotherhoods gradually developed a classified member-
ship with initiatory rites, rituals, and officials set apart to conduct the
ceremonials.

The function of the totem in the societies was intermediate between
that of the individual totem and the totem in its final social office, where
it presided over an artificial structure, in which natural conditions were
in part overruled and the people inevitably bound together. In some
of the tribes of the linguistic group to which the Omahas belong, where
the political structure of the gens is apparently weak and undeveloped,
the Religious societies exist and are powerful in their organization.
This fact, with other evidence which can not be detailed here owing to
its complex nature, together with the similarity traceable between the
rituals and ceremonies of these Religious societies and those incident
to the inauguration of gentile and tribal officers, makes it seem proba-
ble that the training and experience derived from the working of these
- earlier societies had taught the leaders among the Omahas and their
close cognates certain lessons in organization, by which t hey had profited
during the formative period of the artificial social structure of the Ton/-
won-gdhon or gens.

The Ton'-won-gdhon.—The word Ton'-won-gdhon, means a place of
dwellings, where kindred dwelt together. There were ten Ton’-won-
gdhon u/-zhu—dominant, ruling Ton/-won-gdhon, or gentes, in the
Omahatribe. These gentes practiced exogomy, and traced their descent
only through the father. Each gens had its particular name, which
referred directly or symbolically to its totem, which was kept in mind
by the practice of tabu. There was also a set of names peculiar to each
gens, all having the same reference, one of which was bestowed upon
each child; an Omaha’s gentile name, therefore, would at once reveal
his kinship group or gens. This name was proclaimed at the time of
the ceremony attendant upon the cutting of the first lock of hair. After
this ceremony the child’s hair was cut in a fashion to symbolize the
totem of its gens, and each spring, until it was about 7 years of age,
this peculiar trimming of the hair was repeated. The teaching of this
object lesson, so placed before the children, was reenforced by their
training in the strict observance of the special tabu of their gentes,
holding ever before them the penalties for its violation of blindness,
physical deformity, and disease.

There were religious rites peculiar to each gens in which the members
did homage to the special power represented by the gentile totem. In
these ceremonies the hereditary chiefs of the gens were the priests.
It is easy to see why the totem was never forgotten—why its sign was
borne through life, and at last put upon the dead, in order that they

right be at once recognized by their kindred, and not wander as they
assed into the spirit world.

Office of the totem in the gens.—In the early struggle for existence the

vantages accruing from a permanent kinship group, both in resisting

reression and in securing a food supply, could not fail to have been
rceived; and, if the people were to become homogeneous and the
retice of exogomy continue, some expedient must have been devised
by which permanent groups could be maintained and kinship lines be
defined. The common belief of the people, kept virile by the universal
ice of the rite of the vision, furnished this expedient—a device

wi v2 could be understood and accepted by all—the concrete sign of
the vision, the totem of the leader, he whose abilities and prowess
evinced supernatural favor, and won for his followers success and plenty.

From a study of the minutie of the customs and ceremonies within
the gens, it is apparent that their underlying purpose was to impress
upon the people the knowledge and the duties of kindred, and that one
of the most important of these duties was the maintenance of the union

“the gens. This union of kindred we find to have been guarded by
the agency of the totem. The name of the gens, the personal names of
its members, and the practice of tabu—obligatory upon all persons,
except the hereditary chiefs, while they were officiating in the gentile
rites pertaining to the totem—indicate a common allegiance to a super-
natural presence believed to preside over the gens by virtue of its
relation to the common ancestor. These rites did not imply ancestor
worship, but were a recognition of the special power represented by the
totem. Wealso find that the gentile totem and its rites did not interfere
with a man’s freedom in seeking his personal totem, nor of his use of it
when desiring help from the mysterious powers. The gentile totem
gave no immediate hold upon the supernatural, as did the individual
totem to its possessor; outside the rites already referred to, it served
solely as a mark of kinship, and its connection with the supernatural
was manifest only in its punishmént of the violation of tabu. Briefly
stated, the inculcation of the gentile totem was that the individual
belonged to a definite kinship group, from which he could never sever
himself without incurring supernatural punishment.

Social growth depended upon the establishment of distinct groups,
and the one power adequate for the purpose was that which was
believed to be capable of enforcing the union of the people by super-
naturally inflicted penalties. The constructive influence of the totem
is apparent in the unification of the Ton’-won-gdhon or gens, without
which the organization of the tribe would have been impossible.

The influence of the religious societies upon the gens.—In the religious
societies the people were made familiar with the idea that a common
vision could create a sort of brotherhood. This fraternity was recog-
nized and expressed by the observance of rites and ceremonies—in
which ail the members took part—setting forth the peculiar power of
584 sTuUuDY FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE: IMPORT OF THE TOTEM.

the totem. The influence of this training in the religious societies is
traceable in the structure of the gens, where the sign of a vision, the
totem, became the symbol of-a bond between the people, augmenting
the natural tie of blood relationship in an. exogomous group. We find
this training further operative in the establishment of rites and cere-
monies in honor of the gentile totem, which bore a strong resemblance
to those already familiar to the people in the societies. In the gens the
hereditary chief was the priest, and this centralization of authority
tended to foster the political development of the gens.

Related totems.—Certain fixed habits of thought among the Omahas
growing out of their theories and beliefs concerning nature and life—
upon which the totem was based—present a curious mixture of abstrac-
tions and anthropomorphism, blended with practical observations of
nature. Thus, in the varied experiences of disintegration and coales-
cing during past generations, composite gentes came into existence
through the supposed affinity of totems. Out of the ten Omaha gentes,
three only observe a single tabu; the other seven were composed of
subgroups, called Ton/-won-gdhon u-zhiiga (u-zhiiga, a small part),
each of which had its own special tabu, obligatory upon its own mem-
bers only, and not upon the other subgroups of the gens. While there
was no common totem in a composite gens, the totems of the subgroups
which formed such gens had a kind of natural relation to each other;
the objects they symbolized were more or less affiliated in the natural
world, as, for example, in the Mon/-dhin-ka-ga-hé gens (the earth makers),
where the totems of the subgroups represented the earth, the stone,
and the animals that lived in holes in the ground, as the wolf.

The relation between the totems of composite gentes is not always
patent; it frequently exists because of fancied resemblances, or from a
subtle association growing out of conditions which have sequence in
the Indian mind, although disconnected, and at variance with our own
observation and reason.

The totem in the tribal organization.—The families within a gens
pitched their tents in a particular order or form, which was that of a
nearly complete circle, an opening being left as an entrance way into
the inclosed space. This encampment was called by the untranslatable
name, Hu/-dhu-ga. When the entire tribe camped together, each of the
ten gentes, while still preserving its own internal order, opened its
line of tents and became a segment of the greater tribal Hu’-ghu-ga,
in which each gens had its fixed, unchangeable position, so that the
opening of the tribal Hu’-dhu-ga was always between the same two
gentes. Both these gentes were related to Thunder. That upon the
right, as one entered the circle, was the In-shta/-thun-da—flashing eye—
known as the Thunder gens or people. To a subgroup of this gens
belonged the right of consecrating the child to the Thunder god, in
the ceremony of cutting the first lock of hair; another subgroup kept
the ritual used in filling the Sacred Tribal Pipes. On the left of the

STUDY FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE: IMPORT OF THE TOTEM. 585

entrance camped the We’zhin-shte—a symbolic name probably mean-
ing the representatives of anger. The We’-zhin-shté were Elk people,
having in charge the Sacred Tent of War, in which the worship of
Thunder, as well as all rites pertaining to war, of which Thunder was
the god, took place.

It would lead too far afield to follow at great length the interrela-
tions of the gentes; or the dominance of position and leadership in
tribal rites and ceremonies conceded to certain gentes; or to indicate
the scars left upon the Hu’-dhu-ga by the breaking away of groups of
kindred; or the devices used to keep intact an ancient form and order.
The point to be borne in mind is, that the position of the gentes in the

‘tribe, and the interlacing of their functions, were regulated by the
ascription of different powers to their totems; and that the unification
and strengthening of the tribal structure, as in the unification and
strengthening of the gens, depended upon the restraining fear of super-
natural punishment by the totemic powers.

In this rapid review of Omaha beliefs and customs connected with
the totem, many observances have not even been mentioned, and of
those indicated the details have had to be omitted in order to keep
strictly within the limits of our subject, but the fundamental ideas
which have been briefly considered will be found to underlie all rites
and ceremonies within the tribe.

Linguistic evidence as to the totem.—We turn now to the language for
further evidence as to the import of the totem.

The name of the concrete sign of the vision is Wa-hu’-bé, a sacred
thing. The word is applied to sacred objects other than the totem,
such as the sacred pole, the sacred tents, the sacred tribal pipes, ete.

The name of a religious society always included the name of the
manifestation of the vision of its members. For instance, the Bear
society was called Wa-tha/be i/-dha-é-dhé—literally rendered, the
Bear with or by compassion—that is, those upon whom the Bear had
compassion. I/-dha-é-dhé implies that this compassion, this pity, was
aroused by a human being making a personal appeal, either by his
destitute appearance or the moving character of his supplication.
Usage forbade the application of this word to any emotion excited by
animal -ife; it could only express a feeling between man and man, or
between man and the manifestation of Wa-kon/-da. It did not repre-
sent an abstract idea, as of a virtue, but a feeling awakened by direct
contact with need. In the prayer already cited as a part of the rite of
the vision, the man makes a direct appeal to Wa-kon’-da (““Wa-konda!
here needy I stand”), and reference to this act is made in the employ-
ment of the word i/dha-é-dhé in the term designating the Religious
societies.

The name of a gens indicated its totem, or the characteristic of the
group of totems in a composite gens. When the people of a gens were
spoken of in reference to their totem, the word i/-ni-ka-shi-ki-dhé was
586 STUDY FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE: IMPORT OF THE TOTEM.

used immediately following that of the totem. Tor instance, the Thunder
people—the In-shta-thun-da gens—were called In-gdhan-i/-ni-ka-shi-ki-
dhé—in-gdhan’, thunder; i/-ni-ka-shi-ki dhé is a composite word, mean-
ing, they make themselves a people with—that is, with thunder they
make themselves or become a people. The We’-zhin-shté gens, the Elk
people, were called On-pon-i/-ni-ka-shi-ki-dhé—on-pon elk—with the
Elk they make themselves a people. The word i/-ni-ka-shi-ki-dhé
clearly indicates the constructive character of the totem in the gens.

The set of names which belonged to each gens referred to the sign or
totem of a family group. These names were called ni’-ki-e, spoken by
a chief, or originated by a chief. The word ni’-ki-e points to the forma-
tive period when means were being devised to transform the family
into a distinct political group; it argues a central authority, a man, a
chief. The individual names which he bestowed allude solely to the
power behind the chief, the manifestation of his vision represented by
his totem, in the favor of which he and his kindred had made them-
selves a people, i/-ni-ka-shi-ki-dhé.

The Osage equivalent of the Omaha word i/-ni-ka-shi-ki-dhé is zho‘i-
ga-ra, meaning associated with. The Otoe word used for the same
purpose is ki’-gra-jhé, they call themselves.

The word for tribe, u-ki/-té, when used as a verb, means to fight, to
war against outside enemies, indicating that the need of mutual help
impelled the various Ton/-won-gdhon (gentes) to band together for self-
preservation; but the order of their grouping was, as we have seen,
controlled by their totems.

Summary.—lIn the word for tribe, in the formation of the gens within
the tribe, and in the rite which brought the individual into what he
believed to be direct communication with Wa-kon/-da, we trace the work-
ings of man’s consciousness of insecurity and dependence, and see his
struggles to comprehend his environment, and to bring himself into
helpful relations with the supernatural. And we find in this study of
the Omaha totem that while the elements, the animals, and the fruits
of the earth were all related to man through a common life, this relation
ran along discrete lines, and that, his appeal for help once granted,
relief could only be summoned by means of the Wa-hu’-be, the sacred
object, the totem, which brought along its special line the desired
supernatural aid.

It is noteworthy that the totems of individuals, as far as known, and
those of the gentes, represented the same class of objects or phenomena,
and, as totems could be obtained in but one way—through the rite of
the vision—the totem of a gens must have come into existence in that
manner, and must have represented the manifestation of an ancestor’s
vision, that of a man whose ability and opportunity served to make
him the founder of a family, of a group of kindred who dwelt together,
fought together, and learned the value of united strength.

A NEW GROUP OF STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM THE SOUTH-
ERN SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

By Dr. W. A. PHILLIPS,
Evanston, Ill.

INTRODUCTORY.

The first long chapter in the history of human effort and progress is
written in stone, and more especially in the simple forms of implements
Shaped by fracture of brittle stone. Our knowledge of these earlier
phases of human activity would be very meager save for the fact that
the ruder peoples of to-day are found practicing similar forms of art.
Observations among these peoples give us a multitude of clues as to
the first steps in culture, while survivals of primitive processes in some
of our modern trades have afforded no little aid. Experimental shap-
ing, though rarely taken up seriously, has also proved a fruitful source
of information, and a fuller knowledge of the properties of the varieties
of stone has led to the better appreciation of the varied phenomena of
the stone-shaping arts. The body of information secured through all
of these sources is further enforced by recent studies of the refuse of our
native American shop sites. The careful analysis of the stone-flaking
art by Professor Holmes has done much to place the whole subject on a
scientific footing.! His work, however, has dealt more especially with
the great family of implements of ‘“leaf-blade” genesis, while those
shaped more directly from flakes have received less attention, and it is
with the purpose of developing more fully this branch of the subject
that the present study is undertaken. Both shop refuse and the
designed products of the flaking art are abundantly represented in the
region about the southwest shore of Lake Michigan, though the imple-
ments are not good examples of aboriginal skill in shaping because of
the absence of minerals especially suited to flaking.

Before passing to the consideration of the shaped-stone products of
this section the character of the ground and the manner of occurrence
of the materials employed require a brief description.

The region studied.—The region studied begins in northern Cook
County, Ill., and continues southward into Indiana. It is a succession

'W. H. Holmes, Natural History of Flaked Stone Implements, Memoirs of the
Congress of Anthropology, 1893, page 122.
587
588 STONE IMPLEMENTS FR 'M SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

of narrow sandy ridges covered with forest trees, which extend around
the head of the lake. Alternating with these are marshes which in ~
former years were frequently covered with water for a considerable
period of the winter and spring, but displayed for the rest of the year
a heavy growth of flags and grasses. The sharply defined ranks of |
oak woods regularly divided by meadows are still a characteristic of
the lake shore landscape.

Cities and towns now occupy much of the area, and artificial drain-
age has changed the marshes for the most part into cultivated fields.
The ridges were at different times in the past the beaches of Lake
Michigan; three are well marked and continuous, while many inter-
mediate ones are mere sand bars. The width of this zone of shore
formations is variable. In northern Lake County, Ind., it is 7 or 8
miles; across Chicago, from the present beach to Summit, it is about
14 miles, this being the greatest width; at Evanston it is 4 miles,
and between this place and Winnetka, 5 miles farther down, the
beaches fade out into the present shore line. Similar areas of shore
country occur at other points about the Great Lakes. One of them, a
narrow detached district between the cities of Waukegan, Ul, and
Kenosha, Wis., has been repeatedly visited by the writer for pur-
poses of study. Itis a mile wide and displays all the characters of
the larger region about the head of the lake. It is limited on the west
by an old shore line of clay bluffs. .

Aboriginal remains.— Along the sand ridges old hearths and seat-
tered relics of aboriginal life mark sites formerly occupied by camps
and villages. In certain localities such remains are continuous for
miles, and are traceable in wind-swept places, where the sand drifts
away from the heavier objects, leaving them exposed on the surface.
The objects are such as characterize similar sites throughout the
United States. They consist of groups of hearthstones cracked and
broken by fire; fragments of pottery of the kind made and used by the
tribes of the Eastern and Middle States; net weights; the refuse of stone
shaping, and implements and ornaments of stone and sometimes of cop-
per. Articles formed of less durable substance are exceptional. An
occasional gun flint or iron axe connects certain sites with the period of
French and English trade. <A few of the graves give like evidence in
silver crosses and ornaments introduced by the Jesuits. However,
ou all the sites the refuse of stone flaking is constant, and represents
a purely aboriginal phase of art.

In 1853 Professor Lapham recorded the abundant evidence of the
former manufacture of articles of flint near Kenosha.! Similar obser-
vations at Evanston were made some years ago by the present writer
(1884). Chert refuse was collected at that time illustrating successive

stages of the flaking work. This material was placed in the museum
of the Northwestern University at Evanston and was arranged in a
series, beginning with the water-worn pebble from the beach and ending
with the nearly completed but broken implement.'

The present study is limited to a heretofore unnoticed group of
flaked products, which differ wholly from those of flint and chert, and
much time has been given to their collection and separation from other
allied phenomena.

For a part of the material here described I am indebted to Mr. F.
H. Lyman, of Kenosha, who has been familiar with the sites of flaking
for many years. For cooperation in collecting the refuse I wish espe-
cially to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. W. C. Wyman and Mr.
EK. F. Wyman, of Evanston.

THE TRAP FLAKE SERIES.

The district between Waukegan and Kenosha, bordering the lake,
and more especially certain sites about the village of Benton, furnish
a numerous series of shop products in trap rock, comprising flaked cob-
blestones, flakes, and specialized forms.

The total amount of this material from a number of sites was col-
lected for examination. All forms were gathered with equal care, in
order that the relative proportion of waste and designed products might
be compared. The amount of such material is not great when compared
with the refuse of flaking in quarries, and it is doubtful whether the
use of intractable rock like trap would under any circumstances have
given rise to extensive quarrying. A few well-defined shops were found
- near the beach where the refuse of shaping trap cobblestones is mixed
with camp-site remains.

Thirty-two sites located along the sand ridges which extend north-
ward through the marsh from Benton Station to the Wisconsin State
line, a distance of 5 miles, have contributed material. All of the sites
are small, and marked usually by one hearth. In places they occur at
intervals of a few hundred feet. The most productive in trap refuse
were chosen for collecting. In addition to material found on the camp
sites, I have included in my studies local collections furnishing special-
ized forms obtained by others on these sites.

The material.—The trap rock occurs throughout the region in the
shape of cobblestones, varying greatly in size. In color, structure, and
composition it is fairly uniform when examined by ordinary methods;
commonly slate blue or gray when weathered; compact, crystalline, and
finely granular, giving a slightly uneven fracture. There is nothing
remarkable either in its weight or hardness. .

Subjected to light blows it readily yields a white powder, as it does
also to friction. It is, however, the power of resistance to fracture

590 STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

under repeated blows that especially distinguishes this rock—a quality
that made it the favorite material for hammer stones throughout the
region. Tough, and merely battered by ordinary hammering, it is
still capable of flaking under heavy blows, and with a characteristic
effect when certain conditions of the mass worked are present, large
and symmetrical flakes resulting. While the fracture is not as clean
cut as that produced in flaking flint and similar materials, it is never-
theless of the same general character.!

The flaked cobblestones.—The mixed beach gravels east of the shaping
sites afford a supply of well-rounded cobblestones, those used averaging
perhaps 4 inches in diameter and 14 inches in thickness. The clay
bluffs west of the sites supply the same rock in angular masses, but
these are not represented in the refuse under consideration, though
many were carried to the camp sites for a variety of uses. The amount
of refuse of flaking varies with different sites. In some places a single
piece only has been flaked, while again as many as twenty or thirty
must have been worked up. Occasionally a group of four or five well-
selected cobbles occurs in connection with small quantities of refuse,
as if a part only of the stock gathered had been worked up. The num-
ber of flakes removed from a single stone was never great. Many
blows were struck without producing flakes, the point subjected to
percussion exhibiting only a gray mark or depression where the sur-
face crumbled under the shock. Such marks commonly occur singly
or in groups at the usual points of impact, but in cases extend quite
around the stone.

A successful blow, one producing the desired flake, is represented by
a notch in the margin of the resultant facet from which slight furrows
and ridges radiate for a short distance over the face of fracture. (See
Plate I.) The notch is often light gray or even white in fresh-looking
specimens; these percussion marks usually occur singly, but instances of
two or even three notches in one facet are met with. The facet is com-
monly circular or oval in outline and often of considerable size, reach-
ing in cases 4 or 5 inches in diameter; many, aS a matter of course,
are small and some are irregular in coutour. A single facet sometimes

1T am greatly indebted to Mr. W.J.Stebbins for the exact identification of this
rock. A number of flakes submitted to him for analysis gave the following result:
“Under the microscope, sections of each of the rock specimens submitted were found
to be diabase, in each case composed of oligoclase, augite, chlorite, calcite, and iron.
That they have been subjected to much weathering and wearing from water action
is evident from their outward appearance. The most noticeable character brought
out by the microscope is their decomposition. The oligoclase is much clouded and
altered, though a few crystals show clearly defined polysynthetic twinning. The
augite is almost entirely decomposed to calcite and chlorite, and the biotite of the
original diabase has all been changed to chlorite and iron. Calcite is found only in
very small scattered grains. The rock is very tough, fine grained, and holocrystal-
line.” <A few of the flakes and cobblestones show a laminated structure; they com-
prise less than 1 per cent of the whole. This character has not played an impor-
tant part in fracture except in this small proportion.
STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN. 591

occupies nearly the whole of one surface of the stone, while two or three
facets may occur within this space. Commonly where a flake has been
detached, whether of large or small size, further flaking has not been
carried on in the same quarter, but has been repeated. at intervals of
about a fourth or a third or even half the distance around the stone.

Two and three faceted stones are about equally represented and com-
prise the greater part of the flaked cobblestones. (Plate I.) Those with
one facet are in fair proportion, while four and five faceted stones are
less numerous. A limited number have more than five facets. The
order of the letters a, b, c, d is the supposed order of flaking.

Halves of flaked cobblestones, mainly the result of fractures running
through the shorter diameter, occur in the proportion of one to every
four or five of the unbroken specimens; in extent of flaking, as in other
characters, they usually correspond with the stones just described.
Other broken products, in a variety of forms, represented in the refuse
by split or shattered portions of the faceted stones, by large inner flakes
and by fractured outer flakes, suggest that some cobblestones have
been wholly reduced to flakes and splinters. (Plate I, fig. 8.) These
products are limited in number, and are not easily separated from the
flakes proper. An idea of their relative frequency is gained only from
the occurrence of similar results in experimental flaking when attempts
are made to secure from a single stone all possible outer flakes.

The flakes.—On the various sites studied the flakes are much more
numerous than the other trap products, and the excess of outer flakes is
particularly noticeable. In most cases the smooth convex surface of the
original stone forms one entire side of the flake, while a less convex and
rougher surface, showing the characteristic fracture of the rock, forms
the opposite side. The two surfaces meet in a continuous edge extend-
ing around the flake. The thicker end or margin is marked by a
percussion notch in the edge, like that found in the nucleus facet, or
flake bed, and by similar furrows radiating from it for a short distance
over the face of the fracture.

Beyond the radiating furrows, and nearer the opposite margin, the
greatest convexity of the face of fracture occurs and extends across the
flake in a curve having its center in the notch. The degree of convex-
ity of this face depends upon the length of the flake; the greater the
length the nearer the approach to a plane surface; a concave flake is
rarely met with. The waterworn face has its greatest convexity near
the margin that received the blow, to which it descends more abruptly
for about one-third of the circumference; the remaining two-thirds
present an edge like that of a knife, the surfaces meeting acutely. The
edge does not lie wholly in one plane, but approaches nearly that posi-
tion; although apparently sharp, it is uneven to the touch. The main
characteristics of the flakes are easily made out in the photographs and
drawings pzesented. ;

Of the irregular flakes the greater number are also from the outside
592 sTONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

of the cobblestone and owe their lack of symmetry to the overlapping
of previously detached flakes. Inner flakes are for the most part rough
splinters of small size, but a few large flakes appear from the inside of
the stone, lacking the waterworn surface except perhaps in a limited
portion of the margin. Other facts relating to the form of the flake
are developed in experimental flaking, of which an account is given
later on.

A study of the fracture and outline of these flakes serves to establish
nothing beyond the fact that they are artificial, and their number and
association with the camp site might lead to the conclusion that they
are flaking waste. Close examination, however, makes it. apparent
that they are often more than this. They exhibit modifications, some
slight while others are more decided, that point to extensive and sys-
tematic use on the one hand, and to designed modification on the
other, and I wish to lay particular stress upon the fact that here, at
least, flakes were made for definite purposes.

Ue of unmodified flakes.—There is abundant evidence that flakes
were employed as implements on all of the sites examined. Similar
use of ‘‘teshoa” flakes has been noticed by Mr. H. C. Mercer,! but, so far
as I have learned, by few other writers.

“Let us only insist,” says this writer, ‘that here were six cases
where the stone chippers’ object was to make flake knives, and that at
these sites one distinct process has been added to those already studied
and classified as illustrative of prehistoric life in America.” * * *
“And can we easily help regarding this chip knife next only to the
hammerstone that made it as the type of the most venerable of all
stone implements?” :

Modifications of the edge and surfaces, due to wear, occur in numerous
cases, and several kinds of use are readily distinguished. The sharp
edge is often dulled to roundness or even to flatness, and is polished
or striated in a variety of ways. It is also chipped, notched, and
battered.

Of 228 flakes thus modified 81 have the edge smoothed and striated
by use. (Plate ILI, figs. 1 and 2.) Sometimes the amount of wear is
such that more or less of the edge is replaced by a narrow rounded or
nearly flat surface. In a few instances the striz are oblique and show
a variety of relations both to the direction of the edge and the plane in
which it lies. It is commonly the lateral edges that are most worn, and,
especially in broad flakes, the strie run at right angles to the edge.
The whole circumference or only a small part of it may show these
characters. Flakes showing these modifications have an average long
diameter of about 3 inches.

In the few instances where the striations are directed obliquely to
the edge there is no other mark of use. In cases where the striations

'“*Pebbles chipped by modern Indians as an aid to the study of Trenton Gravel
Tmnplements.” H.C. Mercer. Proc. A. A. A.S. 1892, page 287.
STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN. 593

ame directed obliquely to the plane of the edge the modification is gen-
erally in that part of the circumference near the percussion notch,
where the edge is like that of a half sphere. The oblique strive run
into the rough surface of the flake, as shown in Plate ITI, fig. 7.

Of the 228 specimens studied, 166 have the edge altered by chipping
incident to use. Few or many chips have been broken from the edge,

and commonly from what was its sharpest portion. Besides the chip-

ping, an added loss is seen, in such cases, in the rounding off and often
in the polishing of angles or prominences of the edge, whether of the
original flake or where it has been altered by the chipping. In some
specimens the facets left by chipping are of different ages; some are
little worn where they meet the edge of the flake, while others are
almost obliterated. Chipping of the edge is apt to be most marked in
heavy flakes, and especially in those having well-developed marks of
use. Occasionally the chipping has worked a notch in the edge to
which most of the wear is limited. Where the chipping is greatly
developed the edge is roughly blunted, presenting a battered appear-
ance. The chipping here referred to is the result of use. and is not
designed.

The simple rounded, often polished edge, is present in some part of
the circumference of 211 out of the 228 specimens examined. The
rounding is often the only modification of the edge. (Plate IIL, fig. 6.)
The abrasion in cases extends over chipped portions and irregularities.

Modifications of the face of fracture in the nature of smoothly worn
and striated portions, distinct from changes incident to wear at the
edge, occur in 87 flakes. (Plate ILI, figs.3 and 4.) These vary from a
slight reduction of the roughness of the stone to a marked grinding of
the whole surface. The middle of the face is always more worn than
parts nearer the circumference. Striw are usually short, but some
extend nearly the length of the flake and cross others at various
angles. Sometimes a groove is worn in the face of the stone correspond-
ing in direction with the greater number of scratches. All save 9 of
the 87 specimens show striation. In these 9 only the more prominent
irregularities have been touched by the grinding. In a few eases the
striz are arranged in broken circles around the center of the flake and
more or less concentric. indicating a circular movement of the stone
iM VSes

The changes thus described are readily distinguished from changes
produced by natural agencies, chemical or mechanical. Wear produced
by water and ice action is of a totally distinct nature, and alterations
of the surface by decay operate alike on all surfaces, giving no hint of
the specialization which comes about through use.

Uses illustrated.—The trap flake was used in various ways, some of
which are-illustrated in Plate V. As a scraper, a, it was held perpen-
dicularly to the surface operated upon, or approximately so, and moved
in the direction indicated by the arrow; with downward pressure the

SM 97 38

594 STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

rounding and striation of the edge could be produced: an oblique
movement would produce the oblique striations.'

In the operation represented in b the flake is held obliquely and the
edge is pushed forward, with its fractured face directed downward
toward the surface treated, as indicated by the arrow. ‘This operation
is not unlike that of planing, and accounts for modifications in which
striations run over the rough surface of the flake, which was generally
beneath. The divergence of the strizw from the line of the long axis of
the flake coincides with the natural outward tendency of the move-
ment, and with the theory that the operator was right-handed. Flakes
modified in this way are usually characterized by a rounded upper end,
making them convenient for holding in the palm of the hand. The
results of incising wood and leather, and especially of incising with a
sawing motion, were the same. Chopping and grindin® gave charac-
teristic results.

In the operation represented in ¢, the flake is held in much the same
manner as in the first instance, but is drawn in the direction of the
edge, as indicated by the arrow, making a cutting tool. The modifica-
tion shown in Plate III, 7, is thus produced, the character of the
substance incised naturally having much to do with the rapidity of
wear. Scraping as already shown may produce a similar effect. Held
again in much the same way, repeated chopping blows would give the
chipped edge with rounded angles superimposed shown in d.

Pressure in all cases is an important part of the operation, whether of
scraping or cutting, and in the experiments it was productive of more
or less chipping of the edge in addition to the abrading effects.

In e the flake is held by the fingers of the right hand with the rough
surface directed downward. If moved in this position back and forth in
a straight line or in a circle or ellipse over the surface subjected to its
action, a variety of the effects observed in the specimens may be
produced. }

Again, if held in the palm of the left hand, 7, the rough surface of
fracture uppermost, the flake may answer the purpose of a whetstone,
the object ground being moved back and forth in the direction of the
arrows. A specialized flake (b, Plate VI) is represented as the object
ground. In this manner the trap flake would take on exactly the
modification that is found in certain of the flake tools.

Specialized flakes.—Many of the trap-flake tools have been designedly
specialized by means of flaking, pecking, and grinding. Degrees of
elaboration occur extending from a simple alteration of the serviceable
edge to a more complete working out of forms characteristic of the

1 Materials of several kinds were operated upon by the author to test the rapidity
of wear and the nature of the effect upon fresh flakes. Wood, stag horn, bone, hide,
and stone were cut, chopped, and ground. The effect when the scraping acts had
been carried on for some time was a smooth and polished edge, without striations,
except where the material worked was itself uneven in texture.
STONE IMPLEMENTS ‘FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN. 595

ordinary elaborated edge tools of the vicinity. The simplest alteration
is found in the resharpened edge of flakes which have seen service.
The result is clearly apparent when produced by slanting blows near
the edge from one side only, a result not readily duplicated by any of
the acts of utilization, such as chopping, scraping, etc. The large flake
(a, Plate IV) illustrates the effect of designed flaking, and (b) the flak-
ing caused by chopping, both results being easily verified by experiment.

Another example of the flaked edge, not, however, the result of slant-
ing blows, is found in the used scraper (Plate III, g). This specimen
is Shown principally because of its well-marked striations. A scraping
edge shaped by flaking is not common, and is never as sharp or uniform
as the natural edge, although more durable for rough usage.

Hatchet shapes.—A very common form of implement in this region is
a notched flake (Plate VI) resembling a hatchet. The notches are
worked in the lateral edge of the flake nearer its thicker end. Some-
times their presence is indicated by a slight battering of the edge only,
but for the most part they are deeply flaked from both sides, the
roughness of the cleft being reduced by a few bruising blows. The
thinner margin of the flake is the edge of the implement and is fre-
quently ground on the rough side, but to a moderate extent only.
Three inches may be given as an average length of these objects. They
were probably used chiefly for scraping and incising, as the marks of
use correspond to those of the unspecialized flakes which have been
so used.

The notched forms pass by degrees into others, showing more exten-
Sive alterations of the natural outline. The notches are enlarged by
flaking and bruising until only the thick and thin portions of the
circumference remain unchanged. This completes the elaboration
of form for a large proportion of the series; but bruising of the thick
end into a rounded head or poll and grinding of the thin edge have
occasionally produced still more finished implements. Many examples
recall the familiar chopping knife of the modern kitchen, while speci-
mens having a greater length and relatively less width are well suited
for use in the hand without hafting. Many may be described as broad
hatchets with a flaring edge, and these pass into the narrower and
more conventional shapes.

Celt shapes.—A more uniform reduction of the sides of the implement
has produced a well-represented series that may well be classed with
celts (Plate VII). Instead of concave lateral outlines, the sides are
approximately straight. The edge of the tool remains unmodified, or
is reduced to a straighter line and greater thickness by grinding. The
opposite end is bluntly pointed or rounded.

The original percussion notch, or the lines radiating from it, can usually
be discovered at the side rather than at the head of the implement, the
long axis of which corresponds to the width of the flake. In cases
where both the notch and lines have been obliterated, the curve of the
596 STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

convex surfaces, aS Shown in the characteristic profile of the flake, also
serves to locate the point at which the initial blow fell.

Grinding has served more in this class of implements than in others
as a method of shaping. It was applied to the edge of the rough sur-
face for a space of half an inch on the average, and at such an angle as
to remove a considerable portion of the thin, natural edge. At the same
time it served to bring the edge more exactly into the plane of the
implement.

The waterworn surface was rarely treated, as grinding, even in slight
amount on the convex side, would carry the edge farther from the
median plane of the implement.

The functions of these celt forms, as indicated by worn edges, were
the same as those of the simple flakes. A length of 34 inches may be
taken as an average for these implements.

Fie. 1.

In fig. | two implements are sketched within the outlines of flakes
that might readily have served as blanks for such specializations. The
outlines have been traced from common forms of outer flakes selected as
far as practicable to correspond in proportions with the included imple-
ments. In each ease the section through the long axis shows the
nearly unaltered flake section still present in the implement. Elabo-
rated outlines are thus clearly seen to be specializations of the flake.
The length of the flake and the length of the implement correspond
in the specimen a, while in } the width of the flake has become the
long axis of the implement. This is shown by the location of the per-
cussion notch (#) and in the character of the curves of the section.
An oblique diameter often became the long axis of the implement
when the blank offered some irregularity of thickness or outline.
Alignment of the edge by grinding is shown in both specimens.

Rejectage.—Rejectage which has necessarily occurred during special-
izing operations is not particularly abundant. The number of rejects
STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN. 597%

obtained from the sites amounts to twenty-nine only, including all
partly flaked forms which may be recognized as such. About twelve
halves may be added to these; halves of used implements are not
included.

Although limited in number, there are sufficient rejects to show that
flakes have been discarded at all stages of shaping. The beginnings
of designed forms appear in the single roughly flaked notch or in the
roughing out of one side by slanting blows. In such examples the
cause of rejection is apparently often to be found in too great a loss
of the edge at a point probably designed to remain unaltered. Trans-
verse and oblique fractures have also in some cases been the cause of
failure, dividing the unfinished implement at the narrow portion or
notch or detaching the smaller end of the partly flaked celt. Some
rejections have resulted from attempts to bring the desired edge into
proper alignment by flaking rather than by the more usual and slower
method of grinding.

In Plate VIII the forms which are intermediate between the blank
flake and the final product are presented as instances of partial elabo-
ration. The simple flake is the first term of the series, its blade char-
acters having reached their full development with one effectual flaking
blow upon a waterworn stone. The unbroken cobblestone and the
nucleus precede the flake in the series presented.

Designed shaping of the cobblestone.—Specimens are not wanting with
which to arrange a series of flaked cobblestones corresponding to the
Piny Branch rejectage series! and series from other shops in the United
States where pebbles and bowlders have been flaked into blank blades.

Some of the cobblestones have the characters of the one-faced turtle
back or reject, and additional trimming and straightening of the edge
is seen in a limited number of specimens. Twenty-six rejects and
eleven halves and fragments constitute the total number of specimens
intermediate between the faceted stones described above and the celt
forms.

Just how many of the flaked cobblestones of the refuse were designed
originally to pass into some of these more advanced forms and proved
to be failures before assuming their intended characters, is a question
that can not be definitely answered.

The working out of the celt outline (/, Plate IX) may be considered
to begin with ce, Plate II, and to be well advanced in d and e, Plate IX,
which are the only forms of the particular kind in all the refuse. The
final form is also one of three examples appearing in local collec-
tions. It is difficult to say whether the evidences of grinding, seen in
d,e, and f, Plate IX, are due to intentional shaping or to the effects
of use. Flaking of both sides of the cobblestone is poorly represented.
A fully developed leaf blade, with a sharp edge all around, is, from the

nature of the material, not a possible outcome of the process; and the
specimens shown in d and e, Plate IX, do not have the meaning in the
Benton refuse that exactly similar forms have been demonstrated to
have in the Piny Branch rejectage.

Tabulated statement.—The following table will aid in comparing the
various classes of trap products. it shows clearly that the flake was
much more extensively used than the nucleus.

The used and shaped flakes comprise nearly all the large outer flakes
and about an equal number of medium size, while a very few of the
smaller flakes became tools. Of the total flakage 21.6 per cent are
used flakes, and 3.4 per cent specialized and used flakes. Twenty-five
per cent is therefore the proportion of used implements. On the other
hand, there are eleven used faceted cobblestones and one specimen
that may be classed as a completed and used celt, less than 5 per cent
of the total number of flaked stones. Two of the used faceted stones
used for grinding have been illustrated (e, Plate I, and b, Plate II).
The remaining six show very slight flaking. Of the three specimens
showing use only one was flaked, and that but slightly, around the
margin. Similar specimens, but unused, are tabulated with the reject-
age. It appears, therefore, that nearly all of the Benton series of
implements are flakes or of flake origin.

Of the 1,051 flakes found a little more than 80 per cent, including
the used and the shaped flakes, are such as must have been struck from
cobblestones from which not more than five flakes have been derived.
The other 20 per cent “are such as would originate in further shaping
of the flakes or of the cobblestones.

The amount of flakage and the number of cobblestones flaked are
STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN. 599

about rightly proportioned, and as the collections represent a number
of sites this relation can be relied upon as evidence that waste and
products are fairly accounted for. As already stated, the greatest care
was taken to collect all visible trap waste on the sites studied. Later
visits to the sites have yielded little additional material. The preva-
lence of outer flakes seems to indicate designed flake production rather
than the blocking out of blades, especially as it is associated with
general use and specialization of outer flakes. There are excellent
reasons for assigning nearly all flaked cobblestone nuclei to the unde-
signed waste, though there may be occasional instances of used and
shaped nuclei.

Methods of shaping.—Thus far in the description of flaking opera-
tions direct percussion has been the method of working implied. In
the chert flaking of the region trap hammer stones have been used,
other stones rarely serving this function. Hundreds of sites yield trap
pebbles battered in portions of the circumference and associated with
chert flakes and rejects. That similar hammers may have served at
Benton in the flaking of trap is possible; as elsewhere, they are present
in the mixed refuse of the sites, but chert flakes and rejectage are like-
wise present. There is, however, a distinction to be drawn between
two classes of hammer stones on the Benton sites—a distinction which
might easily result from the different properties of the two materials
flaked, the trap being only of medium hardness and remarkably tough;
the chert hard, but brittle. From the great number of trap hammers in
certain localities associated with chert refuse only, the incidental effect
upon the hammer in shaping that material is shown to be nearly con-
stant, many light or moderate blows with the softer rock upon hard,
flinty angles having produced finely battered portions of its margin.
Distinct from these are a small number of stones on the Benton sites
which have been subjected to few and exceedingly hard blows, produc-
ing coarse and irregular battering (Plate II, b). In size and shape
such battered stones were like those selected for flake making by the
aborigines.

Huperiments in flaking.—When flaking is attempted experimentally
with fresh stones from the beach, blows of sufficient force to flake a
trap cobblestone mar the trap hammer in precisely the same manner as
the rougher specimens of the refuse have been marred. The blow nec-

essary to flake trap smashes a chert stone into innumerable pieces

which have no resemblance to flakes. Flaking of the hammer rarely
occurs in working chert experimentally, and from investigations on
many Sites it is clear that it rarely occurred in aboriginal manufacture.

On account of the force required in flaking trap bowlders, it proved
to be a difficult matter to hold the stone which was to be flaked in the
hand. Both hands were numbed by repeated shocks and often con-
tused by glancing strokes, the perpendicular blow upon the edge per-
mitting little chance of escape for the fingers of either hand in case of
a deviation in direction on the part of the hammer. ‘The rebound like-
600 STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM SHORES OF LAKE MICHIGAN.

wise caused uncertainty of grasp. Thick gloves improved matters
somewhat, but flaking was seldom successful, and large flakes seemed
to be altogether impossible results. The failure by free-hand methods
led to other experiments. The stone was made to stand on edge by
sinking it partly into compact sand or sod. The blow was then
directed upon one of the usual points chosen for flaking, the hammer
being held lightly, so that in case of a glancing blow it might be
allowed to leave the hand and strike the ground at the side of the
stone operated upon. With this greater freedom of action it developed
that flakes were produced, but more often from the hammer than from
the stone struck. This result was made nearly constant by using the
smaller or thinner stone as the hammer when a difference of weight or
thickness existed. Thus, without change in the operation other than
transferring the design of flaking from the stone struck to the stone
which gave the blow, choosing flaking points in its circumference
rather than in the circumference of the stone upon the ground, flakes
were successfully reproduced.

The three sketches given in Plate X illustrate the operation and the
manner of revolving the stone held in the hand as successive flakes
were made.

All the forms of nuclei and flakes characteristic of the Benton trap
refuse resulted from extended experiments, and more commonly from
the stone employed as the hammer. It was observed that, unless fresh
stones often replaced those experimented with, battering and fracture
carried them beyond common effects found in the aboriginal refuse.

Specialization of the flakes was pursued far enough to show that |
there was little difficulty in applying the ordinary methods of shaping,
the flake being held in the hand and slanting blows from a hammer
stone delivered along its edge. A combination of flaking and battering
soon produced the desired outlines. Grinding with the rough surface
of flakes and nucleus facets soon gave the desired edges, the grinding
surfaces taking on characters similar to those observed in the abrading
tools shown in Plate ILI.

It is not claimed that the aboriginal method of flake shins IS Cer-
tainly determined by these experiments, but the operation is not with-
out precedent among primitive peoples. Two instances in which the
stone flaked served as the hammer have been reported, one in Aus-
tralia, where flakes were made,' and one in Tasmania,’ in which the
edge of the stone was sharpened by the removal of flakes.

A PRELIMINARY ACCOUNT OF ARCHAOLOGICAL FIELD
WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897.!

By J. WALTER FEWKES.

My field work in the summer of 1897 opened with an examination of
Kintiel, a ruin about 25 miles north of Navajo, Arizona. Extensive
excavations were made at Four-Mile Ruin, near the town of Snow Flake,
south of Holbrook, and at Pinedale, not far from the northern border of
the Apache Reservation. A preliminary reconnoissance of the ruins of
Pueblo Viejo, on the Upper Gila south of the White Mountains, closed
the archeological work of the season.

I was accompanied throughout the summer by Dr. Walter Hough,
of the National Museum, and was joined at Four-Mile Ruin by Mr.
F. W. Hodge, of the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. Both of these gentlemen rendered most valuable aid:and con-
tributed much to the success of the explorations.

I left Washington on the 17th of June, 1897, and returned on Octo-
ber 16th of the same year, being absent in the field about three months.
Nearly a thousand ancient objects were collected from the various
localities visited. As in former years, the majority of the specimens
_ were mortuary pottery, but in addition to this material I brought back
many notes, photographs, and plans of rooms and ruins. A visit to
the Hopi Indians, in August, enlarged my knowledge of their Snake
Dances.

OBJECT OF THE FIELI) WORK IN 1897.

The primary aim of my explorations in the summer of 1897 was a
continuation of the work of previous summers, viz: To follow the migra-
tion of the southern families of the Hopi, along the Little Colorado, and
its tributaries, to their sources in the White Mountains. In the preced-
ing summer my work extended as far south as Chaves Pass and Winslow,
about 30 miles from the latter town. The main result of that explora-
tion was the determination of the southern extension of a zone of
Tusayan pottery. My first effort, in 1897, was to discover the breadth

‘While the cost of this expedition was defrayed from the appropriation of the
Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, this preliminary account seems
to possess such popular interest that it has been deemed desirable to give it early
publication here.

of this zone or to find its eastern limits. I therefore began work on a
ruin in as nearly as possible the same latitude as Walpi, to determine
the relation of its antiquities with those of Tusayan. It was found
expedient to choose the ruin called Kintiel for this study, which choice
took me into a region with archeological characters different from those
on which I had formerly worked.

While the line of demarcation between the Hopi and Zuni zones of
ruins is not a sharp one, and ancient pottery of the one grades imper-
ceptibly into that of the other, as might be expected, we can say that
there are two parallel sections of country extending north and south,
which are achexologically different, separated by the boundary of New
Mexico and Arizona. In the Arizona section there is a marked archi-
tectural similarity of the ruins from the Colorado River to the Gila, and
a difference from the Zuni belt which extends across New Mexico from
San Juan River, southward. The variations in the ceramic art of these
two sections, in prehistoric times, were not as marked as that between
the modern Hopi and Zuni, the survivors of the inhabitants of these
ancient pueblos. The plan of work in 1897, was to gather more data
than were hitherto available bearing on these differences.

KINTIEL AND NEIGHBORING RUINS.

A ruin which is designated on many recent maps by the name Pueblo
Grande is situated about 25 miles north of Navajo, one of the small
stations on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. This ruin is called by the
Navajo Indians, Kintiel (broad house), and is one of the largest in New
Mexico or Arizona. It is claimed by Zuni traditionalists as a former —
home of some of their ancestral clans.

Up to within a few years Pueblo Grande, or Kintiel, was one of the
best preserved ruins in the southwest, and one of the largest west of
those in Chaco Canyon. Its walls were at that time almost entire, but
since then most of them have been torn down to yield building material
for the house of a trader, who has built his store in about the center
of the old pueblo, and dug out the old spring in the middle of the ruin.
Little attention has been paid to this ruin by archeologists and no
attempt at elaborate excavations has been made.

The destruction of the walls of Kintiel rendered it impossible for me
to add anything to the description of them given! by Mr. V. Mindeleff,
and my attention was therefore mainly turned, as soon as I saw the
mutilation of the ruin, to the character of the material that could be
brought to light by excavations. A cemetery was soon discovered on
the eastern side of the northern section, through which extensive
trenches were dug extending from the outer walls of the ruin to the
periphery of the mounds. It was found that the same custom of bury-
ing the dead just outside the outer wall of the pueblo prevailed here
as at Sikyatki, Homolobi, and the ruin at Chevlon Fork, but that the

number of interments at this point were by no means so large as the size
of the pueblo Jed me to suspect they should have been.

The pottery exhumed from the cemeteries at Kintiel was very differ-
ent from that of any ruin yet explored near the Hopi pueblos, and
resembled very closely in character and ornamentation, ceramic ware
from the ruins near Zuni, which evidence substantiates the claim of the
Zunis, that Kintiel was constructed by one of their clans or phratries.
A large proportion of the pottery belongs to the group called white,
with black deeoration, and there were representatives of the group of
red ware, but the yellow ware, so characteristic of Tusayan, appears to
be almost wholly absent. The pottery, as a rule, is coarsely made, and
the decoration, as a general thing, simple. It is more closely related
to the Cliff House pottery of the San Juan River on the north and
Tulerosa Ruins to the south than to that of any ancient ruin from Moki
southward.

One needs but make a superficial comparison of the pottery of Kin-
“tiel with that of Sikyatki, or other Hopi ruins, to see how inferior it is
‘ in character and decoration. This is true in more general comparisons,
for, with the exception of white pottery with black-line decoration, the
ancient Hopi ceramic ware is superior to any other in our Southwest.
The accompanying plates indicate the general character of the pictog-
raphy of Kintiel.

A eairn, filled with stones and rock concretions, was found southeast
of the ruin Kintiel, not far from its outer wall. Of the many strange
shapes which the stones in this cairn assumed the most striking were
three stone fetiches, carved to resemble animals. There were likewise
a number of stone balls, some spherical, others of ovoid and cylindrical
sbapes. <A small, flat, oval stone disk was likewise found in this col-
lection. 7

In digging out the spring, from which no dowbt the ancient people
of Kintiel derived their water supply, the resident trader found stone
steps still used in descending tothe water. The spring had been walled
in, and was protected from hostile invasion by its position inside the
old pueblo.

Taylor Spring is situated about 7 miles north of Navajo,' on the road
from that station to Kintiel, and near it there are two small ruins. These
ancient habitations are both reduced to low mounds, one of which is
circular, the other rectangular; but neither shows any signs of walls
standing above the surface of the ground. The former mound lies a
few hundred feet north of the spring; the latter about a quarter of a
mile off the road in the same direction. Both of these ruins are prom-
ising places for study, but I was obliged to pass them by with only a
cursory examination.

There are extensive ruins near Tanner Spring, about 20 miles west

of Kintiel, which, from reports, I should judge would repay systematic
stady.

A ruin known by a Navajo name, Kinna Zinde, was photographed
and described several years ago by Mr. Victor Mindeleff. It lies a few
miles north of Kintiel and, I should judge, is now in about the same
condition as at the time of his visit. A hurried examination showed
that it is a small, well-preserved ruin, walls of which still rise two
stories high with many of the beams still in situ. An old ladder,! or
rather the poles of one, with notches in which the rungs were for-
merly tied, has not been moved from its old place. From the scar-
city of pottery shards about the foundation of Kinna Zinde, it would
appear that the house had not been inhabited many years when it was
abandoned. ‘The base of the walls is slightly elevated above the neigh-
boring plain, and when seen from one side, as shown in Mindeleft’s
photograph, the ruin resembles a round tower. The walls on the oppo-
site side from which his view was taken are rectangular, and there are
partitions in the inclosure as if this part was once divided into several —
rooms. There are evidences of at least two stories in the inclosures of —
the walls. The character of the stone masonry is the same as that
of Kintiel, and there is no reason to doubt that it was built about the
same time.

RUINS SOUTH OF HOLBROOK NEAR PINEDALE AND SNOWFLAKE.

A short distance east of Holbrook, Arizona, the Little Colorado River
takes a southeasterly course, and near this turn it is joined by a tribu-
tary, which rises in the foothills of the White Mountains almost due
south of the junction. I was informed that there were several large
ruins on the banks of this tributary, which led me to extend my archezo-
logical researches into this part of Arizona.

There are evidences of former occu ation of the country immediately
about Holbrook, and several unbroken specimens of pottery and many
fragments of the finest ware have been collected within a mile of the
town. I was, however, unsuccessful in a search for ruins of any large
pueblo in the neighborhood, and it would appear either that the abo-
riginal dwellings in this locality were very small, temporary halting
places of migratory clans, or constructed of such perishable material
that it has left no commensurate mounds to mark their former presence.

Evidences of occupation by Indians were obtained from the top of
Woodruff Butte, that prominent mountain of pyramidal shape which
is visible from Holbrook in a southerly direction. Two beautiful stone
pendants, in the form of birds, and an ancient pipe of white stone, with
numerous turquoise and shell beads, were found on top of this butte by
Mr. Webb, of Pinedale. Other objects of Indian manufacture are

years ago.

known to me, from the summit of Woodruff Butte, but I have never
visited the elevation, which is conspicuous for miles around.

Small ruins in the petrified forest' were examined, and yielded a
few interesting objects.

PINEDALE RUINS.

The settlement called Pinedale is situated, as its name signifies,
among the pine trees, in a small valley high up on the sides of the
foothills near the northern edge of the Apache Reservation. It lies on
one of the tributaries of the Little Colorado River, near its source, and
is approached by a rough road which branches from the Fort Apache
military road a few miles south of the settlement called Taylor.

The largest of the ruins uear Pinedale is situated just beyond the
town near an unfinisbed (1897) stone schoolhouse. It is divided into
two parts, which are separated by the road. The portion on the right
has a rectangular form, composed of a single series of square rooms
inclosing a plaza. Tall pine trees of great age grow from the soil,
covering the floors of several of these rooms, which indicate the great
antiquity of the buildings. The part of the ruin to the left of the road,
on the opposite side from the schoolhouse, is more concentrated than
the former, and was apparently more densely populated when inhabited.
It also has a square form, but with smaller inclosed plaza than the other
ruin. Our excavations were confined mostly to the eastern slope of
this section, where mauy ancient burials were found and a few fine
objects, mostly mo-tuary pottery, exhumed. About fifty specimens
were collected at the Pinedale ruins, but none of these were differe:t
from the objects from other ruins along the Little Colorado Valley.
Among the smaller specimens may be meutioned numerous objects
made of bone, as awls, bodkins, scrapers, gouges, and tubes, fragments
of deer antlers, metates, grinding stoves, and spear points. The color
of the pottery was as a rule either red with black decorations, or
so-called black and white, and was closely related to that found at
Four-Mile Ruin,” lower down the valley.

FOUR-MILE RUIN.

The ruined pueblo which I have called Four-Mile Ruin is situated 4
miles from Snow Flake and about 2 miles west of Taylor, Arizona. It
lies on Pinedale Creek. a small tributary of Silver Creek, which flows
into the Little Colorado. Before my visit nothing had been written
about this important ruin, as it was known only to a few people in the
Pee ae towns. My attention was called to it ae Mr. Brimhall, cE

visit. The collections made at Pinedale not having been of sufficient
size to enable me to draw conclusions regarding the arts of the people
who formerly lived on this tributary of the Little Colorado, I camped
at Four-Mile Ruin on my return from the mountains, intending to make
a brief reconnoissance. While the results were at first very discourag-
ing, I was later rewarded with one of the most instructive collections
yet obtained in Arizona.

The site of the Four-Mile Ruin is a bluff overlooking the creek.
This elevation rises abruptly on the west side, but slopes more grad-
ually to the east to the surrounding plain. On the north and south
sides the rise is also abrupt from plains which were probably originally
the farms of the aboriginal inhabitants. The ancient cemeteries were
discovered on these two sides, but had apparently been washed away
on the eastern section.

Four-Mile Ruin was evidently formerly a pueblo of considerable size,
certainly as large as modern Walpi, which contains about 300 inhabit-
ants. It was similar in form to that at Chevlon Fork, but was some-
what more extended.! There was no evidence of a central plaza in
this pueblo, which was a solid mass of houses, probably of pyramidal
shape, crowning a natural hillock and extending along a crest of a
hill. Exeavations at the highest point of the ruin showed the exist-
ence there of three well-marked stories, possibly a fourth, and we were
able to lay bare a floor of hardened clay. Some of the wooden floor
joists, very much decayed, projected from the side walls, and cooking
vessels in fragments were thrown out from a level about 6 feet below
the surface of the ground.

Early in my work at Four-Mile Ruin it was discovered that the creek
had encroached on one side of the mounds, and good evidence was
found that a portion of the fields north of the ancient pueblo had been
washed away by frequent freshets in the rainy season. These inroads
were particularly clearly marked in the northern and western sections. -
An examination of the bank of the creek north of the bluff, about 200
yards from the ruin, revealed a human bone projecting from the bank,
which led to extensive excavations at that point. This was the site of
an extensive cemetery, which continued under the bed of the stream,
or, rather, the stream in freshets had washed away the superficial soil,
so that the graves were very shallow, often only a few inches deep.
This part of the river bed, which was only occasionally flooded, was
stony and scantily covered with a growth of sage bush. The roots of
these plants grew from skeletons, near which were accompanying bowls
and other offerings which are customarily deposited with the dead.
The base of the northern slope of the ruin at the level of the plain was
found to be another burial place, containing any skeletons, deeply

‘Por want of space several small ruins discovered near Four-Mile Ruin are not
described. The mounds of an ancient pueblo near Shumway are of considerable
size. F

cavations were made at that point than at
others where the interments were as a rule deeper.

One of the most interesting rooms excavated at Four-Mile Ruin was
situated on the north side, where a deep gulley had been furrowed in
the soil by the rains. This room was excavated to the floor, by which
important architectural details of construction, in common with a Hopi
kiva, were revealed. It measured 10 feet 5 inches by 16 feet 10 inches,
and at one end there was a banquette 4 feet wide raised 1 foot 7 inches
above the main floor. The upright walls were plastered with adobe,
still smooth, and blackened with soot, and at intervals very much
decayed vertical logs were found still in place. The situation of these
upright supports reminded me of a similar architectural feature in the
construction of the buildings of Pueblo Viejo, which are described
later in this report.

The floor was paved with large flat stone slabs, nicely fitted together,
Several of these pavement stones were perforated by one or more per-
fectly round holes, sometimes beveled, an inch or two in diameter.
When these perforated stones were first found I was so struck with
their resemblance to the symbolic orifices in the floors of Tusayan
ceremonial rooms that I regarded them as such, but their number and
distribution, shown in the accompanying plan, would throw doubt on
this identification. A rectangular shrine made of four stone slabs set
on their edges occupied a position between the banquette and the fire-
place. This receptacle measured 1 foot 5 inches by 1 foot 6 inches, and
was about 10 inches deep. Its position and contents suggested the
shrine in the middle of the floor of the kiva at Awatobi, which I have
_ elsewhere! described.

We found in our excavations at Four-Mile Ruin worked stones which
gave rise to considerable speculation. The first specimen was dug out
of the ground, a few feet from the surface, in one of the cemeteries.
Later another specimen was exposed in a deep gulley in the side of
the mounds just above the site of the burial place, and in excavating
the room, which has been called a kiva, five other specimens were dis-
covered on the floor of the room. From the relative positions of the
seven objects there is no doubt that the two specimens found outside the
room had been washed out of the chamber, and that originally all seven
were part of the furniture of the room. These forms were half ovoid
in form, with one side smooth, the curved surface carefully trimmed
into shape. They were of hard stone, and the work of pecking them
into shape had evidently been an arduous one. Their sizes were uni-
formly about that of a ceremonial helmet, slightly larger than the
human head. On one side near the rounded pole there was a shallow

pit or depression about the diameter of the thumb, which was present
in every specimen. ;

It was customary for the ancient Hopi to use ceremonial masks made
of agave fiber which was plaited on ‘ forms.” Some of the oldest hel-
mets now in use were made in this way, and Mr. H. Kk. Voth has
secured one or more modern specimens of these “‘ forms” from Oraibi.

On my visit to Oraibi I examined the helmet forms collected by Mr.
Voth, and found them to be of the same material and shape as the
ovoid stones from the Iour-Mile Rv’n, save that the Oraibi specimens
were somewhat smaller and destitute of the pit in one side to which I
have referred.

One of the best copper bells which I have yet found in Arizona ruins
was taken from a grave at Four-Mile Ruin. ‘This bell closely resembles
those from the Gila Valley ruins, but is larger and better preserved
than that from Chaves Pass, elsewhere ! described.

In the graves of the north cemetery I also found a gourd rattle,
painted green and red. The impression of feathers on the surface of
this rattle indicated that it was formerly ornamented with feathers, as
is often true of rattles in use in the modern pueblos.

As in former years, the majority of specimens obtained from the pre-
ceding ruins were pottery, and include the several classes peculiar to
old pueblos. A small number of decorated vessels belonged to that
division called black and white, or white with black line decoration,
and only about one per cent could be referred to the group called yellow
ware, which characterizes true Hopiruins. The largest number belong
to the group called red ware, with black and white decorations, and
there were a few pieces typical of the Giia and Salt River valleys.
About the same relative proportion of rough and coiled ware was found
in the ruins excavated in 1897 as in previous years, and as a rule the
forms of these vessels were identical. One of the most symmetrical
specimens was a globular jug made of red ware with black decoration.
This jug had a long neck and a graceful handle, ornamented with
highly conventionalized figures of birds drawn in a glossy black.

Two of the bowls from Four-Mile Ruin were ornamented with human
figures which are strikingly different from any that have yet been found
on ancient Arizona pottery. On the head of one of these there was
represented a radiating crown of feathers, recalling certain headdresses
worn in ceremonial dances among the modern pueblos. There was
represented on each elbow of another figure a conventionalized feather,
which I have also seen in figures on bowls from Sikyatki.

One of the best reptilian figures was drawn on a food bowl of chest-
nut color almost identical with the pottery from Chevlon Ruin, exca-
vated in 1896. There were numerous figures of birds, the majority of
which were highly conventionalized, but having little in common with
the elaborate bird designs of Sikyatki. In no instance was the decora-
tion as carefully drawn as the pictography of the last-mentioned ruin.

The only insects found figured on pottery from Four-Mile Ruin were
the butterfly and the dragon fly. Flower decorations were wanting.
The typical forms of feathers characteristic of Hopi ruins were not
observed in the southern ruins.

The large food basins of red ware were ornamented on the exterior
with many highly complicated geometrical designs, and a larger num-
ber of figures of animals were found on the exterior of vessels in 1897
than in previous years.

One of these was the figure of the paw of some large plantigrade ani-
mal, possibly a bear. The complete animal, of which this was probably
one of the tracks, was delineated on the exterior of a second food basin.
The conventionalized figures of two birds joined by the tails decorated
the exterior of several food bowls.

RUINS IN THE PUEBLO VIEJO VALLEY.

If one follows a meridian south from the Moki Reservation he will
find that it strikes the Gila River not far from the mouth of the San
Pedro. It crosses the Little Colorado near the mouth of Chevlon Fork
and runs about a half degree west of Snow Flake and Pinedale, which
are situated over two-thirds the distance from Sikyatki to the Gila.
This north and south line crosses a great mountainous watershed which
separates the drainage of the Gila and the Little Colorado, and passes
through sections of Arizona presenting all the different kindseof geo-
logical environment inhabited by pueblo peoples. I will call this
north and south line an archeological meridian to which to refer varia-
tions in the character of ceramics. The differences in soil at places on
this line have profoundly affected the character of pottery found in the
different localities through which it passes.

In examining Jarge collections of ancient pottery made at Sikyatki,
Awatobi, Chevlon, Four-Mile Ruin, and Pinedale one can trace, step by
step, the gradual modifications in the character of ceramic ware over
120 miles of that distance. The beautiful yellow pottery of Sikyatki,
with sporadic examples of red, black, and white, gradually loses its
predominance and is replaced by red ware, which is most abundant in
the Little Colorado ruins. Bowls made of a rough coiled ware, with a
glossy black inner surface, unknown at Sikyatki, begin to appear
and increase in relative numbers as we go south. Last of all, as we
ascend the northern slope of the hills fringing the White Mountains,
while still on the banks of tributaries of the Little Colorado, a singular
kind of pottery, typical of the Gila basin, appears for the first time.

Having detected in ruins north of the White Mountains the sporadi«
appearance of Gila Valley pottery, I was anxious to examine the ruins
on the Apache Reservation intermediate between those of the head
waters of the Little Colorado and Gila rivers. Not being prepared to
cross the reservation for this purpose, I therefore went around the
White Mountains to a valley south of the Apache Reservation, called

Pueblo Viejo, which, as will be seen by consulting the map, is about
‘ue south of the ruin near Taylor and not far east of the meridian
already referred to.

In the year 1846 a detachment of United States troops, known as the
‘¢ Army of the West,” under General Kearny, made what was officially
called a military reconnoissance from Fort Leavenworth to San Diego.
Cal. Lieutenant Emory, of the topographical engineers, and Captain
Johnston, who lost his life in an action with Californians at San Pasqual,
were attached to the expedition, and their journals were published in
1848, ! in compliance with a resolution of the Senate. These oft-quoted
‘¢ Notes” are of great value to the student of the antiquities of southern
Arizona.

On the 28th of October the “Army of the West” camped on the
Upper Gila River bank opposite a high mountain, indicated on their
map as Mount Graham. For three days they traveled along the valley
now called the Pueblo Viejo,and Emory and Johnston were probably the
first Americans to call attention to the abundant evidences of ancient
habitations which this valley contains. Their accounts of the ruins
have remained for fifty years the best that we have of the antiquities
of this interesting region. Emory was particularly struck with the
amount and character of broken pottery about the ruins, and suggested
that the shards were broken pipes once used ‘‘to convey water.” He
found fragments of agate and obsidian, and mentions the existence of
both circular and rectangular rooms. Stone implements and metates
made of lava rock alse attracted his attention. Johnston records hav-
ing picked up a perforated marine shell and a stone painted red,’
which “‘may have been used as a foot of an idol.” He also mentions
both circular and rectangular rooms, and figures several fragments of
decorated pottery.

Both Emory and Johnston seem to have recognized that the walls
of the ancient buildings were built of earth, with foundations of water-
worn bowlders. From their descriptions I am led to believe that the
ruins which they mention are those that can still be seen at the little
Mexican settlement at Buena Vista and at Pomeroy’s farm, between
Solomonville and Safford.

The material used in the construction of these houses was such that
it weathered rapidly, with the result that in a short time after deser-
tion the house walls were leveled to the ground, and nothing remained
but mounds of earth to mark the sites of ancient settlements. These
mounds, rising a few feet above the general surface of the land, are
conspicuous for some distance on account of the poverty of vegeta-
tion upon them. They are generally slightly higher than the level of
the surrounding plain, and as the water can not be made to flood

them by means of irrigating ditches, their surface often shows above
the cultivated fields of corn or alfalfa. Naturally the white farmer,
seeking to bring them under cultivation, endeavors to plow them down
to the level of the rest of his field, and this reduction can readily be
accomplished in a few years, as the clay is not very hard. As a result
a large number of the ancient mounds of Pueblo Viejo have disap-
peared, and the sites of many old habitations are even now difficult to
find. In the same way the burial mounds have likewise been leveled,
and it is only by chance—digging a ditch or excavating a cellar—that
the wealth of aboriginal objects below the surface of the ground is
discovered.

A house wall built of earth, if not kept in repair, may last many
-years, as those of Casa Grande, or they may rapidly sink to the ground
under the erosive action of rains. The old buildings of the Pueblo
Viejo have disappeared, and in late years all traces of them have been
obliterated by the farmers of the valley. The overflow of the Gila
River, and the great torrents of water which have inundated the val-
ley, redistributing the soil, no doubt contributed to the destruction
and concealment of the mounds, especially those near the river banks.

IT have not found any ruined house cluster in Pueblo Viejo built on
an artificial platform for protection from these floods, but it is possible
that they may be later found in this region, as they are said to occur
elsewhere in the valley.

The desertion of Pueblo Viejo by the sedentary home-builders who
formerly lived there can be traced to the inroads of the Apaches. The
manner of life of the original inhabitants in the plain so exposed them
to attack that with the advent of a vigorous nomad stock they rapidly
melted away, fleeing, no doubt, to the inaccessible canyons north of
the valley or withdrawing from their farms to their kindred along the
Aravaypa and San Pedro.

The houses of Pueblo Viejo valley were constructed of stone and
earth, of which the latter predominated. The rocks employed were
river washed, rounded stones, and not angular fragments, like those
used elsewhere. The ancient builders adopted the building material
at hand. Evidently small bowlders, such as are found in Pueblo Viejo,
could not be used in constructing a wall of any height without using
much more adobe than was necessary with angular rocks, and there was
a great abundance of clay ready for use. The result was that while
stones were used for foundations and for strengthening the walls, clay
gave the walls form and finish. In the weathering of these structures,
the foundation row of stones still remain in their original positions,
where they are now exposed in almost every mound. Such a row of
foundation stones extends across a street in Solomonville, near Mr.
Kelly’s printing office. Tre earth walls and the stones they contained,
were still further strengthened at intervals by upright cedar logs, which
helped to support the roof. These logs, when the earth wore out
612 ARCHAOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897.

between them, would remain, and several old residents of the valley
remember seeing these logs projecting from the mounds twenty years
ago. They were mentioned by both Kmory and Johnston. Senor
Montoya, who lives in a modern adobe house at Buena Vistd, told me
that when he first settled there several of the mounds were staked out
by rows of upright cedar posts, marking the positions of the former
walls. These posts were used as fuel, and although no fragments
remain above ground, there are many indications of them buried in the
soil. The method of supporting an earth. wall by means of upright
posts was used at Four-Mile Ruin, and is conspicuous in the walls of
one of the rooms at that ruin. Similar vertical stumps have likewise
been found by me in several other ruins, showing that this method of
construction was a common one in widely separated localities. It has-
been noticed lower down the Gila, in the Mancos and Chelly canyons,
and appears to have been in use in the middle of the sixteenth century,
for it is mentioned by Castaneda in his account of the ‘ Coronado
expedition.”

I saw no evidence in my examination of the walls that they were
made of blocks of clay, sun dried before they were set in position, nor
of the rammed earth or pisé work, said to be so evident in Casa Grande.
I am inclined to believe that the builders were familiar with both these
architectural methods, but that in the Pueblo Viejo they adopted a
simpler one. A foundation row of stones was first laid, and upright
logs were driven at intervals along the lines of foundation, The inter-
vals between the logs, which were large, were then filled in with stones
and clay taken from neighboring flats. Possibly one object of the line
of foundation stones was to prevent undermining by water and other
agencies the action of which would be greatest at the level of the
ground. The stones thus presented an effectual resistance to erosion
at the weakest part of the wall—its foundation.

The compact dwelling called a pueblo, in which clans are huddled
together, is not represented in the ancient habitations of Pueblo Viejo.
The clusters of houses were approximated, but were not joined, being
separated by courts, reservoirs, or irrigation ditches. We find some-
thing similar to this in the localization of gentes in different quarters
of the Pueblo Walpi, where there is a separation of the houses of dif-
ferent clans, where the tendency has been to consolidation, but in the —
Pueblo Viejo ruins the houses of different clans were isolated from
each other. All the rooms were rectangular in form, or nearly so, and
although circular depressions were noted in several ruins, no evidence
was seen that these were formerly inhabited rooms. The nearest
approach to a circular room is the depression at Buena Vista, which
was too small to be referred to any of the circular rooms mentioned by
Emory and Johnston.

The chambers at Epley’s ruin, which we excavated, were filled with
adobe denuded from the upper part of the walls. Although the room

was filled with clay, it had not become so hard that the walls of the
rooms could not be easily distinguished on account of their superior
compactness.

The large circular or elongated oval depressions in the immediate
neighborhood of some of the house mounds have been identified as
the sites of former reservoirs. Other more irregular depressions mark
the places from which earth had been excavated by the ancient
builders, and it is possible that these depressions were also utilized
as water holes by the ancients. The reservoir at Buena Vista is one
of the largest that was discovered, yet no irrigating ditches leading
into it were distinctly traced. A depression full of water, to the right
of the road as one approaches Epley’s ruin, is said to have existed
there before the Mexicans excavated adobe from the adjacent lands, and
may possibly be the remains of an ancient reservoir.

There is abundant evidence that the ancient people of the Pueblo
Viejo Valley led the water from the Gila River over the plain by means
of canals for purposes of agriculture, for in many places the depres-
sions marking the old ditches may be traced for considerable distances.
These signs are well marked near San José and Buena Vista, where
the surface of the land has been least changed by the plow. I have
been informed by some of the older residents that when they came
into the country, before the Montezuma and San José irrigation ditches
had been constructed, the ancient aqueducts were much more con-
spicuous than they are to-day, and that sections of the modern ditches
follow the course of the ancient waterways.

We found the slopes of the hills marked out with lines of stones,
arranged in rectangular forms of great regularity, extending over many
acres of ground. Some of these, especially on the foothills near San
José, were very extensive. ‘These lines of stones are regarded, not as
remains of house walls, but as boundaries of ancient terraced gardens.
If this interpretation be a correct one, it appears that the ancient inhab-
itants of Pueblo Viejo cultivated not only the bottom lands, slightly
elevated above the Gila River, but also the side hills, which white
farmers have not yet brought under cultivation. It is probable that
these terraced gardens were not irrigated by ditches from the river,
but that water was carried to them by the natives in ollas from some
neighboring reservoir at the foot of the hills.

As 0 remains of houses were discovered near these terraced farms
it would seem that the ancients cultivated lands some distance from
their dwellings. Good examples of these terraced gardens exist near
the Solomonville slaughter house, and from that place along the side
of the San Simon Valley. The best examples that I examined were
not far from San José. There is a close resemblance between these
lines of bowlders and the so-called bowlder sites in the Verde Valley,
which bear every evidence of having been ancient gardens. There is
little debris about them, such as would accumulate if they were parts
614 ARCHAOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897.

of houses which had been inhabited any length of time. The great
areas covered by these lines of bowlders, both in the Verde Valley and
especially in the Pueblo Viejo, would militate against their being house
sites, for if we regard them as house walls we would have to suppose
a continuous pueblo a half a mile square without a single fragment of
pottery near by to indicate former habitation.

RUIN NEAR SAN JOSE.

The plain near the Mexican settlement, San José, shows evidence of
a large ancient population, and it is no rare thing for farmers to dig up
pottery and other prehistoric objects when preparing their farms for
cultivation. There still remains, on the right bank of the irrigating
ditch opposite where the San José arroya enters it, a section of a sym-
metrical mound, through which run ancient walls. This mound is so
situated that it protects a neighboring cornfield from overflow at times
of freshets in the arroya, for when the San José is flooded the water is
turned from it by this mound into the canal. A considerable part of
the mound has thus already been worn away, leaving exposed a section
20 feet high, revealing its artificial character. In an examination of this
section we easily traced the course of the walls, and many fragments
of pottery were exposed from the base to the top of the mound. It
would have been an easy and profitable work to dig away this whole
hill, but the owner strongly objected to my doing so, since it would
destroy the embankment which turned the water from his field. It is
only a question of a few years when this mound will be wholly washed
away, as every considerable storm eats deeper and deeper into its sides,
and spreads the soil of which it is composed over the neighboring val-
ley or washes it down to the Gila. A morning’s work in the embank-
ment revealed a small vase and one or two other objects. Several
pieces of pottery were said to have been taken from it by natives of
the village of San José, which is only a short distance away.

BUENA VISTA RUIN.

A few miles higher up the river beyond San José the valley narrows,
and about two miles from the settlement there is a cluster of four or
five modern adobe homes called Buena Vista. They are situated on a
bluff about 20 feet above the Gila, with a beautiful view of the Bonita
and neighboring mountains. This cluster of adobes is built on the site
of a large ruin, commonly called the San José ruin, which may have
given the name San José or Pueblo Viejo to that hamlet.

This ruin is one of the best preserved of any that was visited in the
valley, as there has been no great disturbance of the soil on its site, and
the mounds, as a rule, have not been leveled, as is generally the case
with those near Solomonville, Safford, Thacher, and Pima. I have
therefore made a map of the distribution of the mounds, but it is far
from satisfactory as it does not include all that are found in the cluster.

Indeed, probably no two observers would agree as to the limits of the
place, as detached home mounds can be detected almost all the way
from Buena Vista to San José. The bluff on which the ruin of Buena
Vista stands is a natural one, and commands a view of the Gila River,
between which and the mound is a low ridge of sand which forms a
bank of the San José Canal. The Gila is fringed with trees, which
also line the edge of the bluff. North of the bluff there is a wide river
bottom, now cultivated, and, no doubt, the site of ancient farms. The
ruin itself is covered with a growth of mesquite bushes, cacti, and
other thorny vegetation, but the soil is more rocky than the rich allu-
vium of the river notion.

The large central ruin of the Buena Vista cluster is fannie in
shape, formed of a number of rooms with a central inclosure or plaza,
which is now used as a corral. The walls of these rooms were built of
_ stones, or at least stone walls are all that now remain. In one or two
parts of this large structure the character of the masonry can be made
out, but as a rule the walls have so fallen that it is very difficult to
determine the size and arrangement of the chambers that formerly
composed this building. This stone inclosure may be likened to the
great central structures that characterize the Gila Valley ruins.
There is evidence that earth was combined with stone in its construc-
tion, but naught now remains but the rows of stones which supported,
possibly strengthened, the walls. This was a citadel or place of refuge,
and from an architectural standpoint resembled more nearly than any
other building the great stone ruins north of the White Mountains, at
Chaves Pass, or on the Little Colorado.

The greater part of the terrace upon which the Buena Vista ruin
was built was covered with small, rounded mounds, isolated or forming
low ridges, bearing evidences of artificial origin.

RUINS NEAR SOLOMONVILLE.

The excavations of the mounds on Epley’s farm, a short distance
from Solomonville, rewarded me with fair results. Some of these
mounds had been opened by Mexicans for adobe, and the many speci-
mens of ancient handiwork found by them have been scattered and
lost. Work had likewise been done upon them by Mr. B. B. Adams,
who greatly aided me in my studies in the valley. Epley’s ruin is
rapidly being brought under cultivation, and in a few years traces of
the ancient mounds will wholly disappear. Already so many have been
leveled that I found it next to impossible to get a good idea of the
arrangement of the house clusters in this locality. There was formerly
a many-chambered house, indicated by a high mound, just back of
Epley’s residence, which appeared to occupy the same relationship to
smaller neighboring dwellings that the large inclosure at Buena Vista
does to the mounds in its neighborhood. We dug to the lowest floor
of this house cluster and found it made of a thick layer of hard adobe
616 ARCHAOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897.

plastered on a base of cobblestones. The upright walls, separating
the rooms, were very smooth and thick. Excavations in this mound
revealed little of archeological value, and no house burials were found.

The rooms north of this central mound had been thoroughly dug out
by the adobe seekers, and it was said that pottery of fine make had
been taken from this place. The surface of the ground in the immedi-
ate neighborhood was strewn with worked stones, metates, grinding
stones, and fragments of decorated pottery left there by the workmen.
Among the objects thus abandoned were some of the finest metates
that I have ever seen, and it would not be extravagant to state that
there were over fifty rubbing stones in sight on the surface of one
of these mounds. The more valuable objects and all whole pieces of
pottery had been removed by the Mexican workmen.

The road from Solomonville to San José bisects Epley’s ruin with
mounds on both sides, connected by sections of walls visible in the
roadbed. There are large quantities of broken pottery on the surface
of all elevations in the immediate neighborhood. The cluster of mounds
on the farm adjoining Epley’s belongs, no doubt, to the same composite
settlement, and between both these places and the Gila River there are
many small hillocks indicative of former habitations. In fact, the
whole country from Solomonville to San José is thickly dotted with
mounds, as if formerly densely populated.

RUINS NEAR THACHER AND SAFFORD.

There were several house clusters near the present village, Thacher,
although at present little evidence remains above ground of their
former position. Perhaps the best preserved mounds are at Mr. L.
Place’s farm, especially in the cut of the road near his house, where
traces of walls can yet be seen. They are being rapidly leveled, and
in a few years will disappear completely. Several ancient ollas have
been found while excavating irrigation ditches in this neighborhood.

There are two large ruins at Safford which are worthy of note. One
of these is on Mr. Peter Anderson’s farm, but the mounds have been
leveled and are hard to trace. The ruin at Beebe’s place is well
marked, and many beautiful specimens of ancient pottery have been
taken from this locality. The mounds indicate that the ruin here was
very extensive, and although considerable excavation has been carried
on much of it has been unsystematic. The original form of the ancient
cluster of houses has been well-nigh obliterated, but profitable results
are possible, especially in the lowlands surrounding the mounds.

From an examination of Emory’s “ Notes” and plan of his march it
seems probable that he camped not far from this ruin on October 28th,
1846. A visit to the mounds in this vicinity was disappointing, for
most of them had been plowed down to the level of the surrounding
plain. There was, however, a small elevation in the midst of a corn-
field which probably belonged to the collection referred to by Emory.
ARCH HZ OLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897. 617

This mound lies not far from the left bank of the Gila, a few miles from
Solomonville.

The general appearance of the mounds on Mr. D. Olmey’s ranch is
practically unchanged save by superficial excavations in some of the
largest. The land, as a rule, has not been cultivated since the occupa-
tion of the valley by the whites, and is covered with a desert vegeta-
tion which formerly characterized the whole valley. Although not
unlike the ruins along the banks of the river, it is less changed than
they are, and affords a good type of the ruins of the higher lands.
There is a large spring near the mounds, and patches of cultivated
land, possibly the same farms as those once tilled by the Indians.

A number of house burials were found in the rooms at Epley’s ruin,
but they were almost invariably the skeletons of infants, the bones of
which showed no signs of cremation. These skeletons were found in
large ollas, of coarse coiled ware, and were sometimes accompanied
with decorated bowls or small ornamented vases. These burials were,
as a rule, found deeply covered with soil, near or under the floor, in the
vicinity of fireplaces. The earth in their immediate neighborhood was
loosely packed, in marked contrast to a harder soil filling the rest of
the room.

Proofs that the ancient people of Pueblo Viejo burned their dead are
many and decisive. The existence of large cemeteries just outside the
pueblo walls, which is so common in the Little Colorado ruins, was not
detected, but there were many hillocks of ashes, indicating pyral mounds.

The Gila Valley ruins are characterized by a large centrally placed
house, or fortress, and clustered about it many dwelling houses, uncon-
nected with each other, apparently habitations of clans. It would seem
that each family had its own pyral mound, and that there were several
places in each cluster of mounds where the dead were buried. Conse-
quently the interments of the incinerated bones were more scattered,
_as each family had its own cemetery. The calcined bones were placed
in vases, over which was luted a pottery disk or bowl, and the whole
buried in a neighboring mound. Near the cinerary olla, in which the
cremated bones were placed, there were deposited other pieces of
pottery, some broken, others entire.

Most of the pottery obtained from this valley came from the ruins
near San José and Buena Vista or from Epley’s farm, the site of my
most important excavations. This latter locality has yielded many
specimens in the past decade, as it has been a favorite place for digging
adobe. In the course of their work Mexican laborers have found there
a large number of pottery objects, which they have either given away
or sold to collectors. We obtained a few pieces from them by purchase,
others were presented, and several were dug up. The majority were
large ollas of coarse ware, coiled or indented, similar to those now
made by Pimas or Papagoes, save that their exteriors were rarely
smooth. These were generally found buried in the rooms, and not a
single entire specimen of these large ollas was found.
618 ARCHAOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897.

The majority of the specimens from these two ruins were food bowls,
made of rough coiled ware, with a glossy black interior. This is also
a common kind of pottery from the tributaries of the Little Colorado
and is especially abundant at Four-Mile Ruin, near Taylor, and Pine-
dale. Sporadic specimens of this peculiar ware have been likewise
found at Homolobi and the ruin near the mouth of Chevlon Fork,
excavated in 1896.

The characteristic decorated ware of the Pueblo Viejo ruins is simi-
lar to that from the Salado River, near Tempe. It has a gray color,
with black and red decorations, but is not glazed, and ordinarily is not
as glossy as the red ware of the Little Colorado. Specimens of this
ware have been found at Pinedale, Four-Mile Ruin, Chevlon, and
Homolobi, the relative proportion diminishing as the ruin is situated
more and more remote from the Gila River. A few specimens of white
and black ware and a limited number of plain red bowls were found,
but the characteristic yellow ware of Tusayan was not represented. It
will thus be seen that as we go south from Sikyatki, in Tusayan, the
yellow ware is gradually replaced by decorated red pottery, and that
the glossy black food bowls, with rough, undecorated exteriors, begin
at Homolobi, are more numerous at Four-Mile Ruin, and most abun-
dant in the Pueblo Viejo. The gray, black, and red ware also increases
as we go south.

All typical forms of pueblo pottery appear in the Pueblo Viejo..
Among these may be mentioned vases, jars, food bowls, slipper jars,
and the like. The geometrical decorations are sinllen to those on
pottery objects from ruins in northern Arizona.

None of the ceramic objects which were collected in the Pueblo
Viejo were adorned with figures of animals or human beings, and this
rule seems to hold in all the Gila Valley ruins. This may be regarded
as an indication either of great age or of a primary state of pueblo art.

It has been said that the custom of making vessels in the forms of
birds and other animals is of recent date among the Pueblos, but, as —
already shown, such a statement is not accurate. I have described and
figured clay vessels in the form of birds from Homolobi, Chevlon, and
other ruins on the Colorado Chiquito. Equally fallacious, also, is the
statement that ancient vessels were not made with organs of the human
body in relief. A vase from a cave in the Nantack’s is good confirma-
tory evidence bearing on this point.

There is another instructive specimen in the collection from Pueblo
Viejo which shows human features in relief. An intelligent Mexican
laborer brought me, for sale, a jar which he claimed to have dug from
the ruins near San José. I was disposed at first to doubt his state-
ment, but later gathered such convincing proof of his veracity that
there was no doubt of the antiquity of the vessel. The jar is made of
red ware, identical with many other specimens from this region, and
apart from its unusual decoration there is no reason to question that it
was found in this valley. The remarkable thing about this vessel is

the existence of human faces, with organs in relief, found on the upper
or smaller of the two globular parts of which it is composed.

My attention was called soon after my arrival in Solomonville to a
small head made of clay, which reminded me of certain similar objects
from Old Mexico. As in all excavations on the Little Colorado I had
never found more than the rudest imitation of a human head in clay, I
was startled by the discovery of objects of this kind so well made and
so Mexican in appearance. A report of a similar head on a dipper
handle from the Beebe Ruin, near Safford, was confirmatory of my
suspicions, but later, in the excavations at Buena Vista, a well-made
figure of a human face and head was taken from a small mound of
ashes and other débris.

The stone implements from the ruins in Pueblo Viejo were particu-
larly fine, and include all the more common kinds. In fact, almost
every stone found in Epley’s ruin bore traces of having been worked,
chipped, or in some other way pecked or dressed into an implement.
There were many metates, mostly made of a volcanic rock, the grinding
surface of which was so worn down that the sides stood 4 or 5 inches
in relief. A most exceptional form of metate was made of lava and
had three stumpy legs. This is a well-known Mexican form, which has
never been found in northern Arizona.

Several worn quartz crystals, which had evidently been prized by
their owners, were found in the rooms which were excavated. It is
supposed that they were used in the ancient ritual. A considerable
number of perfectly spherical stones, that show marks of chipping and
dressing, recall the weapons of offense used by the ancient Pueblos. It
is possible that some of the smaller of these were covered by a skin,
and, when attached to a stick, were used as a maul.

My attention was called, soon after my arrival in the Pueblo Viejo,
to small rectangular slabs of stone about the thickness of the sole of a
shoe, flat on one face, rounded on the opposite, and grooved about the
edge. Later several of these sole-shaped stones were collected. They
have never been found in northern ruins, but are common in the ruins
along the Gila and Salt rivers. These slabs were used in ancient
ceremonials, and the Hopi, who have legends referring to them, still
use stone objects, with which they may be compared, in certain kiva
rites.

The ordinary form of these objects is simply rectangulir, with a
groove on the rim and a slight depression on one face, with a border
which is ornamented with incised parallel lines. One of the best of
these slabs had the head and tail of a bird carved on the ends.

This specimen was found near Mr. L. Place’s ranch at Safford, and
was dug out of an irrigating ditch not far from his house. From the
large number of these stone objects from the Gila Valley ruins, I judge
that they were in common use in ancient worship.

A number of grooved stones identical with those mentioned in pre-
vious reports from more northern Arizona ruins were likewise found in
620 ARCHAOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897.

the Pueblo Viejo. As a rule, however, they were more elaborately
made than those from the north. Their use is apparently identical,
viz, to smooth, by rubbing, wooden sticks or arrows. Similar stones
are at present used in the Hopi pueblos in the manufacture of prayer
sticks.

SACRIFICIAL CAVE IN THE GRAHAM MOUNTAIN.

Both the Graham and Bonita mountains have many caves of consid-
erable size which were formerly used for sacrificial and other purposes.
One of these I will designate Adams Cave, from my friend Mr. B. B.
Adams, of Solomonville, who guided me to it, and assisted me in many
ways during my work in Pueblo Viejo.

This cave lies on the northern slope of Mount Graham, near a saw-
mill, south of Thacher. The entrance is difficult to find, and is said to
have been discovered by following an Apache Indian who used it as a
hiding place.

Descending the cave by a perpendicular passageway, through which
one had to lower himself as if in a well, one enters a large chamber,
from which horizontal passages drifted in different directions. One of
the largest of these extended about 100 feet into the side of the hill.
At its end the cave is enlarged and the floor covered with prayer
sticks, examples of which are shown in the accompanying cut. I
gathered possibly a peck of these sticks, but many bushels were left
behind. The sides of the rock at this point, as elsewhere, show signs
of smoke, and the smooth surface of the passages indicate frequent
visits of the Indians to their shrine.

Following another and narrower cleft we came upon a place where
there was a similar collection of prayer emblems on the ground. In
order to enter this passage one was forced to swing himself to the floor
by means of a rock artificially wedged in between the two walls. The
upper surface of this wedge was worn smooth by human hands which
had grasped it many times. At one place, where the two walls of the
cleft approached so closely that it was impossibie to pass between them
without rubbing the body on either side, the rock surface had been
worn smooth by constantly passing human bodies.

Fragments of basketry were found with the prayer sticks, one of the
best of which was a small basket plaque. I was much surprised not
to find any objects of pottery in this cave, but my examination was
necessarily a hurried one, and no excavations were made. According
to Mr. Adams, the only person in Solomonville who had visited this
cave, pottery had never been found in it.

OBJECTS FROM A SACRIFICIAL CAVE IN THE NANTACKS.

The mountainous region north of the Pueblo Viejo is designated on
maps as the Natanes Plateau, portions of which are called by cowboys,
the Nantacks. It is rough and broken, cut with deep canyons and
mountain streams, and forms the northern part of Graham County,

adjoining the southern border of the Apache Reservation. Early last
summer my attention was called by letters to discoveries made by
young men from Pima in a cave in that region, and as soon as I was
settled in Solomonville I visited Pima to inspect the collection that had
been procured by them from this region.

I found that it had been divided into about four equal parts, and
two of these parts, which were almost complete could be purchased.
Recognizing the value of the objects offered for sale, they were obtained
at a reasonable rate. The original collection contained not far from
one hundred and fifty specimens of pottery, and many shell beads,
obsidian arrowheads, and turquoises. All these objects were taken
from one cave, and were evidently ancient.!

The majority of the specimens in this collection were flat clay disks,
and platters, of undecorated red ware, and a few globular bowls of the
same color. These objects were found on benches of rock in the cave,
where water was continually dripping upon them. As the water con-
tained lime in solution a film of calcareous matter had covered most
of the pottery objects, but unfortunately this deposit had, in most
instances, been rubbed off, although in a few cases it still remained.
The objects removed were said to be only a portion of those seen in the
cave, the broken fragments having been left behind.

The turquoises and shell beads, which no doubt had been placed in
the platters, were strewn about the floor of the cave, some of them still
remaining where they were deposited. The red ware from this cave is
identical with that at present made by the Pimas and Maricopas, and
the same as that from the ruins along the Little Colorado River.

One of the most exceptional forms of pottery found in this cave was
a gray vase with head, body, and arms of a female human figure in
relief. The vase is made of coarse paste and is undecorated with the
exception of parallel white lines on the cheeks, which recall markings
on the helmets of certain Pueblo Katcinas. The treatment of the
figure in relief on this vase betrays Mexican influence.

Among other objects from this cave a clay cylinder covered with
projecting knobs, and a globular jar decorated with rows of small pits,
were the most striking. Several of the vessels had holes about the rim
as if for suspension, and all were small, as is the case with bowls used
for sacrificial purposes. In fact, the whole collection bore evidence that
it was sacrificial in nature, and from the small size of the individual
specimens we could hardly suppose they ever had any other use.

CONCLUSIONS.

There is little to guide us from historical sources regarding the age
of the ruins in this valley. In 1697 the valley of Pueblo Viejo was des-
titute of sedentary people, being overrun by eS a ude in that year

‘From what could be learned drama is little doubt that this cave ine many eee
nesses to the sacrificial cave in the Graham Mountains, already described.
622 ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897.

Bernal led an expedition down the San Pedro to its junction with the
Gila, where he turned west without entering Pueblo Viejo. A mission
called Victoria is indicated on Kino’s map of 1710, at the mouth of the
San Pedro, but east of that no missions appear to have been founded,
nor does Kino appear to have traveled in that direction. All that
region was called Apacheria, and probably long before the beginning
of 1700 the sedentary people had been forced out of the valley by
hostiles.!

The ruins in Pueblo Vieio are similar to those near Tempe and along
the banks of the Gila and Saiado. From what is left of the houses and
the arrangement of the clusters into villages, their mode of construc-
tion, irrigating ditches and reservoirs, I should judge that the former
inhabitants of the two regions were of similar culture if not the same
stock. The pottery of the upper and lower Gila ruins can not be dis-
tinguished, being identical in color, texture, and decoration. Both
people cremated their dead, and likewise, in rare instances, practiced
intramural burial.

The nearest agricultural people to Pueblo Viejo of which we have
any account in early Spanish writings were the Sobaipuri Indians, a
Piman tribe then living on the San Pedro. They appear to have occu-
pied this range in 1540, and the names of their rancherias and number
of inhabitants were given by Kino in 1679. Although they lived on or
near the sites of some of the ruins they do not seem to have regarded
these houses as the work of their people. They had an intimate
knowledge of Zuni and Tusayan, and told Father Garces that the
Mokis built some of the old building's on the Gila.

The Sobaipuri, like the Pimas, were an agricultural people, living in
rancherias which were often clustered together, irrigating their farms,
and raising corn, melons, and cotton. It is possible that their old
range was the Pueblo Viejo, out of which they had been driven by
hostile Apaches.

At the time of the visit of Marcos of Nizza there were trade relations
between Cibola (Zuni) and the Sobaipuri, and some of the latter accom-
panied Estevan to Cibola. Coronado, in 1540, met a Cibolan Indian
among the Sobaipuri and gathered information from him concerning
Cibola and other “kingdoms.” It appears that in the middle of the
sixteenth century there were cordial trade relations between the settle-
ments on the Little Colorado River and those of the San Pedro and
Gila, which would indicate visits back and’ forth and the existence of
trails between the two sections. At that time the Apaches were not
strong enough to prevent communication between the people of the
Gila and the upper tributaries of the Little Colorado.

When Bernal descended the San Pedro with Padre Kino in 1697
they were accompanied by Coro, a Sobaipuri chief, and some of his

1Probably Arivaypa Canyon was one of the last strongholds of the sedentary peo-
ple. The people of that region intermarried with the Apaches.
ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN ARIZONA IN 1897. 623

people. Kino recorded that when they arrived at the Gila they found
mounds which indicated ancient dwellings, but what information the
Sobaipuri gave him about these mounds is not mentioned in the diary,
and almost a century later the same people ascribed ruins on the Gila
to the Mokis.

Up to the advent of the Apaches there was considerable trade
between the Mokis and Sobaipuris, which was fostered by fairs (ferias)
which the Hopi came .as far as the valley of the San Pedro to attend.
They appear to have visited Taibanipita, an ancient settlement near
the modern city, Tombstone. But the Apaches in their inroads cut off
communication between the Sobaipuri and Mokis by occupying a ford
by which the ancient trail crossed the Gila River. There is abundant
archeological evidence to show that trade relations between the people
of the Little Colorado and Giia basins existed in prehistoric times, and
the Mokis were acquainted with the tribes south of the mountains.

A peculiar kind of pottery which is common in the Pueblo Viejo
Valley and in the southern ruins of the Colorado Chiquito is a coiled
ware with rough decorated exterior. The inner surface is a glossy
black. This kind of pottery is unknown at Sikyatki, is common at
Four-Mile Ruin, and has been found at Homolobi and Chaves Pass.

The characteristic Gila pottery, which is a light gray ware with
black decoration on a red base, has been found by me at Four-Mile
Ruin, near Taylor, but it is absent in ruins farther down the Colorado
Chiquito at Homolobi and Chevlon.

The decoration of pottery with human or animal designs, which was
So prominent a feature north of the Mogollons in the Little Colorado
watershed, has disappeared south of the mountains and its place taken
by figures in relief. The geometrical patterns were, however, similar
in the two regions.

The symbolism on the decorated pottery of the Pueblo Viejo ruins is
the same as that farther down the Gila, and remotely related to that of
the Little Colorado and its tributaries.

THE BUILDING FOR THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

By BERNARD R. GREEN.

The Library of Congress was founded by the act of April 24, 1800,
entitled, ‘‘ An act to make further provision for the removal of the
Government of the United States.” The sum of $5,000 was appropri-
ated ‘“‘ for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use
of Congress at the said city of Washington and for fitting up a suit-
able apartment for containing them and placing them therein.”

The act also provided ‘that the said books shall be placed in one
suitable apartment in the Capitol in the said city, for the use of both
Houses of Congress, and the members thereof.” ‘ An act concerning
the library for the use of both Houses of Congress,” approved January
26, 1802, has continued to the present time as the fundamental law of
. “The Library of Congress.”

The Library, comprising not more than 3,000 volumes, occupied a
room in the Capitol until August 25, 1814, when it shared the fate of
the building by being burned on that day by the English in the war of
1812. A month later Ex-President Jefferson offered his private library
of about 6,700 volumes on such terms as the people might accept, and
Congress, after much debate, purchased it for $23,950. It was placed
in a room in the building used by the Post-Office Department, but tem-
porarily taken for the occupation of Congress. In 1816 Congress
removed to a brick building erected on Capitol Hill for its use pending
the restoration of the Capitol. The Library was transferied to the same
building, where it remained until 1824, when it was finally returned to
the Capitol and placed in the west hall, which later became the central
of the three halls occupied by the Library until it was transferred to
the new special building in 1897. For seventy-three years, therefore,
it occupied the same accommodations in the Capitol.

In 1851 the number of volumes had increased to 55,000, but on
December 24 of that year some 35,000 of them were destroyed by fire
communicated by a defective flue, to which the woodwork then com-
prising the fitting and shelving of the library was exposed. The
interior of the three halls referred to was then reshelved on the alcove
plan in three and four tiers, with galleries wholly cast in iron, by the
Architect of the Capitol, Thomas U. Walter.

sm 97——40 625
626 THE BUILDING FOR THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

In 1860 75,000 volumes had been accumulated. By act of April 5,
1866, the library collected by the Smithsonian Institution, amounting
to about 40,000 volumes, was transferred to the Library of Congress,
which thereafter grew rapidly, reaching in 1870, when the national
copyright law went into effect, 197,668 volumes and 30,000 pamphlets.

The operation of the copyright law so increased the rate of growth
that the accommodations furnished by the three halls and two or three
adjacent small interior office rooms soon became quite inadequate for
shelving the books and performing the work of the Library and copy-
right office.

In his annual report of 1871 the Librarian, Ainsworth R. Spofford,
briefly called attention to the need for more space, and in the following
year reported on the subject at length, earnestly setting forth the
imperative necessity for more room, and even the construction of a
special building. At that time the collections amounted to 246,345
volumes and 45,000 pamphlets. The subject was soon taken up by
Congress and considered through its committees from that time until,
by the act of April 15, 1886, the present site, one-quarter of a mile south
of east from the Capitol, was selected. its acquisition by the United
States provided for, and the construction of a building authorized.

During this long period of discussion many schemes for attaining the
desired end, including a variety of plans for enlarging and occupying
the Capitol and many different sites in the city of Washington, were
considered. Several times did the legislation reach an advanced stage
and fail through the pressure of more absorbing interests. Finally the
law referred to adopted sketch plans that had been prepared by Messrs.
Smithmeyer & Pelz, a firm of Washington architects, but it fixed no
limit of cost, nor did it specify the materials of construction or character
of execution of the design other than to stipulate that the building
should be fireproof. A commission, composed of the Secretary of the
Interior, the Librarian of Congress, and the Architect of the Capitol,
was designated to conduct the construction of the building. The site,
comprising two city squares—nearly 9 acres, within the city building
lines and with the included streets—was purchased of the private
owners, the ground cleared of some seventy buildings occupying it,
and by the summer of 1888 about one-half of the foundation footings
for the building were laid. During that year, however, Congress be-
came dissatisfied with the progress that had been made and the uncer-
tainties involved in the operation of the inadequate original law, and
accordingly, on October 2, modified it and lodged the entire control of
the work, including the preparation of new plans at a limited cost, in
the hands of Brig. Gen. Thomas Lincoln Casey, Chief of Engineers of
the United States Army. He immediately placed the writer in local
charge. On March 2, 1889, Congress enacted that the building should
be erected at a total cost of $6,500,000, including previous expendi-
tures, according to a plan that had been prepared and submitted by
General Casey, pursuant to the previous act of October 2, 1888. This

plan was based on that adopted by the original act, and provided a
building of similar form, dimensions, and architecture. The project
embodied the principal materials of construction and a detailed esti-
mate of the cost.

Under these auspices operations were begun in the spring of 1889
where the operations had left off the year before, and the construction
thence proceeded without interruption until the building was finally
completed, in the spring of 1897. It is 470 feet in length by 340 feet in
width, having three stories and a subbasement, and fronts west—toward
the Capitol. Each of the six pavilions contains an attic. The accom-
panying illustrations show the floor plans of the three principal stories
and views of the interior and exterior of the building. The first guid-
ing principle of the design to accommodate a nation’s library was that
an ample general reading room should be located within the mass of
the books, to insure their easy reach and access. The next was ample
light and air, combined with security and latitude for future growth of
the collections and their uses; then that all necessary accommodations
should be provided for the constant work involved in the care, use, and
increase of the Library and its several departments, including suitable
halls for the exhibition of the curiosities and varieties of bibliography
and the graphie art.

In planning the building it was also recognized that its peculiar
importance and functions, as well as its location near the Capitol,
demanded a monumental treatment throughout, and consequently the
most substantial and durable construction, and a high order of fine art.
In endeavoring to meet all the utilitarian requirements of a national
library in the present generation it was found that library science was
in a State of rapid evolution, and that the future of the subordinate
departmental locations and needs was not sufficiently defined to enable
special provisions to be made for them during the construction of the
building. As a collection of books, however, to be housed in shelves,
and used by readers, the problem of shelving and reading room was
much more clearly presented, although book shelving, on a scale of
millions of volumes, had not hitherto approached a stage of perfection.

Out of these conditions the plan of the building was evolved. First,
a reading room of octagoual plan, to accommodate 250 to 300 readers,
with ample light from the sky through clearstory windows at a high
angle, is placed in the center of the building. Adjoining this on three
sides, stacks of book shelving are located, the main entrance being on
a fourth side. Four alternate octagonal sides have wings to the fronts
of the building, and the other four sides open into as many large courts.
The cross plan thus formed is inclosed by four fronts, forming on the
whole a rectangular plan, and containing spaces for the subordinate
departments of the library, for the expansion of the stacks of book
Shelving as future needs will require, and for the exhibition halls, spe-
cial reading rooms, staff offices, ete. For the reason given the spaces
in the front sections of the building are generally not subdivided, but
628 THE BUILDING FOR THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

are So disposed as to admit of any desirable subdivision of a more or
less permanent character that experience may indicate. At the same
time, the arrangements of windows, ventilation, and communication,
and the strength of floors are such that any part or the whole of any
of the long halls may be conveniently occupied by shelved books, while
the corner pavilion rooms are favorable for staff work, reading, etc.,
and contain also lavatories and stairways.

The building is less exposed and better guarded by having but two
entrances, a double or two-story one in front, and a single one in
rear. ‘The first is for the general use of the public and the other espe-
cially for the delivery and dispatch of freight. The front or main
entrance opens into a great staircase hall, 132 feet wide by 122 feet
deep, extending the full height of the pavilion through the first and
second stories, constructed of veined white Italian marble in richly
ornamented design, the vaulting of the lower story in marble mosaic,
and that of the upper story in painted decoration. This hall has a full
basement on the ground floor which serves as the entrance hall from
the porte cochere.

The great reading room or main rotunda opens directly from the
stair hall. It is surrounded by two tiers of alcoves shelved for books,
and surmounted by a gallery 35 feet above the floor, wherefrom visitors,
not desiring to read, may view the rotunda. Special students will find
quiet spaces in the alcoves. The reading room has a clear diameter of
100 feet, with hemispherical dome whose crown is 125 feet above the
floor. The dome lantern and semicircular clearstory windows of 32
feet diameter above the gallery furnish the light. A few small
windows open into some of the alcoves from the courts. By means of
translucent glass the direct rays of the sun are sufficiently softened in
the southerly windows. The catalogue and attendants’ counter and
desk of circular form are placed in the middle of the floor, and the
readers’ tables are arranged around this in three concentric circles.
The central desk is in communication with the several stories of the
book stacks at all times by means of pneumatic tubes for written mes-
sages and speaking, electrical annunciators, and endless-chain book
carriers operated by electric motors. The side walls are composed of
an alternation of narrow brick piers and plate glass openings extend-
ing the full height of the building, admitting ample light from the courts
throughout the stack.

An elevator, stairway, and the endless-chain book-carrier are located
in the middle of the stack. The windows are fixed and air-tight, all
air for warming and ventilation being passed up through the stack
from the subbasement by natural draft or fans, and discharged at the
roof. Hach of the larger stacks will hold 800,000 volumes, and the
smaller one about 175,000. This shelving and that of the reading room
alcoves will together accommodate about 2,000,000 volumes, which is the
present capacity of the shelved portion of the building. The capacity
of the large halls above noted as available for extensions of the shely-

ing is about 2,500,000 volumes, making the total ultimate capacity of the
building 4,500,000 without encroaching on the exhibition halls or any
of the spaces needed for the work of the Library or for special reading
rooms. The small book stack is devoted to the Smithsonian collection.

From a point in the basement just below the center of the reading
room books of any size are transported in a few minutes to the Capitol
and returned by means of an underground endless cable driven by an
electric motor. The Capitol terminal of this apparatus, located in a
small room east of the statuary hall, is in further communication with
the Library by means of a pneumatic message tube, electric bells, and
a telephone.

Every part of the interior of the Library building, excepting the
basement of the rotunda and stair hall, receives daylight most abun-
dantly through some two thousand windows and skylights, and this is
favored by the great width of the four courts and the reflecting quality
of the light cream-colored enameled bricks with which their walls are
faced.

Some of the larger hall spaces are not yet assigned and occupied by
the Library, the collections having but recently been placed in the
building and not yet fully arranged, but in the main the first or Library
story will contain the executive offices of the Library proper, the private
reading rooms for members of Congress, and the cataloguing, manuscript,
periodical, and Smithsonian rooms, together with the Toner collection
and Washingtoniana, and perhaps the music and map rooms; thatis to
say, the first floor will be the Library floor proper, not only for the great
public reading room before described, but for all principal collections,
executive offices, and the main entrance hall of the Library. At least
one-half of the second or upper story, which is 29 feet in clear height,
is to be occupied for the exhibition of graphic art and curiosities of
bibliography and literature. The first story has a height of 21 feet,
floor to floor. The basement story, on the ground floor, is for the offices
of superintendence and maintenance of the building and grounds and
disbursements for the whole Library, the extensive copyright depart-
ment, reading room for the blind, book binding, mailing, packing,
receiving and delivering, storage, etc. This story is 14 feet high from
floor to floor. [ach of the six pavilions—being one at each corner of
the building, and two in the east and west fronts—contains an attic
story well ventilated and lighted and suitable for safe storage and
various kinds of subordinate work. In that of the west center pavilion
there is a convenient restaurant for the accommodation of the Library
attendants and visitors.

The cellar, or subbasement, extends throughout the area of the
building and is occupied by the warming and ventilating apparatus
and most of the machinery. The boiler battery, steam pumps, coal
vaults, ash hoist, ete., are located under the east approach outside the
building. No fires are required within the building and all discomforts
of the proximity of the boiler room are avoided. There are sixteen

60-horsepower horizontal shell tubular boilers, and a coal storage
capacity of 3,000 tons. The steam operates the hydraulic pumps for
elevator power and water supply, the air compressor for the pneu-
matic-tube system, and the dynamo engines for electric lighting and
power apparatus, the exhaust from which is passed through eight sets
of tubular tanks for heating the water required for warming the
building. By circulation of this hot water through cast-iron coils of
3-inch pipe, inclosed in chambers of brick distributed throughout the
cellar, to which it is carried and returned by pipes, fresh air from
outside the building is warmed and passed by natural draft up wall
flues to the respective stories and apartments above. The air thus
taken-into the building and circulated through the rooms is discharged
at the roof through other wall flues.

A complete system of electric lighting is provided for night service,
including both the building and surrounding grounds; also means of
internal communication between all parts of the building through
cables of electric wires laid in the floors, with frequent points for
access and connection without disturbing the permanent structure.

The foundations of the building are of hydraulic cement concrete,
6 feet deep in ground which is a mixture of clay and sand of very
uniform character. The cellar walls are of hard red brick; the exte-
rior face of the superstructure of a fine grained light blue granite from
Concord, N. H.; the stone of the rotunda and the trimmings of the
court walls a light blue granite from near Woodstock, Md.; the facing
of the court walls enameled brick from Leeds, England; and the back-
ing and interior walls as well as all of the vaulting of the basement
and first stories are of hard red brick. Most of the floors that are flat
ceiled are of terra cotta, and this material also forms the covering and
filling of the roofs and main dome, of which the supporting members
are of rolled steel in beams, girders, and trusses. All of the floors are
leveled up with concrete and surfaced with tiles, terrazzo, or mosaic in
the public spaces, while in the office and working rooms they are covered
with a carpet of southern pine boards.

The most important of the strictly useful features of the building are
the book stacks, of which the design is largely original. The problem
was new, not only through the capacity to be provided but the numer-
ous other conditions to be met, such as light, ventilation, adjustability
to several uses, communication, immunity from fire, cleanliness, dura-
bility, and simplicity. It was also necessary that rapid mechanical
transmission of books between the shelving and the reading room
should be provided, coupled with a quick and reliable means of com-
munication, both written and oral. Existing libraries lacked nearly all
of these qualities and appointments and it behooved the designers of the
new building to take advantage of modern materials and mechanical
resources and devise the best possible system of shelving and mechan-
ism to meet all the requirements. This was quite successfully accom-
plished. Having prepared the courts of the building and the walls of the

stacks, as above described, a slender, rolled steel framework of continu-
ous columns and horizontal deck members was introduced, dividing the
stack into nine stories of 7 feet each. The decks are covered with white
marble slabs and contain narrow openings in front of the shelf ranges
for communication, admission of light, and circulation of air. In each
story on either side of every column a simple vertical cast-iron wing is
attached, having the necessary teeth and lugs to receive the shelves
and permit of their ready adjustment to any interval desired. The
shelf is of a gridiron form, being a set of parallel bars of N section,
forming an extremely stiff and smooth shelf, capable of receiving any-
thing that any shelf may be called upon to carry while its weight does
not exceed that of white pine wood. 'l'he shelves may all be removed
from any bay or series of bays on a deck to make a passageway or
insert any convenient piece of furniture, such as a card catalogue, desk,
or cabinet of any kind. The shelf length is uniformly 38 inches in all
the stacks and the shelves are therefore quite generally interchange-
able. Thus, by indefinite multiplication of the few simple elements
described, a stack of almost any required dimensions and capacity may
be constructed. Proper anchorage of the horizontal deck bars in the
surrounding walls is requisite for lateral stability of the loaded stack,
and some other constructive details must be observed, but it is a sim-
ple thing to make a stack of twenty or more stories or tiers in height
and of almost any other dimensions.

The book carrier is a pair of parallel, endless chains, running in a
vertical shaft in the middle of the stack; thence in a horizontal duct
in the cellar to a point below the central desk of the reading room,
where it turns upward and ascends vertically to the delivery outlet at
the desk. A series of equidistant book trays, eighteen in number, are
suspended between the chains. The machine runs continuously and
automatically takes on and delivers books of the size of a quarto or
less at its reading room terminal and at each of the stack stories. The
speed of the carrier is about 100 feet per minute.

The pneumatic message tube is also convenient as a speaking tube.

The great rotunda or public reading room of the building, the main
staircase hall or foyer, the private reading rooms tor the members of
Congress, the Librarian’s office, the corridors communicating with
these, and the exhibition halls as well as many portions of the exterior
walls, especially the west main pavilion, have received a good degree
of artistic treatment and embellishment, but all within strict architec-
tural requirements. Some forty sculptors and mural painters, about
equally divided in numbers, furnished the principal works of art under
the architects’ supervision and direction. Many appropriate quotations
and names are inscribed on the walls in the architectural tablets,
freizes and panels, adding to the general impressiveness and interest
of the building.

In all ways and from all points of view the library building is emi-
nently instructive as an example of good design, good appointment for
632 THE BUILDING FOR THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

its great purpose, good building and good administration in the execu-
tion, and therefore the more appropriate to house the nation’s library.

The unusual success of the undertaking under Government auspices
is almost wholly due to the selection of a known competent, sturdy,
and faithful individual such as General Casey was, and giving him the
sole charge directly under Congress without an executive superior
liable to interfere and cause delays. The work went on quietly, but
with energy, and was completed within the originally estimated time
and well within the legal limit of cost.

The total cost of the building was $6,344,585.34—that of the site,
$585,000—complete records of the work are preserved in drawings,
photographs, correspondence, and accounts. Mr. Paul J. Pelz, of the
original firm of architects, was employed to assist as architectural
designer, remaining until the drawings of the building as a whole were
completed, when he was succeeded by Edward P. Casey, architect,
whose work comprised chiefly the design and supervision of all the
more artistic as well as many of the important fundamental features
of the interior. The writer designed the construction throughout, the
book stacks and much of the apparatus, and supervised everything.

Born February 13, 1851. Died September 6, 1896.

It had been the intention of the Institution to

place here a biography of its late Assistant Secre-

tary, Dr. George Brown Goode, but on account of

his special charge of the Museum it has been

thought better to transfer this to the Museum vol-

tume, where an account of his scientific labors can

be found at length. ‘The Secretary, however, does

not wish to leave without remark the page which

contains this reference to one whose life was inti-

mately associated not only with the Museum, but

with the parent Institution, of which he was, as it

were, a son, and where he was so greatly loved

and trusted by all.

FRANCIS AMASA WALKER.

By GEORGE F. HoAR and CARROLL D. WRIGHT.

I.— EXTRACTS FROM ORATION BY SENATOR GEORGE F. HOAR.!

We have come to pay a public debt, so far as we can pay such debts,
to a public benefactor. Massachusetts has no orders of knighthood,
ne robes, or star, or jeweled ribbon of Bath or Garter, no coronet or
crown for those who have served her. She gives them no title of rank
or nobility. She endows them with no lands or castles to leave to
those who bear theirname. Their children must begin again, for them-
selves, by the side of the humblest and poorest, with no advantage but
the stimulant of the father’s example, and the feeling, if they be of
noble mind, that the State holds a pledge of them. We have no
mausoleum, or cathedral. or abbey, like that—

‘“‘Where Death and Glory a joint Sabbath keep,”

to which Nelson looked forward on the morning of his death and his
immortality. We do not consign the dust of the men we delight to
honor to sleep the last sleep among rows of warriors and walks of
kings. A simple Well done! coming from the heart of the people,
takes, for us, the place of crown, and coronet, and rank, and title, and
broad lands, and dome, and arch. Yet we should not be here to honor
General Walker unless we knew that he would have preferred what
we have to bring—the esteem and love of Massachusetts, with the
conscience that he deserved them, to all other honor, or wealth, or
glory. i

Jdo not purpose, in what I have to say to-night, to speak of Francis
Walker as a man of great and remarkable original genius, as that
word is commonly used. Whether he possessed or lacked that unde-
finable quality, it is not that which brings us here. It is because he
was an admirable example, perhaps the best example Massachusetts
has to offer in late years, of a complete and rounded citizenship. The
excellence and variety of his work grow upon you as you study it.
He was a more useful man and a safer guide than any man, with

rare exception, that we have had of great and remarkable original
genius. He was wise, industrious, conscientious, patriotic, faithful,
and brave. He had an independent intellect rendered prudent by a
great modesty. He administered with remarkable success the Indian
Bureau, the Census Bureau twice under vastly different conditions,
and a great college. He began his service in the Union Army as a
noncommissioned officer. He left it a general officer. He was severely
wounded. He was six weeks in Libby prison, where he met his
brother. He was twice promoted for gallantry in the field. He was a
favorite aide of three famous generals. He was frequently praised for
soldierly quality in the reports of his superiors and in general orders.
He was a model adjutant-general. He saved the day in an important
battle. He was our foremost writer and thinker on political economy
in a generation constantly called upon to reconsider and to apply
economic laws. He contributed, to science our best example of the
scientific temper. He was a profound thinker. He was a successful
teacher. He was a lover, inspirer, and leader of youth. He concealed
great power by quietness in his work. He did, for nearly forty years,
bravely and faithfully, what his generation much needed to have done.
He was a constant spectator and critic of what other men were doing
in other departments of human activity. Yet he never lost his kind-
ness of heart or his brave hopefulness. He loved his country, his
Commonwealth, the town where he was born, and the city where he
lived. He was perfect in the relation of son, brother, husband, and
father. He was unselfish. He was a constant, loving, and faithful
friend. He had no ignoble ambitions. His objects in life were public,
not personal. The ends he aimed at were—

“Nis country’s,
His God’s, and truth’s.”

Every step in his life was upon a stair of honor. His sound brain
and athletic frame could bear great labor without fatigue. He had a
thoroughly healthy and robust intellect, capable of being directed
upon any of the pursuits of life, or any of the affairs of State in any
department of the public service. He exhibited a varied and sound
mental capacity which made it sure that he could have attained dis-
tinction as a metaphysician, or a mathematician, as a linguist, as an
advocate, as a lawyer, as a legislator, as a judge, as he did in fact
attain it as a soldier, as a teacher, as an administrator, as a statis-
tician, aS a writer and reasoner upon abstruse doctrines of political
economy. As Mark Hopkins said of his pupil, President Garfield,
‘“‘there was a large general capacity applicable to any subject, and
sound sense. What he did was done with facility, but by honest and
avowed work. There was no alternation of spasmodic effort and of
rest, but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions of what was
undertaken.” * * *

He was born in Boston July 2, 1840. He descended in the eighth
FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 637

generation from Capt. Richard Walker, of Lynn, a man active in the
church and in the town, a member of the Honourable Artillery Com-
pany of London, and one of the first members of the Ancient and Hon-
orable Artillery Company of Boston. The Walkers in every generation
were good farmers and soldiers and important men in the town. His
great grandfather, Phineas Walker, who moved to Worcester County,
and built a house on land where his descendants now dwell, served in
the old French war under Wolfe; was a captain in the Revolution, and
was at the taking of Ticonderoga with Ethan Allen. His grandfather,
Deacon Walter Walker, a blacksmith and farmer, moved to North
Brookfield in 1800. There his children were born. He was the prin-
cipal citizen of the town. His wife, Priscilla Carpenter, originally
spelled Charpentier, was of French Huguenot descent. General Walker
was of Huguenot descent on his mother’s side likewise. This is a strain
of which we have many delightful examples. The character and quality
of our New England women do not often get into the town records.
But it is noticeable that so far as we have accounts, certainly for three
generations, the women from whom he descended were remarkable for
intellectual vigor and great public spirit. General Walker told the
story at the Commercial Club of his going home unexpectedly on leave
of absence at the darkest time of the war, in the fall of 1862, when
almost every household in Massachusetts was in mourning, and officers
were resigning, and desertions frequent. He came into the house unseen
early in the morning, and found his mother with an open Bible in her
lap—not reading, but with her gaze fixed toward the south, thinking of
her absent sons.

‘‘Instead of the glad welcome I had expected came the quick, sharp
question, ‘You haven’t left the Army, have you?’” His mother was
one of a family of four sisters, all women of commanding presence and
character, having, as Mr. Spencer, the North Brookfield pastor, says,
‘an intense regard for righteousness.” * * *

He began to study Latin when he was 7 years old. He fitted for col-
lege at Leicester Academy and at Lancaster. He was graduated from
Amherst at 20, where he got two prizes for extempore speaking. He
studied law in Worcester.

He enlisted as a private in the Fifteenth Massachusetts Volunteers,
a regiment never excelled on the face of the earth for soldierly quality.
Soon after his enlistment he was made sergeant-major. Very soon he
was commissioned as captain and assistant adjutant-general. He was
promoted to be major, then to be lieutenant-colonel, then brevetted
general. He served on Couch’s staff and Warren’s, and was chief upon
Hancock’s. ‘woof his promotions were for gallant conduct on the field.
His name receives honorable mention in the reports of many battles,
including Williamsburg, Fair Oaks, Malvern Hill, Fredericksburg,
Chancellorsville, Bristow Station, Wilderness, Spottsylvania, Peters-
burg, and Reams Station. He was severely wounded at Chancellors-
ville. General Couch reported that at Fair Oaks he “‘made a daring

personal reconnoissance, and had his horse shot under him.” He was
a model adjutant-general; and to be a model adjutant-general demands
high intellectual and literary capacity. General Warren says of him
in his report of the campaign: “He is fully acquainted with his office
duties, so important to the operation of an army corps. He is willing
and gallant on the field.”

He was by Hancock’s side at Reams Station and received honorable
mention in Hancock’s report. He rode into the enemy’s lines in the
darkness and was captured. He made a gallant dash for liberty and
swam the Appomattox River, but was taken again by the enemy as,
exhausted by the last stroke for which his strength held out, he gained
the shore. Hewas six weeks in Libby prison. He was made brigadier-
general for gallant conduct at Chancellorsville, by Hancock’s express
ReQuUeSts fs as

Walker did not come back from the war spoiled for the duties of civil
life. I would not speak unkindly of those to whom that happened.
Commonly they could not help it. The cause of it, in many cases, was
physica] and not moral. A malarial fever or a wound often takes out
of a man the courage and steadfastness needed for common business
who never would flinch before the enemy or the hardship of a campaign
life. The anxiety, the hope and fear, the constant peril, the din of bat-
tle, the thunder of the cannon, and the shouting—lI do not see how the
sound of shot and shell could ever afterwards get out of their ears—how
could they not spoil the boy for the quiet duties of the farm and the
shop? It was the sacrifice he made for his country, a sacrifice even
more costly than life itself. But to Walker, as to many another good
soldier—as to Grant, as to Devens, as to Garfield, as to McKinley—
the military training was the very source and inspiration of Civic
CRESS

Walker was 24 years old when he came home from the Army, broken
down by imprisonment and hardship. It took several years to get back
his health. But he set himself to work at once. His purpose was to
go to work wherever he could find work to do. His path in life seems
to have been determined by opportunity and not by inclination. He
was employed as a teacher of Latin and Greek in Williston Seminary
for more than three years. From March 15, 1868, to January 15, 1869,
he was an assistant editor of the Springfield Republican, and wrote, he
says, about two-thirds of the editorial matter. He went from Spring-
field to Washington. From that day to his death he led two busy and
crowded lives. One was the life of a practical administrator of large
affairs; the other the life of a theorist, an industrious student and
thinker in the closet. He administered in succession a variety of
important executive offices. He was the author of a great number of
books, addresses, and papers on interesting and living questions. * * *

Perhaps this enumeration may seem tedious; yet itis by no means
complete. It is peculiar to this man that the bare, naked catalogue of
his useful deeds is too long to leave room for comment if the sketch of
his life is to be within moderate bounds. ‘The offices he filled have no
glamouraboutthem. When filled by a great man they are great offices;
when filled by an insignificant man they are insignificant. He gave
dignity to every place he held.

The ease with which he passed from one field of service to another,
which we seldom find among eminent men of other countries, and
which, indeed, the structure of their society renders impossible, was
characteristic of him, even as compared with his own countrymen.
His intellect never seemed jaded or strained. He worked rapidly, but
he rarely gave the impression of being hurried in his intellectual work
and never of being tired. He had light without heat, although quite
capable of lofty enthusiasm and deep affection, as witness his eulogies
on Hancock and Devens.

He did his work with a quietness which concealed its power. He

and spitting along, with the clang of machinery and the smell of oil.
He was an electric current. It was conveyed by a slender and almost
invisible wire, exerting its force without heat or noise or odor, but it
never failed to do its work and to carry its load.

Every one of these offices he administered with signal success. You
can not find an instance of any duty undertaken by him which was not
faithfully and thoroughly discharged. You can not find an instance of
bad or superficial intellectual work. He received more honorary
degrees in this country and abroad than any other American left alive
when he died. * * *

General Walker brought the result of this varied experienve and
the fame of these achievements to the service of the Institute of Tech-
nology in the autumn of 1881. It was a time of great discouragement
here. There had been barely 200 graduates up to 1878. The number
of students had fallen within six years from 348 to 188—almost oune-
half. Professor Tyler says of the friénds of fifteen years earlier:
‘Some were disheartened and some were dead.” The very existence
of the institute seemed for a time in peril. It had been seriously pro-
posed to merge its identity with one of the departments of Harvard
University. I should do injustice alike to an admirable and devoted
faculty and to the liberality of this community if I were to attribute
the change which these sixteen years have shown to any one man;
but surely he was born under a fortunate and auspicious star, of whom
it can be said that he touched nothing that did not spring into new
life and rejoice in new health when he touched it. Nil tetigit quod
non inspiravit.

He was selected by President Rogers as the fittest person to be
found in the country to carry out his comprehensive plans. Leland
Stanford, as Mr. Stanford himself told me, tried afterwards with all his
might to get him to do the same thing for his university. I do not lay
great stress on the fact that in his time the roll of students increased
from 302 to 1,198, or that you had, when he began, 39 teachers, and
when he died, 153. That is the story of many of the schools and col-
leges of the country, certainly of the North, during the same period.
General Walker’s lot was cast at the time of the marvelous growth of
the country in wealth and power. He was here for fifteen years out of
thirty, in which the country gained thirty-eight million in population,
and in which its valuation grew from seventeen thousand million to
thirty thousand million, and in which it became the foremost manufac-
turing nation in the world, and the richest nation in the world.

The endowment of institutions of learning has been going on all over
the North and West. Contributions to the cause of higher education
in this country, which have been published in the newspapers, and
were large enough to attract the notice of the Statisticians of the
Bureau of Education, have amounted, in the last twenty-five Years; to
nearly two hundred million dollars.
FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 641

His work was done in Massachusetts and in Boston, and that means
that he had behind him as generous and liberal a community as ever
existed on the face of the earth—a community specially alive to the
value of institutions like this. It would be a dishonor to the great
old presidents, the Josiah Quincys, the James Walkers, the Mark
Hopkinses, the Woolseys, the Jeremiah Days, and the Timothy
Dwights, who administered our colleges in the days of their poverty,
to measure their success either by money or by the number of their
students. General Walker’s title to gratitude is that in his time this
institution grew toward the zenith as well as toward the horizon; it is
that while the number of students grew, the efficiency and fitness for
their life’s work, to which their diplomas certified, grew in like propor-
_tion; it is that the personal character of the president exerted an
ennobling and enlarging influence on the character and intellect of the
pupil. Never, if we may trust the testimony of those who know best,
was it surpassed in this country, unless possibly in the single instance
of Mark Hopkins. He understood every need of the institution. The
school felt his touch in every nerve. He brought his great adminis-
trative abilities to bear in every department and upon the smallest
detail, as will be seen if you read his reports. He was a lover of
young men. He sympathized with them in their studies, in their
athletic sports; he had a kindly tolerance for their foibles and faults.
The pupils and the younger teachers of the Institute of Technology
loved the president, and the president loved them. * * *

He had inherited a spirit of independent thinking and an aptness
for economic study. His father, a successful merchant, without college
training, had been attracted to such studies by the desire to understand
the laws on which the success of his own business depended. He became
_ deeply interested in the currency, wages, and freedom of commercial
intercourse. He was a thinker and investigator of great independence;
early an antislavery man, and an influential advocate of cheap postage
and sound banking. He was everywhere respected and had much
influence in his day. During the war he saved Secretary Chase from a
grave error, the evil of which we could not easily have gotten rid of.
Mr. Chase had purposed to issue an adulterated silver coinage, to make
the value far above the true value, and had prepared a bill and sent a
letter to the Senate and the committee of the House of Representatives
recommending it. This he showed to Amasa Walker, who was then
in Washington, and gave up the plan in consequence of his sharp
expostulation.

In dealing with this part of General Walker’s life | am afraid some
of my audience will think it is as if I were to deliver an address on
Shakespeare and were to begin by saying that I would not undertake
to estimate Shakespeare’s rank as a dramatic poet. But the time has
not come for a final opinion as to General Walker’s rank in the depart-
ment of political economy. I should be presumptuous if I were to

undertake to measure the permanent value of his contributions to this
science, if that mean that we are to affirm in confidence what among
his conclusions are to stand the test of time and to be accepted here-
after as settled truth. One thing we may say, Walker thoroughly
understood the limitations of his science and of his own intellect. He
brought to these discussions, where usually there is so much heat and
arrogance and anger, a sweet and gentle personal quality; but it will
be a great mistake if we let this quietness of tone and modesty of
spirit mislead us into thinking that he lacked either earnestness of con-

viction or depth of investigation, or that he was not able to defend —

himself with vigor and spirit against any antagonist. Other men have
prepared themselves for affairs by studying political economy. He
prepared himself for studying political economy by a large and intimate
knowledge of affairs at first hand. The fact that he maintained always
so large a relation to practical life was, in my judgment, his great
advantage as a public leader over other men who have been eminent
economists. How many other writers on political economy would have
been fit to administer a technical school? How few others are ever
trusted by their fellow-citizens either with public responsibilities or
with the management of important private affairs? * * *

The great celebration of the three hundredth year of the University
at Dublin, in 1892, where the universities of Hurope, of America, of
Africa, of Australia, of India, and of New Zealand were represented,
was a scene of the kind never approached in Europe for dignity and
splendor, unless we except the tercentenary of Leyden or of Edinburg,
the five hundredth anniversary of Heidelberg, or the eight hundredth
anniversary of the University of Bologna. Seventy-one honorary degrees
were conferred upon men famous in church and state, in science and
literature. The degree of Doctor of Laws, the highest degree of all,
was conferred upon five persons only—two Englishmen, one German,
one Frenchman, and one American. The American was President
Walker. Edinburg conferred upon him a like honor in 1896, * * *

He was a great inspirer of economic thought. There was no rash-
ness about him. He discussed the economic problems for which his
generation was ready. He boldly took by the throat the delusions
which had gained a strong hold upon the thought of men who went
before him. His training as a Statistician had taught him always to
keep close to his facts. To use his own words in giving advice to a
scholar, he kept himself superior to partisan dictation, and to the
seductions of theory.

He rejected the doctrine of laissez faire. He held the state to be a
moral being. It was meet that its great forces should do what the
individual can not do for himself. It was not only that the state should
be great in wealth and empire, but that it should produce a noble
growth of men. Every economic law was lacking in comprehension
that left this out.

To him political economy was an applied science. It was a science
FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 643

to be applied forthwith for the benefit of his own generation, and his
own country. There was no alteri seculo about him. He was not con-
tent to keep a mighty magnet in his museum, holding its weight till a
later generation should accidentally discover and make useful the
resources of its power. Still less could he tolerate for an instant that
arrogant and disdainful spirit with which some men who undertake,
with little title, to represent science in this country, sneer at any
attempt to make use of the forces she reveals to us for the service of
mankind. Someone said, the other day, that science was becoming a
hod carrier. I do not see why the term “hod carrier” should express
the rejation rather than the term ‘‘ benefactress.” I do not see, either,
that there is anything degrading in the thought that the knowledge
of the learned man enables him to lift the burden beneath which
humanity is bowed and bent. Ido not know that science is exempt
from the divine law, ‘He that is greatest among you, let him be the
servant of all.” If the great forces of the universe perform all useful
offices for man, if the sunshine warm and light oar dwellings, if gravi-
tation move the world and keep it true to its hour, nay, if it keep the
temple or cathedral in its place when the hod carrier has builded it, I
do not see why it should not lend its beneficent aid to him also. Our
illustrious philosopher advised his countryman to “hitch his wagon to
a star.” The star will move no less serenely on its sublime pathway
when the wagon is hitched to it. I do not know that any archangel or
goddess, however resplendent the wings, has yet been constructed or
imagined without feet. I do not know that any archangel, however
glorious, has ever been created or imagined without sympathy with
suffering humanity.

I think perhaps this exalted, let me rather say this divine, sympathy
for common humanity is the peculiar characteristic of the men who
have been devoted to scientific pursuit in this country. Each of the
great republics of the world has stood for a great ideal—the Greek for
beauty, the Roman for law, the Hebrew for religious faith. So the
American stands, I will not say for utility, for that word has bad asso-
ciations, but rather for ennobling humanity and raising from the dust
its humblest and coarsest members. I will not undertake to dispute
whether this be of itself and alone the highest ideal to which states
have been consecrated. I certainly do not think, highly as I esteem
him, that Benjamin Franklin was the loftiest example either of phi-
losophy or statesmanship. But the realization of our ideal is the condi-
tion of all the others. There can be neither beauty, law, love, nor
spiritual life for a people in abject poverty or condemned to struggle
for existence under a perpetual and unremitting drudgery. It is the
praise and the glory of the great leaders of American science—it is the
glory of Francis Walker—that the truths they have discovered and
the laws they have expounded have been the benignant harbingers of
light, knowledge, and happiness to the mass of mankind. A soul living
in abject poverty is but the soul of a brute, though in human form.
G44 FRANCIS AMASA WALKER.

Where in this gallery the works of our friend will be hung, on what
shelf his books will be found, we will not to-night undertake to prophesy.
But he will be among the masters. He will have a chapter or a page
in the most compact history of science. His pithy sentences will be
quoted. Better than that; his example of human interest in the wel-
fare of man, and of a deferential regard for his opponents, will be fol-
lowed. He will be remembered as having helped to teach the haughty,
arrogant philosopher, the presumptuous and self-confident debater, a
more excellent way. * * *

Lord Erskine says that though the word Gpentlenan ” can not be
defined, it is the quality to which England owes everything that she is.
Perhaps our conception of it and that of the Englishman may not be
in all respects the same. But certainly Frank Walker possessed that
attractive something, consisting partly of grace of behavior, and chiefly
of quality of heart, which makes the character of the gentleman. In
those countries where rank and birth count for much, rank and birth
are essential to the gentleman. We count them for nothing. But I do
not know that the republican gentleman can better be defined than by
taking the description which, when the age of chivalry was not yet
gone, Chaucer gave of his young knight, the flower of English chivalry:

“‘Curteis he was, lowly and servisable.”

Courtesy, modesty, and service! We can find its examples in New
England farmhouses as well as in baronial halls.

Our English brethren, when they speak of a great-hearted, honest,
and brave man, who does nothing mean, and will not give in, like to
say he is thoronghly English. With all the faults of the English
character, they have an honest right to say it. But we have a right
to say of this man that there was not a trait in his intellectual or moral
character, there was not an action of his life, there was not an emotion
of his soul, that was not intensely American. He loved his country.
Under great and varied responsibilities he did what an American citi-
zen ought to do, and was what an American citizen ought to be. You
can hardly think of a place in the Republic where there was a man’s -
work to do in which, if you had put Frank eeleen he would not have
done it well.

He edited a paper in his youth, and he Teen at one time of making
that his profession. As I have said, he was all his life a constant
spectator and critic. But as I said just now, he never lost his temper
of a brave hopefulness. He never lost his love of country. While he
had many friendships abroad, and had a reputation there which he
highly valued, he was an American from the crown of his head to the
sole of his feet. To him the word ‘‘countryman” was a title of endear-
ment. He would accept no honor or respect for himself which implied
any dishonor or want of respect for his country. Perhaps the crowning
literary distinction of his life was the degree conferred on him at Dublin
at the tercentenary celebration of that famous university. He devoted
FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 645

his speech of acknowledgment to eulogy of the Irish Catholic soldiers
who had been his comrades in the war for the Union. Indeed, he was
always a good stander-by. No comrade or friend need ever fear that
his good name would suffer from any hostile critic in Francis Walker’s
presence.

He had none of the spirit which can find nothing but evil and degen-
eracy and deca in our national life—a spirit which does more than any
other to create what it thinks it finds and to bring to pass its own
prophecies. As nothing can be more injurious to a child than to teach
him that he is base and worthy to be despised, nothing can be more
injurious to a nation than to teach it such alesson. The boastful, brag-
gart, self-asserting temper which is sometimes found in a nation whose
place in the world, whose title to the respect of mankind, is not yet
assured, bad as it is, is infinitely less harmful than the spirit of an indis-
criminate detraction. The taking for granted that honesty and courage
and nobility are the motives of public conduct tends to elevate public
conduct to a higher standard. We may be willing, in admiration for
his mighty genius, to submit to Carlyle’s note of despair and contempt.
Yet I believe Emerson has inspired a hundred heroes where Carlyle
has inspired one. The satirist’s scourge, the critic’s sneer, or the pes-
simist’s whine or moan never exalted a nation and never saved a soul.
It is not that these men are possessed by an enthusiasm for a lofty
ideal. Ifit were we might bear with them. They have neither enthusi-
asms norideals. Whatever other qualities these wailers may have, they
have neither faith, hope, nor charity.

It is remarkable that a man among whose great titles to distinction
were those of author and soldier should be so indifferent to fame and
praise.

“‘Lyke asa ship that through the ocean wyde
By conduct of some star doth make her way,”

he was constant to one bright and blazing star—the star of duty—

“Of whose true fixed and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.”

Il.— EXTRACTS FROM ADDRESS BY HON. CARROLL D. WRIGHT.!

When a man passes through the supreme agony of his existence,
leaving only the clay embodiment of his soul, the mind, after the first
shock of personal loss, turns from the contemplation of the individual
embodiment to the life, character, and achievements of the real man.

1 Extracts from an address delivered at the regular quarterly meeting of the Ameri-
can Statistical Association, held in Huntington Hall, Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, Friday evening, April 16, 1897,8 p.m. Hon. Horace G. Wadlin, vice-president
of the association, presided. Many friends and acquaintances of General Walker
were present by invitation. Printed in Quarterly Publications of the American Stia-

646 FRANCIS AMASA WALKER.

The tear of affection has been shed, and we approach the life of our
friend with bowed head, ever the attitude of reverence and respect.
We can not, as personal friends, forget the magnificent presence of Gen-
eral Walker, nor do we wish ever to have the memory of his kindness,
his cordial support, his active cooperation in everything that: makes for
the upbuilding of humanity, as viewed from the personal standpoint,
effaced. No eulogy, no tribute, however glowing, can do justice or fully
express the influence of personal relations. Such tributes must come
from the heart, which can not express itself fully and satisfactorily
through the medium of speech. Speech can recount the lives of men,
their deeds, their professions, their worth to the public, and thus in a
measure build a tomb to their greatness. The epitaph to goodness must
always appear less than the truth. * * *

To my mind the life we commemorate to-night was a great orchestra,
all its parts and instruments attuned to harmonious results. The ver-
satility of General Walker’s character, the great variety of his success-
ful duties, make this simile emphatically expressive. We who have
watched him through the last quarter of a century of his life know well
the full meaning of this. There were no discords under his magic leader-
Ship; the orchestra ever rendered, obedient to his direction, the great
symphony of his life. Here, with the allegro of the soldier, in that
brisk, sprightly movement carried to the presto, he comes in his pro-
fessorial experience to the adagio, where, with grace and beauty and
diligent execution, he brings out the finest traits of his character, the
closing movement of his life being an andante, with an even, graceful,
onward progression; but through it all we discern the theme, the
motif of his life. There was music in General Walker’s life, as we
contemplate all these movements in it, and this music makes it to us,
who knew him, to all who will know him better as time goes on, a
grand symphony indeed. But, in exact terms, who was this man, and
what did he do? Why do we come here to-night to pronounce our
eulogy.) Satta

An address could be devoted to each branch of his work and yet fall
far short of a comprehensive analysis. His public addresses alone
would constitute a valuable collection of material for the use of stu-
dents, for he took as much paius in preparing them as in producing
his more voluminous works. So the temptation to take up some par-
ticular line which appeals, perhaps, more strongly than any other to
individual taste must be resisted and in this presence chief attention
devoted to his work as an economist and as a Statistician, regretfully
leaving all the rest for other men and for other occasions.

It is difficult to separate in the case of General Walker the econo-
mist from the statistician. He was each in turn, and both always; _yet
chronologically he was an economist before he was a statistician. On
the other hand, the foundation of his great reputation abroad was
rather as a statistician than as an economist, while in this country
I think he was better known as an economist. It was natural that
“FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 647

he should at a very early age turn his attention to economic con-
siderations. In view of his familiarity with his father’s life, and -
impressed by his strong, original, and far-seeing mind, it would have
been strange if the keen, receptive qualities of the younger man were
not affected. The elder Walker, as already intimated, was an honored
and trusted authority in the perplexing problems of political and
social science. * * *

There are two classes of political economists—those belonging to
what is popularly known as the orthodox school and those adhering
to the so-called new school of political economy. General Walker did
not belong exclusively to either. He upheld the theorist’s views, and
yet he understood the pressing influences of environment, of the con-
stitution of human nature, in affecting human economic conditions; he
did not hesitate to attack well-grounded assumptions and theories or
to uphold those which had not the weight of the culture of the past to
support them; he was orthodox enough to insist that ethics could not
displace economics; he was just and fair enough to recognize that
economics could not displace ethies, and his well-balanced mind taught
him that, economic conditions once established, the relationship of men
under them became ethical. This fair-mindedness, of course, subjected
him to attacks from both schools. When his invaluable work on wages
(one of the most positive contributions to economic and social science
that has been published in the last half century) appeared, in which he
made his brave and democratic attack upon the settled wage-fund
theory of the great economists of Europe, he called down upon him-
self attacks which might have staggered a less courageous fighter, but
with his human and humane instincts Walker kept on his course. He
placed manhood at the center of his economic system. He recognized
not only the power but the good of the organization of labor, and
insisted that wages were to be determined, not by any arbitrary rule
under which wage earners have no voice and no concern, and are mere
physical elements of production, but by conditions of production, and
that the receivers of them had some rights; for, as he expressed it, no
class is fit to be the trustee of the interests of any other class. He did not
occupy the position in America that must be given to Nmile de Laveleye,
of Belgium, although there is much in common in their writings; he
can be classed more truthfully, probably, with Leslie and Marshall, of
England. He recognized that political economy must deal with vital
things; that it has something more to do with the world’s affairs than
to teach the accumulation of wealth. * * *

His chief studies as an economist have related to wages, theory of
distribution, money, and social economics. Adopting the historical
method, President Walker very naturally turned to statistics for his
arguments and illustrations, and, while many economists may differ with
him in many of his positions, the general student feels that he came
nearer the truth than many of his contemporaries. He did not waste
his efforts in quarreling over definitions; his economic work was some-
648 FRANCIS AMASA WALKER.

thing grander and broader. He undertook to announce principles and
to draw deductions which, whether new or old, could be clearly backed
by fact and reason. He was not worried about definitions. * * *

In his discussions on wages and distribution, while merciless in
destroying the popular views of simple cooperation, thus showing his
power as a theorist who understood conditions as well, he did not hesi-
tate to advocate, not as a solution, not as a full remedy for labor diffi-
culties, but as an alleviation of them, the principles of profit sharing
and industrial partnership, and to this end he was, from its inception,
one of the vice-presidents of the American Society for the Promotion
of Profit Sharing.

This and various other positions did not give him the highest reputa-
tion as a theoretic economist, although in other lands he stood higher
in this respect than in his own country. His strong grasp of whatever
subject he was discussing, and the striking and interesting way in
which he presented it, added force to his views. At the same time his
interest in all good works, his attitude in educational matters, and his
warm-hearted personality brought him strength with the masses, while
he held his own as a theorist. He had that rare faculty of treating
matters, both scientifically and popularly, in such a way that neither
the scientists with whom he was associated nor the common people who
admired him could claim him for their own. Impregnated, it may be,
with the hard-headed doctrines of Sumner, which admit of no collateral
distinctions in economic science, he could still see, feel, and comprehend
the ever-existing struggle of humanity toward a higher standard.
Yet no man was more rigid and unyielding in his teaching. He never
allowed himself, optimist that he was, to proclaim any sentimental
doctrines, for he knew well that. their adoption would simply result in
increasing the difficulties which he was so anxious to avoid, in intensi-
fying the struggle which he was so desirous of softening. This scien-
tifie attitude enabled him to attack some of the modern isms, and even
to destroy some latter-day views of life. * * *

His knowledge of history and his familiarity with statistical science,
or the scientific method of statistics, were his powerful allies as an
economist. _ With this equipment he vitalized political economy, and
thus stood, with all fair and due consideration of the splendid abilities
of other economists, at the head. No one was jealous of him, even
though attacking him. * * *

It was very natural, when the professors of political economy and
others organized the American HKconomic Association, that General
Walker should be chosen as its leader. It was an honor due him and a
choice which honored the association as well. Modest in his acceptance
of the trust, he always urged that other men should take the lead, and
yet he was continued as its president from 1885 to 1892. His counsel
in guiding the course of the association in its formative period, his
addresses at the opening of each recurring session, and his reputation

—
FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 649

at home and abroad did more to give the association its great impetus
and to establish its right to exist than any other single influence.

His works, his doctrines, his public positions growing out of them,
contribute to make him the foremost figure among the political economists
of America.

AS a Statistican the life work of our friend comes nearer to us in this
association than any other feature perhaps. For nearly a generation
General Walker’s name has been associated with the statistics of the
United States Government. His first experience was as Deputy Com-
missioner of Internal Revenue and Chief of the Bureau of Statistics
of the Treasury Department. His experience here, however, was so
brief that he did not have the opportunity of stamping his individu-
ality upon the work of the office. In 1870 he was appointed Superin-
tendent of the Ninth Census, and he entered upon the work of that
office with all the enthusiasm of his nature and the consecration of his
science as a political economist. Like every other statistician in this
country who has been called to take charge of statistical enterprises,
General Walker came to his work untrained, yet with a vast advantage
over every other man in the country who has undertaken like work.
He was a political economist by inheritance, by endowment, and by
painstaking equipment, and so an economist adopting the historical
method, he had been a student of the statistics of other countries and
of this, as far as they existed.

As a census taker he was obliged, in almost every expansive respect,
to blaze the way. The censuses of the past had been of a fragmentary
nature, those of 1850 and 1860 being creditable departures from the old-
time lederal enumeration. It was General Walker’s ambition to have
the census of 1870 taken on a broader basis than that of any preceding
it. The country was approaching its interesting centennial period. In
1876 there was to be a great exposition of the resources, the wealth, and
the character of our people. The General foresaw all this, and his desire
was to make the census of 1870 encyclopedic in its nature, comprehend-
ing all the great features of social and economic conditions. He wanted
to show not only the character, the composition, the movement, and
the growth of the people, but the character and composition of its indus-
tries, its transportation systems, its accumulation of wealth, its socio-
logical elements—everything, in fact, that goes to make up a great and
growing nation. In this he had Gen. James A. Garfield, then in the
House, as an able coadjutor. General Garfield was chairman of the
House Committee on the Ninth Census, and he made a deep study of
the census methods of the world. With the aid of General Walker and
the advice of Dr. Edward Jarvis, at that time president of this associa-
tion, he projected a system of census taking on a broad and compre-
hensive basis. The bill * * * was defeated, the result being that
General Walker was obliged to take the census of 1870 in accordance
with the law of 1850. Nevertheless, he made it, through the support -
650 FRANCIS AMASA WALKER.

he gained from legislators and the Administration, by far the most
scientific census which this country had yet seen, and it gave him at
once a leading position among the statisticians of the world. He was
hampered all through it by the clumsy methods of the past. His experi-
ence, however, gave him not only the courage but the power to insist
in the Tenth Census, that of 1880, upon the,adoption of more scientific
methods. Coming into that census with splendid equipment, General
Walker had no great difficulty in inducing Congress to broaden its scope.
He adopted new methods of enumeration; he got rid of the old, bun-
gling methods of collecting facts through the United States marshals,
and secured the power to appoint an army of enumerators, properly
supervised in districts comprehending a certain number of enumeration
districts. The census of 1870 was confined to the few topics authorized
by the law of 1850, as already stated—population, vital statistics,
wealth, and industry—the publications of that census being comprised
in four volumes, including a compendium, in one volume. The resuits
of the Tenth Census, however, comprised twenty-two volumes and a
compendium (in two parts). General Walker’s ambition of 1870 to
make a centennial contribution of facts found ample field in 1880. The
enthusiasm of the period, perhaps, aided him greatly, but by this vast
work he was enabled to show to the country the leading facts relative to
its population, its manufactures, and its agriculture, and, in addition, its
agencies of transportation; its valuation, taxation, and public indebted-
ness; Statistics of its immense systems of transportation, its newspapers,
and its shipbuilding. He also presented elaborate reports upon the
forest trees of North America, the petroleum and building-stone indus-
tries of the country, the technology of the precious metals, the mining
laws and industries of the country; also a technical report upon the
the water power of the United States, a magnificent volume upon
wages, with reports upon the prices of necessaries of life, trade socie-
ties, strikes and lockouts, and other features.

When it is considered that the census of 1880 was undertaken on
such an expansive plan as that outlined, and had to be carried out by
a temporary and an untrained force, under the necessity of fighting off
those thirsty for position, the magnitude of the work involved seems
simply appalling. But General Walker was a great organizer. His
experience in bringing together bodies of troops, in superintending the
movement of all the impedimenta of a great army, in collecting mate-
rials for attack and defense, in handling forces in the field in active
conflict, his training aS a scientific economist—all these experiences
constituted him par excellence the one to carry out the plans of the
Tenth Census. He did not carry the work through to completion, in
one sense. Called to the presidency of the institute here in Boston,
he left the census in the middle of 1881, so far as his official connection
with it was concerned, but until the last volume appeared, in 1888,
- General Walker exercised a supervisory relation to it all. All the text
passed through his hands. :
FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 651

While this vast work is not, of course, of uniform merit, on the whole
it must be considered as the greatest, most elaborate, and most valuable
contribution to the body of statistics furnished by any country up te
its date. It has been criticised, attacked, and abused; it has been
lauded and indorsed, but so far as I know it has never yet had a severer
critic than General Walker himself.

In the various analyses accompanying the innumerable tables he
always took pains to point out the weak spots. He put his downright
integrity into this work, as into every other to which he put his hand.
He has been blamed for launching the Government upon an exhaustive
census, but it must be understood that it was never General Walker’s
idea that a census so comprehensive should be repeated. It was the
centennial period, as 1 have said, and he wanted to exhibit this country
in all its vast, comely proportions through the statistical method. In
this he succeeded. When it was done he was in hopes that the Gov-
ernment would establish a scientific census, profiting by the experience
of the past, and giving to the world the results of work conducted by
a trained and well-qualified force. * * *

With the cessation of his duties as Sumormnrendent of the Tenth
Census, and his voluntary duties as general supervisor after his resig-
nation, General Walker’s active statistical experience came to a close,
but his interest in official statistics never flagged. He was an honorary
member of the Royal Statistical Society of England. He was in Eng-
land and France at the time of the celebration of the jubilee year of
the society. The proposition was advanced that out of that jubilee
celebration of the Royal Statistical Society there be established an
international statistical institute. There had been many attempts to
create an international statistical body, taking the form of statistical
congresses held from some time in the fifties, for twenty or thirty years.
The results of these congresses were of no great importance. It was
therefore the view of the principal statisticians of the world that some
regular organization could be of great service in harmonizing interna-
tional statistics for comparative purposes. (General Walker gave his
warm adherence to the project. The International Statistical Institute
was organized, and he was made one of its vice-presidents. In 1893,
when the institute met in Chicago, he was created honorary member
and président-adjoint, presiding at the deliberations of the institute dur-
ing that session. In 1882 he was elected president of this American
Statistical Association, and he served it devotedly until his death. I
have been informed that he was present at every meeting of the asso-
ciation. His last service in the interest of statistical science and of
statistical progress was rendered in Washington on Thursday, Decem-
ber 31 last, only a few days before his death, which occurred on the
5th of January. It was on the occasion of the opening meeting of a
series to be held by the Washington members of the association.
President Walker was delighted at the prospect, and, at great incon-
venience to himself, was present and made an address. This address is
652 FRANCIS AMASA WALKER.

typical of the man. It should be read by every legislator, State or.
Federal, in the country. He brought out most clearly and graphically
how vast sums of money have been spent by the Federal Government
in training men for the Army and the Navy, through the maintenance
of the Military and Naval academies, but that not even the interest of
$10,000 had ever been expended by the Government in training men
for its great census service—a service which has cost tens of millions
of dollars, and yet is entered upon every ten years with an untrained,
unscientific, and unequipped corps of clerks and officers. This he
deprecated most severely, and pointed out the advantages that would
accrue 1f the Government would establish a permanent census office,
and devote itself to the assiduous collection, analysis, and publication
of statistical information; that the expenditure of such vast sums in
the publication of statistical matter was not warranted unless great
pains was taken to secure accurate data to begin with.

This was the last public utterance of General Walker, and those who
heard him were impressed, not only with the dignity, the character,
and the force of his address, but, alas! with the fact that he was over-
worked, and that soon we might expect—we did not anticipate how
soon—his work to overcome him.

It may be that we shall conclude that the most monumental work
undertaken by President Walker was the administration of the affairs
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I have spoken of his
equipment for that position. His experience at Williston and at Yale
confirmed him in his estimate of a sound, practical education. Never
ignoring the classics, always broad enough to appreciate and foster all
that belongs to a college of the liberal arts, he, nevertheless, under-
stood more thoroughly than most educators fifteen years ago the real
necessity of the most complete scientific education. He _ therefore
entered upon his duties in the institute with more than the ardor of an
educator, for he had but little to do with teaching as such. His
breadth of mind enabled him to understand the needs of the institute,
and his great administrative abilities made him familiar at-all times —
with all the features of the various curricula. His innovations were of
the very greatest help to the young man seeking to equip himself for
his life contests. He never believed in giving dipiomas to men who
had simply stayed the required time in the institution over which he
presided; but when a young man was not competent to take the full
course, or through ill health or other adverse conditions was obliged
to drop out of some of the departments, he gave him every opportunity
to secure a special certificate in some one branch. By this means he
has sent out into the world men often without a diploma to be sure,
but thoroughly competent to take charge of work intrusted -to them.
We all know many of these young men—we know their success; we
know their loyalty to President Walker. He was their friend always,
and at all times ready to aid with his advice and assist materially with
his recommendations. While carrying the student roll of the institute
FRANCIS AMASA WALKER. 653

from 32 to 1,198 during his incumbency of the presidency, he raised
the standard of the school in like proportion. The graduates of the
institute are found everywhere, and, so far as my own knowledge is
concerned, always with the same result as to their standing and their
efficiency.

It must be admitted that as an educator in the very highest sense
President Walker had no superior, and with that rare faculty of
aequiring a personal relationship to each student his influence has
never been surpassed, except it may be in the case of Mark Hopkins.

How can I sum up the life of General Walker? His works, his serv-
ice as a public officer, his devoted life as an educator, his brilliant
career as a Soldier—all these appea! to one; and yet they in themselves,
taken all together, making, as they do, a magnificent monument to his
memory, planned, erected, completed by himself, do not fully answer
the question. One must have known him personally, have known his
devoted adherence to principle, have realized and felt his courageous.
action at all times in order to completely appreciate and understand
him. How many knew him! How many miss him! The Loyal Legion
knew him—knew him as a brave soldier, a man of capacity in the field,
aman of resources in planning, and a man of courage in carrying out
his plans; a man who won the commendation, the admiration, the
affection of his comrades in arms, whether of low or of high rank.
The institutions of learning with which he was connected knew him;
students knew him as a man who loved them, who believed in their
- sports, who entered into their ambitions and aspirations, who guided
them with his advice. He once wrote to a young man that he never
wished to shut the door on anyone who was seeking an education, and
was always willing to give another trial to a young man who had
failed. You and I know that as an educator he won their affection.
They felt at liberty to approach him personally, to call upon him, to
visit him. I know how the men who came from under his guidance
here in the institute stand in the world, how their services are sought,
how their preeminent attainments secure for them at once a living
position.

The economists and statisticians of the country will miss him; they
knew him, knew his worth, knew his integrity in all that interests
them, knew the value of his advice. The philanthropic and benevolent
institutions of this State and city knew him and will miss him, for he
was ever ready to give his thought, his sympathy, and his presence to
all good enterprises, and his kindly sympathy with those who had
fallen along the track of life was warm and devoted. * * *
