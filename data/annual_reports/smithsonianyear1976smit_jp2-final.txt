THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and ac-
cepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “estab-
lishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice
President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive depart-
ments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the
Smithsonian Board of Regents.

S. DILLON RIPLEY

THIS IS THE YEAR of the Bicentennial, and this Institution can take
pride in its accomplishments after nearly ten years of preparation.
It is a year in which a new Smithsonian museum, newly opened on
July 1, 1976, the National Air and Space Museum, played host to
two million visitors in its first forty-nine days of existence, surely a
record of some kind. It is a year in which we successfully looked
backwards to a hundred years ago, with the opening of “1876: A
Centennial Exhibition,” a simulacrum of the great Philadelphia
Centennial Exposition, using the same materials, and displaying
them in the building on the Mall originally built to house the forty-
two carloads of material given to the Smithsonian at the time the
Philadelphia exposition closed. After a year and a half of the most
painstaking restoration and refurbishing, that exhibit opened on
May 10, 1976, one hundred years to the day from the opening in
Fairmount Park, complete with carriages, prayers, the Hallelujah
Chorus, release of pigeons, and the John Philip Sousa music com-
posed for the occasion. Each of these great exhibits, the one cele-
brating the achievements of America’s first hundred years, the other
celebrating the triumphs of American technology of our second hun-
dred years, creates an atmosphere of excitement, of sheer pleasure,
and of enthusiasm which is contagious.

Nor were these all. The rest of the Smithsonian celebrated alike,
each museum or bureau with a triumphant series of exhibitions, the
best Festival of American Folklife ever, and a marvelous array of
traveling exhibits, portfolios, courses, lectures, and visiting smaller
exhibits of exquisite beauty and rarity. Truly the Bicentennial year
has been a triumph for collections, the justification of all that has
gone before. These magnificent exhibitions remind us of our na-
tional esprit, and of our special human qualities—innate curiosity
combined with memory, and the insatiable will to discover.

And the people came. Several years ago we predicted that there
would be a vast turnout of visitors during the Bicentennial summer.
Perhaps the expectations of the business bureaux were overly
aroused, for the final city figures and those of hotels, motels, and so
on, have been lower than expected this spring, right up and down
the East Coast. But the Smithsonian visitation, after a rather slow
start, has been picking up steadily since the glorious Fourth, and
indeed that last week of July and the first week of August, for ex-
ample, our visitors were up a full 20 percent over the year before.
We are conducting a study to determine who they are, and why
and where they are staying. In any case, it appears likely that
earlier news reports of light visits to Washington in the spring pro-
duced more tourists later, as well as a different manner of coming,
hard for the business or other count-takers to assess; namely, the
use of campers, trailers, or backpacks by many people who may just
come by for a day, and camp out of town somewhere at night, even
bringing their own food. The National Park Service seems to agree
with us that visiting was heavy, but the manner of visits has
changed.

But the visitors have written in; witness this visitor from South
Carolina:

“Dear Sirs,

I must take this opportunity to say ‘Thank you’ for your
part in making this a wonderful vacation to your city.

People like you, proved all the ‘wild tales’ I’d been told
were false.

The week I spent in Washington, ‘The days at the Smith-
sonian’ will be a memory I'll cherish.

I hope to return in the near future.

God Bless—
Sincerely”

Certainly this Institution is proud to be part of Washington, and
proud too to have the great collections which make us the ““Magnet
on the Mall.” The collections are as much a part of the Smithsonian
as any other. In the original Act of Congress of 1846 occur the

4 / Smithsonian Year 1976
words: “All objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and
all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogi-
cal specimens belonging, or hereafter to belong, to the United States

.. Shall be delivered . . . and shall be arranged in such order, and
so classed, as best to facilitate the examination and study of them,
in the building . . . for the Institution.” By 1857, it had been defi-
nitely settled that Congress would make the necessary appropria-
tions for the museum’s maintenance. As Paul Oehser in his book’
on the Smithsonian has written, and as the early Annual Reports of
the Institution amply demonstrate, Joseph Henry, the first Secretary,
“ .. would rather have seen the museum separate from the Smith-
sonian. He did not relish the idea of having to depend on annual
Government appropriation for Smithsonian activities. It would, he
thought, ‘annually bring the Institution before Congress as a sup-
plicant for government patronage, and ultimately subject it to politi-
cal influence and control.’ He wanted the Institution to ‘mingle its
operations as little as possible with those of the general govern-
ment... .’” But that was not to be, for under the original Act as
quoted above, the Smithsonian was specifically charged with the
museum collections function, and so by 1858 an appropriation of
$4,000 was made for the arrangement and care of the national col-
lections, and appropriations in increasing amounts, as the collections
and the visitation (and inflation) have increased, have continued
ever since.

By 1877, it was obvious—the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition
(in which the Smithsonian had played a leading part in arranging
the Government exhibitions) having resulted in a shower of gifts to
the Institution—that additional space must be secured. This was the
genesis of the Institution’s second building, the Arts and Industries
Building, so-called, which we reopened in Centennial style. As the
Regents of the time proposed to the Senate, it would be necessary
for the nation to pay for the maintenance, care, and upkeep of these
national collections. So Senator Hiester Clymer averred, introducing
the bill for the appropriation of construction funds for the new
building: “It may not be disputed that the acceptance of them (the
gifts) by the Government imposes an obligation that they shall be

1 Sons of Science, page 67 (New York, N.Y.: H. Schuman, 1949).

Statement by the Secretary / 5
preserved and exhibited for the gratification and instruction of the
people... .”

Public instruction has been the cornerstone of the policy of every
generation of Regents and Secretary alike in this Institution. For the
purposes of public instruction, the need for continuing federal sup-
port is clear, whether the means adopted be exhibits, traveling ex-
hibits, publications ranging from guidebooks to encyclopedias of
knowledge, or kindred forms of diffusion.

Similar sentiments were expressed in Congress, and by President
Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, when Charles Lang Freer indicated that
he would give his collections and funds for a building to be part of
the national heritage. Roosevelt writing to the Board of Regents
urged the gift upon them:

“All that is asked of the government or the Regents of the
Smithsonian now is that they shall accept this magnificently
generous offer. . . . Congress will have to take some steps to
provide the comparatively small sum necessary to take care of
what will be a national asset. . . . I hope the Regents will feel
warrented [sic] to close with the offer; for they are the na-
tional guardians of such a collection.”

Congress in subsequent years has often reaffirmed this principle,
as in the Act of May 17, 1938, describing the purposes of the Na-
tional Collection of Fine Arts.

“... (a) It shall be the policy of the Regents to maintain a
worthy standard for the acceptance of art objects for exhibition
in the Gallery . . . and the Regents are hereby authorized to
solicit and receive private donations of works of art and con-
tributions of funds from private sources for the purchase of
works of art....

“.. . (b) In order to encourage the development of con-
temporary art and effect the widest distribution and cultivation
in matters of such art, the Regents are hereby authorized to
solicit and receive funds from private sources, to acquire (by
purchase or otherwise) and sell contemporary works of art or

47

copies thereof, to employ ... artists... .

Statements such as these continue over the years: in 1946 (estab-
lishment of the National Air Museum, Public Law 722); in 1962

6 / Smithsonian Year 1976
(establishment of the National Portrait Gallery, Public Law 443);
and all echo the words of Joseph Henry when in 1855 he stated:
“The principal aim, therefore, in taking charge of all the specimens
(of every kind) is not to swell the Smithsonian collection, but to pre-
serve them from destruction, and to render them immediately avail-
able,” (and here he writes of everything from natural history speci-
mens to “a valuable collection of engravings by the first masters’’
[italics mine]—who were they, I wonder, for these were presumably
lost in the fire ten years later?). And Henry goes on, “.. . with the
hope that Congress will, at some future day, make a liberal appro-
priation to support a national collection.”

And so it has proved, for Congress has indeed taken the Smith-
sonian most seriously, as a special trust responsibility to which it
pledged “the faith of the United States” in 1836, and has been
generous in its stated purposes to improve and protect the national
collections.

Congress now appropriates about one hundred million dollars a
year to maintain collections, to provide for their study and display,
and to support other operations of the Institution. A much appre-
ciated and generous figure indeed, but one which deserves a brief
assessment. It is my suspicion that the collections of scientific mate-
rials, art objects, books, and historical materials amassed by the
Institution over the years, while obviously priceless to the nation in
general terms, could be valued to surpass Mr. Smithson’s original
seed money of somewhat over $500,000 by a factor of at least ten
thousand, or something between five and six billion dollars. If the
annual interest on such a vast sum were to be reckoned as the appro-
priate amount to be made available for collections maintenance and
operations, it would be seen that our current levels of funds repre-
sent about a third of what could prudently be spent without exceed-
ing our income.

In this connection it has always been hoped that a “liberal dis-
tribution of the duplicate specimens should be made to societies and
other establishments in this country and abroad” (quoting Henry’s
Ninth Annual Report, page 25, 1855). Although Secretary Spencer
Baird, who followed Henry, attempted to furnish materials to a
number of early scientific societies in this country, the later de-
velopment of scientific methods requiring series of duplicate speci-
mens for certain studies somewhat cramped the fulfillment of this

Statement by the Secretary / 7
ideal concept. As a result, the Smithsonian has never been able
freely to open up its “riches” and lavishly distribute duplicates to
kindred museums. Sensible exchanges, trade-offs, and deposits, par-
ticularly in the scientific fields, but also in the art field are sometimes
made, but always with committee or commission approvals, and
sometimes with specific scrutiny by the Regents according to a set
of rules adopted by the Board.

It has always seemed sad that objects of great importance or ex-
hibit potential were not more plentiful, for every year the Institution
is petitioned to start a satellite museum here or there in the country
at large. But there are simply not enough objects of exhibit quality
to go round to develop a collection of subsidiary museums. That is
partly why the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service
has come into its own, as a source of surrogate exhibitions which can
be shared across the fifty States, and enjoyed by additional millions
of viewers. And this Bicentennial year has been a notable one for
our Service, with 200 exhibitions traveling to forty-eight States.
Dennis Gould, our Director, deserves great credit for his persistence,
and the ability of his organization to deliver on time. We estimate
that these exhibitions alone have been seen by over eight million
people in this past year.

Even so, the collections continue to mount in number, and de-
mands for space proliferate. As I wrote in last year’s annual report,
Smithsonian Year 1975, “museum keepers know that the supply of
objects, whether made by man, or great natural objects such as
whales or pandas, are finite in number and will inevitably run out
in due course.” We continue to be offered many things, and even
with a discriminating eye, there are certain things which we must
legitimately accept. We can turn things down, as I reported last
year, or we can redirect them to places which seem more appropri-
ate, especially, for example, objects of preeminent state interest
which should go to state institutions. But there are always objects
which fit in, or which fill an important gap, and these we continue
to receive, fulfilling our basic responsibility.

Last year I wrote that one of the things that we would dearly
love to secure for our collection of transportation was a donkey
engine, as its absence was a serious gap in our history of railroad
evolution. Such a miniature, narrow-gauge creature is of considera-
ble rarity in this day and age. Having heard that these little gems

8 / Smithsonian Year 1976
can still sometimes be found rusting away in some southern pine-
land lumber yard, I prayed—‘’Oh Georgia-Pacific, Oh Weyer-
haeuser, where is thy benison? Where in some neglected forest
glade lies maundering that rusting hulk?”

But romantic prayers fell on deaf ears, and nary a peep or chirrup
of recognition came from the busy giants of the lumber industry. It
is no wonder, for all the great timber companies of the world today
seem to be intent on besting their competitors in cutting down the
tropical forests of the world. I am told by the New York Botanical
Garden that these tropical forests, either through lumbering or
burning off, are being cut at the rate of 49.2 acres a minute, day in,
day out, over 22 million acres per year.

Rather, an answer to prayer has come from a Mr. Gerald M. Best
of Beverly Hills, California, who all these years has preserved and
lavished attention on “oLtomana,” a donkey engine from the Island
of Maui in Hawaii. Mr. Best has promised that he and his wife will
give us “OLOMANA,” and so the final jewel has been placed in the
diadem of the Museum of History and Technology’s Department of
Transportation. “oLomaNna” will take her rightful place beside the
great Southern locomotive, No. 1401, and the San Francisco Cable
’ our oldest horseless, belching monster of the
rails. It will be interesting to see if our curators can reconstruct the

Car, and ‘PIONEER,’

voice of “OLOMANA,” on tape, to ring out every so often, and amaze
the children of all ages who throng the Hall of Transportation, and
are so enraptured by the thunderous song of the Southern locomo-
tive. That one has a wonderful taped voice including the word
“bo---ard” among the roars, the pants, and puffs of the start-up,
the shattering passage down the track, and the final mournful
whistle echoing over the distant prairie at the end.

And yet all these objects take care and conservation, whether
books, or paintings, or early transportation. Our paramount need is
still a museum’s support center, in nearby Maryland, on land al-
ready in public ownership, which will give us the conservation,
storage, and work areas that make collections come to life, and keep
the Smithsonian where it should be in the vanguard of preservation,
retrieval, and conservation. Without this facility, and without an
appropriate library for our History of Science collections, the nag-
ging dilemma will continue, the reception of collections with inade-
quate facilities to house them and the gradual deterioration as a

Statement by the Secretary / 9
result, or the rejection of needed materials—to moulder and lie
a-rusting somewhere else.

But what we have done this past year has been a triumph. The
quality and style of exhibitions all over Washington have been an
appropriate tribute to the Bicentennial, and have indeed made this
city a focal point in a way nothing else could have so illumined the
event. For perhaps obvious reasons there are common purposes to
be discerned in the assembling of exhibitions either in science, his-
tory, or art, which have to do with the celebration of a Bicentennial.
As mentioned earlier, two exhibitions have, it seems to me, a com-
mon theme. One is the creation of the great Air and Space Museum
with its extraordinary exhibit of fact, which in truth outdoes fiction.
The design and the settings in which man’s conquest of air and space
is depicted are almost as handsome and as symbolically diverse and
sophisticated as the creation of the objects themselves. They are
highly appropriate. The history of air and space involves technologi-
cal design and inventiveness of the first order. The objects are dis-
played in the awareness of these technologies and the results are
meet and right. The building is in perfect scale, and the effect is not
unlike a novel art museum, in which objects and display suit each
other perfectly. This then is the epitome of the last eighty years,
and of much of which the United States can be justly proud.

The “1876” exhibition similarly tells us what we were most proud
of one hundred years ago. It is the history of the development of
the United States as we conceived it at that time. Our pride was in
the possibility of the mastery of the Continent. The horrible Civil
War was behind us. Now we should turn our minds to the real
priorities, to the unification of the Continent from “sea to shining
sea.” Thus 1876” represents a kind of microcosm of the previous
hundred years, and a sense of where we thought the priorities lay.

Another theme which seems to run through the exhibitions has
had to do with the discovery of the Continent by foreigners and
their impressions of the setting or the new-found objects or peoples.
Thus at the National Gallery of Art there was a superb and fasci-
nating exhibition, “The European Vision of America,” organized by
Hugh Honour. Here one could delight by reflection in the marvels,
some of them fanciful, of the new worlds across the seas, as seen
by artists and naturalist draftsmen. In the same vein, but in a
slightly different context, the National Portrait Gallery has mounted

10 / Smithsonian Year 1976
a triumph in representation of what the eighteenth- and nine-
teenth-century travelers from abroad saw and thought about us all
then. As John Russell said in the New York Times” “Nothing in
American museum life is quite like the exhibitions at the National
Portrait Gallery... . They are about people . . . brought alive by
paintings, photographs, objects and letters which document what
they said, what they did, and what they saw. . . . What we experi-
ence at the National Portrait Gallery is resuscitation in depth.”’ It is
a great show, and it does a great deal to tell one what America
seemed like, truly or not, in foreign eyes. And as we all know we
Americans are always immensely curious to know what others think
of us.

A third theme might be described as what America has done to
people, the people who came, and how they reacted. The Hirshhorn
Museum has a fascinating exhibition, “The Golden Door,” which
surveys the immigrant artists who came to America, and what
they then proceeded to do in the Land of Opportunity, and how it
managed, often subtly, to affect their style and their transition into
a new consciousness in the New World. A monumental exhibit at
the Museum of History and Technology called, ““A Nation of
Nations” tells us about immigrants in general to this country, who
came, and when, where from, and where they went, east and west,
north and south. In the process we can see how ethnic roots have
been preserved, and at the same time how the land and the setting
have inevitably moulded customs and traditions. Styles of making
things changed from region to region, even though the roots of
the styles, or the utility of the objects, were held in common. Finally
the homogenization of the late twentieth century is shown in glaring
detail, but still with ethnic variety, e.g., McDonald’s signs in
Japanese.

A third exhibit within this theme has been the major Bicentennial
exhibition at the National Collection of Fine Arts, “America as Art.”
Here is a sensitive interpretation of the evolution of indigenous art
in America, what the country did to the eye of the artist—as a
symbol—as a theater for the evolution of local character in oppo-
sition to European values. Here, landscape became a romantic no-
tion, evoking moral values and an approach toward understanding

2 July 11, 1976.

Statement by the Secretary / 11
philosophic truths in nature. In a later state there is shown the
paradox of sympathy for the noble savage in an idealized sense
coupled with the frenzied exaltation of frontier conquest. Still later
comes urbanism, the masses, the new realism, accompanied by the
growth of a new liberalism, provoked perhaps by the vestiges of
transcendentalism and moral superiority. At the end there is some-
thing of the current struggle of artists to decide how to break away
from homogenization, to develop an identity out of uniformity.

A variant on this theme could be described as what people have
done to America, and here the National Museum of Natural History
has presented an ecological succession exhibition which graphically
depicts changes in the environment of Washington, D. C., taken at
a point where Rock Creek debouches on the Potomac River. Be-
ginning some 10,000 years ago when the forest was primeval in-
deed, with tree boles of sycamores and other hardwoods as large as
sequoias, down through the first cultivation by native Americans to
the present parklike setting with benches, litter, rats, and sparrows,
it is all there, a panorama of change pointing to a wholly uncertain
future.

Other museum exhibits have been historic moments in time, de-
picting a stage in some cultural succession, or a glorious moment
perceived and now lost. Thus, the Freer Gallery of Art chose to
represent something of where culture or stages in life, as depicted in
painting, stood in Asia in 1775. All over the world the late eight-
eenth century had life and vigor and style, and so it was in India,
China, and Japan. The exhibit is exquisite in its selection and re-
fined in taste. If there are intimations of revolution there, they
escaped me.

An exhibition, celebrating a moment perceived and lost, has been
“The Eye of Thomas Jefferson” at the National Gallery of Art.
Romantic to the hilt, the objects brought together represent all the
varied influences of the art and culture of Europe, a kind of im-
pressionistic grand tour, which might have influenced Jefferson as
a man for all seasons, architect, philosopher, aesthetic interpreter
of life itself, and yet somehow a man of action, a superb politician,
whose pen was mightier than many a sword. The exhibition was
a glorious assemblage of objects of the time, a depiction of the sur-
roundings of an enigma, an aristocrat and an elitist who could be a
violent revolutionary in a time when revolutionaries tolerated gen-

12 / Smithsonian Year 1976
tlemen and aesthetes among their company. How is it possible? It
is too romantic for today. The moment has been lost in the stirring
swirl of history, and we can view such diversity of style and char-
acter with pure nostalgia, convinced that we will not see such
times, or such heroes again.

Then there have been small special exhibitions sent from abroad
to honor the Bicentennial. One of them reached the Museum of His-
tory and Technology. It was an exhibit sent over especially to mark
the visit of the Spanish King and Queen, but one which had taken
years to plan, an exhibit about Columbus and with the artifacts con-
nected with his voyages. There was the great Juan de la Cosa Map
of 1500, never before seen outside of Spain, painted on a sheepskin
as a guide to travelers to the new hemisphere, with symbolic repre-
sentations of travel, such as the Three Kings journeying to pay
homage to the Christ Child. There was Columbus’s copy of Marco
Polo’s travels, appropriate reference reading for someone searching
for the Indies. There were Columbus’s meditations in jail when the
Bible became his support and comforter. There were documents,
paintings, tapestry, and artifacts which made this a treasure trove
to view, and transported the imagination back nearly five hundred
years. Yes, nearly five hundred years; what will there be to com-
memorate in 1992?

A particularly precious exhibition was loaned to the Smithsonian,
and to the Los Angeles County Museum by Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II of Great Britain. This was a collection of anatomical
drawings by Leonardo da Vinci from the Library at Windsor Castle.
These drawings, with Leonardo’s enigmatic script notations, are so
far ahead of their time (as witness contemporary anatomical draw-
ings) that they excite wonder, admiration, and awe. Visiting
scholars and students came from all over the Eastern States to see
the exhibit, taking advantage of a very rare opportunity.

Additionally, for the visit of the Queen herself, we had the stylish
exhibition of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and Silver-
smiths of gold and silver plate of all periods. This was in the original
Smithsonian building, the “Castle,” where Her Majesty was greeted
by the Chancellor and Regents, shown the tomb of James Smithson,
and presented with a Joint Resolution of the Congress of the United
States commemorating what is perhaps the largest philanthropic gift
ever made to one nation by a citizen of another, the bequest of

Statement by the Secretary / 13
James Smithson. Thus the Congress was right to commemorate the
event in this way, and it would seem as if Her Majesty, in this year
of revolutions, should be pleased to think of what a Britisher had
done for the United States, and what the results in subsequent
years have been.

To measure all of the results of Mr. Smithson’s bequest would
be an impossible task, I feel. We can only suspect that nothing quite
like the present Institution could have been foreseen, or even
planned a hundred and forty years ago, when the Act of acceptance
was finally passed and signed into law. No comparable set of cir-
cumstances has existed in any other country. One of the joys of
the creation of the Smithsonian has been that it inaugurated a
vehicle by which the nation might be given things, and a way in
which they might be accepted. Over the years the magnitude of the
gifts—Smithson, Hodgkins, Sprague, Freer, Gallatly, the Walcotts,
the Barneys, Dibner, Roebling, Mellon, Vetlesen, Winston, Link,
Forrest, Bruce, the Ramseys, Reeves, Lilly, Becker, Johnson, Hirsh-
horn, and Post—more than justifies the funds from various sources
spent annually to keep them up. We must take all possible steps
necessary to assure that what we now possess is well cared for and
thoroughly catalogued, or else fail in our trust to the donors. We
would otherwise fail in our responsibility to the Executive and to
the Congress, and thus imperil the very mandate of 1846, that “all
objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of
natural history,” etc. . . . “shall be arranged in such order and
so classed, as best to facilitate . . . the study of them... in the
building . . . for the Institution.” This is a charge which we are
solemnly obligated to carry out with the help of the Congress, God
willing.

And we must keep “The Nation’s Attic” (as it is suspected
Bernard de Voto first called us) in proper order so as to keep safely
our stake in the future as well as the past. Let no one call the Smith-
sonian derelict in pointing out the urgent necessity of preserving the
testament of the past in order to assure our future. For, as has been
said before, history gives us ample reminders of the probable way
of the future. If the Bicentennial has reminded us of anything, it
has brought home to the Smithsonian the interest of our citizens in
being reminded of the past, and the kindred interest in knowing
more of the root stock from which we are all sprung. As I had

14 / Smithsonian Year 1976
predicted, July Fourth was celebrated with a big bang, but there
was more to it than that, more to it than the thrilling nostalgia of
the Tall Ships. There was indeed a sense of rededication and newly
reborn pride in being an American, after what now seem numbing
years of uncertainty and denigration. Can we discern something?
Through the smog of oral and visual logomania which surrounds
us, can we perceive a new will, a new desire for humanity, for
honesty and tolerance? If we can, then indeed our Bicentennial
will have been worthwhile.

Tuis PAST YEAR has brought sadness to the Smithsonian in the un-
timely death of Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks, scholar, poet,
and expert administrator, whom we shall long mourn. Mr. Brooks
had been with the Institution a scant five years, but had already
endeared himself to his colleagues with his fair-minded outlook and
good humor. Less than a year after joining the staff, we have also
lost our Coordinator of Membership and Development, Lawrence E.
Layborne, a valued new addition indeed. We shall miss his style
and gentle spirit.

Another loss has been the nation’s gain, for this year Professor
Daniel J. Boorstin, Senior Historian, National Museum of History
and Technology, has left us to become the nation’s twelfth Librarian
of Congress. The appointment is particularly welcome to the Smith-
sonian, symbolizing as it does the traditional partnership in schol-
arly exchange and book collection that has illuminated the entire
history of our two institutions.

As Assistant Secretary for Administration, John F. Jameson, a
relative veteran of the Smithsonian in spite of his years, has been
appointed to assist me in integration of the management functions
of the Secretary’s office. As Chief Budget Officer of the Institution,
he has developed a particular view of the whole operation which is
invaluable.

Dr. Kevin Sullivan has been appointed Director of the Chesa-
peake Bay Center for Environmental Studies after serving for five
years on that staff. He succeeds Dr. Francis S. L. Williamson, who
decided to resign after a year’s leave of absence in order to continue
as Commissioner of Public Health and Social Services for the State

of Alaska.

Statement by the Secretary / 15
Mr. Edward F. Rivinus has been appointed Acting Director of the
Smithsonian Press after coming to the Smithsonian from the United
States Foreign Service and serving for a time in the area of Public
Service.

To head Smithsonian employee health programs, Dr. Edward
Belton has been appointed as Chief Medical Officer. Professor
Herbert Gursky has been appointed Associate Director of the Center
for Astrophysics (Optical and Infrared Division), Smithsonian As-
trophysical Observatory. Among our affiliates, Miss Ruth Graves
has taken the position of Director of Reading Is Fundamental, and
Messrs. Donald Elliott and Harold Leuba have become Vice Presi-
dents of the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange. Mr. George
Packard has become Deputy Director of the Woodrow Wilson Cen-
ter for Scholars to replace Professor Prosser Gifford, who has re-
turned to Amherst College as Dean after a year’s leave of absence.

Retirements this year included Dr. Waldo Wedel, Senior Anthro-
pologist and distinguished authority on Indian archeology, from the
staff of the National Museum of Natural History, and Dr. Helmut
K. Buechner as Biologist from the National Zoo. Sadly, Dr. Buech-
ner has recently died after a long illness. His ecological research
studies, particularly of ungulates in East Africa, are classics in
their field.

Finally to all those unsung heroes and heroines of the Smith-
sonian staff who kept the wheels rolling, and who performed un-
stintingly and with unfailing politeness to keep this Institution’s
Bicentennial observance on a plane above any single other equiva-
lent ceremonies that I know of, may I say how grateful America
must and should be to you all!

16 / Smithsonian Year 1976
Board of Regents

THE BOARD OF REGENTS met in fiscal year 1976 in the autumn, winter,
and spring, as is customary. At the autumn meeting on Septem-
ber 30, 1975, it was attested that Dr. John Nicholas Brown and
Thomas J. Watson, Jr., had been reappointed as Citizen Regents.
The Secretary reviewed the financial report of the Smithsonian and
described the present schedule of the Bicentennial programs. Of par-
ticular significance was the report that the National Air and Space
Museum would be completed on time and that the costs for con-
struction would be under the original estimate.

Progress was also reported on the joint sponsorship by Wells
Fargo and Company and the Smithsonian of the Bicentennial Essay
Contest authorized by the Regents which would serve to focus at-
tention on the more positive and exciting prospects that face our
country in its third century. Nine distinguished Americans agreed
to serve as national judges to vote on submissions made by various
categories of contestants on the subject “Toward Our Third
Century.”

Two recent legislative actions were noted. The first reserves for
Smithsonian use in the future the last remaining site on the Mall,
located between Third and Fourth Streets and Independence Ave-
nue and Jefferson Drive. The second measure authorizes the prepa-
ration of plans for museum support facilities for the care, curation,
conservation, deposit, preparation, and study of the national collec-
tions of scientific, historic, and artistic objects, specimens, and
artifacts; for related documentation of such collections of the
Smithsonian; and for the training of museum conservators.

The first anniversary of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden was celebrated after the Regents’ meeting at the Museum.
The Museum has a visitor attendance of 1.8 million in the year.

The winter meeting of the Board of Regents was held on Janu-
ary 22, 1976. Special recognition was given to Mr. James E. Webb
as an outstanding Regent and Chairman of the Executive Commit-
tee. The financial report of the Institution was summarized by the

Statement by the Secretary / 17
Secretary for the Board, and a full discussion of the finances of the
Institution will be found in this report.

The Board of Regents determined that the Smithsonian Institu-
tion is financially unable to operate Hillwood as a nonprofit museum
under the terms specified in the Agreement between the Institution
and Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post and therefore directed, in
accordance with the provisions of Mrs. Post’s will, that title to Hill-
wood pass to the Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation of D.C.
on July 1, 1976.

In commemoration of the nation’s Bicentennial, the Regents voted
to award a number of medals to the following recipients for dis-
tinguished achievement in areas of Institutional interest: The Smith-
sonian Medal to Nancy Hanks, the Langley Medal to Grover
Loening and James E. Webb, the Henry Medal to Dr. Martin H.
Moynihan and Dr. T. Dale Stewart, the Matthew Fontaine Maury
Medal to Dr. Robert M. White, and the Redes Medal to Dr.
E. Cuyler Hammond.

The designation of the ‘Doris and eee) Dreyfus Memorial
Study Center” in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts
and Design was approved in recognition of the contributions of
Henry Dreyfus to the field of industrial design. The generous dona-
tions of Mr. and Mrs. Henry J. Heinz II to the Cooper-Hewitt were
underscored by the naming of the “Drue Heinz Study Center for
Drawings and Prints.” The Regents also approved the name “Waldo
L. Schmitt Conference Room” for a room in the Invertebrate Zool-
ogy area of the National Museum of Natural History in honor
of Dr. Schmitt’s outstanding contributions to invertebrate zoology.

A number of legislative proposals were approved for submission
to the Congress, including measures to authorize appropriations
under the National Museum Act, to eliminate the ceiling on appro-
priations for the Barro Colorado Island at the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute, and to authorize the construction of a museum
support facility. The Secretary reported that the two measures,
approved by the Board of Regents in 1974, to authorize planning of
a museum support facility and to remove restrictions on the collec-
tion of portraiture by the National Portrait Gallery have been
enacted.

The Secretary discussed plans for the forthcoming visit of Her
Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to the Smithsonian Institution. It was

18 / Smithsonian Year 1976
agreed to request a Joint Resolution of the House and Senate to
express the American people’s gratitude for the bequest of James
Smithson

The spring meeting of the Board of Regents was convened on
May 10, 1976. At this meeting the Regents paid tribute to the
Smithsonian’s late Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks, hailing par-
ticularly his outstanding classical scholarship and his remarkable
administrative career. The Secretary introduced to the Regents John
F. Jameson, newly designated as the Acting Assistant Secretary for
Administration.

The financial reports were summarized by the Secretary and ac-
cepted by the Board, including the estimate for the “transition
quarter” from July 1 to September 30, 1976, occasioned by the
change in the beginning of the fiscal year from the first of July to the
first of October.

The Secretary reported developments at the National Zoo, includ-
ing the renovation of the elephant house, the new bird yards, and
the glockenspiel provided by a bequest. The first portion of the new
“William M. Mann Lion and Tiger Exhibit” was opened to the pub-
lic on April 9, 1976. This exhibit received a design award in 1975.

An underground parking garage on the Mall was again con-
sidered by the Board as a possibility for the future. A recent up-date ~
of an earlier study indicates that 3,200 parking spaces could be con-
structed under the Mall. It was decided to continue to examine
possibilities for the construction and financing of this parking facil-
ity in cooperation with the National Park Service and other in-
terested government agencies.

Noting progress on a number of legislative matters, the Board of
Regents reviewed the language of the proposed Joint Resolution of
the Senate and House on the occasion of the visit of Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II.

The Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design hav-
ing progressed on schedule toward its opening in the renovated
Carnegie Mansion in New York, the next meeting of the Regents
was scheduled to precede that opening in early October.

FINANCIAL REPORT

T. AMES WHEELER, TREASURER

THIS REPORT coveRS the fiscal year 1976 and the added three
months’ “Transition Quarter” (July 1-September 30, 1976), re-
flecting our change in fiscal year to conform with the new federal
year beginning October Ist.

In this period the Institution continued to benefit from both
strong governmental support and growth in nonfederal income. As
shown in Table 1, federal appropriations received for operating
purposes rose 12.7 percent to $84,004,000 in fiscal year 1976, with
an additional $23,150,000 for the Transition Quarter; together,
these appropriations amounted to 77 percent of the total operating
support in the 15 months’ period. Research grants and contracts
provided another 11 percent, while nonfederal funds from gifts,
endowments and our various auxiliary activities and concessions
supplied the remaining $16,438,000 or 12 percent of the total. For
construction purposes, the Institution received an additional $13,-
922,000 of federal appropriations and $560,000 of gifts from private
sources.

The increased income for the most part went to meet inflationary
cost increases and to make possible the outstanding Smithsonian
Bicentennial programs for the nation’s capital, including the open-
ing of the new National Air and Space Museum, a summer-long
international folk festival on the Mall, and a wide variety of major
exhibitions. Nearly $10,000,000 of federal construction funds were
used to continue the modernization of the National Zoo, while
renovation of the Carnegie Mansion in New York City for the

29
October opening of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and construction
of the new Associates Court, public and staff restaurants and
educational facilities in the National Museum of Natural History,
were completed with nonfederal trust funds, derived principally
from our fund-raising and Associates activities. This period also
saw the completion of our Museum Shop construction and modern-
ization program which will benefit visitors and the Institution alike.

A further step was taken toward the building of our present
relatively small unrestricted-purpose endowment funds to a level
capable of assuring stable financial support for nonfederally sup-
ported Institutional needs in the future; continuation and enlarge-
ment of this effort remains a goal of highest priority.

An overall picture of the application of all of these funds for
operating purposes (exclusive of foreign currency and construction
funds) by individual bureaux and offices may be seen in Table 2.

FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS

The $81,564,000 of federal funds received for Institutional operat-
ing purposes in the 12 months of fiscal year 1976, exclusive of funds
for the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., and the
Excess Foreign Currency Programs, was an increase of $10,858,000
over fiscal year 1975. Well over half of this increase ($6.0 million),
however, was provided merely to meet costs of legislated and
other uncontrollable increases in federal salaries, plus sharp in-
creases in utility rates and other inflationary cost increases. A
further $2,800,000 was made available to equip and staff the new
National Air and Space Museum, and $700,000 was added for our
Bicentennial Program. A large part of the remaining $1.4 million
was needed for maintenance, protection, conservation, and other
program support activities, with relatively little available for any
expansion of programmatic efforts themselves. The resulting alloca-
tion by broad program categories is set forth in Table 3.

As the year progressed, it became possible to hold costs to lower
amounts than originally anticipated; as a result, some $1,271,000 of
the $104,193,000 combined appropriations for operating purposes
in fiscal year 1976 and the Transition Quarter was returned to the
United States Treasury.

For the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, $1,940,000
was provided for fiscal year 1976, and another $521,000 for the

to expand both as to contribution into the research project data
bank and also in providing summaries of such data requested by its
customers. Payments for the latter services, suggested several
years ago by the Office of Management and Budget and the Con-
gress as an alternative to increased appropriations, are growing
steadily and have proven very successful in allowing the Exchange
to meet its total increase in costs with only minimal added federal
support.

Federal funds for the Smithsonian’s Foreign Currency Program,
which provides grants to United States educational institutions for
field research in those countries where these blocked foreign cur-
rencies remain available, were curtailed sharply in fiscal year 1976
to only $500,000. Thus, usage of these funds, together with re-
maining prior-year balances, was limited primarily to supporting
priority ongoing research needs (see Table 4).

Federal appropriations for the Institution’s construction purposes
in fiscal year 1976 and the Transition Quarter totaling $13,922,000
included $2,500,000 to complete the National Air and Space
Museum, an amount which was $500,000 less than anticipated at

the beginning of construction. Another $9,830,000 of the total
allowed the continued gradual renovation of the National Zoo in
accordance with its previously approved Master Plan. Major specific
projects paid for with these appropriations included the service
facility to consolidate support functions, new bear exhibits, con-
tinued planning for Beaver Valley exhibits, planning and installa-
tion of educational graphics, and repairs and renovation of Zoo
facilities at the Rock Creek and Front Royal locations. An additional
$1,592,000 was granted for restoration and renovation of other
Institutional buildings.

GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

Grants and contracts from federal agencies also provided sub-
stantial support to the Institution research programs over the past
15 months. During fiscal year 1976, $11,525,000 was expended,
roughly the same as in the prior fiscal year, and a further $3,987,000
was expended during the Transition Quarter, primarily for work in
the scientific disciplines. The major granting agencies are listed in
Table 5 for this and prior periods representing hundreds of different
grants and contracts each year.

The major recipient in the Institution is the Smithsonian Astro-
physical Observatory which, as shown in Table 2, expended $8,-
517,000, or 55 percent of these funds; most of this support came
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for such
projects as satellite tracking and research and development of
masers. Projects for other bureaux ranged from studies of the social
behavior of harbor seals to analysis of herbicide concentrations in
the Chesapeake Bay, and an oral history of jazz in the United States.

SMITHSONIAN TRUST FUNDS

The federal funds discussed above are provided to enable the
Smithsonian to carry out its responsibilities for the preservation,

research, and exhibition of the ever-growing national collections of
valuable cultural, historic, and scientific objects; they constitute
by far the largest source of income to the Institution as has been
the case for nearly the past 100 years since the construction with
appropriated funds of the Arts and Industries Building, completed
in 1881. Nevertheless, the Smithsonian’s own nonfederal trust
funds remain the basic element of this unique Institution’s financial

structure as they have been ever since the Institution was estab-
lished in 1846. In order for the Smithsonian to continue its position
as an outstanding cultural and scientific resource for the entire na-
tion, this important and flexible source of support must be main-
tained and strengthened. Efforts toward this goal were continued
successfully in this Bicentennial period.

Most encouraging perhaps has been the continued success of the
Associates program, including the Smithsonian magazine, and also
our Museum Shops and related programs featuring sales of products
based on interesting and informative items in the museum collec-
tions. National Associate memberships again rose sharply from
just over 900,000 in June 1975 to about 1,300,000 in the Transition

participate here in special cultural, educational, and entertainment
programs now exceed 40,000. In addition, Associates activities have
now been expanded to extend certain Smithsonian events to about
ten cities throughout the country each year.

While Museum Shop sales have increased, income was reduced
in this period by the temporary closing of the Arts and Industries
Building and by start-up expenses of new shops and our new mail

future, particularly with the completion of all the Shops, including
those in the National Air and Space Museum and the National
Museum of Natural History.

The unrestricted funds derived from all of these various pro-
grams have been used to cover Institutional administrative costs,
to continue a program of small research grants, and to benefit the
individual bureaux which share in the income from the concessions,
Shops, and Product Development Program. The Associates, school
children, and other visitors have benefited during the past year
from the addition of new facilities in the Natural History Building.
Income from the unrestricted funds enabled the Institution to take
another step in its high-priority program of increasing its relatively
small unrestricted-purpose endowment funds. With the addition

of $1,750,000 during the 15-month period, these unrestricted en-
dowment funds now total approximately $7.5 million.

Special Purpose Funds, shown separately in Tables 2 and 6, in-
clude gifts and other income received directly by individual bureaux
for their general use or set aside by Smithsonian management from
general unrestricted funds for bureau programs or other specific
uses. Income to these funds shown in Table 6 totaling $1,420,000
in this period is only that portion received directly—from gifts, for
example, or from Zoo parking receipts reserved for future expan-
sion of its parking facilities, or from miscellaneous sales, performing
arts admissions and rentals. Including funds from such items as in-
terest payments and sharing of shop proceeds, royalties and con-
cessions earnings, total income to these Special Purpose Funds in
this period equaled $2,665,000 and expenditures $1,248,000. The
balance in these funds as of September 30, 1976, was $2,488,000,
compared to $1,071,000 on June 30, 1975 (see Balance Sheet on
page 58 of this report).

A major portion of Smithsonian trust funds is restricted to
specific bureaux or activities by designation. During fiscal year 1976
and the Transition Quarter, the Institution received $7,788,000 of
these restricted funds. Of this total, $2,137,000 was income from
Restricted Endowment Funds, $4,965,000 was gifts and grants from
individuals, foundations, and corporations, and $686,000 repre-
sented miscellaneous receipts, such as those from sales desks, bene-
fits, and membership fees.

The major units receiving these funds are shown in Table 9. The
Freer Gallery of Art and the Fort Pierce Bureau were both provided
for in large measure by endowment dedicated to their use; the
other restricted endowments, detailed more fully below, support a
wide range of projects throughout the Institution. Principal activi-
ties benefiting from gifts and grants during this period include the
Maritime Hall project of the National Museum of History and
Technology, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Freer Gallery of Art,
the Division of Performing Arts (which produced the extended
Festival of American Folklife on the Mall), and the Hillwood
Museum, which at the end of the fiscal year was transferred to the
Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation of D.C. Gifts and grants
also represent a major source of support for programs in other
areas, and the Institution is extremely grateful for this public sup-

The Archives of American Art, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, and
the Freer Gallery of Art also support their activities through such

which are included under miscellaneous receipts.

Generous support was also received during the year for the
renovation of the Carnegie Mansion of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Due in great measure to a matching grant in this period from the
Carnegie Corporation, as well as a gift from Mr. Henry J. Heinz II,
the Museum was able to open to the public in October 1976. A
welcome and specific bequest from the Estate of Dr. Ivy A. Pelzman
allowed us to construct a glockenspiel in the National Zoological

consists of the Freer Fund, whose income supports the operation
of the Freer Gallery of Art, Endowment Fund No. 3, used for
oceanographic research at the Fort Pierce Bureau in Florida, and a
great number of smaller restricted and unrestricted funds (listed in
Table 13) for a variety of research and museum projects. Unre-
stricted endowment funds totaled $7,477,000, or 17 percent of the
total. Separate accounting records are, of course, maintained on
each of these various endowments, but for investment purposes
they have been pooled since June 1, 1974, into the one fund. Market
values of the Consolidated Endowment Fund since 1972 are shown
in Table 11.

Financial Report / 45
The investment management of the endowment funds of the
Institution, with the exception of $1,000,000 on permanent deposit
and the miscellaneous securities, is conducted by three professional
advisory firms, under the close surveillance of the Investment
Policy Committee and the Treasurer, and is subject to policy guide-
lines set by the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents. As described in
prior reports, the Institution follows the total return policy, adopted
by the Board of Regents in 1972, under which income is paid by
each individual endowment fund at the annual rate of 41/2 percent
of the running 5-year average of market values, adjusted for addi-
tions or withdrawals of capital.

As indicated previously, the Smithsonian in this last fiscal period
was able to transfer $1,750,000 from current unrestricted income
into endowment funds, in furtherance of its goal to increase such
funds to a level more in proportion to the present operations of the
Institution. Every effort will be made to continue this practice in
future years.

The changes in the Consolidated Endowment Funds over the past
15 months, due to transfers, reinvestment of income, donations, and
values in the securities markets, are shown in Table 12. The in-
crease in market value during this period indicates a market per-
formance roughly in line with the major market indexes. Income of
$2,467,000, net of managers’ and custodial fees, was paid out dur-
ing the 15-month period under the total return policy; this was
$565,000 greater than the $1,902,000 from dividends and interest
yield. A breakdown of the income to the various funds participating
in the Consolidated Endowment Funds is shown in Table 13,
together with the book and market values of these funds. Table 10
provides detail on the types of securities held by the Institution. A
listing of the individual investments held in the Consolidated En-
dowment Funds at September 30, 1976, may be obtained upon
request to the Treasurer of the Institution.

ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The nonfederal Trust Funds of the Institution are audited annually
by independent public accountants as they have been at the direc-
tion of the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents since
1909. Their report for fiscal year 1976 and the Transition Quarter

46 / Smithsonian Year 1976
is contained in the following pages, including a comparative balance
sheet and a statement of the changes in various fund balances.

The Defense Contract Audit Agency annually performs an audit
on grant and contract moneys received from federal agencies. In
addition, the federally appropriated funds of the Institution are
subject to audit by the General Accounting Office which, at year’s
end, was conducting a general review of Smithsonian finances. The
internal audit staff continued its program of selective audits during
the year, contributing to continued improvements in administrative

and financial management.

CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20036

The Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution:

We have examined the balance sheet of the Trust Funds (formerly
designated as Private Funds) of Smithsonian Institution as of Sep-
tember 30, 1976 and the related statement of changes in fund
balances for the fifteen months then ended. Such statements do
not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, nor other departments,
bureaus and operations administered by the Institution under
Federal appropriations as detailed in note 2 to the financial state-
ments. Our examination was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of
the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.

In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present
fairly the financial position of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian In-
stitution at September 30, 1976 and the changes in its fund balances
for the fifteen months then ended, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with
that of the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION—TRUST FUNDS
Notes to Financial Statements
September 30, 1976

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and General Information

a. The statement of changes in fund balances reflects transactions for the
fifteen months ended September 30, 1976, as a result of a change in the
Institution’s fiscal year from June 30 to September 30.

b. Accrual Basis—The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution—Trust
Funds (previously designated as Private Funds) (note 2) have been pre-
pared on the accrual basis, except for depreciation of plant fund assets as
explained in note 1(i) below, and are in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles included in the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Audit Guide “Audits of Colleges and Universities.”

c. Current funds include capitalized improvements and equipment used in
income-producing activities having a net carrying value of $1,069,862 and
$597,610 at September 30, 1976 and June 30, 1975, respectively. Current
funds used to finance the acquisition of plant assets and for provisions for
debt amortization and interest are accounted for as transfers to the plant
fund.

Separate sub-fund groups of current unrestricted funds have been reflected
in the statement of changes in fund balances for auxiliary activities
(representing primarily the revenue and expenditures of the Smithsonian
Associates program, including the Smithsonian Magazine, and museum
shop sales) and Special Purposes (representing internally segregated funds
for certain designated purposes).

d. Fund Accounting—In order to ensure observance of limitations and re-
strictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution,
the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the
principles of “fund accounting.” This is the procedure by which resources
for various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes
into funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified.
Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accom-
panying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have
been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions
have been recorded and reported by fund group.

Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so
indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to specific
purposes by action of the governing board. Externally restricted funds may
only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the source
of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which the
governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its in-
stitutional purposes.

Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments re-
quiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be

58 / Smithsonian Year 1976
utilized. Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the
expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions.

While quasi-endowment funds have been established by the governing
board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such
funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts
for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be
maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board
has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the
purpose stipulated by the donor.

All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition of
investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund which
owned such assets. Ordinary income derived from investments, receivables,
and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets, except for
income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which
income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unre-
stricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds.

All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current
fund. Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted
resources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds.

. Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisi-
tion when acquired by gift.

f. Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value.

. Income and expenses in respect to the Institution’s magazine and asso-
ciates’ activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the
applicable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current
unrestricted funds.

. The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment manage-
ment of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this ap-
proach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and
unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. In apply-
ing this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide 412% of the five
year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and
transfers during this period) as being available for current expenditures;
however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is
less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of
donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends
received.

. Capitalized improvements and equipment used in income-producing activi-
ties purchased with Trust Funds are capitalized in the current unre-
stricted fund at cost (see note 1(c)), and are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives of five to ten years. Depreciation
expense of $186,660 for 1976 is reflected in the expenditures of the current
funds.

Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost, to
the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor,
or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in
Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded
at nominal values. Depreciation on buildings is not recorded.

Financial Report / 59
All the other land, buildings, fixtures and equipment (principally acquired
with Federal funds), works of art, living or other specimens are not re-
flected in the accompanying financial statements.

j. The agency funds group consists of funds held by the Institution as custo-
dian or fiscal agent for others.

k. Pension costs are funded as accrued.

l. The Institution has a number of contracts with the U. S. Government,
which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the Institution. Contract
revenues are recognized as expenditures are incurred.

2. Related Activities

The Trust Funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from
private sources, from Federal grants and contracts and from certain activi-
ties related to the operations of the Institution.

Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying
financial statements, provide major support for the operations and ad-
ministration of the educational and research programs of the Institution’s
many museums, art galleries and other bureaus, as well as for the main-
tenance and construction of related buildings and facilities. In addition,
land, buildings and other assets acquired with Federal funds are not re-
flected in the accompanying financial statements.

The following Federal appropriations were received by the Institution for
the fifteen months ended September 30, 1976 and the twelve months
ended June 30, 1975.

The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to certain
separately incorporated organizations on which certain officials of the In-
stitution serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institu-
tion by these organizations for the aforementioned services, together with
rent for Institution facilities occupied, etc., totaled approximately $466,000
for the fifteen months ended September 30, 1976. The following sum-
marizes the approximate expenditures of these organizations for the fifteen
months ended September 30, 1976, as reflected in their individual financial
statements and which are not included in the accompanying financial state-
ments of the Institution:

Substantially all of the investments of the endowment and similar funds
are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each in-
dividual fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value
per unit at market value at the beginning of the calendar quarter within
which the transaction takes place. Of the total units each having a market
value of $103.69 ($102.61 in 1975), 335,954 units were owned by endow-
ment, and 79,520 units by quasi-endowment at September 30, 1976.

. Pension Plan

The Institution has a contributory pension plan providing for the pur-
chase of retirement annuity contracts for those employees meeting certain
age and length of service requirements who elect to be covered under the
plan. Under terms of the plan, the Institution contributes the amount
necessary to bring the total contribution to 12% of the participants’ com-
pensation subject to social security taxes and to 17% of the participants’
compensation in excess of that amount. The total pension expense for the
fifteen months ended September 30, 1976 was $1,404,788.

Income Taxes

The Institution has been recognized as exempt from income taxes as a
nonprofit organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code. It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt
from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as described in
Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Recognition of this dual status will be
sought from the Internal Revenue Service. Should the Institution’s position
not prevail, income taxes in a substantial amount might be imposed on cer-
tain income of the Institution, under provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code dealing with unrelated business income as defined therein.

Smithsonian Year + 1976
SCIENCE

THE BICENTENNIAL YEAR has brought a greater recognition among
the general public of our common heritage; it has also intensified
doubts prevalent in this country during the past decade concerning
cherished ideas and institutions. Many organizations and beliefs
have adjusted to the times or simply disappeared. Throughout this
period of uncertainty and skepticism the Smithsonian has been will-
ing to accept divergent viewpoints and in its research and in its
exhibits has adhered to a truthful portrayal of our universe and of
man’s role in its development. This is a proper function for the
Smithsonian and one which under no circumstances should be
abrogated.

Due to its unique nature, the Smithsonian is in a position not
only to chronicle the past but to chart the future toward the third
century of American development. The conquest of air and space
which we celebrate in the new National Air and Space Museum
and the work of our own scientists at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory in Cambridge will be instrumental in unlocking the
mysteries of the universe. While progress is assuredly slow at times,
no one in Philadelphia in 1876 would have thought that today we
would have reached the Moon and Mars, with promise that by the
last quarter of this century the outposts of our own galaxy and
beyond will be accessible.

The serious question of our ability to sustain life on earth at the
time of our Tricentennial is a problem to which we must address
ourselves. Depletion of our floral and faunal heritage is of particu-
lar concern to the National Zoological Park and the National
Museum of Natural History. It is hoped that with increased atten-

65
tion and research on endangered species, especially through pro-
grams at the Zoo’s Conservation and Research Center and the
National Museum of Natural History’s Department of Botany, we
will be able eventually to repatriate such species to the wild with
practical plans for their rational management.

Health problems continue to plague the world, and scientists at
our Tropical Research Institute are studying how the life cycle and
behavior of tropical wild animals relate to human health. Studies
have already linked the sloth as a possible vector in the spread of a
form of encephalitis and yellow fever. In conjunction with health
officials, our scientists hope to provide clues which will solve the
riddle of these debilitating diseases. At our Radiation Biology
Laboratory, scientists are studying the problems of ultraviolet light
and its relationship to skin cancer and plant growth. Further
research on ultraviolet light should lead to greater food production
and lessen the risk of skin cancer.

While we in science will always have our critics and be tempted
to explore fleeting trends, our hope, and that of the country in our
third century, is to be concerned with the long term. Through the
stabilizing influence of such institutions as the Smithsonian, our
society is protected against temporarily fashionable research, so
that, thanks to our firm resolve, forthcoming generations may
expect a better world and the realization of many of the dreams
of our forefathers.

Center for the Study of Man

Research on American Indian problems has been a prime activity
over the past year at the Center for the Study of Man. Investigation
of the American Indian ecumenical movement continued, with
invited attendance at the Southwest Regional Meeting at the Navajo
Community College and at the general meeting on the Stony Indian
Reserve in Morley, Canada. The Center was also represented by
invitation at the first meeting of the Fourth World Tribal Peoples
in Port Alberni, British Columbia, Canada.

The Handbook of North American Indians is a comprehensive
encyclopedia written from the perspectives of anthropology, his-
tory, and linguistics. Hundreds of scholars from all over the world

66 / Smithsonian Year 1976
have submitted articles for this twenty-volume work, which is now
being assembled by a staff under General Editor William C. Sturte-
vant, Curator of North American Ethnology in the National Mu-
seum of Natural History.

Most volumes will be studies of tribal culture and history by area,
e.g., the Northeast, the Southwest, and the Plains. Several others are
thematically organized, e.g., technology and the visual arts, and the
history of Indian-White relations. Volumes on California and the
Northeast are expected to appear in 1977.

THE NATIONAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL FILM CENTER

Founded a year ago by Dr. E. Richard Sorenson “as a means to
forge beyond the too narrow view of the human condition as bio-
logical organization or collections of artifacts,” the National
Anthropological Film Center is now taking advantage of the
scholarly potential of the visual media to explore and reveal the
range of human qualities and behavior in our diverse and changing
world. Bridging science and the humanities, it draws upon the ma-
terials and methods of both.

Research this year centered on Dr. Sorenson’s Study of Child
Behavior and Human Development in Cultural Isolates. As pat-
terns of behavior and interaction take hold of and mold a growing
child, they can reveal how basic human potential may respond to
various conditions of life and how the patterned responses char-
acteristic of a culture emerge.

Using techniques of phenomenological inquiry developed by Dr.
Sorenson to obtain data suitable for study without first having to
decide what might be important or significant, the Center is now
examining child behavior and human development in isolated soci-
eties in New Guinea, Brazil, Micronesia, Afghanistan, and Mexico.

To sample as broad a range of human expression as possible, a
World Ethnographic Film Sample is being planned to preserve
examples of the range and variety of human life. Bodies of film
already made are being searched out, and new collaborative film
studies of existing cultural survivals are aimed at filling the gaps in
the range of cultural expressions of humankind. Special attention is
being given to threatened social and cultural enclaves which repre-
sent vanishing or changing expressions of human organization and
behavior.

With great freedom bestowed on them to explore objects and places at will,
the Fore children of New Guinea reacted to unanticipated, new, or surprising
occurrences by seeking bodily association with others—similarly to the way
they learned new things as infants. To Fore infants and toddlers, this physical
contact was a sanctuary of nurture and warmth, in which curiosity and in-
terest could be safely maintained. Supplying cues to appropriate response,
this sanctuary was also a retreat when the children’s cognitive or response
capabilities were overtaxed. Research film analysis by Dr. Sorenson showed
this pattern persists throughout childhood. This pattern of response to the
novel or unknown left the freely ranging young child relatively safe in his
exploratory quests. His automatic reaction to novelty was to approach it in
the company of a “more knowledgeable” hamlet-mate. (Photo credit: E. Rich-
ard Sorenson)

A National Research Film Collection is being developed as a
means of preserving the irreplaceable film records which document
divergent expressions of human potential, organization, and be-
havior in natural, social, and cultural contexts.

A temperature/humidity-controlled film vault has been installed,
thanks to a gift from Drs. Jerry and Lucy Waletzky and the Na-
tional Endowment for the Humanities; and the developing film
collection is now being preserved at 40° F. and 35 percent relative
humidity. The capacity of the vault—2,500,000 feet of 16 mm film—
will allow continued accessioning for several years.

This year, 312,538 feet of film were accessioned into the National
Research Film Collection, bringing the total number of feet to
554,338. This growing body of irreplaceable documents represents
aspects of life in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Brazil, the Cook Islands,
Ghana, India, Mexico, Micronesia, Nepal, New Guinea, the New
Hebrides, and the United States.

In an effort to improve location and identification of existing an-
thropological films and to help establish priorities for urgent
anthropological filming, a central National Union Catalog of an-
thropological films is being developed. Anthropological film his-
torian Emilie de Brigard is organizing this catalog so that it will be
compatible with existing indexes to the anthropological literature
and ethnological collections.

Developed from the small Ethnofilm Training Program for Devel-
oping Nations initiated two years ago by a grant from the Wenner-
Gren Foundation, the Ethnofilm Training Program has been designed
to train students to obtain film samples, suitable for research, of
human behavior of vanishing and changing cultures. Based on the
belief that individuals from other cultures enrich such samples,
because of their different, often more expert, cultural perceptions,
the Program purposely involves members of non-Western cultures.

RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC STUDIES

The Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies (res)
was founded in 1973 as a unit within the Smithsonian Institution’s
Center for the Study of Man. The mission of ries includes research,
dissemination, stimulation, and facilitation of interdisciplinary

Science / 69
study, and consultative services on the broad range of knowledge
of United States immigration.

RIES is unique among institutions studying immigration in at least
two ways: (1) stress on the new immigrants entering the United
States since 1965, and (2) explicit inclusion of American extrater-
ritorial jurisdictions among those topics studied. Such a focus
complements the Research Institute’s goal of achieving a fuller
understanding of the new immigration, its patterns and character-
istics, and its ongoing impact on American society and discernible
implications for the future of the international community.

Since its inception, the Research Institute has provided consulta-
tive services, been host to and advised research fellows, and spon-
sored activities aimed at fostering in-depth study of issues related
to international migration, ethnicity, development, and other critical
areas, as they influence domestic and international relations.
Within the Smithsonian, rues personnel have contributed to the
activities of the Interdisciplinary Communications Program, the Di-
vision of Performing Arts, the Woodrow Wilson International
Center for Scholars, the Office of Symposia and Seminars, the
Smithsonian Associates program, and the Office of Academic
Studies.

Planning and evaluative services have also been provided to pub-
lic and private organizations concerned with national and interna-
tional programs and activities. Among these organizations are:

Association of Caribbean Universities and Research Institutes (UNICA)
Carnegie Foundation

Ford Foundation

House Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs

National Endowment for the Humanities

National Institute of Mental Health

National Urban League

Organization of American States

Phelps-Stokes Fund, Washington Bureau

In observance of the Bicentennial, many Smithsonian Institution
units have emphasized such subjects as immigration, ethnicity, cul-
tural pluralism in the evolution of American society, and techno-
logical and cultural developments. ries has been one of the few
units within the Smithsonian Institution to stress a truly contempo-

mately sixty-five representatives of academia, government, and the mass
media attended the seminar.

rary phenomenon—post-1965 immigration to the United States and
its various implications.

As its contribution to the Bicentennial, rmes has planned a two-
year activity aimed at the convening of a national conference on
the new immigration to the United States and the publication of a
technically definitive volume on the same subject. The conference
will combine public panel discussions and selective scholarly semi-
nars. The panels will discuss policy issues, such as refugees and
illegals, and will present progress reports on research concerning
policy-oriented aspects of the new immigration. The scholars will
participate in two sequences of seminars, on international and do-
mestic implications of the new migration. In addition to national and
international dignitaries, key participants will include important
academicians, researchers, and policymakers.

In order to realize more effectively its goals for the Bicentennial,
ruES has established regional ad hoc committees of individuals to
assist the rues staff in the design of the Bicentennial program. These
individuals are highly respected professionals from the diplomatic

Science / 71
corps, private industry, academia, government, and other public in-
ternational and national agencies, as well as public-interest groups.
They are chosen on the basis of reputation for knowledge of rele-
vant literature, professional experience, or participation in the new
immigration. These ad hoc advisory committees embody many
racial and ethnic groups and, as an added dimension, bring to bear
interdisciplinary viewpoints on the formulation of programs or ac-
tivities. In addition to Washington, D.C., sites visited by the ries
staff as part of its work with these groups were: Miami, Florida;
San Juan, Puerto Rico; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and Camp Pendleton, California; and Toronto,
Ontario, Canada.

As part of its preliminary activities for the Bicentennial, r1Es
planned a series of mini-conferences. These mini-conferences had
several objectives: to stimulate cross-country enthusiasm for the
general topic; to identify prospective participants and subthemes;
and to establish working ties with organizations and agencies with
special interest in the new immigration.

rues also sponsored selected individuals to participate in panel
discussions on “International Immigration as a Policy Issue,” held
at the International Studies Association’s Annual Convention in
Toronto, Canada. The ries session, which stressed Western Hem-
isphere immigration, included papers on the comparison of United
States and Canadian immigration policies, Third World immigra-
tion, and analyses of Caribbean emigration and immigration.

Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies

In the spring of 1976, Dr. J. Kevin Sullivan was appointed Director
of the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies (csces).
Before joining the Smithsonian Institution in 1971, Dr. Sullivan
spent seven years with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
in Michigan, where he was involved in environmental studies on the
Great Lakes and the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.

Associate Directors for Science and Education were also
appointed in 1976. Dr. David Correll, formerly a research chemist
at the Smithsonian Institution’s Radiation Biology Laboratory, was
named Associate Director for Scientific Programs, and Dr. John

72 / Smithsonian Year 1976
Falk, an ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley, was
named Associate Director for Education Programs.

Activities at the Chesapeake Bay Center include ecological re-
search and education programs. Principal themes in research include
comparative ecology of terrestrial communities, with emphasis on
the effects of past land use. Estuarine research is concerned with
the response of biological populations to physical and chemical
factors. The integration of these two programs is accomplished by
an extensive program of monitoring and analysis of runoff from the
Rhode River watershed through a system of permanent gauging
stations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES

The long-range goal of the Upland Ecology Subprogram is to gain
a better understanding of the comparative ecology of the various
land uses found on the Rhode River watershed. This past year’s
participants in the Upland Ecology Subprogram, led by J. Lynch and
B. Tremper, are concentrating their efforts on the characterization
of nine intensive-study sites, each of which is 1 to 10 hectares in
size. These sites were selected on the basis of past land use, time
period since abandonment, and the types of plant communities
presently found on the sites. This research is supplemented by a
land-use history project in which deed records and oral histories
are being used to develop a detailed understanding of past land-use
practices on sites undergoing contemporary comparative research,
The investigations are analyzing population data on birds, small
mammals, ants, understory arthropods, and litter arthropods.

These study sites are representative of successional stages. For
example, two sites have never been clearcut or burned since coloni-
zation in the 1650s. Both are characteristic of mature plant com-
munities.

In comparison, another site is a previously cultivated field which
was abandoned only six years ago. The soils of this site are
relatively low in nitrogen.

In addition to these baseline studies on the animal and plant com-
munities of each site, Dr. Correll and his colleagues are beginning
to examine the mechanisms underlying observed distributional
patterns. Rates of nutrient depletion and pH decrease when land is
abandoned from agriculture are being studied. An experiment in-

One species responsible for a dense dinoflagellate bloom in the Rhode River
estuary was identified as Prorocentrum mariae-lebouriae. This scanning elec-
tron micrograph shows its almost spherical, strongly compressed, saucer-shape.
Its surface has an evenly distributed pattern of small projections and ridges
at the cell periphery.

volving the manipulation of nutrient availability in an old forest
has also been designed, and preliminary survey data are being
gathered. One goal of this study is to determine whether mineral
nutrient limitations are the restricting factor for plant species com-
position and animal population size in southern Maryland forests.
In addition to studies of the upland sites in the Rhode River
Watershed, Dr. Patricia Mehlhop has also been conducting studies
on small-mammal distribution at the Poplar Islands. Owned and ad-
ministered by the Smithsonian, these small islands are located 2
miles off the Eastern Shore of Maryland, in the Chesapeake Bay.
In 1973, Dr. Mehlhop and Sheila Minor surveyed the islands for
small mammals. They found mammal diversity and populations to
be very low. Meadow voles were found on two Poplar Islands, and
Norway rats were found on one. Later in 1973, the Norway rat
became extinct. Interviews with past residents indicated that other
mammals, such as squirrels and mice, had once inhabited Poplar.

74 / Smithsonian Year 1976
In the watershed subprogram, Drs. Correll, Pierce, Faust, and Wu
are measuring mass balances for a series of parameters on sub-
watersheds which vary in size from 2 hectares (5 acres) to 1000 ha
(2500 acres). A major goal is to determine how land management,
climate, and other factors influence the movement of materials from
a watershed into an estuary.

The watershed of the Rhode River is composed of small basins
which drain directly or through creeks into the estuary. The basins
have been mapped according to land use, and instrumented sam-
pling stations have been constructed to monitor the runoff from
each basin. These stations record the volume of water discharged
while taking volume-integrated samples. The runoff is analyzed for
organic matter, nutrients, bacteria, sediment, cations (including
heavy metals), and pesticides. Rainwater is also collected and
analyzed.

Analysis of the 1974 data revealed the following findings:

1. For the entire year, runoff from residential land contained
more nitrogen and phosphorus per unit area than runoff from any
other land-use type. Cultivated cropland had the second highest
yield rate for these nutrients. The nutrient yield rates for forests
were consistently low throughout the year.

2. Rainwater deposited more nitrogen in the estuary than upland
runoff. For example, rain deposited 4.1 tons of nitrogen in the
estuary, compared to 3.7 tons of nitrogen from land runoff.

3. Cropland and pasture are not exporting most of the incoming
loads of nitrogen to the Rhode River. Substantial amounts are prob-
ably lost to the atmosphere as nitrogen, ammonia, and nitrogen
oxides. On the average, farmers applied 0.16 lb. N/acre day to
cultivated land and 0.13 lb. N/acre day to pasturelands. The yearly
average loading rates of nitrogen from cropland and pasture were
0.011 Ib. N/acre day and 0.0085 lb. N/acre day, respectively.

4. Residential land had the highest loading rate of sediment for
the year, followed by cultivated cropland, pastureland, and forest-
land.

5. Freshwater upland wet areas were found to be nutrient and
sediment sinks; average loading rates for wet areas, especially in
the spring and summer, were negative.

6. Fecal coliform concentrations in the Rhode River exceeded
standards for shellfish waters at certain times of the year. This

Science / 75
contamination was entirely from runoff and from drainage areas,
with average densities of only 1.6 animals/acre and 0.8 persons/
acre.

The watershed program is funded by the National Science Foun-
dation-Research Applied to National Needs (NsF-RANN) through the
Chesapeake Research Consortium and by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency.

The goal of the estuarine subprogram is to develop a more ade-
quate understanding of the relationship between biological popula-
tions of an estuary and physical/chemical factors. Some of the more
advanced research projects in this subprogram focus on phosphorus
cycling and flux in an estuarine environment.

David Correll and Maria Faust have been investigating the role of
microorganisms in phosphorus cycling. In their research, they
attempted to distinguish phosphorus-uptake by algae from that by
bacteria in an estuarine community. Using a differential filtration
technique to separate the bacterial population from the phytoplank-
ton, they measured the phosphorus-uptake of each. Monthly sam-
pling was carried out in the main basin of the Rhode River estuary
from March 1973 through February 1974.

The results of these experiments indicated the relative contribu-
tion of algae and bacteria to phosphorus-uptake with the season.
During the period from August to May, phosphorus was assimi-
lated mostly by bacteria, and the algal contribution to phosphorus-
uptake was less than 6 percent. During June and July, phosphorus-
uptake by algae increased to 9 percent and 42 percent of total
phosphorus-uptake, respectively. The bacteria’s higher phosphorus-
uptake throughout the year clearly indicated the importance of
bacteria as a major recycler of phosphorus in the estuarine environ-
ment.

Nutrient-flux experiments have also been conducted in tidal
marshes. During 1974, various levels of phosphate were applied to
a high and low marsh in the Rhode River for a period of three to
four months. Samples of plant leaves, surface detrital materials, and
sediment cores at various depth were analyzed for the amount and
specific activity of various phosphorus fractions. Since the nutrient
loading included nitrogen in the form of ammonia and nitrate, core
samples were also analyzed for total nitrogen composition.

76 / Smithsonian Year 1976
An important implication of these results is that the contention
that marshes have considerable value as nutrient-removal systems
appears to be unfounded, at least for the medium salinity marshes
of the Chesapeake Bay.

Another project by M. Faust focused on the survival of Escheri-
chia coli MC-6, a bacterium of fecal origin, in an estuarine environ-
ment. The effects were measured of physical parameters on E. coli
survival in diffusion chambers placed in the Rhode River. Data
were collected to evaluate the combined efforts of time, water tem-
perature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and montmorillonite (a type of
clay particle) on coliform survival.

EDUCATION

During 1976, csces continued to initiate and expand programs
aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of outdoor-
centered environmental education.

Initiated in 1975, the teacher-led tour program was designed to
provide children with outdoor experiences which reinforced or in-
troduced science concepts. The Center worked closely with the local
Anne Arundel County School System to develop the following
teacher-led activities: ‘“Micro-Trails, Macro-Trails’” for the first
grade; “Animal Adaptations: Insects and Spiders” for the second
and third grades; “Community Comparison: Forest and Old Field”
and “Estuary Chesapeake” for the fifth and sixth grades; and
“Seeing the Trees for the Forest: A Census Activity” for the
seventh and eighth grades. Each activity is outlined in a brochure
that includes background information for the teacher, objectives
for the students, a step-by-step procedure section for the class, and
suggested follow-up activities.

During the summer of 1976, the Summer Ecology Program was
expanded and restructured to emphasize community-centered learn-
ing. For the first time, the Program was conducted in eight different
locations instead of the Center’s research facility. This new approach
helped familiarize children with the human and natural ecologies
of their own communities.

The Work/Learn Program in Environmental Studies, initiated in
the fall of 1975, is a cooperative education program that provides
college students with the opportunity to live and work in a research

Science / 77
setting. Each participant receives a small stipend, plus living accom-
modations and may arrange to receive academic credit for work
completed at the Center.

Seventeen students were selected to participate in the Program
during the first year. They worked with csces’s professional staff
on projects in estuarine and terrestrial ecology, land-use manage-
ment, and environmental education.

Another major objective of the Education Program is to convey
the Center’s scientific research findings to management agencies
and the general public. Recently, public groups have been especially
interested in obtaining information on the extent of nonpoint source
pollution from land runoff. Since nonpoint sources of pollution are
measured and evaluated in the Center’s Watershed Research Pro-
gram, special efforts were made in 1975-1976 to disseminate the
Center’s watershed findings to the public.

In June 1975, the Center began publishing Rhode River Review,
a newsletter which summarized on-going cBcEs research projects and
activities on a bimonthly basis. Each issue covers major develop-
ments in the science and education programs and describes staff
activities. Feature articles are also included on csces’s research find-
ings and Bay-wide environmental issues. The newsletter has proved
to be a major means of communication with the surrounding com-
munity and other regional, state, and national organizations.

Under a grant from the Edward John Noble Foundation, the
Center provided support in the form of staff time and expertise to
citizen organizations throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. Sup-
port activities for these groups included organizing workshops and
conferences, developing technical information on environmental
issues, and helping achieve citizen participation in land- and water-
quality planning.

In January 1976, ceces planned and organized a major conference
on Water Quality Goals for the Chesapeake Bay. Existing water-
quality conditions in the Bay were described and governmental
officials outlined federal and state programs that deal with water-
quality problems in this region. The role of the citizen in achieving
water-quality goals was also explored.

In 1976, cBces acquired a 32-foot diesel work boat from the Fort
Pierce Bureau of the Smithsonian Institution in Florida.

78 / Smithsonian Year 1976
Fort Pierce Bureau

The Fort Pierce Bureau has continued to stress its three long-term
programs, as part of a consortium effort with the Harbor Branch
Foundation, Incorporated, to study the estuarine and marine en-
vironments along Florida’s east-central coast and adjacent con-
tinental shelf. These programs are: the Indian River Coastal Zone
Study, Life History Studies, and Submersible Exploration of the
East Florida Continental Slope. The initial purpose of these investi-
gations is to accumulate baseline information by making an inven-
tory of the aquatic biota and by assessing the environment and
sources of pollution, in order to predict natural and man-caused
changes in the Indian River lagoon and offshore continental shelf.

This past year the Bureau added five personnel to its scientific
staff; initiated a predoctoral/postdoctoral fellowship program; pro-
vided an electron-microscope facility for the Life Histories Section
for Ultrastructural Studies; and remodeled the Smithsonian’s Butler
Building to accommodate eight offices, an air-conditioned room for
the reference collection of preserved specimens, and a ventilated
area for the gross sorting of samples.

The Indian River Coastal Zone Study is investigating the eco-
logical role of the two primary production bases of the estuary,
the seagrasses with their epiphytes and the phytoplankton. During
the past year, 79,000 benthic invertebrates have been collected
quantitatively from experimental seagrass stations and analyzed for
information on community structure. Data indicate that benthic
invertebrates associated with seagrasses of the Indian River are
heavily preyed upon, and are extremely important to the overall
food web of the estuarine ecosystem. A total of 278 fish collections
have added 47 species for waters shallower than 200 meters. An
innovative drop net was developed to determine fish biomass and
densities and to compare seagrass-bed community changes with
respect to water depth. The coastal sabellariid worm reefs of the
Indian River region were found to have associated decapod and
stomatopod crustacean communities, consisting of about ninety-six
species. Grass shrimps were found to form a major component of
the seagrass and drift-algae communities.

The Life Histories Program has continued to accumulate baseline

information on the critical stages in reproduction and development
of the common species in the region, for potential utilization in
assessments of environmental stresses and modifications on popula-
tions of marine organisms. This knowledge of developmental pat-
tern is basic for evaluation of the effects of environmental factors
on marine animals, for individuals with highly vulnerable plank-
tonic larvae are predictably more susceptible to the effects of pollu-
tants than those with direct development and no planktonic stages.
Three specialized techniques were devised for the Program this
year: a quantitative sampling device for collecting sand-dwelling
sipunculans and polychaetes for population analyses; a culturing
technique to rear successfully planktonic sipunculan larvae, through
metamorphosis to adulthood; and a procedure for preparing one-
micron-thick serial sections of larvae and embryos embedded in
plastic resins. Six different sipunculan larvae, representing four
genera, were reared to sexual maturity in the laboratory. One of
these, common to oceanic plankton, was reared to adulthood and
spawned gametes which developed to the second larval stage—the
first-known instance of the successful culturing of a sipunculan
larva to a gamete-producing mature adult.

The Submersible Exploration of the East Florida Continental
Shelf has continued to carry out its dual functions of reconnaissance
and contribution to the inventory bank of continental-shelf organ-
isms. Eleven of 14 proposed east-west transects, from 100 feet to
1000 feet in depth, were completed between Lake Worth and Cape
Canaveral. These transects have traversed a total of 260 kilometers
during 68 transect and local reconnaissance dives. Forty-nine lock-
out dives between 60 feet and 212 feet have collected 97 plant
species, including at least 6 new records and 2 undescribed species;
about 230 different invertebrates; and 27 fish species, of which 5
are new records. Many species of organisms were observed which
were not collected.

A unique ribbon-cutting ceremony and immediate popularity
marked the opening of the National Air and Space Museum (NaAsm),

On opening day, July 1, 1976, President Ford and Vice President
Rockefeller arrived at the west door of the Museum, where they
were greeted by Secretary S. Dillon Ripley and Museum Director
Michael Collins. The party toured the Museum and emerged onto

After the presentation of colors by the Joint Services Color Guard,
welcoming speeches were made. Referring to the Museum as “a
perfect birthday present from the American people to themselves,”
President Ford dedicated the building.

Symbolically the ribbon for the opening ceremony was bright red,
white, and blue, and stretched between the jaws of a replica Viking
spacecraft soil-sampling mechanism similar to one that was to dig
on the surface of Mars a few weeks later. The taut ribbon awaited
not a snip of the scissors but a signal from the Viking spacecraft
approaching Mars.

After an 18-minute journey of more than 200 million miles, the
signal from Mars arrived at the Museum, causing the soil-sampling

by a hot metal coil in the mechanism.

The completed Museum was then open for the first time. Visitors
came at such rates that the millionth visitor was welcomed only
twenty-five days after the door opened and the two millionth after
only seven weeks.

EXHIBITS

July 1, 1976, marked not only the opening of the Museum but also
the completion of the preparation period of the inaugural exhibition.
The effort involved appears to have been by far the largest single
museum-exhibit development program in history, encompassing
twenty-three major galleries, two presentation centers, and a num-
ber of smaller areas. Under the direction of Michael Collins, this
program was supervised by Melvin B. Zisfein, Deputy Director of
the Museum. Included in this effort were the development of basic
concepts for each gallery; the preparation of all written material
(such as all label and audiovisual scripts) needed for gallery design;
the development of conceptual and detail designs; development of
all fabrication drawings and specifications; programming and re-
cording of all presentations; preparation of all plans; and fabrica-
tion and installation of all exhibit units.

The galleries and presentation centers that were opened to the
public on July 1, 1976, occupy a floorspace of some 230,000 square
feet on two exhibit levels. The galleries are listed below:

Most of the design of these galleries was initiated in fiscal years
1974 and 1975, while most of the fabrication occurred in fiscal year
1976. All gallery concepts were developed internally; numerous out-
side firms, however, were placed under contract to perform portions
of the detail design and fabrication.

The nasm exhibits design and fabrication program was closely
managed by an internal group chaired by the Deputy Director and
representing all phases of museum operation. A comprehensive
activity-by-activity schedule was developed for each gallery and a
Coordinator was assigned to each for control of all administrative
aspects of the gallery development program. Items requiring action

Automatic Control Center System (mMaccs) was developed. Con-
tained in a climate-controlled room in the basement of the Museum,
MAccs is designed to: (1) feed audio and video programs to all gal-
leries as required; (2) provide switching logic to all exhibit units
(such as automated shows) requiring it; and (3) maintain a diag-
nostic surveillance of all exhibit areas to detect malfunctions such
as film break, delamping, loss of synchronization, overheating, etc.,
and activate a malfunction print-out and alarm when a malfunction
signal is received.

maccs is the only facility of its kind in the world. Its use has
resulted in the need for a maintenance staff approximately one-half
to one-quarter that of an equivalent museum not comparably
equipped.

All of the nasm Departments contributed to the central gallery,
Number 100, Milestones of Flight—the premier gallery in the
National Air and Space Museum. Only the most highly significant
flight vehicles in the national collection qualify for inclusion in this
gallery. Special recognition is accorded the 1903 Wright Flyer, the
first airplane capable of sustained powered, controlled, manned
flight. Also in the Gallery are such historic flight vehicles as The
Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, and
spacecraft such as the Friendship 7, Gemini 4, and Columbia, the
Apollo 11 command module that orbited the moon during the first
manned lunar exploration. Also on exhibit is a lunar rock that
visitors can examine and touch.

During 1976, the Departments of Aeronautics, Astronautics, and
Science and Technology devoted their major efforts to the comple-
tion of those galleries pertaining to the respective Department’s
specialties. Between July 1, 1975, and July 1, 1976, galleries de-
veloped from the concept and unit script stage to completion. In
addition to their normal tasks of research and writing, many
curators from the Departments were assigned the job of coordinat-
ing the efforts of the firms engaged in the design and construction
of the exhibits.

PRESENTATIONS AND EDUCATION DIVISION

Members of the Presentations and Education Division worked with
other Smithsonian employees to: (1) organize and begin an educa-
tion program; (2) equip, staff, program, and begin operation of the
Albert Einstein Spacearium; and (3) equip, staff, and put into opera-
tion a highly specialized projection theater. All of these programs
went into full operation the day the Museum opened.

The year began with twenty-three volunteers in the Education
Unit. Recruitment during the fall of 1975 multiplied this corps of
enthusiastic and capable people by a factor of ten. During the first
half of 1976, 230 recruits completed the training program. About
two-thirds of them have worked or now work as professionals in
aerospace fields. Some are pilots; others are aerospace managers,
scientists, engineers, journalists, and educators; still others are air-
traffic control workers.

Volunteers served in many ways, including assisting in offices,
library work, cataloguing, care and storage of collections, exhibit
preparation, public information, and museum teaching.

During the past year considerable progress was made in helping
handicapped visitors enjoy the Museum. A full-time coordinator of
programs for the handicapped was hired. The philosophy has been
to integrate handicapped visitors into all parts of the Museum rather
than to have special exhibits for them. Groups such as the National
Federation of the Blind, the National Association of the Physically
Handicapped, and the National Association of the Deaf have been
of great help in this effort.

Wherever possible the building has been designed or modified as
a barrier-free environment for the physically handicapped. Various
implements and materials have been and will continue to be devel-
oped for handicapped visitors. For example, mirrors with universal
clamps that will attach to any wheelchair are available for persons
who have little or no head movement. There are two teletype
machines: one for use in the Education Office for answering in-
quiries from deaf persons, the other for use in the public areas for
communicating with deaf visitors.

Blind persons may obtain copies of the nasm and Smithsonian
brochures in either braille, large print, or on cassette tape. These
sell for the same price as the regular printed editions. A building
model of the Museum, marked in braille and in print, is located in
the Lobby, and cassette tours of Museum galleries are provided to-

Science / 89
gether with a list of touchable objects. Raised-line drawings have
been produced and may be borrowed by blind visitors.

On June 1, 1976, the Smithsonian Institution received a grant of
$74,000 from the United States Office of Education to develop a set
of guidelines for establishing museum programs for handicapped
students. The nasM Education Unit directed the grant on behalf of
the Institution, with participation by the National Museum of His-
tory and Technology, the National Museum of Natural History, and
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Other research pro-
grams, including evaluation of NaAsm galleries and presentation
centers, are in the planning stages.

Volunteers have been given special training in presenting tours to
groups that include handicapped individuals. A comprehensive bib-
liography of books that are available in braille or talking-book form
has been compiled with the cooperation of the Washington, D.C.
Public Library and the Library of Congress. In addition, a growing
collection of tape-recorded material on air and space subjects is
available in the Museum library.

The Education Unit arranged and conducted a number of special
lectures. One lecture series, the Noon-Time Air and Space Forum,
consisted of fifteen lectures presented by selected authorities in
aviation and space science. This series began in September 1975 and
continued monthly through May 1976. In past years these lectures
have not been given during the summer months. This year, how-
ever, a special set of lectures, arranged with the help of the Goddard
Space Flight Center, was held twice monthly, beginning in July
1976.

On December 22, 1975, the second Annual Holiday Lecture Series
for high school students was given. The lectures, presented by three
noted space scientists, were on the theme of “The Planets” and were
supported by the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation.
During 1972 and again in 1974, two complementary series of astron-
omy lectures were co-sponsored by nasM and the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory. A third series started in the fall of 1976
was titled ‘““New Windows to the Universe.”

The Albert Einstein Spacearium

Prior to the middle of this century, various individuals and groups
began attempts to establish a major planetarium in the city of

90 / Smithsonian Year 1976
Washington. The opening of the Albert Einstein Spacearium is the
culmination of these interests.

During the fall of 1975 a Carl Zeiss Model VI planetarium instru-
ment was installed in the Spacearium. This instrument, together
with funds for automation of the Spacearium system, was a Bicen-
tennial gift from the Federal Republic of Germany to the people of
the United States. An interesting feature of the facility is a foreign
language system that will allow visitors to hear programs in French,
German, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as English.

The first Spacearium show, “Cosmic Awakening,” is a 42-minute
look at how human perception of the universe has changed over the
past two-hundred years. This multi-media show uses hundreds of
audiovisual effects, including the Zeiss projector, to illustrate the
sun, moon, planets, stars, and galaxies and mankind’s increasing
comprehension of them. The automated show is narrated by Burgess
Meredith, with music by William Penn of the Eastman School of
Music.

The Spacearium is also used for education programs that are re-
lated to Museum-guided school activities.

Even though the Spacearium opened with the rest of the Museum
on July 1, 1976, it was officially dedicated on July 15. Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt of the Federal Republic of Germany presented the
planetarium system and its control system to Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller, who received the gift for the American people. A new
composition, Sirius, written by the noted German composer Karl-
Heinz Stockhausen, was given its world premiere during the dedica-
tion ceremony. A beautiful gleaming glass sculpture, containing an
intaglio of Albert Einstein, was especially designed and fabricated
by Steuben Glass of Corning, New York, to serve as a dedicatory
plaque. It is located beside the Spacearium entrance.

The Theater

The theater at the National Air and Space Museum is one of the
world’s best equipped projection theaters. It was designed to accom-
modate an IMAx projector, one of six currently operational in the
world. This instrument projects extremely high-quality motion pic-
tures onto a screen 50 feet (five stories) high and 75 feet wide. Fac-
ing the screen are 483 seats in amphitheater arrangement. A high-
quality sound system adds the aural dimension needed to sweep

Science / 91
people into space to explore the accomplishments of flight. This
combination of equipment and giant screen helps provide Museum
visitors with the experience of flight, increasing their enjoyment and
comprehension of the Museum’s artifacts and exhibits.

The premier max film is entitled To Fly. It is a “Bicentennial view
of America through flight-oriented eyes.” This Francis Thompson,
Inc., production was custom-made for the nasM theater and was pro-
vided to the Museum as a public service by the Continental Oil
Company. The film was directed and photographed by MacGil-
livray-Freeman Films of California. It will be shown regularly dur-
ing Museum hours for at least one year.

COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT

The period from July 1, 1975, through September 30, 1976, was
characterized by an extremely high level of activity, directed at
moving specimens into the new building, erecting or hanging these,
and improving conditions at the Silver Hill storage facility.

The movement of more than 250 major air-and-space artifacts
from more than two dozen locations, some as far away as the Soviet
Union, presented an immediate scheduling problem. The problem
was compounded by the size and weight of some items (the weight
of the Orbital Work Shop, for example, exceeded 35 tons); the com-
plexity of others (some with perhaps as many as 100 major com-
ponents); and the fragility of still others (the Wright Flyer, for
example).

The modes of transportation for these items included air, rail,
barge, bus, and truck. Truck transportation was determined to be
the restricting factor, as Smithsonian trucks were limited in size
and had numerous other commitments. This problem was solved
when the United States Army at Fort Belvoir agreed to provide
trucks, tractors, cranes, and operators for the duration of the move.
The Washington, D.C.,and Maryland police readily provided per-
mits and escorts for the movement of large items.

During the entire program, in which more than 1,000 truck ship-
ments were made, more than 150 objects suspended, and numerous
artifacts positioned into difficult locations, only one accident oc-
curred, involving relatively minor (and easily repairable) damage to
one artifact and no injury to personnel. This accident had a
useful side result. Despite the contractor’s primary responsibility, all

92 / Smithsonian Year 1976
future lifts were reviewed by a team chaired by the Deputy Director.
As a result, even so complex a task as bringing in the 70,000-pound,
23-foot-diameter Orbital Work Shop (ows) and assembling it to its
full 52-foot height, was accomplished safely.

When the restoration effort at the Preservation, Restoration, and
Storage Division at Silver Hill, Maryland, approached completion,
as much support as possible was directed to the Museum opening.

An evaluation was made of the facility, and a long-range annual
program of restoration of four aircraft and preservation of twenty
others was determined to be the most useful to the Museum in
terms of future exhibit requirements and the management of the
collection.

The microfilming of engine materials and biographical materials
is almost complete. The project was much more time-consuming
than originally envisioned. The space saved by this effort will
amount to more than forty-five file-drawer cases. Additional plans
are underway to use microfilm to reduce storage space further.

As a result of the various attempts to improve warehousing, and
indirectly as a result of model requirements for the new Museum,
NASM’s model collection was inventoried and reviewed for expansion
and deletion.

DHE LIBRARY

The National Air and Space Museum Library staff began the move
to the new building on July 14, 1975. The collection of over 22,000
books, 4,600 bound periodicals, and one million documents was
shelved and filed. The Library opened its new quarters to the re-
search staff and public one month later in August. When the con-
solidation of materials from two warehouses and the Arts and
Industries nasm collection was made, significant collections were
documented. Over 1,000 motion pictures and 800 audio tapes were
also moved from a warehouse to the new library.

Special collections include the William A. M. Burden collection of
early ballooning books, Russian and German rocketry works, and
scarce aeronautica; also, the Bella Landauer aeronautical sheet
music collection and her unique collection of children’s books. A
valuable 1912 edition of Hike and the Aeroplane by Tom Graham,
the pseudonym for Sinclair Lewis, was discovered in the children’s
collection.

The Ramsey Room houses rare and scarce aeronautica and astro-
nautica. Included are the aeronautical manuscripts of Samuel Pier-
pont Langley, James Means, Hiram Maxim, Otto Lilienthal, Octave
Chanute, Stephen M. Balzer, the correspondence of Professor
Jerome C. Hunsaker, designer of the airship Shenandoah, and the
scrapbooks of Captain ““Eddie”” Rickenbacker.

The Ramsey Room furnishings are the gift of Juanita Gabriella
Ramsey (1892-1966), who visualized this room as a memorial to her
husband and to all persons associated with the science and art of
flight. Admiral De Witt Clinton Ramsey (1888-1961) was one of
the first naval aviators and holder of the Navy Cross. At one end of
the room are portraits of Admiral and Mrs. Ramsey. The painting
of the admiral is by the late Thomas E. Stephens; that of Mrs.
Ramsey is by Gabriella Koszorus. At the other end of the room are
three bronze medallion plaques representative of three forms of
manned flight: aerostation (balloons and dirigibles), aviation (all
heavier-than-air craft), and astronautics (space flight).

94 / Smithsonian Year 1976
OFFICE OF THE CURATOR OF ART

During fiscal year 1976, the following projects were undertaken by
the Office of the Curator of Art:

Richard Lippold and Charles O. Perry were commissioned to pro-
duce two major sculptures, which, by opening day, were installed
outside the entrances to the National Air and Space Museum.

Richard Lippold’s Ad Astra, a 100-foot golden spire penetrating a
cluster of silver stars, stands on the sidewalk at the Mall entrance to
the Museum. Charles O. Perry’s 16-foot-diameter black bronze
Continuum is at the Independence Avenue entrance.

Artists Robert T. McCall and Eric Sloane were asked to decorate
2,100-square-foot walls in the Independence Avenue Lobby of the
National Air and Space Museum. Mr. McCall painted The Space
Mural: A Cosmic View and Mr. Sloane did The Earth Flight En-
vironment. Because progress went so well on these murals, they
became an important factor in the decision to preview the Inde-
pendence Lobby area to the public beginning on February 2, 1976.

At the same time, the Office of the Curator of Art commissioned
two other mural projects: one by Keith Ferris in the World War II
gallery, depicting a number of B-17 bombers on a raid over Ger-
many, and the other by Eric Sloane in the General Aviation Gallery,
showing a cross section of weather conditions when warm and cold
fronts meet.

For the first time, the National Air and Space Museum art col-
lection was brought together from three storage areas to a perma-
nent storage facility within the new Museum. Many of the artworks
not on display in the public exhibition areas are either displayed in
administrative areas within the Museum or installed upon racks in
the new storage rooms.

During fiscal year 1976, about 600 new pieces of art, mostly
transferred from the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion collection, were accessioned and catalogued.

An art gallery was designed and built during this period, and an
inaugural exhibition of 119 pieces of art by 64 artists was opened to
the public. Most of the work shown was transferred to the National
Air and Space Museum collection from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Also represented in the exhibition was
work from the United States Air Force, Department of the Army,
and many private lenders and donors. The Metropolitan Museum

Science / 95
of Art lent Richard Lippold’s Variations Within a Sphere: The Sun,
Doris Bry lent Georgia O’Keefe’s Blue A, and Stuart M. Speiser lent
from his collection a number of photo-realist works of aerospace
subjects.

CENTER FOR EARTH AND PLANETARY STUDIES

Personnel of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies participated
in the creation of the lunar sample display in the “Apollo to the
Moon” exhibit. Center personnel were also responsible for the
acquisition of one lunar sample that visitors can touch. This particu-
lar display has proven very popular with Nas visitors.

Plans were initiated for a new exhibit to deal with space science.
The nature of the subject will necessitate the continuous updating
of the exhibit as new knowledge is acquired. Since there will be few
artifacts to be displayed in such an exhibit, the available space will
be used to impart scientific knowledge to Museum visitors.

The Center for Earth and Planetary Studies played an important
role in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp). The Research Director
of the Center, Dr. Farouk El-Baz, was Principal Investigator for the
“Earth Observations and Photography Experiment” on this mission.
The objectives of the experiment were for the astronauts to make
visual observations from orbit and to obtain photographs of specific
Earth features, processes, and phenomena. The experiment was
highly successful. A description of performed tasks and acquired
data was published in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Preliminary
Science Report.

The southeastern Mare Serenitatis area of the Moon has been
mapped at a scale of 1:250,000. Data sources included Apollo pho-
tographs, analyses of samples from the Apollo 17 site, and results
of Apollo orbital geochemical and geophysical sensors. Using struc-
tural relationships within this relatively well-studied area of the
Moon, it is possible to deduce age relations of other lunar basins
and thus further explain their geologic history. The resulting
sequences of tectonic events are also applicable to studies of major
basins on Mars and Mercury.

Cooperation has continued with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration on the lunar mapping program. The Center
Director attended meetings of the Lunar Photographic and Carto-

96 / Smithsonian Year 1976
graphic Committee to choose sites for future lunar mapping in
accordance with the scientific community’s needs, interests, and
priorities. Nomenclature data for fourteen new maps at 1:250,000
scale and three large-scale maps (1:50,000 scale or larger) were sup-
plied to the Defense Mapping Agency Topographic Center where
the maps are produced. These maps are used in both regional lunar
studies and detailed investigations of particular surface features of
interest to scientists from several disciplines.

A computer program was devised for the lunar nomenclature file
which greatly enhances the Center’s capacity to do statistical work
and to retrieve information. The computerized file will be expanded
by the addition of scientific details relating to the size, character-
istics, and significance of named lunar features. The file will be
used by the Advisory Committee on Extraterrestrial Features of the
U.S. Department of Interior’s Board of Geographic Names. This
committee hopes to establish a system of nomenclature that would
be applicable to features of all planetary surfaces in the solar
system.

The photographic library of the Center for Earth and Planetary
Studies has expanded. New acquisitions include Earth photographs
from Gemini 3-12, Apollo 6-17, and Apollo-Soyuz: a total of 8,494
new frames. Microfiche catalogues of available imagery of Mars and
Mercury will be used to select the best photographs of these planets
for acquisition. The photographs will be used in ongoing research
in comparative planetology.

National Museum of Natural History

The Bicentennial year saw major improvements and enlargement of
the interior of the National Museum of Natural History (NMNu) in
an effort to make the public’s visit to the Museum more rewarding.
Improved permanent exhibits were created and a variety of new
service conveniences were offered, including dining facilities, an
escalator, larger lounge areas, centralized restrooms, orientation
aids, and classrooms.

“Our Changing Land,” the Museum’s Bicentennial exhibit,
opened in November 1975. It focuses on the history of land use in

Science / 97
the Potomac River Valley. The changes of landscape in this region
are representative of what happened to many North American areas

after they were settled by man and transformed from virginland to
farmland and ultimately to urban centers. It will become a perma-
nent ecology hall. Other permanent exhibits that opened in late
1975 and 1976 as part of the Museum’s long-range exhibits-renewal
program are: “South America: Continent and Culture,” showing the
distinctive environments and resources of four South American
regions and the different ways in which cultures have adapted to
them during the prehistoric, colonial, and modern eras; ““The Moon:
Its Rocks and History,” a large display of moon rocks that tells
what scientists have learned from the rocks about the first one-half
billion years of planetary evolution; and the “Insect Zoo,” the first
such installation in the United States, in which a visitor can view
the life-styles of a large array of live insects and their arthropod

relatives and discover why insects are the most successful animals
on earth.

With its heavy commitment of space to exhibits, research labo-
ratories, and collections storage, the Museum in the past was never
able to find the room for a restaurant and several other sorely
needed public services. But in 1975-1976 an imaginative solution
to this problem was worked out by fitting a three-level service
building within the Museum’s west courtyard. Originally an air and
light shaft, the courtyard had become an anachronism in an age of
air conditioning and fluorescent lighting, serving only as a site for
a small tin storage shed. The new service building constructed in
the cleared courtyard adds 45,000 square feet of floor space to
the Museum. On the top level, with access from the Museum’s
rotunda area, a skylit public dining area for 400 persons and a
lounge area are situated next to a shop that specializes in books
and items related to natural history. Restrooms are conveniently
accessible one flight down on the middle level. Late in 1976 a
Naturalist’s Center is scheduled to open on the middle level, de-
signed for amateur naturalists who are interested in handling

greenhouse. (Photo credit: Victor Krantz)

and studying natural history specimens. This facility will be oper-
ated by the Museum’s Office of Education. On the ground level is
a school-tour staging area that includes a conference room and
four classrooms—also useful to the Office of Education—and sep-
arate employee and Smithsonian Associates dining areas.

In addition to services offered in the west courtyard building, the
record crowds of visitors to the Museum during the latter half of
the Bicentennial year enjoyed a number of other new accommoda-
tions. At the Constitution Avenue entrance to the Museum, a
spacious lounge area with comfortable sofas and soft rugs opened
for foot-weary visitors. Those eager to see the exhibits had a new
escalator to take them directly from the ground-floor Bicentennial
exhibit hall up to the second-floor rotunda area. There they obtained
orientation maps keyed to large colored banners hanging at the
entrances of exhibit halls around the rotunda. The banners identify
the contents of the halls and add a note of gaiety and warmth to
the rotunda’s grey granite facade. These improvements are part of
a new program designed to insure that visitors find their way
through the Museum without becoming lost or confused. New direc-

100 / Smithsonian Year 1976
tional signs and map stands have been placed at strategic points to

assist in this effort.
A rooftop greenhouse, serving as a research resource for the

Museum’s botanists, and a two-story Osteo-Preparation Laboratory
have been erected in the east courtyard. The Osteo-Preparation
Laboratory provides space for the dissection and preparation of bird
and mammal research specimens, especially marine mammals, which
the Museum is gathering in large numbers from its marine mammal
beach salvage program. Another service to scientists set up at the
Museum in 1975-1976 is the Scientific Event Alert Network (sEAN).
SEAN is a worldwide communications system, administered by
the Museum’s Director and a scientific review board, which alerts
scientists throughout the world of geophysical, biological, astro-
nomical, and anthropological events, from meteorite falls and vol-
canic eruptions to whale strandings and archeological finds.

One of the highlights of 1975-1976 at the Museum was the visit
of Emperor Hirohito of Japan. The Emperor, who is a marine
biologist, visited the Department of Invertebrate Zoology, where
he spent over an hour in the privacy of a laboratory studying
hydroid and mollusk specimens with the assistance of staff curators
Dr. Frederick M. Bayer and Dr. Joseph Rosewater.

DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

What kinds of animals and plants can one find on an undisturbed
Caribbean coral reef? How do they interact with each other? What
effects do changes in light, temperature, and wave action have on
these organisms? How do populations change with time and increas-
ing influence of man? What is the reef’s energy budget, and how
much organic matter (carbon) and how many nutrients does it
exchange with the surrounding sea?

At Carrie-Bow Cay, a tiny island that stands on the barrier reef
extending along the coast of Belize (British Honduras), NMNH
marine biologists, geologists, botanists, and paleontologists have
undertaken a long-term ecological investigation that they hope will
shed increased light on these questions.

The Investigation of Marine Shallow Water Ecosystems project
(IMsWE) is coordinated by nmnn’s Dr. Klaus Ruetzler. He and the
other scientists chose Carrie-Bow Cay as their study site because of

ratory is the study site for the Investigation of Marine Shallow Water Ecosys-
tems project. Below. Diver photographs underwater reef life at Carrie-Bow
Cay. Right. Dr. Klaus Ruetzler, coordinator of the project, studies biological

features that make it an ideal reef laboratory. Perhaps the most
important of these features is the compactness of the reef, which
slopes off sharply into deep water, making it convenient for the
scientists to monitor its different habitat zones. Two other ideal
characteristics are its accessibility from the mainland by charter
boat and the presence of several buildings that can be used by the
scientists as lodgings and laboratory space. Finally, and no less

importantly, the reef is not marred by pollution or other manmade
disturbances.

In addition to carefully mapping and photographing the reef,
much of the early study has been devoted to an inventory and
description of the reef’s inhabitants. Samples of life have been
systematically sampled from the various marine habitats off
Carrie-Bow Cay and logged and distributed to specialists for iden-
tification. Quite a few of the scientists participating in the pro-
gram have made frequent scuba-diving descents into the reef and
lagoon waters to do their own collecting, which they prefer because
they can make underwater observations that give them clues as to
how the organisms they are interested in relate to the total reef
ecosystem. Among this group are Dr. Ruetzler, who has inventoried
the reef’s sponges; Dr. Thomas Waller, who is interested in Carrie-

Science / 103
Sea urchin collected by Museum Director Porter Kier at Carrie-Bow Cay.

Bow Cay’s bivalves, particularly the scallops; Dr. Porter Kier, who
has collected over twenty different kinds of echinoids in the
island’s lagoon and reef bottom; Dr. Ian Macintyre, who is studying
the reef’s coral rocks; and Dr. James Norris, who is investigating
Carrie-Bow Cay’s marine flora. Kjell Sandved, the Museum’s bio-
logical motion picture producer, documented all of this underwater
work.

Many of the specimen collections made at Carrie-Bow Cay are
now the basis for further studies. Dr. Ruetzler, for example, has
been making electron microscope examinations of the blue-green
algae within the cellular system of sponges, a study that illuminates
the symbiotic process whereby an animal gets nutritious photo-
synthetic products from plants. Dr. Norris is submitting his speci-
mens of algae and seaweed to colleagues for chemical analysis in
order to discover what alkaloid compounds these plants contain
that protect them from fish and other plant grazers.

Considerable research has been directed at the processes that
contribute to the construction and destruction of the reef frame-

104 / Smithsonian Year 1976
work—research that is giving scientists a better idea of how much
energy the Carrie-Bow Cay reef ecosystem expends in carbonate
production and breakdown. Dr. Ian Macintyre has headed this part
of the project. One of his successful experiments provides a new
means of determining the rates of growth of reef corals. At regular
intervals, plastic bags are placed over coral head and a red dye
released inside, staining the exposed coral. Eventually the coral is
collected, sectioned, and radiographed. The result is a picture that
perfectly preserves the history of the coral, making visible dye
bands that can be read like tree rings and enabling Dr. Macintyre
to see how a species of coral grows in relationship to its environ-
ment. Transplantation experiments of dyed corals suggest that at
Carrie-Bow Cay light is the critical factor in determining coral form
and growth. A coral can grow in a vertical column at depths where
there is little light (below 50 feet), whereas in shallow areas where
there is high light intensity the same species will show little vertical
growth but significant hemispherical growth.

Other experiments by Dr. Macintyre are planned or are in
progress. He and his colleague Dr. Walter Adey have drilled into
the Carrie-Bow Cay reef substructure in initial attempts to recon-
struct the historic development of the ecosystem. In another ongoing
project, different types of coral plates, one-half to one-inch thick,
have been spiked into the reef floor at different depths. Over a
period of years these plates are expected to yield information on
what types of boring organisms attack different corals and at what
rate. Screened traps on upright plastic pipes record sediment ac-
cumulation rates and biological data. In several cases a rare mollusk
invaded a trap in its larval, free-swimming stage and established
itself in the sediment, allowing Dr. Thomas Waller to make obser-
vations of its growth.

Dr. Mary Rice is engaged in an intensive study of sipunculan
worms that form burrows in dead reef coral and weaken its struc-
ture. Her investigation seeks to determine what are the diversity
and density of worms in the rock; if there are some types of rock
into which they bore more readily than others; and how they do the
boring, a process that is poorly understood because the worms do

DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
Archeology

In 1972, Robert B. Jones was bulldozing irrigation ditches in a field
on his ranch near Wray, Colorado, when he turned up a quantity
of bones and stone points. Jones called in Jack Miller, a Colorado
anthropologist, who examined the site and identified several hun-
dred bison bones and a large number of PaleoIndian stone and bone
tools. This discovery set in motion a chain of events that led to a
full-scale National Geographic Society-funded excavation directed
by the National Museum of Natural History’s Dr. Dennis Stanford,
an archeologist who heads a program that is trying to throw light
on the settlement patterns of early man as he moved from the Bering
Straits to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America.

The Stanford party’s dig at the Jones-Miller site revealed the bone
remains of nearly 300 big-horned bison (the extinct Bison
Antiquus), spread over a 30-meter-long by 20-meter-wide area. The
bison evidently had been killed and butchered some 10,000 years
ago by a band of 40 to 50 PaleoIndians. The bones had been tossed
systematically into piles, suggesting that the bison were quartered
and that groups of persons were organized and given specialized
responsibilities for preparing meat cuts from different sections of
the dead animals. Hundreds of stone and bone cutting and chopping
tools were found at the site, as well as stone projectile points. The
source of the stone has been traced to Plains areas in Wyoming,
Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, and the Texas panhandle, raising the
question whether the stone came there through the union of several
bands at the site, through one band’s roving travels, or through
regional trade.

Whatever its source, the evidence shows that one or more groups
of PaleoIndians evidently spent the winter in this area of north-
eastern Colorado and, on several occasions when they needed meat,
banded together to corral and kill bison at the Jones-Miller draw.

National Museum of Natural History, directed the excavation, which revealed
evidence of the presence of one or more groups of PaleoIndians. (Photo credit:

In the scenario Dr. Stanford has reconstructed, the draw was filled
with windblown snow. The hunters herded a group of bison into the
draw’s snowdrifts and as the bison floundered around, dispatched
them from the edge of the draw with hand-launched spears. Then
the bison were butchered on the site, with the snow acting as a
freezing agent to keep the meat fresh until the job was completed.

Many observers of the nineteenth-century Northern Plains In-
dians reported the use of a similar winter buffalo-hunting strategy
and also noted that these hunts were highly ritualized occasions. In
the center of the impoundment, a “medicine post” was set up and
offerings were placed around it for a successful kill. Outside the im-
poundment, the hunt chief held a religious ceremony for several
days before the hunt, burning incense on smudge fires.

At the Jones-Miller site Dr. Stanford uncovered intriguing evi-
dence that these same rituals were practiced by the Plains Paleo-

Science / 107
Indians. A large post mold was found in the center of the draw.
So shallowly was the post emplaced that it probably was not meant
to serve any purpose in the butchering operation. Near the post
mold a flutelike drilled bone and an extremely tiny but complete
projectile point were dug up, both of which could have had a
ceremonial purpose. West of the bone bed, a hearth area was found
that contained red and yellow ochre, both associated with cere-
monial activities.

The many similarities of the Jones-Miller hunt to the historical
plains hunts have interesting implications. They suggest the
existence of at least 10,000 years of socioreligious continuity on the
northern plains, which would alter our theoretical concepts of the
development of Plains Indian culture and the complexity of
PaleoIndian society. According to Dr. Stanford: “It is the first
PaleoIndian physical evidence we have ever uncovered that gives
evidence of a high level of social organization. Early bison kills like
this were generally assumed to be fortuitous happenings, but we can
see from what happened at the Jones-Miller site that it was actually
a highly complex, ritualized and planned event.”

Ethnology

Dr. Samuel Johnson labored for six years over his famous dictionary
and now Dr. Robert Laughlin, a cultural anthropologist at the
National Museum of Natural History, after an even longer lexico-
graphic effort, has had his The Great Tzotzil Dictionary of San
Lorenzo Zinacantan published by the Smithsonian Institution Press.

When he started the project fourteen years ago, Dr. Laughlin
recalls that he was rashly confident he could swiftly complete it. He
quotes in his dictionary’s introduction a letter he wrote to his
secretary in those sanguine days:

“An extensive dictionary of the Mayan language, Tzotzil, spoken
today by 78,000 Indians of the State of Chiapas—has not been com-
piled since the 18th century. In 1960 a vocabulary of 2,000 items of
the dialet of Zinacantan was collected by Lore M. Colby. I have
expanded the vocabulary to 4,000 items. It is hoped that this mate-
rial will be ready for publication in a year’s time.”

He was wrong. The book was not ready for press until 1973 and
in that interval, Dr. Laughlin noted ruefully, the population of the
78,000 Tzotzil Indians had grown with “fearful exuberance” to

108 / Smithsonian Year 1976
125,000; the vocabulary of 4,000 items had mushroomed to more
than 45,000; and he had undergone searing tribulations in the pro-
cess of having the dictionary programmed into a computer. He be-
lieves it to be the largest dictionary ever published of a Western
Hemisphere language.

Dr. Laughlin began his study of the Zinacantec language in 1959.
That year, he was invited as a Harvard postgraduate student to join
Dr. Evon Vogt’s Chiapas Project. He soon succeeded in learning
the language and set about documenting Zinacantec folktales and
myths. Completing a dissertation on this subject, and taking a job
at the Smithsonian, he returned to Zinacantan, and after a year
decided to undertake the task of compiling an extensive dictionary
for the Chiapas project’s use.

Most of the raw data for the dictionary was compiled between
1963-1967 with the help of two highly intelligent and articulate
young Tzotzil collaborators, Romin Teratol and Anselmo Peres.
Dr. Laughlin spent many months interviewing them in Zinacantan.
He also brought them to the United States—to Santa Fe, New
Mexico, and to his home in Alexandria, Virginia—where Tzotzil
definitions were added for “such foreign elements as chaise lounges,
which were promptly dubbed in Tzotzil ‘foot watchers.’ ” Identifica-
tion of stars was made in visits to the Hayden Planetarium, and
insects and larger animals not seen in Zinacantan were named dur-
ing trips to United States museums and zoos.

Dr. Laughlin’s collaborators become increasingly foot-weary as
month after month was spent walking along trails through the
mountainous Zinacantan region. The dictionary has five maps,
showing the 1,000 place names that the collaborators pinpointed
with the aid of aerial photographs and ground surveys. Ornitholo-
gist Alexander Skutch went into the field and helped make sight
identifications of scores of birds, and Dennis Breedlove, an authority
on Chiapas flora, advised in the collection of more than 3,000 local
plants. This part of the project was so successful that Dr. Laughlin
began to worry that plants were going to engulf the whole
dictionary.

As published, the dictionary is 598 pages long. The heaviness of
the tome makes a mockery of the conventional wisdom that “primi-
tives speak ‘primitive’ languages,” Dr. Laughlin believes. For him
the language has genius. Its musical cadences and complex phraseol-

Science / 109
ogy brilliantly lend themselves to the formal discourse, gossip, and
spinning of tales that are the heart of Zinacantan life.

DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY

Squash, gourds, and pumpkins (Curcurbita plants) are native to the
Western Hemisphere, where they evolved in close association with
bees that are especially adapted to pollinate them. But when these
plants were introduced into other parts of the world, squash bees
were left behind, so that less effective honeybees, native wild
bees, or man himself, had to do the pollinating. These methods of
pollination have never worked very well, and crops of Curcurbita
plants cultivated in areas without squash bees have a poor yield.

NMNH entomologist Dr. Paul Hurd is attempting to restore this
perfect and age-old squash-plant-and-insect partnership in Hawaii,
an island where squashes exist but no squash bees. If Dr. Hurd’s
experiment is successful, he feels that it may possibly be repeated
throughout the world, dramatically increasing the production of one
of man’s important food sources.

One of the first things Dr. Hurd and his two collaborators, Dr.
E. Gorton Linsley and A. E. Michelbacher, had to determine was
which species of squash bee would be best to export to Hawaii.
After studying the distribution, ecology, and behavior of the
twenty-one species of squash bees ranging throughout Mexico and
North America, they selected the species P. pruinosa because of its
efficiency as a pollinator of almost all domestic Curcurbita plants
and its proven ability to survive in a wide variety of climatic and
topographical conditions.

They chose California’s Sacramento Valley as a region to collect
bees for their experiment. Deep rich soil makes the Sacramento
Valley a center for the growing of pumpkins for the canning in-
dustry; a great deal of commercial and home planting of summer
and fall squashes is done there, too. This abundance of pumpkins is
directly related to the large populations of P. pruinosa bees that live
in the area.

One of the flat, grassy, well-watered areas where the squash bees
make their burrows was located, and behavioral observations were
made that determined that the bees were leaving their nests for
the fields shortly after 5 a.m. It was apparent that they had become
adapted to flying at early morning temperatures and at low light-

110 / Smithsonian Year 1976
intensities so that they could synchronize their foraging with the
limited time in the morning that the pumpkin flowers are open.

Before the heat of the day wilts and closes the flowers and other
insects arrive, the P. pruinosa bees are able to get the pollen and
nectar they need from the flower and at the same time pollinate
them. The plants have adaptive features that encourage pollination,
including heavy, large, and adhesive pollen grains; an adhesive
stigma; a large amount of sugar-rich nectar produced by both
staminate and pistillate flowers; and large showy blossoms.

Once the scientists discovered the daily rhythm of activity of the
squash bees, they were able to choose the best time to collect the
bees for their introduction experiments. Females, they decided, are
best moved immediately after their emergence from the pupate
stage in early June, before nest construction has begun.

They checked on this and other critical factors by conducting
a number of trial introductions. Batches of Sacramento bees were
collected in the fields and released the next day, 250 miles away,
near squash plantings close to the Davis and Berkeley campuses of
the University of California.

A method of transporting the bees had to be developed for the
trial introductions. Still in the flowers, the bees were placed in
plastic bags that were put in thermos jugs or ice chests with a
cardboard liner to protect them from direct contact with the ice
or ice water. Usually some bees died during the trips, but most of
them were ready to resume full activity on being released. Before
letting them go, the three scientists marked the bees with colored
acrylic paint so that later they could identify them on the plants.

Feeling that the trial introductions had worked out well enough
to warrant going ahead with the Hawaii experiment, the three
scientists enlisted the cooperation of the Hawaii and the California
Agricultural Experiment Stations, and Dr. Toshiyuki Nishida and
his associates of the Department of Entomology of the University of
Hawaii. Dr. Nishida made local arrangements, including the locating
of pumpkin plantings where the bees could be released.

Dr. Hurd and Mr. Michelbacher then flew a batch of captive bees
to Hawaii and released them at designated sites in Hawaii and on
the neighboring island of Oahu. These sites are now being moni-
tored to see if breeding populations of squash bees will succeed in
permanently establishing themselves.

DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL SCIENCES

Dr. Kurt Fredriksson is completing a decade of studies of the only
major meteorite crater on earth that is directly comparable to
lunar impact craters.

Lonar crater, in the Bulana District of Maharashtra, India, is a
rimmed circular depression in basaltic rock, 1,830 meters across and
nearly 150 meters deep, with a shallow lake in the center. For
many years it was commonly believed to be volcanic, despite the
glass fragments that had been found on the rim of the crater—
evidence of a meteoritic origin—and despite the crater’s close re-
semblance in structure and size to Arizona’s Meteor Crater.

In 1964, the Geological Survey of India carried out magnetic,
gravity, and seismic surveys at the site, but the surveyors did not
uncover sufficient evidence to prove the impact hypothesis. No
magnetic anomalies of significance were discovered, and studies of
lake water and soils and plants from in and around the crater
did not reveal any appreciable concentration of nickel or cobalt, two
elements that are present in enriched quantities in most meteorites.

Unsatisfied with the scope of this investigation, Dr. Fredriksson,
an authority on meteorites, suggested further tests. He knew that
if Lonar was indeed a meteoritic crater, its situation in basaltic rock,
which is similar to many lunar basalts, would give it singular sig-
nificance. No other basaltic impact craters are known on earth,
and samples of the Lonar crater would be of great value for com-
parison with samples brought back from the moon by the Apollo
missions.

The India Geological Survey concurred with Dr. Fredriksson
about the importance of establishing the impact origin of the Lonar
structure. In cooperation with the Smithsonian, the Survey began a
comprehensive exploration program, including geologic mapping,
drilling, trenching, and geochemical studies. The work began in
1970 and although not yet completely finished, it has established
beyond a doubt that the Lonar crater was produced by a meteorite
that hit the earth’s surface perhaps less than 50,000 years ago
(carbon-14 dating indicates an age of more than 30,000 years).

“At Lonar we can make a detailed study of debris ejected from a
relatively recent basaltic impact point, including a mapping of its
fall-out distribution,” Dr. Fredriksson said. “This is valuable be-
cause it is not feasible to do this with moon craters. On the moon’s

surface we are left with a record of a period of intense meteoritic
activity that took place during the formation of the solar system 4
to 4.5 billion years ago. During this time when one crater was
formed, additional meteorites would hit directly on top of it, mixing
and agglomerating the debris, and in doing so creating a very
complex and confusing history. This continuing bombardment,
which now takes place at a much lower rate, formed the moon’s
characteristic breccia rocks (breccia rock consists of mixed frag-
ments embedded in a fine-grained matrix).

“Indeed, for hundreds of millions of years such impacts may
have been the dominant geological process on the earth, moon, and
other bodies of the solar system. In order to appreciate the magni-
tude of the forces involved, consider the fact that a kilometer-sized
meteoritic body traveling at 20 kilometers per second packs an
energy perhaps 10 times greater than the energy released in the
explosion of volcanoes during each year on earth.”

In the India Geological Survey’s investigation, fifty-five trenches
one to three meters in depth were excavated in the main crater rim
flank, reaching out in concentric patterns as far as twice the dis-
tance of the crater radii. No volcanic ejecta was found, but in six
trenches, spherules and fragments of black glassy material were
found that are characteristic of intensely shocked basalt.

To explore the main crater, six holes more than 300 meters deep
were bored into the lake bottom. The cores that were brought up
had 100 meters of lake sediment that contained small amounts of
impact glass and shocked rock fragments. Below the sediment

Science / 113
strata, the drilling returned cores of coarse breccia, either unshocked
or slightly shocked. Beneath this layer of coarse breccia, all drilling
encountered a layer composed of unconsolidated to extremely
friable microbreccia.

Dr. Fredriksson and his colleagues from the Department of
Mineral Sciences, Joseph A. Nelen and Dr. Robert F. Fudali, and
Dr. Daniel Milton of the United States Geological Survey, working
in collaboration with Ananda Dube of the Division of Petrology of
the India Geological Survey, analyzed the constitution of Lonar
basalts, breccias, and glass ejecta, with an electron microprobe and
compared them with stony meteorites and lunar materials. This
work was supported mainly by the Smithsonian Foreign Currency
Program and the Smithsonian Research Foundation.

The analysis showed close structural and textural similarities
among meteorites, Lonar, and lunar material. These data, combined
with the mapping of the crater stratigraphy and impact fall-out,
are expected to aid in the interpretation of questions about the
source and depth at which lunar ejecta originated; how unfirm and
how extensive this ejecta blanket is, and what role secondary
cratering plays in the shaping of the moon’s surface.

DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY

Dr. Beryl B. Simpson is completing work on an International Bio-
logical Program (1Br) comparative ecosystem study examining the
generally held theory that similar communities can evolve in two
widely separated areas with comparable rainfall, temperature, soil,
and other conditions.

One theory holds that a high level of evolutionary convergence
of form and process occurs in similar environments, and IBP sup-
ported several programs that tried to produce ecosystem models on
this assumption. But Dr. Simpson and her collaborators decided to
test the theory of community convergence before accepting it as a
basis for construction of models that would influence important
policies of land use, management, and conservation.

Because a comparison of complex ecosystems would be an over-
whelming task, they chose to study two relatively simple pairs of
desert scrub ecosystems with very similar climates and geological
histories. One of these comparisons was between the Sonoran
Desert near Tucson, Arizona, and the Monte Desert, near Andalaga,

Argentina. At these sites, Dr. Simpson investigated the similarity of
plant-pollinator relationships and the breeding systems of the domi-
nant perennial plants.

The thirteen dominant plant species were singled out in each of
the desert areas (dominance was based on numbers and ground
coverage). Dr. Simpson then set out to determine how the polli-
nators interact with the plants; how much energy these plants
apportion to nectar and flower production in order to attract pol-
linators; and how many pollinators are supported by the plant
community. To this end she collected data on floral structure and
odor, blooming schedules, amounts of flower and nectar production,
sugar concentrations of the nectar, amounts of pollen produced,
and daily cycles of both nectar and pollen presentation.

The determination of which insects visited the flowers was made
in the study of a collaborating entomologist. Solitary bees are by
far the most important desert scrub pollinator. Several hundred
species were collected during the project, with more at the North
American site turning out to be specialized than at the South
American site.

Dr. Simpson observed that plants in North and South America
depend on different major pollen carriers, invest different amounts
of energy in flower production, and supply different amounts of
nectar and pollen to potential animal pollinators.

An interesting difference between the two ecosystems is their
blooming patterns. This difference appears to be the result of the
way in which rainfall is dispersed during the year. The total amount
of rain received at both sites appears to be about the same, but at
the Monte Desert site rain falls only in the summer, whereas at the
Sonoran Desert site rain falls at the end of the summer and toward
the end of the winter. As a consequence, in Argentina the dominant
plants bloom patchily for a long period during the summer, as
opposed to Arizona, where the blooming is relatively synchronous
during short blooming times in the spring and late summer.

DEPARTMENT OF PALEOBIOLOGY

Mollusks migrated into the Atlantic and Caribbean at the time
these basins opened through seafloor spreading 150 million years
ago. The evolutionary history of these animals over the next 90
million years is the focus of a study by Dr. Erle G. Kauffman.

116 / Smithsonian Year 1976
Analyzing thousands of specimens collected in widely scattered
field areas and housed in the nmnun’s collections, he has been able to
document the evolutionary response or patterns of these ecologically
sensitive organisms to major fluctuations in the global environment.

By integrating his data with radiometric age determinations from
volcanic ash falls preserved in sediments of these ocean basins, Dr.
Kauffman can also measure variations on rates of evolutionary
change. As expected, patterns and rates of evolution were found to
vary widely between different types of organisms. Predictable vari-
ances also showed up in single evolving lineages subjected to major
changes in the Earth’s environment.

But many unexpected evolutionary phenomena also emerged
from these studies: nearly simultaneous, basically catastrophic ex-
tinctions among diverse groups of organisms; periods of very rapid
radiation of new forms; and remarkably fast evolutionary rates, at
times producing a new species every 80,000 years within a single
lineage. Dr. Kauffman believes these evolutionary changes are
related to geologically cataclysmic events brought about by plate
tectonics, seafloor spreading, and continental drift, and he suggests
that this relationship clearly alters the concepts of evolution.

According to Dr. Kauffman: “Strict Darwinism holds that evolu-
tion takes place slowly, through small changes over long periods of
time, on a globe that was structurally and environmentally stable
through time. It gives no mechanism for explaining periods of rapid
evolution and massive extinction. But now we work with a different
model of the Earth’s crust and are beginning to realize that plate
tectonic movements provide logical mechanisms for biological
‘explosions’ and ‘catastrophes’ that we see reflected in the history
of fossil organisms.

“The movement of crustal plates across the Earth’s surface and
the resultant building and/or collapse of oceanic ridges and uplifts
over the 90-million-year period I am studying, caused major fluctua-
tions in the sea level and accompanying climatic changes which
were the principal controlling environmental forces on the rates and
patterns of evolution in marine mollusks.”

Essentially, the history Dr. Kauffman has documented follows
this pattern: global rise of sea level took place during times of
rapid plate movements and oceanic ridge building, flooding much of
the low continental areas of the world with shallow continental seas

Science / 117

History’s Dr. Erle G. Kauffman

and creating vast new spaces and environments that were ideal
for the habitation, spread, and diversification of marine organisms.
For mollusks, evolution proceeded at a relatively slow but increas-
ing rate during these periods; life conditions were optimal and
environmental stresses were low. Dr. Kauffman has found evolu-
tionary rates during these times that averaged only one new species
every half million years within many lineages.

The slowing and temporary cessation of plate movements resulted
in ultimate collapse of oceanic uplifts and ridges like the present
mid-Atlantic Ridge, caused global lowering of sea level, environ-
mental decline, restriction of space and resources, and ultimate
elimination of many prime marine environments for mollusks. As
a result, strong competition for food and space coupled with high
environmental stress caused extinction of many mollusks and ac-
celeration of evolutionary rates of others.

The maximum evolutionary rates recorded within molluscan
lineages during these high-stress periods were approximately one
species per 80,000 years—the most rapid rate ever documented for
marine organisms. The more abrupt the plate tectonic event and
resultant environmental events, the more dramatic the evolutionary
rates and extinctions associated with them. Superimposed upon
these patterns is a complex ecological response. Specialized and
normally exposed (swimming, surface-dwelling) marine organisms
show the earliest and/or most rapid evolutionary response to en-

vironmental stress; generalized or protected (buried) marine orga-
nisms, as well as those of brackish-to-fresh water and the intertidal
zone, show the lowest level of evolutionary response.

DEPARTMENT OF VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Ornithological research at the National Museum of Natural History
during 1975-1976 included publication of Birds of the Antarctic and
Sub-Antarctic (American Geophysical Union), by Dr. George Wat-
son, the first comprehensive field identification guide to penguins,
petrels, and other resident and vagrant birds of these areas. It is
illustrated with color plates and black-and-white drawings by Bob
Hines of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Sixty-seven
birds are described in detail, with information on reproduction,
molting, flight, habits, voice, display, food, predation, ectoparasites,
habitat, and distribution. Numerous vagrants are covered in less
detail. There is also an introduction to the Antarctic environment
and directions on how to observe seabirds. The book is the culmi-
nation of a project that began in 1963 when the National Science
Foundation approached the Smithsonian Institution about the
possibility of producing such a guide. Dr. Watson made three col-
lection trips into the Subantarctic and Antarctic areas, surveyed all
of the literature (dating back to Captain Cook) on the birds of the
area, and examined specimens in major museum collections, includ-
ing those at the Smithsonian gathered by the United States Explor-
ing Expedition of 1838-1842 and Admiral Richard Byrd’s United
States Antarctic Service Expeditions of the 1930s and 1940s. One
of the author’s aims is to standardize the nomenclature for birds of
that region, as well as suggest areas where further research is
needed. He believes that his book would also benefit tourists who
are now regularly traveling to Antarctica and previously had no
really helpful guide to the birds of that area.

Dr. Richard Zusi continued his studies of the evolution of bark
climbing in the tropical family Dendrocolaptidae. Members of this
family, such as the Buff-throated Woodcreeper (not related to
woodpeckers), feed along trunks and limbs, lifting mosses, poking
into holes, and digging into cracks of the bark with their beaks.
They support themselves with feet that are adapted for clinging and
a spine-tipped tail that bends under their weight.

Dr. Paul Slud has been working in Central America, as well as

Science / 119
in other New World Tropic areas, on a project that correlates
ecological background with bird census observations. His analysis
of this information, published as Geographic and Climatic Relation-
ships of Avifaunas with Special Reference to Comparative Distribu-
tion in the Neotropics (Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, No.
212) establishes links between the comparative distribution of birds
and prevailing environmental and climatic conditions.

Dr. Storrs Olson edited the Collected Papers in Avian Paleontol-
ogy Honoring the 90th Birthday of Alexander Wetmore, eighteen
papers by prominent avian paleontologists. Dr. Wetmore’s career
at the Smithsonian spans more than half a century. Dr. Olson also
made trips to Ilha da Trinidade (off the coast of Brazil), Hawaii, and
Japan, collecting many specimens of fossil and recent birds for his
studies of island paleofaunas and evolution of seabirds.

National Zoological Park

Out of the construction chaos of the past years, the National Zoo-
logical Park’s Master Plan now begins to be seen in reality. The
“William M. Mann Memorial Lion-Tiger Exhibit’’ was completed
and officially dedicated on May 25, 1976; the outdoor waterfowl
ponds and the crane yards around the Bird House Plaza opened
in July; and the enlargement of the Elephant House yards for the
African and Indian elephants, Indian rhinoceroses, and Nile
hippopotamuses were finished in the late fall of 1975.

Renovation started on the interiors of the Elephant House and
Bird House. Construction began on new bear dens, and on the mas-
sive job of digging out the hillside along Rock Creek for the
General Services Building.

Research and scientific projects grew steadily, and the amount of
grant money the Zoo received likewise increased. Grants to Zoo
personnel came from the National Institutes of Health, the World
Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Preservation Trust International
(formerly sare International), the Noble Foundation, and the Na-
tional Geographic Society, as well as from the Smithsonian’s
Research Foundation and Fluid Research Fund. These grants sup-
ported such diverse projects as the evaluation of anesthesia and
restraint of exotic species by monitoring blood gases and blood pH,
and the study of social communication in three South American
canids.

The Zoo began work-study programs with the Washington Tech-
nical Institute, the University of Maryland, and Cornell University.
These programs enable students to become familiar with zoo work
and to plan appropriate study for zoo careers. Participating offices
include Animal Management, Animal Health, Zoological Research,
Graphics and Exhibits, and Police and Safety.

Predoctoral and postdoctoral training has expanded also. The
veterinary internship program, which began in 1974, fulfills our
national purpose by helping other zoos improve their veterinary
staffs. The predoctoral programs in the Offices of Animal Health
and Zoological Research are yielding productive results.

The Friends of the National Zoo (Fonz) expanded their operations
this past year by taking charge of the food concessions; money from
these concessions goes into Zoo educational programs, such as the

puppet shows designed and produced by the Bob Brown Marionettes
which were performed during July and August 1976. A char-
acter named Zoodle, the star of each show, cautioned his audience
against littering as well as against feeding and harassing the
animals.

The Zoo’s new glockenspiel is the imaginative gift of the late
Dr. Ivy A. Pelzman of Washington, D.C. Its thirty-six bells, in
three octaves, were cast in The Netherlands, and the tunes may
be played either manually or electronically. Just below the clock a
fiberglass lion, bear, elephant, and giraffe move when the hour

OFFICE OF ANIMAL MANAGEMENT

Major changes are going on in the hardy hoofstock area. Several
years ago Zoo staff determined this area was being destroyed by
the large hoofed mammals. At first some of the cages were deco-
rated with plants to conceal erosion, buildings, and fences. This,
however, was not successful with animals as large as the greater
kudus and Cape buffaloes which trampled pens and hillsides. Thus,
during the past year, the kudus and Cape buffaloes were shipped
out to other zoos; in their cages now are dama gazelles and bles-
boks. In adjoining cages are red brockets from Mexico and munt-
jacs from the Far East showing New World and Old World cervids
side by side. As the smaller species allow the plants to take hold in
these enclosures, there has been a dramatic change: the animals
together with the greenery have become the focus of the exhibit.
Guy Greenwell moved to Front Royal to develop the bird incu-
bation program for the Zoo. Emphasis is on birds which have previ-
ously bred well at the Zoo, including roulrouls, Bali mynahs, vul-
turine guineafowl, and Hawaiian geese. Eggs laid at the Zoo will be
sent to Front Royal where they will be hatched and the young
raised and returned or placed in other zoos. The unit’s incubation
program was so successful in breeding Hawaiian geese in 1975 (it
raised nineteen) that the International Wild Waterfowl Association
presented the Zoo with its Annual Achievement Award. There
appears to be a bumper crop of this endangered bird in 1976 also.
The new “William M. Mann Memorial Lion-Tiger Exhibit’ con-
tains a large conference room and offices for the curatorial staff, a

Science / 123
small theater for the public, and indoor and outdoor exhibit areas
for the big cats. The keeper staff has had to learn to operate the
new mechanical systems, such as the electronic shift doors and com-
plex alarm system. Mohini, the eighteen-year-old white tigress,
returned from Chicago, along with her three white “grand” cubs
from Cincinnati. The Atlas lions arrived from Morocco in Septem-
ber 1976, as part of a long-term breeding project.

One of this year’s major accomplishments and the culmination
of a three-year project was the birth of an orangutan. This baby,
the offspring of two animals born in captivity and raised by their
own mothers, was the first second-generation captive birth of an
orangutan in the Western Hemisphere, and possibly only the second
in the world. Although the female proved to be a good mother, the
baby died later of a bacterial meningitis. It is possible, however,
that the orangutan captive-breeding program will not end when all
the animals caught in the wild die—at least not at the National Zoo.

OFFICE OF ANIMAL HEALTH

The primary function of the Office of Animal Health is to provide
the best available health care for the animal collection, whether at
Rock Creek Park or at Front Royal, Virginia. The delivery of veteri-
nary care to the Conservation and Research Center is more difficult
than in the Park due to the inability to watch closely and handle
the herd animals in their large enclosures.

In both locations, however, the ideal approach in exotic medicine
is preventive. Yearly tuberculosis tests and physical examinations
are conducted on all primates, and yearly vaccinations and physical
examinations are undergone by the carnivores, including the cats,
pandas, and canids. The quarantine facility of the hospital prevents
the introduction of any infectious agent into the existing collection.
All animals are monitored by routine fecal examinations and appro-
priate therapy is administered when parasites are found.

OFFICE OF PATHOLOGY

The Office of Pathology’s primary functions are diagnostic medi-
cine, teaching, and research. The diagnostic aspect is its paramount
mission. Routine blood tests, urinalysis, cultures, parasite examina-
tions, and a variety of other diagnostic tests are performed in the

124 / Smithsonian Year 1976
Office’s laboratories. All animals that die undergo autopsies and
are completely examined grossly and histopathologically to gain
insight into the various causes of death.

In the spring of 1976 an outbreak of versiniosis, a bacterial dis-
ease caused by Versinia pseudotuberculosis, took the lives of three
of the Zoo’s blesboks. Through the diagnostic capabilities of the
Zoo laboratories, the cause of the disease in the hoofstock was iso-
lated. A vaccine was developed from the isolated bacterial organ-
isms, and an all-out effort was made to exterminate the carrier ver-
min, which had brought the disease into the yards.

The Office began a new system of record keeping by streamlining
the flow of information concerned with pathologic diagnoses. An
1BM data-retrieval system is used; it can integrate previous material
generated in this Office. A similar retrieval system is used for the
color-slide collection, which currently contains over 3,000 slides of
pathologic and clinical conditions of zoo animals.

OFFICE OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH

During the past fifteen months, the Office of Zoological Research
not only continued previous programs and studies but added some
new ones.

The Venezuelan field project in vertebrate behavior and ecology,
coordinated by Dr. John Eisenberg, assembled valuable data
concerning distribution, abundance, reproduction, and natural his-
tory of selected species of marsupials, rodents, primates, reptiles,
and birds. The studies were conducted by Dr. Eisenberg, National
Zoo staff, and students in two quite different regions: the montane
rainforest of Guatopo National Park and the seasonally inundated
llanos on the ranch of Sr. Tomas Blohm.

In June 1976, Dr. Eugene Morton began to reintroduce on Barro
Colorado Island several avian species which had become locally
extinct. Seven song wrens and seven white-breasted wood wrens,
trapped on the mainland, were transported to Barro Colorado,
marked with bands, and released. Preliminary indications suggest
that some of the reintroduced birds have established themselves on
the island. The problem of local extinction in a biological preserve
the size of Barro Colorado is of great theoretical interest since
populations in small areas may be of extremely small size, and un-

Science / 125
predictable environmental events, over which man has no control,
may cause local extinction.

The studies of South American canid social behavior and com-
munication, conducted by Dr. Devra Kleiman at the Conservation
and Research Center, were highlighted by the birth of two litters of
crab-eating foxes. Both were reared by the mothers, and detailed
observations of development were recorded for the second litter.
At the same time, a maned wolf was born which did not survive.
The female bush dog was artificially inseminated but the attempt
failed, and a proven breeding male was sent on breeding loan
from Los Angeles.

The Zoo was saddened in October 1975, by the untimely death
of Dr. Helmut Buechner. His energy and enthusiasm successfully
launched several projects dealing with the propagation of ungulates
at the Zoo. He will be sorely missed.

CONSERVATION AND RESEARCH CENTER,

FRONT ROYAL, VIRGINIA
In the past fifteen months since the Smithsonian was given full title
to the Front Royal, Virginia, property, the Conservation and Re-
search Center as a resource for research has grown. Dr. Eugene
Morton of the Office of Zoological Research began two projects:
the first concerns the nesting habits and population dynamics of
the eastern bluebird; the second studies the movements and social
organization of the turkey vulture using radiotelemetry. Dr. Dale
Madison of McGill University in Montreal carried out a summer
investigation in 1975 of the social use of space by two species of
mice, the meadow mouse and the white-footed mouse. Dr. Christen
Wemmer and Larry Collins began a three-year study of the social
structure and behavior of the Pére David’s deer; and in the summer
of 1976 Kerry Malson initiated a one-year study of nutrition and
pasture-carrying capacity, also on the Pére David’s deer.

During the winter and spring, a muntjac facility was completed.
It consists of seven paddocks covering about 5 acres, with a central
observation tower. The yards have been planted in dogwood and
the plant growth will be allowed to proceed naturally to provide
adequate cover for the animals. The tower will allow keepers
and researchers to observe the animals without disturbing them.

The granary built in 1916 is being renovated as a commissary.

126 / Smithsonian Year 1976
One wing will be a rodent-breeding area, and the other will include
walk-in cooler and freezer, meat saw and grinder, butcher table,
food mixer, can washer, tables, and counter space. There will also
be an office, locker rooms, and a drive-through section for loading
trucks in cold weather.

The first residents of the Center in 1974 were one male and two
female scimitar-horned oryx. Today the herd numbers nine, all
of which were born in captivity, and eight either at the Rock Creek
facility or the Conservation Center. There were two births this
spring and one last December which was hand-reared. Other
births this year include seven crab-eating foxes, two zebra, and
two Pére David’s deer.

Cooperative agreements with other zoos have made the Center’s
present large breeding groups possible. The Bactrian camel herd is
jointly owned by the National Zoo and the Minnesota State
Zoological Gardens, while the New York Zoological Society pro-
vided over one-third of the Pére David’s deer. The onager herd was
established solely through the contributions of the zoos in Balti-
more, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The Lincoln Park Zoo sent
three male muntjacs to help establish breeding groups for this
species of nonrelated animals.

OFFICE OF EDUCATION-INFORMATION

The audience of the National Zoological Park is large and varied.
According to a visitor survey completed in 1976, visitors to the
National Zoo have above-average education levels and above-
average annual family incomes; they are predominantly white and
non-Spanish-speaking, and visit the Zoo as a family experience;
they also visit other zoos and natural history museums, and have a
high interest in other cultural institutions. The Zoo seeks to pro-
vide a well-balanced offering of exhibits, programs, and materials
for this audience.

Working as a team with the Office of Animal Management and
the Office of Graphics and Exhibits, numerous interpretive projects
were completed. Labels received first priority. Each label has two
parts: a standard identification label containing basic species infor-
mation, and a visual key which consists of a statement about an
aspect of biology relating to the animal exhibit with a photo or
drawing to highlight that statement. By spring 1976 all labels also

Science / 127
had been rewritten in a two-langauge format, English and Spanish.

More complex exhibits were completed for the three outdoor
alcoves in the new “William M. Mann Memorial Lion-Tiger
Exhibit.” A photo-collage and written text in each alcove deal with
a single theme—habitat, predator-prey relationships, and social
behavior. In addition, two films were produced for showing in the
small theater in this exhibit. Tiger is a live-action profile of that
endangered cat. The Big Cats and How They Came To Be is the
history of cat evolution, and was animated by Film Polski, Warsaw,
Poland, through a grant from the Smithsonian Foreign Currency
Program.

For the first time in many years, the Zoo will have a written
guide: ZOOBOOK. This pictorial essay, written by this Office and
photographed by Jan Skrentny, tells the story of the Zoo’s animals
and of the people and programs that revolve around them.
ZOOBOOK will be published in the late fall of 1976.

In addition to its ongoing dealings with the press, the information
service added two innovations. Tiger Talk, the employees news-
letter, was redesigned and is published weekly. A second develop-
ment was the three-month trial photo-caption story, mailed to 150
selected newspapers. This was well received and plans are under-
way to continue this service in 1977.

The use of the Zoo’s library increased considerably in the past
year, and a library technician was hired to provide more assistance
to users. The generous gift of Dr. Helmut Buechner’s journal col-
lection filled many gaps in journal holdings and over 200 volumes
were bound. Also this past year a good portion of library funds
was used to develop the book and journal collection at the Con-
servation and Research Center in Front Royal, Virginia.

OFFICE, OF ‘GRAPHICS AND EXHIBLES

With the Office of Education—Information, a new format for animal
identification labels was designed to present information in the
most effective manner. The labels are designed so they can be read
easily at various distances, are legible at low light levels, are
easily produced, and are flexible. The first labels in the Reptile
House in 1974 revealed some problems and additional changes were
made. Complete labeling of the Park, with the exception of the
Bird House, was finished in September 1976.

128 / Smithsonian Year 1976
A child studies the National
Zoological Park’s brochure show-
ing the various pictograms which
will direct visitors to areas of
interest.

The Zoo is attempting to provide an organized approach by which
visitors may find their way around the grounds. Graphic totems, 12
to 18 feet high, using the new animal pictographs, will be located
along the center road known as Olmsted Walk. These totems mark
the beginning and end of six trails that pass the animal exhibits.
Each trail covers a specific group of animals, such as birds or hoof-
stock, and is named for a conspicuous animal found on that trail,
such as the crowned crane or zebra. The pictograph representing
that animal will be in the largest space on the totem. The first totem
was installed at the waterfowl ponds in early August 1976. The
remaining ten will be in place by October. These six separate trails
allow the visitor to cover the entire Zoo or just one area. The totems
also include such information as the length of each walk and the
approximate time needed to complete it.

OEEIGE OF POLICE: AND:SAEFETY

During the past year the Office of Police and Safety has also under-
gone changes—keeping pace with the rest of the Zoo’s activities,
while continuing its emphasis on service and public relations.
In-service training for officers was expanded to include on-the-
job training for less experienced recruits, and has resulted in an

Science / 129
increase in applications from minority groups. In addition, the
summer work-study program with the Washington Technical Insti-
tute has turned out very well. Students in the law enforcement-
criminal justice programs were hired as police aides and used in
nonenforcement aspects of the police and safety program, such as
internal traffic and pedestrian control, and communications and
office work at the police station.

OFFICE OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

A major effort was made to prepare the Rock Creek Park facility
for the Bicentennial summer, and a number of related projects were
begun in addition to the ongoing Master Plan construction. They
included renovating the roadway leading to the Monkey House and
constructing a visitor sidewalk; building a visitor pavilion on the
site of the old Puma House; and completely renovating the Mane
Restaurant and the Panda Cafe.

Three major areas of construction under the Master Plan are the
Education-Administration Building, the bear dens, and the General
Services Building. In July 1975, construction began on the Educa-
tion-Administration Building near the Connecticut Avenue entrance.
When completed in December 1976, the building will include space
for the library, the administrative staffs of the Zoo, and the Friends
of the National Zoo, plus three classrooms and a 300-seat audi-
torium.

Construction started on bear exhibits in February 1976 involves
two areas: one for polar bears, with three amphitheaters and under-
water viewing, and the other for grizzley bears and a smaller
bear, possibly the sun bear. Completion is scheduled for January
1977.

Work on the General Services Building began in January 1976.
When the building opens in August 1977, all of the Zoo’s mainte-
nance facilities will be moved into it, thereby freeing a number of
areas around the Park for other uses. Included in this building will
be additional parking spaces. This is the largest project under the
Master Plan; the first phase is contracted at approximately six
million dollars. The second phase, four parking levels providing
spaces for 1,000 cars, is subject to future appropriation by Congress.

By the summer of 1976 all Bicentennial projects were complete,
and the center of the Park was opened to the public.

130 / Smithsonian Year 1976
OFFICE OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

The Office of Facilities Management is primarily responsible for the
upkeep of all buildings, grounds, and related mechanical systems
of the Zoo. The majority of the work consists of specific, recurring
duties which make up the preventive maintenance programs. This
year, however, additional responsibility came to the Office owing to
progression of the Master Plan. New and renovated buildings now
have multimechanical systems—sophisticated, expensive, sensitive
—which must be incorporated into the preventive maintenance
programs.

Office of International Programs

The Office of International Programs fosters and coordinates the
international aspects of Smithsonian programs and also provides
support to United States institutions of research and higher learn-
ing, including the Smithsonian, through Special Foreign Currency
Program grants. Its functions are carried out by sections designated
as the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program and the International
Liaison Section.

SMITHSONIAN FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAM

The Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program (srcp) awards grants
to support the basic research interests of American institutions, in-
cluding the Smithsonian, in those countries where the United States
holds blocked currencies derived largely from past sales of surplus
agricultural commodities under Public Law 480. The Program is
active in countries where the Treasury Department deems United
States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of normal federal
requirements, including at present India, Pakistan, Egypt, Tunisia,
and Poland. The Smithsonian has received a fiscal year 1977 ap-
propriation of $3.5 million in “excess” currencies, which will be
used to support projects in the anthropological sciences, systematic
and environmental biology, astrophysics and earth sciences, and
museum professional fields. The Smithsonian received a fiscal year
1976 appropriation of $500,000 in “excess” currencies that was
used to grant support to over sixty projects in these disciplines.

Science / 131
Since its inception in fiscal year 1966, the srcp has awarded approxi-
mately $29 million in foreign currency grants to some eighty-seven
institutions in thirty-two states and the District of Columbia.
Within the framework of the Program, the Smithsonian will make
a third contribution of $1 million in Egyptian pounds in support of
Egypt’s efforts to save the submerged temples at Philae in Nubia.

INTERNATIONAL LIAISON SECTION

The International Liaison Section (11s) provides liaison and assist-
ance to individuals and units of the Smithsonian in dealing with the
Department of State and with foreign governments. It handles
international matters involving travel and research abroad, and
foreign participation in domestic programs of the Smithsonian. 11s
provides passport and visa services for Smithsonian staff, and as-
sists in research arrangements for foreign visitors. 11s worked
closely with the Division of Performing Arts in arranging Bicen-
tennial-related participation by 814 foreign folk artists in the Festi-
val of American Folklife, and some 150 other foreigners participating
in the special Bicentennial activities of the Institution.

Radiation Biology Laboratory

The form and structure of growing plant cells are determined by the
interaction of at least two qualitatively different sets of signals. One
of these controlling sets of signals is within the cell, and the second
is external, consisting of a wide range of environmental factors such
as light, temperature, and availability of the raw materials needed
for growth.

The internal instructions can be thought of as coming from a
complex architectural blueprint, which is being followed by the
molecular processes of the cell. This genetic blueprint, however,
has a number of alternative, contingency plans that are read
only if an appropriate signal is received from the environment.
As the organism develops, it follows a basic pattern, so the species
is clearly recognizable, but superimposed on this basic pattern are
many possibie variations of development in space and time.

132 / Smithsonian Year 1976
One of the most important and dependable external signals
is sunlight. The Radiation Biology Laboratory has been studying the
growth and development of organisms for nearly fifty years. Cur-
rently, the Laboratory is emphasizing three basic areas of research:
(1) the molecular nature of the pathways regulated and controlled
by light, (2) the time dependency of developmental processes upon
periodic changes in sunlight, and (3) a quantitative description of
the time course of periodic fluctuations in environmental signals that
are important for growth.

A familiar example of the control of development by light is the
sprouting of a potato. In the dark, the shoot produced is white
and the leaves are small. If the shoot is exposed to light, the leaves
expand and develop structures within the cells, called chloroplasts,
that contain the membrane and pigments, chlorophylls (green) and
carotenoids (yellow), that are necessary for photosynthesis. The
formation of these chloroplast photosynthetic membranes and the
mechanism by which proteins are added to the membranes during
growth are being studied by electron microscopy and biochemistry.

Experiments have not yet determined whether the information for
controlling the synthesis of chloroplast membranes is within the
chloroplast itself or is in the cytoplasm of the cell. The molecular
components required for synthesizing proteins are known as
polyribosomes. Polyribosomes occur on chloroplast membranes.
These membrane-bound polyribosomes are attached to the mem-
brane by proteins, since they can be released by mild treatment with
the enzyme trypsin that breaks down protein. The released poly-
ribosomes probably do not contain remnants of membrane, since
they can be degraded by another enzyme, ribonuclease. The ribo-
nuclease attacks the information-carrying nucleic acids in the poly-
ribosomes. In contrast, treatment of membranes with the detergent
“Nonidet” releases polyribosomes that appear to be attached to
membrane remnants about the size of the polyribosome group.
Another detergent, “Triton,” solubilizes much of the membrane, but
leaves the polyribosomes attached to much larger pieces of mem-
brane. These membrane remnants are identifiable both in the elec-
tron microscope and by analysis of their protein (polypeptide) com-
position. The remnants differ in polypeptide composition from the
membrane as a whole. This observation suggests that the poly-
ribosomes lie on specialized portions of the membrane.

Science / 133
Some chloroplast membrane proteins are synthesized in the
chloroplast itself, and some are synthesized in the cytoplasm. These
proteins are then independently inserted into the chloroplast mem-
brane. Isolated chloroplast membranes can be made to synthesize
protein in vitro and the products obtained compared with products
formed in vivo. The results suggest that the in vitro system com-
pletes some membrane polypeptide chains. It is by studying such in
vitro systems that the control of membrane synthesis by the inter-
action of information from both the chloroplast and cytoplasm may
be understood.

The complexity of the chloroplast development in flowering
plants has made progress slow and difficult. Another approach being
pursued in the Laboratory is the use of algal cells. Many algae have
developed special pigment molecules that act as light-harvesting
antennae to funnel the light energy into photosynthetic membranes.
These pigments have properties which allow efficient absorption of
light in the color bands of sunlight that cannot be absorbed effi-
ciently by chlorophyll alone. Thus, light captured between the red
and blue absorbing peaks of green chlorophyll is transferred to
chlorophyll in special protein-pigment structures (phycobilisomes)
for photosynthesis. These phycobilisomes can be isolated from
membranes and their structure determined. The pigment which
finally funnels the light energy to chlorophyll is called allophyco-
cyanin, and recent data show that it is in the base of the phycobili-
some near the attachment point on the photosynthetic membrane.
Allophycocyanin in vivo is in an aggregated state, which appears to
enhance the energy transfer efficiency as seen by a fluorescence
emission in the red region of the spectrum (675 nm). This year, in
vitro shifts in absorption in purified allophycocyanin solutions have
been produced. This is the first step in attempts to reconstitute
functional phycobilisomes in vitro.

The use of such seemingly simpler single-celled biological sys-
tems has been productive. Another type of organism, the large,
multinucleate single-celled fungus, Phycomyces, has been studied
for many years. Aerial cells (sporangiophores) respond rapidly in a
number of ways to environmental stimuli. The chief advantage of
Phycomyces has been that growth responses were known to occur
localized in the same region of the cell where the environmental
signals are received, quite unlike flowering plants, which have a

134 / Smithsonian Year 1976
complex system of hormones that move from one region of the
plant to another. In the past few years, data have been published
that such hormones also may be involved in the Phycomyces sys-
tem. It was discovered in this Laboratory that continuous exposure
to high-intensity blue light will cause the sporangiophores to stop
growing by elongation and, after a period of a few hours, to initiate
a branch cell that elongates for many hours. The system also dem-
onstrates apical dominance, in that two branches sometimes are
formed, one of which exerts control and elongates, while the other
is inhibited. If the spherical sporangium, at the upper end of the
dominant branch sporangiophore, is mechanically removed, growth
is initiated in the previously inhibited branch. We have been able to
confirm this phenomenon and have observed that application of the
plant growth hormone, auxin (indoleacetic acid), in about 50 percent
of all experiments, is able to prevent branching. It appears that
high-intensity blue light selectively destroys the sensitivity of the
growing cell to hormonal materials being produced by the
sporangium, since it has not been possible to produce branches by
irradicating the sporangium alone. Each mature sporangium con-
tains about one million vegetative spores, and the active material
appears to be produced by these spores. The application of a num-
ber of auxin inhibitors and antagonists, known to interfere with
the effects of auxin or the flow of auxins in higher plants, has not
led to branch formation in Phycomyces.

Most fungal cells contain carotenoid pigments responsible for the
yellow, orange, and red colors observed. These same compounds
occur in higher plants and in animals. Some of these pigments are
the accessory pigments for photosynthesis and are also precursors
for Vitamin A synthesis. In many organisms the carotenoids have
a protective function against adverse effects of visible light, and in
addition they have other, unknown, functions.

In the orange bread mold, Neurospora crassa, blue light is re-
quired to initiate the biosynthesis of at least eight different carote-
noid pigments. From experimental data using biochemical inhibitors,
it has been proposed that one or more enzymes in the carotenoid
pathway are absent or at low levels in dark-grown Neurospora cul-
tures and that the activity of these enzymes increases following light
exposure. One way of testing this hypothesis is to examine bio-
chemically the precursors of the carotenoid pigments. Phytoene, a

Science / 135
40-carbon colorless compound, accumulates in dark-grown cultures.
The enzyme activity that catalyzes the biosynthesis of phytoene
from isopentenyl-pyrophosphate has been partially purified. Even
though phytoene can be produced by dark-grown cultures, the
activity is higher in cells which were exposed to blue light prior to
extraction. Thus, light may regulate both the biosynthesis of
phytoene, as well as its subsequent conversion to carotenoids. In
order to separate these two processes, it will be necessary to investi-
gate the regulation of each enzyme in the pathway.

Temperature changes can also regulate carotenoid production in
Neurospora. The optimum temperature for carotenoid biosynthesis
following a light exposure is 6°C. Mutants have been isolated which
have the same optimum, but carotenoid production is relatively in-
sensitive to higher temperatures. For example, at 25°C to 37°C
these mutants accumulate more pigment than the wild type strain.
The gene containing the mutation has been mapped and found to
be on the right arm of Chromosome IV.

One of the pigments involved in the regulation of green plant
development is the chromoprotein phytochrome. This pigment regu-
lates a wide variety of plant responses, from flowering, stem growth,
and seed germination to chlorophyll synthesis. Much effort has been
devoted to characterizing this pigment because of its ubiquitous and
important nature. Characterization has been hampered by two
factors. One is the low concentration of phytochrome in the plant
cell, and the second is the presence of other molecules which alter
the structure of proteins when the plant tissue is broken up for
extraction. Both of these factors have led to spurious artifacts. It
was discovered by this Laboratory recently that highly purified
phytochrome solutions previously thought to be free of significant
contaminants contained another protein that could only be separated
from phytochrome by ultracentrifugation. In addition, the struc-
tural features observed by electron microscopy and previously
ascribed to phytochrome are actually due to the presence of the
contaminating protein. These data led to a reexamination of the
phytochrome molecule. Electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal studies
confirm that phytochrome exists in solution as a dimer. Analysis
of gel filtration and ultracentrifugal data led to a description of
phytochrome as an elongated molecule, described as a cigar-shaped
structure with an axial ratio on the order of 8 to 1. The dimer dis-

136 / Smithsonian Year 1976

ee EE

sociates as the alkalinity of the solution is increased. Even under
conditions routinely used in isolating phytochrome, some dissocia-
tion occurs. Such dissociation may account for some of the con-
flicting descriptions from other laboratories of the properties of
phytochrome.

In addition, a purported photoreversible pigment system, driven
by blue and yellow light from the alga Protosiphon, was examined
because of its similarities to the photoreversible phytochrome
molecule. However, the data indicate that the isolated pigment is
probably not photoreversible by yellow light, since it reverts to the
blue-absorbing form in the dark, with nearly identical kinetics ob-
served under yellow light. The suggestion was made that the pig-
ment plastocyanin is involved in this system, but data from mu-
tants of Chlamydomonas which lack plastocyanin did not support
this hypothesis.

The phytochrome molecule acts as the receptor molecule for the
control of reproductive development. When light signals are re-
ceived from the environment, either inhibition or promotion occurs
that is dependent upon both the species of plant and the time in the
developmental cycle during which the signal is received. Normally,
the red portion of sunlight predominates during the day, with
marked increases in the far-red portion near sunrise and sunset.
Experiments conducted with a long-day plant, Wintex barley, indi-
cate that high levels of far-red light (700-800 nm), if maintained
throughout the day, significantly promote the induction of flowers,
when compared to plants grown with equally photosynthetically
active energies but without the additional far-red light.

Once flowering is induced by an appropriate light signal, internal
biochemical changes occur that are transmitted from the sensitive
leaves to the vegetative buds which become flowers. The nature of
this chemical stimulus is unknown. This material is carried in the
phloem sap. One way of obtaining sufficient phloem sap for analysis
is to take advantage of the fact that aphids feeding upon plants
insert a stylet directly into the phloem tissue. Droplets of honeydew
can be collected from the aphids feeding on plants that have been
induced to flower, and, assuming that no appreciable chemical
changes have occurred in the passage of the active material through
the aphid, it should be possible to identify the flowering stimulus.
Salicylic acid was identified in honeydew, and salicylic acid has

Science / 137
been found by this technique to induce flowering in test plants of
duckweed (Lemna gibba). Other materials known to be present are
being tested in reference to their involvement in the flowering
process. In addition, salicylic acid is being tested on a number of
plant species, including several different Lemnaceae.

Besides its regulatory effect upon growth processes, light is im-
portant for photosynthesis. The efficiency of light usage in photo-
synthesis is very low: about two percent of the incident energy
is utilized. In some regions of the world, plants are grown under
artificial lighting to produce prime horticultural and floricultural
products. The electrical energy used is mostly produced from fossil
fuels, thereby depleting a nonrenewable resource. The mode of light
used for this purpose traditionally has been continuous light.
However, work completed thirty years. ago under flashing light
conditions produced by mechanical devices indicated an increased
efficiency in the photosynthetic utilization of light. The Radiation
Biology Laboratory has recently been testing a prototypical, elec-
tronically controlled, flashing fluorescent lamp system in a con-
trolled environment for plant growth. Preliminary testing of the
light utilization in the flashing mode versus continuous application
of equal total energy indicates an increase of as much as 30 percent
in photosynthetic efficiency. Such data should also lead to a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms occurring in photo-
synthesis.

Salt marshes along the Atlantic seaboard are thought to be among
the most productive ecosystems, and it has been assumed that much
of the solar energy fixed as carbon compounds by photosynthesis
finds its way into the adjacent estuaries, where fish and shellfish
spend a part of their life cycle. In association with measurements of
the incident solar radiation, measurements have also been made of
the primary productivity of selected portions of two salt marsh
communities. One of these communities is dominated by a sedge
and the other by a mixture of two grass species. From measurements
taken at different times during the growing season, estimates were
made of the net carbon assimilated. More carbon was found to be
assimilated by these communities than could be accounted for on
the basis of measurements of the total mass of plant and animal
matter in the community. These data substantiate the notion that

138 / Smithsonian Year 1976
these salt marsh communities are supplying significant amounts of
carbon to the adjacent estuaries.

In order to make these correlations, measurements of the incident
solar radiation were needed. Such a monitoring program has been
in progress for six years by the Laboratory. The program for
measuring and monitoring the ultraviolet erythemal (sunburn) en-
ergy (285 to 320 nm in 5nm increments) content of daylight was
initiated last year. A preliminary analysis of the data indicates a
pattern for this energy at the earth’s surface at various latitudes for
the northern hemisphere. As anticipated, the amount of ultraviolet
erythemal radiation increases from the pole to the equator, with
more detectable energy at the shorter wavelengths as one moves
toward the equator. Also, the amount of ozone decreases as one
approaches the equator.

The data for these trends have been obtained from four scanning
radiometers developed and constructed by the Radiation Biology
Laboratory. Ozone calculations from the ultraviolet measurements
at the Panama station indicate very little variation in ozone thick-
ness seasonally, while measurements from the other stations indi-
cate more seasonal variations for higher latitudes.

There have been other phenomena observed in the data. Besides
an increasing variability in daily ozone measurements with increas-
ing latitude, there is the appearance of a cycle in the ozone data at
three sites simultaneously. This cycle appears to be of about 27 to
30 days and occurs in data from November 1975 to June 1976. More
data will be needed to ascertain the existence of this observed
cyclical event.

The data collected on the spectral quality of daylight are being
analyzed for long-term trends and variability at various locations.
The analysis has begun using one year of data from three locations:
(1) Barrow, Alaska (71°N), (2) Rockville, Maryland (39°N), and
(3) Panama Canal Zone (9°N). The analysis was performed using
the daily amounts of irradiance in each of the 100-nanometer (nm)-
wide spectral bands from 400 nm to 800 nm, the total irradiance
(300 nm—2800 nm), and the infrared region from 800 nm to 2800
nm. The data were collected using precision Eppley pyranometers
and automated acquisition systems.

The analysis of the 1974 data clearly showed that the determi-

Sites at Barrow, Alaska, (above) and Panama (below) show the different en-
vironments to which delicate and complicated instruments are exposed in the
Smithsonian’s Radiation Biology Laboratory studies.

140 / Smithsonian Year 1976
nation of the available solar energy and the spectral quality of that
energy can only be obtained from direct measurements if data
better than +25 percent are required. Also, it may be quite impos-
sible to predict long-term trends without measurements taken over
many years. Such things as spectral quality changes, and losses in
energy such as those found at Washington, D.C., and Mount Saint
Katherine, Egypt, cannot be predicted with only five or six years’
data.

Another fact clearly shown in the analysis is that there are not
only major differences in the spectral quality of daylight from place
to place, but large variations in the spectral distribution can occur
at any one location, especially around sunrise and sunset.

For the 1974 data, the average daily amount of solar energy
reaching the surface of the earth, compared to that available daily
at the top of the atmosphere, is approximately 40 percent at Barrow,
Alaska (71°N) and about 53 percent at the Pacific entrance to the
Panama Canal (9°N). The variations in these values are relatively
large: from 5 percent to 65 percent at Barrow, 30 percent to 50
percent at Rockville, and 48 percent to 60 percent in Panama,
where the atmosphere is generally clear.

If data from a longer period of time are used—for example the
data from Rockville for seven years—then different mean values
for the year will be obtained. For Rockville, an average value of
46 percent of the solar energy available at the top of the atmosphere
falling on the earth’s surface is obtained, with a variation in the
average of only 41 percent—51 percent. The measured values of the
average energy available for over three quarters of the time range
from 5 percent to 75 percent. Therefore, it is apparent that the use
of calculated rather than measured values of solar radiation in solar
energy applications must be done with great care.

In photosynthesis, radioactive ‘carbon naturally occurring in
the atmospheric carbon dioxide is assimilated. This '*C decays with
time and can be used to determine the age of once-living materials.
Using this technique in collaboration with the Institution staff and
in cooperative research with some twenty other institutions and
universities, the relationships are being investigated between chang-
ing environments and changing cultures, and research is being done
on the early human occupation of the Americas. Of necessity, this
requires more than the straightforward construction of chronolo-

Science / 141
gies, for research must be carried out in all the fields of archeology,
geology, sedimentology, pollen analysis, sea-level changes, etc., in
order to understand why peoples move, why cultures change.

Current reversal in the Mediterranean Basin 10,000 years ago,
first noted through sediment studies at the Strait of Gibraltar, has
been confirmed by similar studies at the Strait of Sicily and the
underwater cone of the Nile Delta. The entire Basin was subjected
to drastic environmental change, and the concomitant change in
human culture must have been equally great. The documentation
of a succession of rapid climatic changes in Labrador and along the
coast of northeastern North America has been keyed to successive
movements and occupations by Eskimo and Indian groups, and the
continued dating of pollen cores throughout the area will provide
confirmatory evidence of geomorphological and ecological events
and parameters.

Continued excavations at Meadowcroft Rockshelter in western
Pennsylvania have revealed some very early levels of occupation.
Two samples, one of charcoal and the other of a simple bark textile,
recovered in the 1975 excavations, have been dated and are esti-
mated to be about 19,000 years old.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Astronomy was once concerned only with observing and charting
the positions and motions of the planets and stars. Joy and satis-
faction came from seeing the beauty and symmetry of these distant
celestial bodies. The sense of wonder basic to astronomy naturally
evolved into a desire to understand the physical composition of
these celestial objects. Thus developed the science of astrophysics:
the application of the prinicples of physics to the study of the
stars, and, in particular at the Smithsonian Institution, the sun.

At the turn of the century, the basic tools of astrophysics were
optical telescopes and spectrographs. Following World War II,
astrophysics expanded to include radio observations of stars,
planets, and galaxies. Now the concept of astrophysics has broad-
ened again. The stars are no longer considered static entities, but
rather dynamic bodies that change and evolve—being born, matur-

142 / Smithsonian Year 1976
ing, aging, and dying much like living organisms. Thanks to the
space program, modern astronomers can now observe radiation
across the entire electromagnetic spectrum—from radio waves that
are meters long to gamma rays, trillions of times shorter. During
the past two decades, with each new wavelength revealing new
insights on the complex nature of the universe, astrophysics has
become an especially challenging and exciting branch of science.

To theoretical astrophysicists, the future of this science seems
exciting indeed. Astronomers have discovered quasars, pulsars, cos-
mic masers, X-ray sources, and black holes. But even more exciting
is the prospect of studying these mysterious objects with the radio,
optical, infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray techniques that first re-
vealed them. Some clues have already been discovered. For ex-
ample, the quasars seem to have points of similarity with the X-ray
sources discovered by satellite experiments, in which a spinning
disk of matter is thought to be swallowed slowly by a black hole.
The quasars appear to be a similar phenomenon on a much larger
scale. To generate the tremendous energy of quasars, the black
holes within them would have to weigh as much as 100 million suns.

Each of these discoveries, fascinating in itself, contributes to our
understanding of the processes by which the universe has expanded,
galaxies have been formed, and stars have evolved over the past 15
billion years. Dying stars apparently eject new chemical elements
into space, in which they are available for forming new stars and
planets—some of them with life. The intellectual synthesis describ-
ing this process might be called “Cosmic Evolution,” with an
impact rivaling that of the Darwinian theory of biological evolution.
This synthesis may account for all the structures in the universe,
from quasars to planets.

Particularly exciting is the prospect for future study of the pro-
cesses that connect cosmic evolution with the evolution of life. If
life originated from nonliving matter early in the history of the
solar system, according to the laws of physics and chemistry, then
perhaps some day we can predict which stars have life, and even
which stars have intelligent life with which we might communicate.

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (sao) is participat-
ing fully in the exploration of the frontiers of astrophysics. Only a
large, multidisciplinary organization can muster the scientific capa-
bility and technical expertise necessary to exploit and utilize the full

Science / 143
range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma rays.
Accordingly, in 1973, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
and the Harvard College Observatory were joined, under a single di-
rector, as the Center for Astrophysics, in order to pursue excellence
in astrophysical research by developing the potential of both organi-
zations. Today, with over 140 scientists and 500 staff members, in
Cambridge and at field stations around the world, the Center repre-
sents the nation’s largest observatory.

The research of the Center is organized by divisions representing
major fields of study; and, as the following summaries show, the
Center is making important scientific progress.

HIGH ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS DIVISION

One of the most exciting discoveries in the field of astronomy dur-
ing the past year was the detection of giant bursts of X-ray emission
from the centers of globular clusters of stars. The first and largest
of these extraordinary X-ray sources was found by scientists at the
Center for Astrophysics working with data taken by an experiment
aboard the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite (ans). The sudden
burst of energy, comparable to the 30-fold brightening of an optical
object, was seen from a cluster in the constellation Sagittarius. Sub-
sequently, at least another dozen of these so-called “X-ray bursters”
were identified by Center scientists and a team from the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, with the latter group using data
from the Small Astronomy Satellite (sas-3).

The bursts of X-ray radiation are thought to be associated with
giant black holes weighing the equivalent of several hundred suns,
which may represent an intermediate stage between stellar black
holes and the quasi-stellar black holes with a mass 100 million
times that of the sun.

An X-ray experiment using a two-dimensional low-resolution
mirror and imaging system was flown aboard a rocket. In addition to
observations of extragalactic X-ray sources, the experiment ob-
tained the data that produced the first X-ray map of the Perseus
cluster of galaxies, showing both extended emission regions and the
galaxy NGc 1275. That gallaxy is the most intense source of X-ray
emission discovered.

Work continued on the experiments scheduled for flight aboard
the upcoming National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Range December 1975 produced this image of X-ray emissions from the Per-
seus cluster, an ensemble of some 1,000 galaxies located about 300 million
light years from earth. The image shows a broad area of diffuse X-ray emis-
sion estimated as several million light years in diameter. Intense emission is
seen from the Seyfert galaxy NGc 1275 at the center of the cluster, indicating
that the object is perhaps the most powerful X-ray source known, some mil-
lion times more luminous than the sum of all the X-ray sources in our own
galaxy. Right. Photographic image of X-ray data returned by sas-3 satellite

thus allowing searches for optical counterparts of X-ray emission objects. (sao

(nasa) series of High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO) satel-
lites, the first of which is planned for late 1977. A major effort has
been devoted to construction of the cosmic X-ray telescope aboard
the HEAO-B, due to fly in 1978. This telescope will be capable of de-
tecting tens of thousands of X-ray sources, some more distant than
the most distant galaxies now seen from ground-based telescopes.

Experiments proposed by the division have also been selected
for flight on the Hea Transient Explorer satellite and the Soft X-ray
and euv Explorer satellite.

The all-sky survey of high-energy gamma-ray sources using a
10-meter reflector at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, neared completion
after an intense observation campaign during the past year.

GEOASTRONOMY DIVISION

Two major satellite experiments conceived and designed by Division
members culminated with successful launches in the spring.

Science / 145
Lageos, an extremely dense, mechanically and electrically inert,
passive satellite fitted with retroreflectors was launched by nasa on
May 4, 1976. The satellite, which has an orbital lifetime estimated in
millions of years, will serve as a stable reference for ground-based
laser tracking stations, including those of the Smithsonian, thus
providing data on crustal movements, polar motion, and variations
in the rotation of the earth.

At an altitude of 5,900 km and with a magnitude of 13, the
Lageos satellite was thought too faint to be photographed by the
network’s Baker-Nunn camera; indeed, it was expected that 60 days
would be needed for initial observations. Yet the Baker-Nunn
camera on the island of Maui, Hawaii, photographed the satellite on
its first orbit, just 90 minutes after launch, and other network
cameras photographed the object shortly thereafter. Using the
camera data to improve pointing predictions, the Mount Hopkins,
Arizona, laser obtained returns within 3 days after launch. Lasers
in Peru and Brazil were successful as well, and routine tracking of
this geodetic reference point, including daytime observations, began
nearly 2 months ahead of schedule.

During the next four years, geophysicists hope to obtain range
data (laser-to-satellite distance) accurate to 10 cm, with the dis-
tances between the ground stations measured to comparable ac-
curacies. By the 1980s, this accuracy is expected to be 2 cm, or about
the distance that Europe and North America are suspected of drift-
ing apart annually.

On June 18, 1976, a Smithsonian-designed and -built hydrogen
maser clock, so accurate that it loses only 1 second in 10 million
years, was launched by nasa on a 2-hour suborbital flight to test
the equivalence principle, a cornerstone of Einstein’s theory of gen-
eral relativity. In the test, time aboard the spacecraft was measured
against a duplicate ground-based clock to an accuracy of 1 part in
10'*. According to Einstein’s theory, the space clock should run
faster once free of the earth’s gravitational field.

The payload reached an altitude of 10,000 km with a flight time
of 1"56™. The probe maser functioned properly throughout the
flight, as did the ground-based equipment. Initial analysis of the
data, considered some 100 times more accurate than any previous
ground-based experiments, indicates Einstein’s theory is correct.

In support of research in geodesy, geophysics, and the upper at-

Hopkins, Arizona, is part of the

range data from the Lageos satellite.

mosphere, satellite-tracking operations were conducted in close
cooperation with nasa, the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, and
the Institut fiir Angewandte Geodasie. As coordinator of all interna-
tional laser networks, sao provided orbital elements, scheduling,
and general operational support for all the overseas lasers partici-
pating in the campaign to track the Geos 3 satellite. Laser data were
also acquired on a number of other retroreflector satellites for use
in the development of the gravity-field and geodetic models of the
earth.

An analytical theory for determining the nongravitational effects
of solar radiation pressure, albedo pressure, and infrared pressure
on artificial satellites, was developed for the first time.

A complex theory for ocean tides was devised that incorporates
existing theories on perturbations due to the sun and the moon, as
well as those due to the earth’s solid body tides caused by the sun
and the moon. The new theory includes ocean tidal loading on the
solid earth.

Ionospheric data collected by the doppler-tracking experiment on
the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astr) of 1975 were reduced. This
experiment was designed to detect large concentrations of mass
in the earth beneath the satellites. Work this year was devoted to
removing propagation errors from raw measurements of the relative
velocity between the Apollo spacecraft and the aster docking
module, with the resulting data to be inverted into gravity-field
anomalies. These data also represent valuable horizontal sounding
samples of the ionosphere at the 220-km orbital height.

SOLAR AND STELLAR PHYSICS DIVISION

The primary research of this Division continues to focus on the
study of the sun as a star, with related programs designed to under-
stand similar physical processes observed in other stars.

Basic to this research has been the continued analysis of solar
data obtained by Harvard experiments aboard the Skylab satellite
during the 1973-1974 flight. These data, in the form of thousands
of photographs, were taken by two different instruments—one
sensitive to ultraviolet emissions, the other to X-rays—and they are
being analyzed by two different groups within the Division.

The analyses have resulted in detailed numerical models describ-
ing the physical mechanisms for energy flow in the sun’s corona and

148 / Smithsonian Year 1976

the acceleration of solar wind. It has been found that the solar wind,
which strikes the earth, is controlled by a magnetic field deep within
the body of the sun.

This discovery has major implications for understanding physical
processes and motions below the solar surface. Moreover, this dis-
covery may allow earth-bound investigators to predict periods of
solar-wind activity through observations of changes in the sun’s
surface features.

An excellent example of Harvard-Smithsonian collaboration in
scientific endeavor is the establishment of the Langley-Abbot pro-
gram of solar research. Funded by the Institution and using Harvard
satellite data, the program will attempt to integrate current theory
and observation of solar processes with historical studies of solar
variability in a critical assessment of the interrelationship between
solar and terrestrial phenomena, particularly long-term climatic
change.

During the past year, activities in the Langley-Abbot program in-
cluded analysis of possible solar “constant” variations from the
original Abbot data and more modern Mariner and Nimbus space-
craft data; measurement of the differential rotation of solar
magnetic fields and the photosphere; theoretical analyses of the
implications of such data and related observations on the solar cycle
and long-term solar variability; data analysis and theoretical studies
of the interaction of solar plasma and magnetic fields in active
regions; prominences and flares; and the continuing analytic studies
of long-term terrestrial climatic variation and its possible relation to
solar activity.

RADIO ASTRONOMY DIVISION

Harvard-Smithsonian collaboration in radio astronomy has been
active for many years in a cooperative program designed to detect
and measure the very faint radio signals emitted by molecules in
interstellar space.

The list of newly discovered interstellar molecules grows every
day, with scientific interest and anticipation mounting as more and
more complex organic molecules are found in the space between the
stars. For example, in the past year, Division scientists detected in-
terstellar nitrogen sulphide. Although no one expects to find living
organisms in space, there is hope that molecules of biological inter-

Science / 149
est will be discovered, thus providing a step toward understanding
the origin of life on earth.

The Division also began a program that applies the techniques of
ground-based millimeter-wave radio astronomy to the problem of
measuring the photochemical ozone balance in the earth’s atmos-
phere. Scientists measured H:O and O; in the earth’s mesophere and
developed mathematical models for determining the altitude distri-
butions of the two substances. The design and construction of a
millimeter-wave atmospheric spectrometer for this program were
completed, and a method of predicting the millimeter-wave spectra
of heavy organic molecules was developed to support this program.

Using the Harvard radio astronomy facility at Fort Davis, Texas,
Center scientists participated in an expanded collaborative program
of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (viB1) with a number of
other radio astronomy institutions. The visi technique utilizes
several widely separated radio antennas to observe celestial sources
of radio emission. This technique has the effect of extending the
“size” of the radio receivers to a diameter of hundreds, or even
thousands, of miles. The difference in arrival time of received radio
signals at the various ground stations provides highly accurate an-
gular resolution. The initial studies of this ambitious program con-
centrated on radio galaxies, quasars, and oH masers, including, in
one case, an unprecedented eight-station experiment to map quasars
at the 18-cm wavelength. An extremely precise hydrogen maser
clock, built by the same team that prepared the clock for space flight
in the gravity probe experiment, was developed for use in the radio
project.

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS DIVISION

By combining Harvard laboratory facilities with Smithsonian theo-
retical research support, programs in the Division are influenced
and inspired by the diverse activities and needs of astrophysics. The
goal is to provide the basic parameters of atomic and molecular
physics required to understand physical processes and thus to aid
in the interpretation of observational data obtained by other Center
groups.

Theoretical studies in the field of atomic structure and processes
concentrated on the application of model potential methods for the
accurate calculation of properties of complex atoms, and the de-

150 / Smithsonian Year 1976
velopment of a relativistic generalization of the random phase
approximation for studying the properties of highly stripped atomic
species.

In the field of molecular structure and processes, progress has
been made in large scale ab initio calculations of potential energy
curves, methods for including electronic continuum functions in
molecular calculations, and the use of model potential and random
phase approximation methods in molecular physics.

Atomic and molecular data have been used in theoretical studies
of the thermosphere of the earth, for comparison with the in situ
measurements obtained by the nasa Atmospheric Explorer Satellite
system, in order to obtain a quantitative understanding of the
physical and chemical processes. The absorption of solar Euv radia-
tion and photoelectrons in the atmosphere and the photochemical
equilibrium in concentrations have been calculated. Using the satel-
lite observations, information on the O» concentration, the total
ionization rate due to the solar ultraviolet flux, and the thermal
budget of the ionosphere can be obtained. Some preliminary studies
of the upper atmosphere of Jupiter and Mars have been carried out.

PLANETARY SCIENCES DIVISION

The Planetary Sciences Division is somewhat unusual in that con-
siderably more attention is given to the smaller bodies of the solar
system than to the larger ones. This emphasis has recently received
a unique form of recognition: the asteroids numbered 1877, 1880,
1881, 1913, and 1940 have been named Marsden, McCrosky, Shao,
Sekanina, and Whipple, respectively, in honor of the scientific con-
tributions of these Center staff members. An astrometric program
at Harvard’s Agassiz station has contributed to the awarding of
those honors; more than 500 positions of faint asteroids and comets
have been measured, leading to the assignment of permanent num-
bers to thirteen minor planets. Much of this activity has been made
possible through the development of a program to reduce the uncer-
tainties in comet and asteroid orbits and to reconcile apparently
conflicting observations.

Several members of the Division maintain an active interest in
comets. Investigations of comet orbit clustering have led to the con-
clusion that there is less evidence than previously thought for the
reality of comet pairs. Work continued on the process of comet

Science / 151
splitting, particularly on the possibility that a very large number
of new comets would be deflected into the inner solar system where
the large release of cometary gases could have formed a secondary
solar nebula early in the history of the solar system. Photometric
studies on the properties of cometary tails continued, with a con-
centration on predicted observability of ‘‘antitails.’” These predic-
tions have been verified by a number of recent observations and
give interesting physical information about cometary particles in the
millimeter-to-centimeter size range. Studies of nongravitational
forces affecting cometary projectories also continued.

In meteor research, the Prairie Network observing stations have
been closed, but analysis of network observations continues. A co-
operative program with groups in Albany and Ottawa has been
conducted to measure the spectra of faint meteors from ground and
aircraft. These groups have had some successful runs with observa-
tions of meteor showers and are beginning the reduction of the
data. This program is expected to continue for two more years.

Work relating to the outer planets included research on the prop-
erties of Saturn’s rings, particularly the structure of the gaps in the
rings, which are associated with satellite resonances. Ring-particle
scattering apparently plays an important role in widening these
gaps, and the current estimate of ring particle size is of the order of
a meter. The ephemerides of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, as
well as knowledge about their diameters, have been improved
through analysis of their mutual occultations. In cooperation with
the California Institute of Technology, efforts are being made to
discover new faint satellites of Jupiter.

A strong program of research on lunar and meteorite samples
has been maintained by Division members who have also organized
two consortia to coordinate research in lunar geology. One of these,
the Consortium Indomitable, worked on the analysis of samples
from a large lunar boulder; the other, new consortium, the Con-
sortium Imbrium, has been formed to study ejecta from the Imbrium
basin. In addition, the analysis of solar-wind gases trapped in the
lunar materials has placed a meaningful upper limit on the amount
of tritium in the solar wind and has allowed a positive identification
of carbon 14.

Members of the Division are also engaged in a variety of theo-
retical programs. An investigation of the theory of Cassini states

Comet West, one of the brightest comets of the twentieth century, was visible
to North American observers in early 1976. This 47-minute exposure was

has predicted that the lunar spin axis points to within a few degrees
of the earth-moon system, and further predicts that the earth-spin
axis will undergo wild gyrations about two billion years in the
future. Similar studies are being applied to Venus. A new theory
was developed to account for the large eccentricity of Mercury’s
orbit, which involves passing the planet through two resonances
with Venus and requires that a certain limit exist on the spin-down
time of the sun. Evolutionary sequences of models of the primitive
solar nebula were constructed, with each treating the nebula as a
viscous accretion disk. According to the theoretical studies, the solar
nebula should have become repeatedly unstable against global
gravitational instabilities, and an investigation of the properties of
the giant gaseous proto-planets that would result from such insta-
bilities has begun. Also studied was a collision theory of lunar
formation, in which a large collision in the late stages of formation
of the earth inefficiently places vaporized and condensed rocky
material in earth orbit, from which the moon can collect by gravi-
tational instabilities.

OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY DIVISION

The research of the Optical and Infrared Astronomy Division may
be divided according to the areas and objects of interest and accord-
ing to facilities and instrumentation.

In the former scheme of division, a major interest is extragalactic
work. The spectra of active galaxies that emit large amounts of
energy in the infrared, such as the Seyfert galaxy NGc 1068, were
studied by means of both a 1-m balloon-borne telescope and a
ground-based instrument at the Kitt Peak National Observatory
fitted with a circular variable filter. The data show complexity in
the spectrum, including line emission, which indicated that no
single simple model can explain the infrared emission.

The optical variability of several quasi-stellar or BL-Lacertae
objects was studied. The observations revealed large variations, the
peaks of which show very great luminosities of these objects at
cosmological distances.

Two techniques are being used to search for halos of faint red
stars around galaxies, which could represent large amounts of mass.
An essentially negative measurement was made of NGc 4565, an
edge-on spiral, by use of a silicon vidicon camera. Additional studies

154 / Smithsonian Year 1976
will continue with the ccp camera under development at the Center.
Preliminary measurements with photographic emulsions and grid
technique to get reliable low-contrast results were also made.

The problem of two- and three-body correlations for the distri-
bution of galaxies was studied. This work has shown that extensive,
careful red-shift measurements, combined with positional data, can
be of great cosmological interest when compared with theory.

Work on the interstellar medium includes study of H 1 regions at
both near- and far-infrared wavelengths, again utilizing data from
both balloon- and ground-based observations. Mapping of the Orion
and w3 regions, and near-infrared measurements of various regions,
will aid in the understanding of how energy is distributed between
gas and dust.

A large proportion of the research on stars is centered on the use
of optical observations in conjunction with X-ray data to study the
properties of highly condensed objects interacting with normal
companions in binary systems. An identification of these com-
panions and studies of their variability were made, both on short-
and long-time scales. In the latter case, the studies were made pos-
sible by the archival photographs in the Harvard plate collection.
Intensive studies were made of the centers of globular clusters
which emit X-ray bursts in a search for optical clues to this unusual
phenomenon. A study of abundances in Sirius has been conducted
to see whether mass transfer between it and its companion could
have affected nucleosynthesis in this system. Ultraviolet studies of
X-ray sources will be made with the rve satellite.

In planetary research, a definitive determination of the tempera-
ture of Uranus was made with the balloon instrument calibrated
by means of the model for the time-dependent effective temperature
of Mars.

In terms of observing facilities, the Division’s activities were
many and varied. A duplicate version of the Mount Hopkins echelle

Station in Massachusetts, and will be supplemented with an electro-

vailing nonphotometric conditions. A novel fast spectrograph is
being constructed to permit lower-resolution observations of fainter
objects.

As of July 1, 1976, the Smithsonian discontinued its participation

in the operation of the Boyden Observatory in South Africa because
the remoteness of the station made research there costly and ineffec-
tive. New locations are being considered for Harvard’s Southern
Hemisphere Damon patrol cameras that have been at Boyden.

The major commitment in observing facilities is at Mount Hop-
kins, Arizona, where the installation of the Multiple Mirror Tele-
scope has begun, in collaboration with the University of Arizona.
The Mount Hopkins complex now operates on a reliable commercial
power line from the valley, and improvements to the road and water
system continue.

The 60-inch telescope was refurbished this year, with recoating
of the primary mirror (done at Kitt Peak) and subsequent use of the
primary in testing the figure of a new secondary mirror (made by
the University of Arizona’s Optical Science Center). This light-
weight mirror is designed for infrared work and is now mounted on
an oscillating support designed and built, together with its drive, at
the Center. The improved system allows sky subtraction for infra-

red photometry, using an f/10 beam up to 2-arcmin diameter, a
unique capability among infrared telescopes.

During fiscal year 1976, the 24-inch telescope of the State Uni-
versity of New York at Stony Brook was brought into full operation
under our collaborative arrangement. Used for photometry and
spectroscopy, it is being designed to accept instruments from the
60-inch telescope.

The Multiple Mirror Telescope (mmr) Program jointly carried
out by the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory is proceeding at a satisfactory pace. The optics are
essentially complete, and the active-optics alignment system is
nearing completion, with both tasks undertaken at the University
of Arizona. The final subcontract, for actual fabrication of the opti-
cal support structure, was let in the summer; construction and
testing should be complete by February 1977. The construction of
the mat housing is proceeding nearly on schedule, under the direc-
tion of Aeronutronic-Ford Western Development Laboratories, the
prime contractor for all the structural mechanical work. The pier
and foundation are complete, and the bearing support and yoke
base have been installed by the Smithsonian. Erection of the hous-
ing and its support and drive system will take place during the
summer and early fall, allowing for the completion of the yoke
installation, under shelter, before the end of 1976. After the erec-
tion of the optical support structure, scheduled for February 1977,
installation of the optical components can begin and should be
completed during the spring of 1977. Serious testing and provisional
operation of the telescope should take place during the summer
of 1977.

THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS DIVISION

The Theoretical Astrophysics Division performs research in a wide
range of astrophysical topics, with theoretical studies often applied
to the support and interpretation of observational data. Members
of the Division frequently work in collaboration with members of
other divisions as well as with scientists in other institutions. In
addition, they contribute substantially to the educational program
of the Department of Astronomy.

The development and application of methods of quantum me-
chanics to atomic and molecular processes continued, as did studies

on the role of atomic and molecular processes in astrophysics. A
relativistic generalization of the random phase approximation was
developed and is proving to be a powerful new tool for the treat-
ment of elements of high nuclear charges.

A pulsating white dwarf model for explaining the X-ray pulsars
was devised, in which the pulsations are driven by nuclear burning
of accepted hydrogen from a binary companion.

Similarly, a model developed for the formation of oB stars in a
molecular cloud suggests that an os star can drive an ionization and
shock front into a molecular cloud, which will trigger the formation
of a second os star. The process repeats to form a chain of os stars.

Investigations were made of the possible noncosmological pro-
duction of deuterium and other light elements; of the spatial dis-
tribution of galaxies; of the propagation of acoustic waves in stellar
atmospheres, with particular application to the heating of the low
solar chromosphere; and of the radiative transfer and line formation

in sources with spherical geometry and with velocity fields.

Studies of the evolution of close binary stars indicate that in an
early phase of evolution the binaries were in contact and may have
lost a substantial amount of mass and angular momentum at that
time.

The growth of the central galaxy in a rich cluster of galaxies,
due to its accretion of other cluster galaxies, was studied. Also, a va-
riety of scenarios was developed to describe formation of a large
black hole in a globular cluster.

Studies of stellar turbulence driven by tidal distortion revealed
that tidally induced shear probably cannot cause turbulence in an
otherwise stable star.

The unified gauge theory of weak, electromagnetic, and strong
interactions was used to study neutrino-pressure supernova models.

Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc.

The Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc. (ssre) has had
another year of growth in fiscal year 1976. Not only has there been
increasing recognition of the importance of ongoing research infor-
mation as a tool for the management and planning of research, but
new approaches have been developed to make ongoing research
information in the ssieE data base more readily available.

The Exchange sought to increase the comprehensiveness and
coverage of information in its data base in a number of areas of
major importance to the national interest. Two such areas were in
the fields of cancer and energy research. New sources of input in
both these fields were forthcoming at the national and international
level, and more than 4,000 new projects were added to the system
in these two areas alone.

In the field of energy research, the Exchange prepared, under a
National Science Foundation grant, the first directory on Informa-
tion on International Research and Development Activities in the
Field of Energy, which was published by the National Science
Foundation. Because of the Exchange’s success in obtaining input
from five European countries and Canada this first year, the project
has been extended for a second year, and arrangements have been
completed for obtaining information from three new countries,

Science / 159
Sweden, Denmark, and Israel. The possibility of adding input from
other foreign countries is also being explored. A concerted effort has
been undertaken to obtain new national energy research informa-
tion from nonfederal organizations, such as the Electrical Power
Research Institute and the Petroleum Research Institute.

Through its operation of the Current Cancer Research Project
Analysis Center for the International Cancer Research Data Bank
program of the National Cancer Institute, the Exchange has in-
creased its data base of information about ongoing cancer research,
both nationally and internationally. The program is particularly
significant not only in terms of identifying research in progress
worldwide, but also in terms of the Exchange’s output products and
services, which are distributed by the National Cancer Institute
to scientists in this country and abroad. During fiscal year 1976, the
Exchange prepared eight major directories of cancer research and
some fourteen special listings of cancer research in highly specific
subject areas. Copies of the latter were made available to research
investigators worldwide whose research projects appeared in each
of the special categories. In addition, information on all research
projects in the cancer field, registered at sstE, were made available
on-line through the computer facility at the National Library of
Medicine. This program is expected to continue throughout the
coming year and become increasingly valuable as more research
information is fed into the data base.

During the year, the Exchange began preparing a quarterly
directory of ongoing research information in toxicology for the
Toxicology Information Subcommittee of the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare’s Committee of Coordinate Toxicology and
Related Programs. The directory, published quarterly by the Na-
tional Technical Information Service, will have an annual cumula-
tive index covering research projects indexed throughout the year.
The response to the project was enthusiastic and the project has
been continued for a second year.

The Exchange also continued to prepare directories for publica-
tion by various federal agencies in Water Resources Research,
Disaster Related Technology, and Dental Research.

In 1975 and 1976 the Exchange, with the support of the National
Science Foundation, began to develop a more extensive program to
identify international data sources of ongoing research information

160 / Smithsonian Year 1976
which could be of major importance and use to research planners
and managers in various scientific fields. As a part of this effort,
the first International Symposium on Information Systems and
Services in Ongoing Research in Science, sponsored by the unisIsT
program of unesco in collaboration with sste, was held in Paris in
October 1975.

The Exchange is currently preparing, in cooperation with the
UNISIST program of UNESCO, a directory of ongoing research systems
worldwide in order to further the exchange of information between
developed and developing countries. Efforts are currently underway
to identify problem areas which might develop as actual exchange
of scientific information between countries becomes a reality. As a
follow-up to the symposium, the uNIsIsT program expects to de-
velop an office for ongoing research, which will have a working
group of international experts in the field to help identify and
suggest ways to resolve problems that might develop in the ex-
change of information between countries. In addition to working
with unisist, the Exchange is currently exploring the possibility of
bilateral cooperation with several countries, including the leasing of
the sste data base, exchange of information in selected subject
areas, and development of bilingual indexing terminology to facili-
tate exchange of information.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

Many people living in temperate regions still regard the tropics as
a “green hell” of steaming jungles inhabited by all manner of fierce
and unfriendly creatures. Part of our work at the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute (str1) is to correct this notion. Our
primary concern is to support studies that will help to place the
ecological, evolutionary, and sociological processes occurring in the
tropics into a proper perspective relative to the world ecosystem.
Just as we have found that events in the temperate regions, such as
indiscriminate use of insecticides and release of radioactive at-
mospheric pollutants, produce worldwide effects, so we can expect
that destruction of tropical forests and pollution of coral reefs may

Science / 161
have profound and as yet unpredicted effects on the earth’s weather
and ocean productivity.

The tropics contain the fastest growing segments of the human
population, and the economic aspirations of this group impinge on
natural areas in ways that we have only begun to understand.

In some parts of Central America more forests may exist now
than existed before the Spanish exploration, when indigenous popu-
lations may have had greater acreage under cultivation; in other
parts of the new world, cutting of forests is proceeding at an un-
precedented rate. In tropical rain forests of the Far East, plantations
of few or single species are becoming increasingly popular. Of
course, such forests are more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and
they can only support a much-reduced fauna compared to the
mixed-species rain forest that they replace. Tropical rain forests are
great storehouses of animal and plant species, and once a species is
removed from the genetic pool, it cannot be restored.

sTRI is devoted to fundamental research on tropical organisms.
Scientists and students seek to learn why there are more kinds of
animals and plants in the tropics and how they divide the avail-
able resources. strI is engaged in a wide variety of studies; how-
ever, for purposes of this report, the focus will be on activities in
two areas: forest ecology and certain aspects of the evolution of
aquatic organisms.

By conducting fundamental research on the reproductive strate-
gies of plants, ecologists on Barro Colorado Island are also learning
how and why some species are better exploiters of new openings
that appear in tropical forests. Clearings of various sizes appear
both naturally and through human activity. Man clears forests for
farms, roads, dams, etc. Nature provides clearings through single
treefalls, storm-induced clearings, such as the 1.5 hectare openings
produced on Barro Colorado Island in 1973; or most spectacularly,
the hundreds of hectares of forest that were scoured away by the
forces of an earthquake on the Colombia-Panama border last June.

Study of recolonization under natural conditions provides the
kind of data needed to understand the processes of forest develop-
ment, succession, and persistence. A number of workers at sTRI are
looking at problems related to plant growth and success in the
tropics.

Egbert Leigh went to Malaysia to continue his comparison of

Island in Panama.

lowland and montane rain forests around the world. To see whether
transpiration (the evaporation of water through the stomates of
leaves), which brings up water by capillary traction from the roots,
plays an essential role in transporting nutrients to the tree crown,
he visited montane forests in the fog belts of Costa Rica and
Malaysia, where transpiration is much reduced. He hoped to dis-
cover whether the trees had adopted forms to increase transpira-
tion rates under those conditions.

These comparisons are part of a program instituted by Martin
Moynihan to determine how typical Barro Colorado is of the wet
tropics around the world. Analysis indicates that the ecological
organization of Barro Colorado wood and leaf production, and the
spectrum of defenses from herbivores, etc., seem very similar to
those of lowland Malaysian rain forests, as revealed by the 1p
project there.

Mycorrhizae are specialized plant organs, formed by the associa-
tion of fungi with plant roots, which absorb minerals. Almost all
plant species, including many crops, can form the vesicular-
arbuscular (va)-type mycorrhizae. The fungi of this type have
extremely broad host ranges, and are obligate root inhabitants that
neither grow nor reproduce when unassociated with host roots.

David P. Janos, a str postdoctoral fellow, is developing a model
of the interaction of va mycorrhizal fungus and plant communities.

Science / 163
Many canopy tree species are dependent on mycorrhizae for growth.
Plant species of early successional communities are less absolute in
their requirement of mycorrhizae, being adapted to greater varia-
tion in mineral and mycorrhizal fungus availability. The quantity of
mycorrhizae formed in an early successional community affects the
availability of inocula for subsequently colonizing species. A reduc-
tion of mycorrhizal fungus populations may impede return to
climax forest.

The current study at stri is concerned first with learning whether
the plant community composition reflects mineral and mycorrhizal
inoculum availability. Several successional and climax species are
being grown with different additions of mycorrhizal inocula and
mineral nutrients. The more dependent species are expected to be
incapable of growing where inocula are lacking, although this in-
capacity may be ameliorated by increased mineral availability.
Second, stri scientists are trying to determine whether the quantity
of mycorrhizae formed by the plants in a community affects sub-
sequent inoculum availability. Repetition of the previously de-
scribed experiment without further manipulation of mycorrhizal
inoculum will answer this question.

Robert Silberglied joined the biological staff in January 1976.
He holds a joint appointment with strr and with Harvard Uni-
versity as an Assistant Professor of Biology and Curator in Ento-
mology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

Silberglied is studying the function of color and pattern in insect
communication and orientation. Of particular interest to him are
the spectacular ultraviolet reflection patterns found on the wings
of certain butterflies. These patterns, visible to insects (and by
photography) but not seen by man, are characterized by some of
the most intense and spectrally pure colors found in nature. Since
different butterfly species that appear similar to us often have
radically different ultraviolet patterns, and since the sexes within
a species often differ from one another in this respect, there is
potential for an elaborate and very subtle communication system.
By changing the colors of living butterflies in behavioral experi-
ments, Dr. Silberglied is attempting to unravel the mysteries of this
language beyond the spectrum visible to man.

Dr. Gene Montgomery has also joined stri’s permanent staff.
Formerly employed by the National Zoo, Dr. Montgomery’s re-

search interests are primarily involved with the ecology of tropical
mammals and so can be more conveniently pursued at str1. An
expert on the radio-tracking of mammals, Dr. Montgomery will
continue his studies of anteaters and sloths in Panama and
Venezuela.

In an effort to further the development of a cooperative program
with the Charles Darwin Research Station in the Galapagos Islands,
Ecuador, Messrs. Rubinoff, Rand, and Borges visited there in No-
vember 1975. Discussions were held on the establishment of a ma-
rine laboratory and on the development of fellowships to encourage
students to work in the Galapagos. Two str scientists went to the
Galapagos in August to initiate marine studies. D. Ross Robertson
was interested in the problem of resource partitioning and competi-
tion between damselfishes and surgeonfishes on coral reefs. In
most coral reefs of the world, many species of both groups are
found, but in the Galapagos only one species of surgeonfish is
found as opposed to six species of damselfishes. During Mr. Robert-
son’s short trip, the patterns of spatial distribution, feeding habits,
and interaction of these fish groups with the marine iguana were
examined. The only marine lizard occurs there, and it is a herbi-
vore probably competing with the fishes for food.

From October through December 1975, Tyson Roberts conducted
a comprehensive biological survey of the fishes in the Fly River
basin, one of the largest in Papua New Guinea. A total of about
twenty-five families and eighty-five species was obtained. The fish

Science / 165
fauna of the Fly consists almost entirely of recent invaders from
the sea or those forms that have had a long history of movement
back and forth between marine and freshwater habitats.

In June a workshop met on Barro Colorado Island, to review
knowledge on when and how the Isthmus of Panama was formed
and to discuss the effects of its formation on the evolution of in-
vertebrates, especially mollusks and corals. Special attention was
given to possible parallels with major “crises” earlier in the fossil
record, such as those resulting in extinctions of ammonites,
mosasaurs, icthyosaurs, etc. Mollusks survived better on the Pacific
side, which suffered less environmental disturbance, but the corals
survived better in the Caribbean, largely because of trade-wind-
induced upwellings of deeper nutrient-laden waters in the Pacific.
Where nutrients abound, algae and barnacles smother infant corals.
Long absences of coral reefs are found in the fossil record, such as
in the early Carboniferous items when shoal waters were probably
richer in nutrients. Had this condition caused kelp beds to replace
coral reefs as they do in colder, more nutrient-rich waters today?

Drs. Moynihan and Linares left for Senegal in July 1976 for a
year of field work. Dr. Moynihan will be looking at the behavior of
squirrels and cephalopods, while Dr. Linares will be revisiting the
Diola wet rice cultivators that she studied in 1964.

A. S. Rand was awarded a grant from the National Science
Foundation’s United States—Latin American Cooperative Program
to investigate the role of malaria in the fluctuations of the popula-
tions of lizards on Barro Colorado Island. These population
changes, which do not appear to be caused by changes in food or
predator abundance, may be a function of disease. Co-investigator
in this study is Steven Ayala of the Universidad del Valle, Cali,
Colombia.

In December, the second annual report of the Environmental
Sciences Program’s Tropical Studies was published. Donald Wind-
sor was the editor. This computer-assisted compilation makes pos-
sible the convenient comparison of data from 1973 and 1974 for a
number of parameters. As subsequent volumes accumulate, more
meaningful comparisons between annual fluctuations in environ-
mental and biological variables will be possible.

The short-term fellowship program was expanded with a grant
from the Exxon Foundation. Along with continued support from

166 / Smithsonian Year 1976
the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation and the Edward John
Noble Foundation, more than fifty students from the United States,
Panama, Colombia, Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, Chile, Vene-
zuela, and Peru were provided with fellowships to begin studies
introducing them to tropical research.

Interest in tropical science is increasing, judging from the num-
ber of visitors to str1. Over 1,700 scientists and students from 39
states and 37 foreign countries, representing over 180 universities
and other institutions, took advantage of str1 marine and terrestrial
facilities in the last fifteen months.

HISTORY: AND) ART

Ir seems FITTING that the Smithsonian’s Bicentennial year should
have turned out to be fifteen months long. As the following pages
show in some detail, the history and art bureaus of the Institution
produced an array of exhibitions, publications, scholarly tools and
educational programs that could scarcely be expected to fit within
the confines of an ordinary twelve-month year. The continuing
encouragement and support of the Congress and the White House,
the extraordinary dedication of hundreds of members of the Smith-
sonian family, the cooperation of government agencies and private
institutions and individuals, and the administrative and diplomatic
skills of the Institution’s Bicentennial coordinator, Susan Hamilton,
made possible a program worthy both of the Smithsonian and of
the great occasion we celebrated.

It will be interesting for future generations to compare our Bi-
centennial celebration with the Centennial that has been so bril-
liantly recaptured in the National Museum of History and Tech-
nology’s “1876: A Centennial Exhibition” in the Arts and Industries
Building on the Mall. Perhaps our successors will see fit to do this
at the time of the Tricentennial, in an exhibition called “1976,”
which might be shown in the nostalgic setting of a carefully re-
stored National Air and Space Museum.

With the Bicentennial year drawing to a close, our museums and
research offices look forward to catching up on some of the impor-
tant work of research, collections management, and sheer mainte-
nance that has necessarily been deferred during the last few years.
But in an Institution as vital and imaginative as the Smithsonian,
that does not mean simply a return to business as usual—if, indeed,
that phrase can be said to have any meaning at the Smithsonian.

169
The inventiveness of our directors, curators, and other specialists,
the farsightedness of our Regents and Secretary, and the interested
participation of our visitors and associates throughout the country
all guarantee that the Institution will continue to develop in response
to the needs of the time.

Archives of American Art

As a research bureau, the Archives of American Art serves scholar-
ship by acquiring and preserving the documentary records needed
by art historians and by making them known and available to re-
searchers. The past year has seen an unusual degree of success in
each of these endeavors.

Through the activities of its five regional centers, the Archives
received as donations 357 collections of personal papers and insti-
tutional and business records. One of the larger of these, the papers
of Thomas Casilear Cole and his family, spans a two-hundred-year
period in correspondence and diaries. Other collections with useful
nineteenth-century material are the papers of the sculptor John
Frazee, the engraver James Barton Longacre, the painter Francis
D. Millet, and the dealer J. Eastman Chase, whose records include
seven Winslow Homer letters. Two important groups of letters
written by the contemporary sculptors Alexander Calder and David
Smith were lent for microfilming, as were the records of the early
twentieth-century abstract painter Arthur Carles. Particularly use-
ful series of letters written by Bernard Berenson, Charles Burch-
field, John Steuart Curry, and Stanton Macdonald-Wright were also
acquired during the year. Other twentieth-century artists repre-
sented by substantial collections of correspondence, notes, business
records, photographs, and clippings are Rico Lebrun, Philip Pearl-
stein, Walter Quirt, Edward W. Redfield, Judson Smith, and Frank-
lin Watkins.

Artists’ papers make up the major portion of collections received,
but those of other figures in the art world are often of equal value.
This year the entire corpus of records of the art historians Robert
Goldwater, Millard Meiss, and Wolfgang Stechow, the curator Sam-
uel Wagstaff, and the collector Ferdinand Howald were deposited
in the Archives or lent for microfilming. The Lee Nordness Gallery

and the Finch College Museum, both significant New York institu-
tions, also donated their records to the Archives.

A supplementary and often quite useful form of documentation
is the tape-recorded interview. The Archives Oral History Program,
established nearly twenty years ago, conducted taped interviews in
1976 with more than thirty artists, collectors, historians, and mu-
seum administrators, including particularly fruitful ones with James
Flexner, Al Held, Marcia Marcus, Roy Neuberger, Perry Rathbone,
and Otto Wittman.

“A library in disorder,” Thomas Jefferson wrote, “has little util-
ity.” The observation applies to an archives as well, and much of
the staff work of the Archives of American Art is devoted to ar-
ranging, cataloguing, and microfilming the collections it receives.
During this year, 280 collections were catalogued; 2,350 catalogue
and index cards were produced and distributed to each of the re-
gional centers; and 164 rolls of film were completed and distributed.

The effect of this activity and the rising scholarly interest in
American art history are reflected in the growing use made of

History and Art / 171
Archives resources. Research visits to the Archives centers by
graduate students, curators, and scholars totaled 2,760, and 730
rolls of microfilm were sent out on interlibrary loans to researchers
in all parts of the country. Books, articles, exhibition catalogues,
and dissertations are the concrete evidence of research in primary
documentation. Among the more important recent ones acknowl-
edging assistance from the Archives are full-length books on Rock-
well Kent, William Sidney Mount, Eadweard Muybridge, Grant
Wood, and on the Dada movement in New York; exhibition cata-
logues on Peggy Bacon, Jervis McEntee, and women artists of the
1930s; and dissertations on William Zorach and on the Stieglitz
circle.

In a continuing effort to reach beyond the confines of pure
scholarship to a broader audience, the Archives organized several
exhibitions of documents from its holdings. “Artists and Models,”
installed in the Archives Gallery made available by the National
Portrait Gallery, opened in December. A traveling exhibition of
letters, sketches, and photographs was shown in Dallas, San Fran-
cisco, and Cleveland through arrangements made by the Smith-
sonian National Associates Program, and other exhibitions were
prepared in connection with Bicentennial art shows in San Fran-
cisco, Detroit, Cleveland, and Toledo. Press comments and public
response to these efforts were extensive and enthusiastic.

Members of the Archives staff delivered thirty-five lectures and
published eight articles and one exhibition catalogue during the
year, a significant increase over similar activities in the past. They
also participated in seven symposia devoted to professional and
art historical subjects.

Editorial work on the Archives Bicentennial project, a three-
volume bibliography of American art, was completed and a pub-
lication date in 1977 established. The Archives of American Art
Journal, a quarterly publication containing articles based on Ar-
chives holdings, reports from the regional offices, and listings of
recent acquisitions, continued its efforts to inform the scholarly
community and provide a publishing medium for those actively
engaged in research.

The Archives exists for the future as well as for the present, and
later generations of scholars will expect to find here records that
throw light on the art of our epoch. In meeting its responsibility to

172 / Smithsonian Year 1976
posterity the Archives regularly acquires collections whose signifi-
cance and historical relevance will become clear only as time goes
on. Such groups as the correspondence of David Smith and Alex-
ander Calder are now of obvious importance, but early letters
written by a then-obscure Andrew Wyeth at the outset of his
career might well have been lost if his dealer, whose name is hardly
known today, had not preserved them and eventually offered his
gallery’s records to the Archives.

Cooper-Hewitt Museum
of Decorative Arts and Design

The Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution’s Na-
tional Museum of Design, opens to the public on October 7, 1976,
in the renovated Andrew Carnegie Mansion at 2 East 91st Street,
New York City.

The Museum’s opening exhibition, ‘“Man Transforms,” has been
designed by the architect and industrial designer Hans Hollein of
Vienna, Austria, working with a team of international designers,
including George Nelson, Richard Meier, and Buckminster Fuller
of the United States, Ettore Sottsass of Italy, Oswald Ungers and
Peter Bode of Germany, Arata Isosaki of Japan, Karl Schlamminger
and Nadar Ardalan of Iran, and Murray Grigor of Scotland. The
exhibition is being sponsored by the Johnson Wax Company.

A series of twenty satellite exhibits in different museums, li-
braries, and universities in New York City is scheduled to coincide
with the opening. These exhibits, all drawn from the Cooper-Hewitt
collections, will serve as a reminder to New York of the rebirth of
one of the oldest of the city’s museums.

The Cooper-Hewitt’s drawings, prints, wallpapers, textiles, furni-
ture, ceramics and glass, and library are being installed in new
surroundings and will once again be available to the public for
study.

The Museum is offering a full range of classes, workshops, lec-
tures, weekend seminars, and tours for the autumn semester, begin-
ning October 1976.

In cooperation with the Book-of-the-Month Club, the Museum
is preparing a series of volumes on antiques, to appear in 1977.

Benefit auction in progress in the garden of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in
May 1976. All objects sold had been donated for this occasion.

These volumes will deal primarily with the collections of the
Cooper-Hewitt but will also refer to collections of other museums.

A third benefit auction was held in May in the Museum garden,
and approximately $90,000 was raised from the sale of objects
given specifically for the auction and from a dance that inaugu-
rated the viewing. Several benefit lectures and small exhibitions
were organized by the departments of drawings and textiles, and
the proceeds from these events were contributed to special con-
servation and purchase funds.

A total of 633 works of art were received through donation, 19
were purchased, and 30 were transferred to the Museum; the
Cooper-Hewitt participated in 37 exhibitions and transferred 1
work of art to the National Museum of History and Technology in
Washington, D.C. and 4 to the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London.

The Museum received major grants from the Johnson Wax Com-
pany, Karastan Rug Mills, Carnegie Corporation, Mr. Henry J.
Heinz II, and support from the New York State Council on the Arts
and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Several members have been added to the professional staff.

Freer Gallery of Art

In observance of the American Bicentennial, the Freer Gallery of
Art assembled, from its own collections, an exhibition entitled “The
Arts of Asia at the Time of American Independence.” The exhibi-
tion and the fully illustrated catalogue were arranged in three
sections: Arts of the Ch’ing Dynasty, 1644-1911; Arts of the Edo
Period, 1615-1868; and Arts of the Near East and India. Objects
in the exhibition were selected to provide insights into the civiliza-
tions of the Far East, the Near East, and India during the period
of the American Revolution.

Another special exhibition was prepared for Her Majesty the
Empress of Japan, who visited the Freer Gallery of Art on October
2, 1975. Her Majesty, who is an amateur artist, specifically asked
to see a number of outstanding Japanese and Chinese objects in
the Freer collection. The objects were placed on exhibition and
were seen by Her Majesty during her visit. Her Majesty viewed
another group of Far Eastern art objects in the study areas of the
Gallery.

As part of an extensive conservation project—directed toward a
forthcoming major exhibition of American paintings in the collec-
tion—that was begun during fiscal year 1975, a number of oil
paintings have been cleaned, and gilt frames requiring repair are
being restored.

Harold P. Stern, Director, completed a catalogue and book en-
titled Birds, Beasts, Blossoms and Bugs, the Nature of Japan. The
volume was prepared for an exhibition selected and arranged by
Dr. Stern at the Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery at the University
of California, Los Angeles.

Members of the curatorial staff contributed to the first volume
of the Freer Gallery handbook series. The initial volume, devoted
to a selection from the Chinese and Japanese collections, will be

followed by studies based on the Near Eastern and American col-
lections. This first handbook, Masterpieces of Chinese and Japanese
Art, was made possible by the generous financial support of the
Weatherhead Foundation, Mr. Richard Weatherhead, and the Na-
tional Endowment for the Arts.

In fiscal year 1975, the Collection acquired a number of impor-
tant objects, gifts from Mr. Toyosaburo Taniguchi, Professor Franz
Michael, Miss R. K. Keith, Mr. Gordon H. Brown, Mrs. Marion
Hammer, Mr. John Thacher, Dr. Kurt Gitter, Mrs. Elizabeth Reyn-
olds, and the Estate of Edith Ehrman. Mr. Taniguchi’s generous
gift to the Study Collection consisted of ninety-five hanging scrolls
by Japanese artist Takashima Hokkai (1850-1931). The scrolls are
part of a suite of one hundred landscape paintings, entitled Hokkai
Sansui Hyakushu. Mr. Taniguchi presented the paintings to the
Freer Gallery in commemoration of the American Bicentennial.
Secretary S. Dillon Ripley accepted the paintings from Mr. Tani-
guchi at a luncheon in the Gallery on April 20, 1976.

The Ellen Bayard Weedon Foundation again presented a gener-
ous gift to the Gallery for library acquisitions in the oriental field.

During the year, the Freer Gallery sponsored its twenty-third
annual series of “Illustrated Lectures on Oriental Art.”

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

The first full year of operation of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden witnessed a continuation of public enthusiasm, as at-
tendance equaled that of the inaugural year of 1974. In the less
than two years since its opening, over three million people have
visited the Museum.

This interest on the part of scholars, artists, collectors, and the
general public has also been evidenced by many generous offers
of works of art, from which the Museum has accepted 108 paint-
ings, drawings, illustrated books, and sculptures. These gifts enable
the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden to continue the pol-
icy of its Board of Trustees in expanding the existing collections.
In addition to these gifts, the Hirshhorn Museum, as authorized
by its Board of Trustees, also has purchased other works of art that

add depth to the collection and maintain the Museum’s interest in
fine examples of contemporary creativity.

A meaningful celebration of the nation’s Bicentennial was a
Museum priority in 1976. The combined efforts of the staff, guided
by Curator Cynthia McCabe, produced the exhibition ““The Golden
Door, Artist-Immigrants of America: 1876-1976,” a selective sur-
vey of the immigrant-artist’s contribution to the development and
expansion of American culture. The comprehensive 432-page cata-
logue, which contains an introduction by Dr. Daniel Boorstin, Li-
brarian of Congress, and an essay by Mrs. McCabe, includes
detailed information about the exhibition’s content: 203 paintings,
sculptures, architectural models, drawings, and photographs, rep-
resenting 67 artists who immigrated to the United States from 23
countries. In addition, the catalogue includes a one-hundred-year

chronology of world events, immigration legislation, and cultural
history, as well as artists’ biographies and their comments concern-
ing the impact of immigration. A generous grant from The Thomas
M. Evans Foundation, New York, made it possible to enlarge and
enhance this significant catalogue.

Three orientation galleries, featuring pertinent immigration docu-
ments, ship lists, photographs, newspapers, and memorabilia,
served to introduce visitors to the immigrant experience and were
made possible by liberal support from The Balch Institute of Phila-
delphia. The Balch Institute also made it possible for the Museum
to print and distribute 150,000 free tabloid-format information
sheets about the exhibition.

Other exhibitions presented by the Museum were: “Soto: A

Retrospective Exhibition,” September 25, 1975—-November 9, 1975;
“The Sculpture and Drawings of Elie Nadelman,” December 18,
1975-February 15, 1976; “Artists, Authors, and Others: Drawings
by David Levine,” March 4, 1976—-May 2, 1976; “Thomas Hart
Benton: The Sources of Country Music,” June 28, 1976—September
6, 1976; “Homage to Joan Prats,” June 28, 1976-September 6,
1976; “Robert Rauschenberg’s Stoned Moon Series,” June 28,
1976—September 6, 1976; and “John Covert, 1882-1960,” Septem-
ber 16, 1976—November 14, 1976.

On October 14, 1975, in cooperation with the United States Gen-
eral Services Administration, the Museum installed on its plaza a
reduced version of Alexander Calder’s 53—-foot sculpture Flamingo,
created for the Federal Plaza in Chicago. The installation was spe-

cially designed for use by sightless visitors to the Museum. The
suggestion for the smaller version, which made it more accessible
to the touch, came from various organizations for the blind and
was approved by Mr. Calder and the General Services Adminis-
tration. A braille plaque described the sculpture to the blind visitor.
An official ceremony marked the unveiling at which Mrs. Gerald
R. Ford; Mr. Arthur F. Sampson, Administrator, General Services
Administration; and United States Senator Jennings Randolph
(West Virginia) spoke before invited guests and a large audience.

Research on the permanent collections continued, with archival
material being sorted, analyzed, and catalogued in a master file.
Over one thousand photographs were added to these official files.
The Museum answered 579 research inquiries from various sources
and furnished 564 photographs to scholars, publishers, and authors.
The Registrar’s office catalogued 400 works in the Museum collec-
tion (including 129 new acquisitions) and added newly gathered
data to the computerized catalogue of the collection. A number of
practical working tools were developed from this computer file,

182 / Smithsonian Year 1976
including artist lists, donor lists, retrieval by type of object, store-
room inventory cards, and labels for photo archive files.

With its large collection of painting and sculpture, the Museum
engages in an active program of lending to significant exhibitions
here and abroad. Forty-two loans involving one hundred works
were made from the Museum collection to other institutions. These
loans included a portrait by Robert Delaunay sent to the Louvre,
paintings by Willem de Kooning and Stuart Davis circulated to
Rome, Bonn, and Eastern Europe, and other objects lent to major
museums in London, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San
Francisco, and Los Angeles. Another twenty-two paintings are on
loan to the White House.

In addition to this regular program of outgoing loans, two ex-
hibitions of works from the Museum collection were circulated:

,

“Sculptors and Their Drawings,” a selection of twelve sculptures
and twelve related drawings, traveled to museums in Charlotte,
San Francisco, Akron, and Middletown; an exhibition of twenty-
seven sculptures by Italian artists was made available to the Mu-
seum of Fine Arts in Richmond and the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville.

Seven temporary loan exhibitions and three smaller exhibitions,
drawn from the Museum collection, were held during the year.
These exhibitions included over 400 works borrowed from other
museums and collections and 150 from the Museum’s own holdings.

The Education Department of the Museum continued to inter-
pret the collection to a diverse public, which included many visi-
tors from abroad during the Bicentennial year. The docent pro-
gram continues to be the most popular educational service in the
Museum, and one of the largest in the Washington metropolitan
area. During the fifteen-month period from July 1, 1975, through
September 30, 1976, 102 docents provided tours as follows:

The docents gave approximately ten thousand hours of volun-
teer time. To augment the summer schedule during the Bicentennial
year, the Department trained five specialist-docents to interpret
the Bicentennial exhibition “The Golden Door, Artist-Immigrants
of America: 1876-1976.” These docents were especially useful dur-
ing the Museum’s first evening visiting hours, when it was open
until 9:00 p.m., April through Labor Day.

The Education Department developed a manual for Museum
volunteers that is invaluable in the training and supervision of
docents.

As part of the Museum’s changing exhibition program that
began in September 1975, the Education Department prepared spe-
cial one-page handouts for each exhibition, distributed without cost
to visitors. Approximately sixty thousand copies of these handouts
were distributed during the Soto, Nadelman, and Levine exhibi-
tions.

In addition, the telesonic guide system, which serves to interpret
selected paintings and sculptures in the permanent collection, was
incorporated into the Bicentennial exhibition. Thirty-eight special
tapes were created for this purpose.

The auditorium program, begun in November 1974, has contin-
ued with a weekly three-part film series and a monthly program
of lectures. The film series features documentaries on art and art-
ists, as well as avant-garde and experimental cinema and a special
Saturday series featuring works in animation particularly selected
for children. From September 1975 through April 1976, over 25,600
persons viewed 140 different films. Highlights of this film program
included premieres of many new films, talks by artist-filmmakers,
screening of works by sixteen independent filmmakers, and lectures
on film as an art form.

The monthly lecture series featured distinguished professionals in
the field of nineteenth- and twentieth-century art. Among the
speakers in this program were Michael Fried, Peter Plagens, Douglas
Davis, John I. H. Baur, John Hallmark Neff, David Levine, and
Diane Waldman. The eight lectures given during the year were
attended by 1,242 persons.

The Museum’s intern program, begun last year, was continued
during 1976. The graduate program included two interns who were
working toward their master’s degree in art history at George

Washington University. The undergraduate program was also con-
tinued during the summer of 1976 and included four interns, who
were selected from a total of 215 applicants from colleges through-
out the United States.

The Photography Department concentrated on documenting the
permanent collection and producing slides and photographs re-
quired for special exhibitions. Over 7,776 original photographs
were produced by the Department through September 1976. The
Department also answered 564 individual photo requests during the
same period.

The Conservation Department made major advances toward com-
pleting its modern laboratory. Some three hundred objects were
treated, twenty requiring major treatments. More than one hundred
examination and condition reports were completed in connection
with the ongoing project of surveying the entire collection. The
collection of outdoor sculpture was cleaned and coated to help
guard against harmful atmospheric conditions. With most of its
equipment now installed, the laboratory is carrying on conservation
activities essential to the physical care of the Museum collection.

The Department of Exhibits and Design mounted a total of four
major and six smaller exhibitions. Shown were groupings of works

History and Art / 185
by David Smith, Henry Moore, Robert Rauschenberg, Jose de
Creeft, and Ben Benn, as well as a selection of drawings from the
permanent collection and of paintings by artists of the San Fran-
cisco area.

Major exhibitions installed by the Museum’s Department of Ex-
hibits and Design included a retrospective of works by the Vene-
zuelan artist Jesus Rafael Soto, which originated with The Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum, and a retrospective of sculptures and
drawings by Elie Nadelman, which was presented in cooperation
with the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Museum’s ex-
hibition of caricatures by David Levine will tour for two years
under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhi-
bition Service. Especially relevant to the Smithsonian’s Bicentennial
Festival of American Folklife was the exhibition of Thomas Hart
Benton’s mural, The Sources of Country Music, which included pre-
liminary drawings and was lent by the Country Music Hall of Fame
Museum. An exhibition of Stoned Moon, a series of twenty-nine
lithographs by Robert Rauschenberg, celebrated the opening of the
new National Air and Space Museum.

Joseph Henry Papers

On February 6, 1976, ceremonies were held at Princeton University
celebrating the publication of volume two of The Papers of Joseph
Henry, released by the Smithsonian Institution Press in December
1975. Highlighting the activities at Princeton were the opening of
an exhibit of Henry apparatus and documents, prepared in part by
members of the staff of the Henry Papers, and a demonstration
lecture reproducing Henry’s electromagnetic experiments, in which
some of Henry’s original apparatus was used.

Volume two of The Papers of Joseph Henry is concerned with
Henry’s first three years as Professor of Natural Philosophy at
Princeton (1832-1835). Documented are his initial contacts with
major European scientists, Henry’s struggles to improve the quality
of the scientific program at Princeton, his continuing experimenta-
tion in terrestrial magnetism and self-induction, and his early asso-
ciation with Alexander Dallas Bache, later to become Henry’s

186 / Smithsonian Year 1976
partner in remaking American science. Reading notes, personal and
scientific correspondence, and detailed laboratory notes are included
in the volume.

Research and editing for the third volume of The Papers of
Joseph Henry have proceeded on schedule. Covering Henry’s career
through mid—1838, this volume will document both his professional
and personal life. The core of the volume will be Henry’s diary of
his first European trip (1837). Henry observed European science,
technology, and culture, and compared them to their American
counterparts. The reader will view Europe through the eyes of
Henry the scientist, exchanging ideas with colleagues, and Henry
the tourist, awed by the sights of Europe.

The Henry Papers continues to participate in various scholarly
and educational activities. The nineteenth-century seminar pre-
sented speakers from assorted divisions of the Institution. The
editor, with financial support from the National Endowment for the
Humanities and the National Science Foundation, organized a series
of sessions on “The Sciences in America: A Bicentennial Retro-
spective,” at the 1976 meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, under the sponsorship of the History of
Science Society. This past year the Henry Papers again participated
in the National Historical Publications Commission’s fellowship
program in Advanced Editing of Documentary Sources for Ameri-
can History, training a postdoctoral fellow in the techniques of
preparing documents for publication.

National Collection of Fine Arts

What has art meant to America and what has America meant to art?
These questions were asked by one of the National Collection of
Fine Arts’ major Bicentennial exhibitions, “America As Art.” In-
cluding 388 works of art, many never before shown in a major
national presentation, the exhibition was organized in eight distinct
parts, each examining an aspect of the relationship between Amer-
ica and its art and culture, from the late eighteenth century to the
present. Themes ranged from ‘““America As Symbol” and “The
American Cousin” to “Identity from Uniformity.” Accompanying

History and Art / 187
“America As Art” was a 320-page book of the same title by Joshua
C. Taylor, with an additional essay by John Cawelti, an illustrated
checklist, and a study manual.

Calling attention to more contemporary matters, ‘Signs of Life:
Symbols in the American City,” an elaborately installed show at
the Renwick Gallery, set out to explore the various levels of mean-
ing in the environment we have built for ourselves. Candidly
looking at “The Home,” “The Strip,” and “The Street” through
photographs and full-scale mock-ups, “Signs of Life’ pointed out
the human values underlying much that is overlooked in conscious
efforts at environmental design. The exhibition, produced by the
architectural firm of Venturi and Rauch, in close association with
the staff, provoked wide discussion in the national press.

As a foundation for future work in the history of American art,
on July 6 the National Collection of Fine Arts (NcFA) opened to the

scholarly public its Bicentennial Inventory of American Paintings
Executed before 1914, an event marked by a small explanatory
exhibition. This project was begun in 1971 to locate and record
works from across the nation, with particular concern for those
never before recorded. With the aid of individuals and local com-
mittees throughout the country, 153,000 paintings were filed on
the computer by the time the Inventory was opened for use, and
an image file recording 35,000 works was established. A guide to
the Inventory, outlining its contents and describing its nature and
use, was published in August. Since its opening, entries have con-
tinued to expand the Inventory’s listings, and scholars have been
quick to utilize its information.

As a further Bicentennial contribution to the understanding of
American art, the NcFA mounted the first comprehensive exhibition
of works by the nineteenth-century painter Emanuel Leutze and
published a catalogue raisonné of Leutze’s known works, compiled
by Dr. Barbara Groseclose. The study revealed him to be a painter
of great skill and national pride, who deserves to be remembered
for more than his Washington Crossing the Delaware. Throughout
the summer, “1876: American Art of the Centennial,” a small but
representative exhibition of works actually shown, or similar to
those exhibited in the art section of the Philadelphia exposition
of 1876, provided an opportunity to look back at the complexities
that characterized art in that important year. The exhibit was or-
ganized by Dr. Susan Hobbs.

In addition to exhibitions related to the Bicentennial celebration,
the ncFA produced fourteen exhibits that continued its policy of
investigating often neglected aspects or little studied assumptions
of American art. The delightful and incisive work of Peggy Bacon,
well known since the 1920s but sometimes overlooked by those
more interested in the avant-garde, was presented by the Depart-
ment of Prints and Drawings in an exhibition of 192 paintings,
prints, drawings, and pastels. A 166-page publication, with an essay
by Dr. Roberta Tarbell and a complete catalogue of Miss Bacon’s
prints, accompanied the exhibition. In cooperation with the artist’s
family, Janet Flint, Curator of Prints and Drawings, organized a
major exhibition and catalogue of prints by Louis Lozowick, an
artist of the 1920s and 1930s who in his theoretical writings and

History and Art / 189
works of art celebrated technology and the American city. Lozo-
wick’s paintings were also featured in “Urban Optimism,” the sec-
tion of ““America As Art” that dealt with the urban ideal of the
Twenties. Mrs. Flint also organized an exhibition and wrote a criti-
cal essay on the contribution of George Miller, the master printer
who almost single-handedly provided a generation of American
artists with the technical expertise to produce lithographs of artistic
quality. An especially provocative exhibition was that of the color-
ful works of Bob Thompson (1937-1966), organized by Adelyn
Breeskin. Though cut off early in his career, Thompson made his
mark as a distinctive personality in American art.

Of particular importance in the reassessment of recent art was
“Sculpture: American Directions, 1945-1975,” assembled by Wal-
ter Hopps, which traveled to Dallas and New Orleans after its show-
ing in Washington. Concentrating on variety in process and content,
the exhibition provided a picture of the range and power of Ameri-
can sculpture over the past thirty years. “Images of an Era: The
American Poster, 1945-1975,” an extensive exhibition prepared by
