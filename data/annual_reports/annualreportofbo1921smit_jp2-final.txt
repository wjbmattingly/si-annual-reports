OF THE
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

CuHarues D. Watcortr,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1921.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

Grentriemen: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual re-
port on the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and its branches during the year ending June 30, 1921. The affairs
of the Institution proper are reviewed on the first 24 pages of this
report, while more detailed accounts of the year’s work of the various
branches of the institution are given in the appendices hereto.
These include reports on the United States National Museum, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchange Service,
the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the
Smithsonian Library, the United States Regional Bureau of the
International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the National Gal-
lery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, and the publications of the
Institution and its branches.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of
the executive departments.”

x
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents, whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of
the House of Representatives, together with six other persons other
than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the city
of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State,
but no two of them of the same State.” One of the Regents is elected
chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has fallen on either
the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suitable person is
chosen by them as secretary of the Institution, who is also secretary
of the Board of Regents and the executive officer directly in charge
of the Institution’s activities.

In regard to the personnel of the board, it becomes my sad duty
to record the death, on May 19, 1921, of its chancellor, Edward
Douglass White, Chief Justice of the United States. Resolutions
in memory of Chancellor White were adopted by the Regents at a
special meeting held May 27, 1921, when the Hon. Calvin Coolidge,
Vice President of the United States, was elected chancellor of the
Institution.

The only other change in the personnel of the board was the
appointment of the Hon. A. Owsley Stanley, Senator from Ken-
tucky, as a Regent on January 5, 1921, to succeed Senator Charles S.
Thomas. The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as
follows: Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United States,
chancellor; Henry Cabot Lodge, Member of the Senate; A. Owsley
Stanley, Member of the Senate; Medill McCormick, Member of the
Senate; Lemuel P. Padgett, Member of the House of Representa-
tives; Frank L. Greene, Member of the House of Representatives;
John A. Elston, Member of the House of Representatives; Alexander
Graham Bell, citizen of Washington, D. C.; George Gray, citizen of
Delaware; Charles F. Choate, jr., citizen of Massachusetts; John B.
Henderson, citizen of Washington, D. C.; Henry White, citizen of
Maryland; and Robert S. Brookings, citizen of Missouri.

The board held its annual meeting on December 9, 1920. The pro-
ceedings of that meeting, as well as the annual financial report of the
executive committee, have been printed as usual for the use of the
Regents, while such important matters acted upon as are of public
interest are reviewed under appropriate heads in the present report
of the secretary. A detailed statement of disbursements from the
Government appropriations under the direction of the Institution
for the maintenance of the National Museum, the National Zoological
Park, and other branches will be submitted to Congress by the sec-
retary in the usual manner in accordance with the law.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The act establishing the Smithsonian Institution in 1846 included
in its functions the promotion of art as well as science. Heretofore
this phase of the Institution’s activities has remained somewhat in
abeyance owing to the lack of means to further it, but within the
last few years a tremendous impetus has been given the art feature.
At the beginning of the past fiscal year the National Gallery of Art,
formerly administered as a part of the National Museum, became a
separate unit under the Smithsonian Institution, and Congress pro-
vided a small appropriation for its maintenance. This important
step will do much toward the development of Washington as an art
center, and will undoubtedly bring much desirable material to the
national collections, already valued in money at several million
dollars. The Freer Gallery of Art, a unit of the National Gallery,
wag brought practically to completion during the year, and work
is going forward on the installation of the Freer collection. This
beautiful building and the unexcelled collection of American and
oriental art which it contains are, as noted in previous reports, the
gift to the Nation, through the Smithsonian Institution, of the late
Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit.

It is an unpleasant duty to here record again the pressing need
of the Institution for a larger endowment. Although several gener-
ous contributions have been received since the founding of the
Institution, few material additions to its endowed funds have ever
been made. Despite the greatly enlarged field of its scientific activi-
ties, despite the ever-increasing demands for scientific information
from individuals throughout the country, its income has remained
substantially the same. Almost daily the Institution is forced to
forego opportunities for valuable explorations and scientific re-
searches on account of lack of means, and it is hoped that some far-
sighted benefactor, recognizing the advantageous position and un-
excelled facilities of the Smithsonian Institution for carrying on
valuable researches in every branch of science, will provide an en-
dowment sufficient to enable it to carry on this work in the “ increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

Bequests—As noted in a previous report, an important bequest
was made to the Institution under the terms of the will of Mrs. Vir-
ginia Purdy Bacon, of New York, probated April 14, 1919, which
will do much toward extending our knowledge of the fauna of the
world.

That portion of Mrs. Bacon’s will relating to the Institution reads
as follows:

(f) To Smithsonian Institute the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), to
be used in establishing a traveling scholarship, to be called the Walter Rath-
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

bone Bacon scholarship for the study of the fauna of countries other than the
United States of America; the incumbents to be designated by said Institute
under such regulations as it may from time to time prescribe and to hold
such scholarship not less than two years, and while holding such scholarship
to conduct for said Institute investigations in the fauna of other countries
under the direction of said Institute.

During the year the Institution received from the executors of
Mrs. Bacon’s estate securities amounting to $45,000 on account of the
total $50,000. At the close of the year sufficient income from this
amount had not been received to enable the first scholarship to be
established, but it is planned to inaugurate the project during the
coming year.

Miss Caroline Henry, daughter of Joseph Henry, first secretary of
the Institution, died November 10, 1920. Under the terms of her
will the Institution is named as the ultimate beneficiary, the entire
estate reverting to it after the death of the last life beneficiary, as a
memorial to her father and mother. Miss Henry also bequeathed to
the Institution the sum of $1,000 and certain articles of furniture;
to the National Museum a set of china presented to Joseph Henry
by the first Japanese minister; and to the National Gallery of Art
an oil portrait by Kneller.

FINANCES.

The investments of the Institution are as follows:

To Mr. H. B. Swales, custodian, section of birds’ eggs, the Insti-
tution is indebted for an additional gift of $100 for the purchase of
specimens, making a total contribution of $700 since January, 1919.

Some of the unimproved land near Lowell, Mass., has been sold,
and the sum of $226.42 was realized therefrom and invested for
account of the Lucy T. and George W. Poore fund.

Dr. William L. Abbott has contributed $2,000 during the year to
the maintenance of a field party, the purpose of which is to procure
archeological and natural history specimens in Australia. This
expedition followed those to Borneo and Celebes and has now con-
tinued for two and a half years.

The Institution has received for specific activities further valu-
able contributions from Mr. John A. Roebling, amounting to $15,200,

6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

In partial settlement of the Charles L. Freer bequest the Institu-
tion received, in October, 1920, 3,919 shares of the stock of Parke,
Davis & Co. (Inc.), and in March, 1921, 10,000 shares, making a
total of 13,919 shares. The dividends are required to be expended
in accordance with the terms prescribed by the testator. The total
amount received by the Institution from this source since the trans-
fer of these shares was $25,970.75, and the sum of $15,026.01 has been
expended.

Current funds not immediately required for expenditure are, when
conditions will permit, deposited on time in local trust companies
and draw 8 per cent per annum. The interest received in this manner
during the fiscal year 1921 amounted to $1,066.67.

The income during the year consisted of interest on permanent
investments and other revenues for current expenses, $61,576.32 ;
receipts from bequests and for specific purposes, $110,740.47; which,
with cash subject to check on July 1, 1920, amounting to $13,304.34,
constituted a total of $185,621.13.

The disbursements described in the annual report of the executive
committee were classed as follows: General objects of the Institu-
tion, $66,202.39; investments and expenditures for specific purposes,
$93,816.33; temporary advances for field expenses, etc., $9,373.07,
leaving $5,000 deposited on time and $11,229.34 subject to check.

The Institution was charged by Congress with the disbursement
of the following appropriations for the year ending June 30, 1921:

In addition to the above, there was appropriated for printing and
binding $123,123.69 to cover the cost of printing and binding the
Smithsonian annual report and reports and miscellaneous printing
for the Government branches of the Institution. This includes the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

usual annual appropriation for printing and binding and the addi-
tional amount appropriated by Congress for printing delayed by

war work.
RESEARCHES AND EXPLORATIONS.

An important phase of the Institution’s work in the “ increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men” is the scientific exploration of
little-known parts of the earth, as well as the extending of existing
knowledge concerning better-known regions through field-work.
Although the Institution’s funds for this purpose are extremely
limited, it is often able to cooperate advantageously with other
establishments in putting expeditions in the field. The results of
these numerous explorations in every quarter of the globe have not
only advanced scientific knowledge, but have greatly enriched the
collections in the United States National Museum in biology, geology,
and anthropology.

A number of the expeditions sent out during the past year are
described in the appendices to this report, and others are here re-
viewed briefly to indicate the character of the Institution’s work in
this direction.

GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES.

Your secretary continued his geological field-work in the Cana-
dian Rockies with two main objects in view, (1) the determination
of the character and extent of the great interval of nondeposition
of sedimentary rock-forming material along the Front Range of
the Rocky Mountains west of Calgary, Alberta; (2) the clearing up
of the relations of the summit and base of the great Glacier Lake
section of 1919 to the geological formation above and below. Work
was begun early in July along the Ghost River northeast of Banff,
Alberta.

The solution of the two problems attacked may be briefly described
as follows:

The Rocky Mountain front is formed of masses of evenly bedded
limestone that have been pushed eastward over the softer rocks of
the Cretaceous plains-forming rocks. This overthrust is many miles
in extent and occurred long before the Devils Gap, Ghost River Gap,
and other openings were cut through the cliffs by running water and
rivers of ice. Great headlands and high buttes have been formed
by the silent forces of water and frost, many of which stand out
against the western sky as seen from the distant foothills and plains.

It was among these cliffs that we found that the first great cliff
was of lower Middle Cambrian age, and that resting on its upper
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

surface there were 285 feet (86 meters) of a yellowish weathering
magnesian limestone, named the Ghost River formation, which
represents the great interval between the Cambrian below and the
Devonian above. Sixty miles to the west, over 4 miles in thickness
of limestone, shales and sandstones occur in the break in sedimenta-
tion of Ghost River cliffs.

Returning to Bow Valley, the party left the Canadian Pacific —
Railroad at Lake Louise and went north over Pipestone Pass to the
Siffleur River, which is tributary to the Saskatchewan. In the north-
ward facing cliffs, 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of the Glacier Lake —
section of 1919, and 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Lake Louise,
a geological section was studied that tied in the base of the Glacier
Lake section of 1919 with the Middle and Lower Cambrian forma-
tions. Returning up the canyon valley of the Siffleur River to the
wide upper valley of the Clearwater River, a most perfectly exposed
series of limestones, shales, and sandstones of Upper Cambrian and
later formations was found, which cleared up the relations of the
upper portion of the Glacier Lake section to the Ordovician above.

The work was considerably handicapped by forest fires in July
and August and by unusually stormy weather in September.

PALEONTOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK.

Dr. R. S. Bassler, curator of paleontology, National Museum, suc-
ceeded during the year in securing for the Museum’s collections two
much-desired specimens, one a large well-preserved fossil elephant
skull formerly exhibited in Cincinnati, the other a highly fossilifer-
ous limestone slab of Silurian age quarried out by him near Oxford,
Ohio. Such a slab has long been desired to show the advancement
in life from the primitive Cambrian forms, represented in the large
Cambrian sea-beach sandstone exhibit, to the higher and more com-
plex species of succeeding geological periods. Notwithstanding the
numerous occurrences of fossiliferous limestone of Ordovician and
Silurian age, it was not until the past year that a layer affording
slabs of suitable size and sufficient perfection of preservation was
brought to the attention of the Museum. Numerous large blocks of
stone had to be removed before the real task of quarrying the de-
sired slab was begun. The work was successfully accomplished with
the generous assistance of Dr. W. H. Shideler, professor of geology
at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, who first located the specimen,
and before the close of the year this valuable educational exhibit was
installed in the hall of invertebrate paleontology.

At the conclusion of this work Doctor Bassler proceeded to Chicago
for the purpose of securing casts of type specimens of fossils in the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

collections of the Walker Museum, University of Chicago. Regard-
ing this work, Doctor Bassler says:

The paleontological collection of the National Museum, which includes the
celebrated Walcott, Ulrich, Springer, Harris, Nettelroth, and Rominger collec-
tions, is especially rich in type specimens of early Paleozoic fossils, but neverthe-
less the Walker Museum possesses many unique types not represented at
all in Washington. Permission to prepare casts of these and thus advance our
study series toward the completeness which the National collections should
attain was generously granted by Dr. Stuart Weller, director of the Walker
Museum. In two weeks’ time I was enabled to finish casting all of the Ordovi-
cian and Silurian types, leaving the remaining Paleozoic species for a future
trip. The work was done quickly by using the modeling compound (plasticene)
to make the mold from which the cast is prepared.

THE SMITHSONIAN AFRICAN EXPEDITION.

The Smithsonian African expedition, in conjunction with the
Universal Film Manufacturing Co., which was described in my last
report, concluded its work shortly after the beginning of the fiscal
year, and somewhat later the collections made by Mr. H. C. Raven,
the Institution’s representative on the expedition, were received by
the National Museum. Among the more important material may be
mentioned 697 mammals (including 272 specimens from South
Africa, a region hitherto very imperfectly represented in the Mu-
seum’s collections; 152 from Lake Tanganyika; and the chimpanzee
of Uganda), 575 birds, 206 reptiles, and 193 fishes. Although not
numerically large, these collections are of unusual interest on account
of the manner in which they supplement those obtained by other
expeditions to Africa in which the Smithsonian Institution has been
interested.

Dr. H. L. Shantz, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
also accompanied the expedition with the objects in view of securing
live plants of agricultural value for introduction into the United
States, of studying the agricultural methods of both natives and
Europeans, and of collecting plants for the National Herbarium of
the United States National Museum. Over 1,000 botanical specimens
were secured for the Museum, and first-hand observations were made
of the methods of agriculture pursued by African tribes as well as
the Europeans. About 1,600 plants were collected for growth as
agricultural plants in this country, the more important being forage
plants, nut plants, fruits, and vegetables.

AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION.

Through the generosity of Dr. W. Iu, Abbott, Mr. Charles M. Hoy
continued his work of collecting for the Museum specimens of the
very interesting fauna of Australia. The results of this expedition
are of especial value for two reasons: First, the Australian fauna
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921,

has heretofore been but scantily represented in the Museum, and,
second, the remarkable fauna of that continent is rapidly being ex-
terminated through various causes. During the year two shipments
were received from Mr. Hoy containing a total of 440 mammals well
prepared, several of which were hitherto unrepresented in the collec-
tion, together with series of skeletal and embryological material;
570 bird skins, with 24 additional examples in alcohol, and smaller
collections of reptiles, amphibians, insects, marine specimens, etc.

MALACOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK IN CALIFORNIA AND THE HAWAITAN
ISLANDS.

On the way to the First Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress, held in
Honolulu, August 2 to 20, 1920, Dr. Paul Bartsch, curator of mol-
lusks, United States National Museum, spent one day on shipworm
investigation at Mare Island, Calif. A tug was placed at his dis-
posal by the commandant of the station in order to make every
minute of the brief visit count, and the investigation resulted in the
discovery that the mollusk vee caused damage to the extent of
some $25,000,000 last year is a new species of Teredo, which Dr.
Bartsch named Zeredo beachi, in honor of the eee dant of Mare
Island. .

In the Hawaiian Islands, collections of mollusks were made at
several localities, and dredgings were made in Pearl Harbor, where
the commandant placed a dredge at the disposal of Doctor Bartsch
and Mr. John B. Henderson. Here also a new species of shipworm
was discovered, which was named Z’eredo parksi, in honor of Ad-
miral Parks.

An interesting observation made at the southeast point of Ha-
nouma Bay was the finding of an existing marine flora and fauna
at a considerable tence above the level of the sea. Regarding
this occurrence, Doctor Bartsch says:

This flora and fauna consist of algae, quite a number of species of mollusks,
crustaceans, echinoderms, and other marine organisms, which occupy pools.
and puddles kept ever moist and supplied with fresh water by the spray from
the breaking surf, which incessantly pounds that shore. I consider this an
important observation, since the occurrence of fossiliferous laminz bearing
marine organisms between sheets of lava has been held to indicate that they
were deposited at or below sea level, and their occurrence above this has
been held as evidence of elevation. We have here an instance which indicates

that this is not necessarily the case, for such a lamina would be produced if
a new outpouring of lava were to cover up the place mentioned.

BOTANICAL RESEARCHES IN THE ORIENT.

Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian, section of grasses, United States
National Museum, left Washington the last of April for several
months’ botanical work in the Orient under the auspices of the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. by

United States Department of Agriculture. This journey was un-
dertaken with two main objects in view: (1) To study the grasses
of the Philippine Islands in response to a request from the director
of the Philippine Bureau of Science (Dr. EK. D. Merrill) to prepare
the manuscript on the grasses for a flora of the Philippine Islands;
(2) to study the native and cultivated bamboos of the Philippines,
Japan, and China with special reference (1) to their introduction
into the United States and (2) to the publication of a revision of
the economic bamboos of the world.

Doctor Hitchcock arrived in Manila June 9 and spent 19 days in
the islands, mostly in Luzon. He visited Los Bafios and from there
ascended to the summit of Makiling, 3,300 feet, through virgin
forest. He also ascended Baguio, 5,000 feet, and Santo Thomas,
8,000 feet.

At the close of the year he was en route to Japan by way of
Hongkong. In Japan he intends to visit Hokone and to ascend
Mount Fuji and other mountains, studying and collecting bamboos.
From there he will proceed to China, and, if time permits, to Java,
returning to Washington the latter part of December.

RESEARCHES ON A MULTIPLE-CHARGE ROCKET FOR REACHING GREAT
ALTITUDES.

As mentioned in my last report, Prof. Robert H. Goddard, of Clark
University, is working under a grant from the Hodgkins fund of the
Institution, on a multiple-charge rocket for exploring the unknown
upper layers of the earth’s atmosphere. During the year the work
has consisted entirely of the construction and test of a small model,
illustrating the multiple-charge principle.

The experiments and tests carried on during the year have been
specifically for the purpose of eliminating jamming, of improving
and simplifying the firing devices, of securing proper protection for
the propelling charges, and of overcoming difficulties introduced by
changes in the manufacture of materials used.

A parachute device for preventing damage to the rocket and any
apparatus or instruments carried has been made which operates for
a fall of 60 feet. In addition to this, a modification has been con-
structed suitable for operating the parachute after a short fall in
rarefied air, such as is to be encountered at high elevations.

The intention has been to demonstrate as early as possible a model
multiple-charge rocket such as has been mentioned, a successful
demonstration of which, it is believed, should show clearly that a
larger multiple-charge rocket, constructed upon the same lines, will
make possible the reaching of great altitudes.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.
MEETING IN HONOR OF MADAME CURIE.

A meeting in honor of Madame Curie, the codiscoverer of radium,
was held in the auditorium of the National Museum the evening of
May 20, 1921, by the Madame Curie Committee of Washington. The
address of welcome to Madame Curie was delivered by your secre-
tary, honorary chairman of the committee, who said in part:

In your personality as a child of Poland and a citizen of France you recall
to us the inspiration that has come to our national life from those lands and as
a scientist the inspiration and courage that you have given to every research
student in America. * * * Your discovery of the two elements, polonium
and radium, and the determination of their atomic weights and many of their
properties, awards you a place in the foremost rank of the world’s research
workers, while your generous devotion to science and the application of your
work to the alleviation of human suffering, asking for yourself only the privi-
lege of continuing your work, place you among the great benefactors of man-
kind. Moreover, your work has another great underlying value. It has demon-
strated to the public at large and to those who control Government expenditure
for scientific research, the inevitable ultimate benefit to humanity of research in
the domain of pure science, however distant it may seem in the beginning from
useful application.

The meeting was also addressed by Miss Julia Lathrop, and a
lecture on radium was given by Dr. R. A. Millikan, of the University
of Chicago.

CINCHONA BOTANICAL STATION.

The lease of the Cinchona Botanical Station held by the Smith-
sonian Institution on behalf of several American botanical agencies,
mentioned in previous reports, was terminated on June 30, 1921, as
the colonial Government of Jamaica decided to retain the station for
the use of British and Jamaican botanists. It is hoped that the
Institute for Research in Tropical America, recently organized in
this country, will soon be able to provide some station affording
advantages similar to those of the Cinchona station for botanical
research in the Tropics.

PUBLICATIONS.

There were issued during the year by the Smithsonian Institution
and its branches 113 volumes and pamphlets. Of these publications
there were distributed a total of 142,208 copies, including 255 volumes
and separates of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, 12,922
volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
24,423 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian annual reports,
89,000 volumes and separates of the publications of the National
Museum, 12,795 publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
2,000 special publications, 14 volumes of the Annals of the Astro-
physical Observatory, 40 reports on the Harriman Alaska expedi-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

tion, 414 reports of the American Historical Association, and 345
publications presented to but not issued by the Smithsonian In-
stitution.

The publications of the Institution and its branches are the prin-
cipal means of carrying out one of its chief purposes, the “ diffusion
of knowledge.” They cover practically every branch of science and
are distributed to libraries, educational and scientific establishments,
and interested individuals throughout the world. The annual report
of the Institution contains a general appendix made up of articles
reviewing in a semipopular style recent advances and interesting de-
velopments in all branches of science. These reports are printed in
large editions, and the increasing demand for them indicates that
there is a growing interest in scientific matters among the American
people. The publications of the National Museum and the Bureau
of American Ethnology are described in detail in the appendices
devoted to those branches of the Institution.

Seven papers of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections were
issued during the year, among which may be mentioned as of special
interest a seventh revised edition of the Smithsonian Physical Tables,
a comprehensive work for which there is great demand among indus-
trial concerns, engineers, and educational institutions; the annual
Smithsonian Exploration Pamphlet, which describes briefly the re-
sults of the Institution’s explorations and field-work during the year
and is profusely illustrated with interesting photographs taken by
the explorers in various parts of the world; and a reprint of the
Smithsonian Mathematical Tables, one of the Institution’s series of
tables which includes the Physical Tables mentioned above, the
Meteorological Tables, and the Geographical Tables.

Allotments for printing—The congressional allotments for the
printing of the Smithsonian reports and the various publications of
the branches of the Institution were practically used up at the close of
the year. The allotments for the coming year ending June 30, 1922,
are as follows:

Committee on printing and publication—The function of the
Smithsonian advisory committee on printing and publication is to
examine and make recommendations concerning all manuscripts
offered for publication by the Institution or its branches. During
the year eight meetings were held and 94 manuscripts were acted
upon. The membership of the committee is as follows: Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger, head curator of biology, National Museum, chairman; Dr.
George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, National Museum; Dr.
J. Walter Fewkes, chief, Bureau of American Ethnology; Mr. N.
Hollister, superintendent, National Zoological Park; and Mr. W. P
True, editor of the Smithsonian Institution, secretary.

LIBRARY.

Accessions to the library of the Institution during the year num-
bered 11,948 volumes and pamphlets, of which 6,250 went to the
Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress; 938 to the Smith-
sonian office, Astrophysical Observatory, Freer Gallery of Art, and
National Zoological Park libraries; and 4,760 to the National Mu-
seum library. Many of the packages of books and pamphlets re-
ceived by the library through the International Exchange Service
consisted of publications issued by several foreign countries during
the years 1914 to 1920 which had been held awaiting normal trans-
portation facilities. This unusual number of receipts necessitated
more than twice the amount of cataloguing accomplished by the
library staff during the previous year.

Among the many valuable accessions to the scientific library of the
National Museum may be mentioned the entire geological library
of the late Dr. Joseph P. Iddings, which forms the most important
acquisition to the geological section of the library since the founda-
tion of the department in 1880.

Two new branch libraries were created during the year, namely,
the National Gallery of Art library and the Freer Gallery of Art
library. The former is administered by the National Museum
library, but the latter is a distinct unit consisting of publications
needed for reference use in connection with the Freer art collections.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The past year was an unusually busy one for the Nationa] Museum.
The National Gallery of Art was separated from the Museum and
created a separate administrative unit under the Smithsonian Insti-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

tution; the Aircraft Building was opened to the public; and consid-
erable additional work was entailed by the schemes for reclassifica-
tion and reorganization of the Government departments, the putting
into effect of the retirement system for civil employees, and the im-
pending inauguration of the budget system for Government accounts.

Other changes in the organization of the Museum besides the sepa-
ration of the National Gallery of Art include the removal of the
division of graphic arts from the department of anthropology to the
department of arts and industries; the creation of the division of
history, formerly under anthropology, as an independent division;
the subdivision of the division of marine invertebrates; and the
grouping of all strictly engineering units, including mineral and
mechanical technology, under one curator. The Museum, as now or-
ganized, comprises an administrative office, 4 scientific and technical
departments, and 1 independent division, with a total of 49 recog-
nized subdivisions.

The total number of specimens acquired by the Museum during
the year was 338,120. This new material is described somewhat in
detail in the report of the administrative assistant in charge, ap-
pended hereto, so that it is necessary to mention here only a few
of the most interesting accessions. In anthropology, a collection of
rare Mission Indian baskets was received from Miss Ella F. Hubby,
and Dr. W. L. Abbott contributed some very interesting stone fetishes
and ancient pottery from Santo Domingo. An immense collection
of skeletal material was received from the College of Physicians and
Surgeons, New York City, which will double the value of the col-
lections in the division of physical anthropology.

The most notable accession to the department of biology was the
material collected in Australia by Mr. Charles M. Hoy through the
generosity of Dr. W. L. Abbott. A great collection of Japanese
mollusks was donated by Mr. Y. Hirase, of Japan, forming one of
the most valuable accessions ever received by the division of mol-
lusks. The geological accessions included a quantity of South
American material comprising Bolivian tin and tungsten ores, rare
copper minerals from Chile, and a representative series of ores from
Argentina. An interesting exhibit of precious opal in the matrix,
ranging in color from the “ black” opal to the pale opalescent tints,
was presented by the Rainbow Mining Co., of Nevada. An extensive
series of igneous rocks from islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans,
collected by the late Dr. Joseph P. Iddings, was presented by his
sister, Mrs. Francis D. Cleveland.

The division of textiles received specimens of the fabrics used in
the construction of airplanes for military use, and many beautiful
specimens of silks, fur fabrics, plushes, and velvets contributed by
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

American manufacturers to show the progress of textile industries
in this country. The division of medicine acquired, among other
valuable material, a series of the most frequently prescribed pharma-
ceutical preparations, arranged, according to their therapeutic action,
into 26 groups. The collection of aeronautical material in the divi-
sion of mechanical technology was enriched by the acquisition of the
original hydroplane model devised by Mr. Edson F’. Gallaudet. This
model was constructed and experimented with in 1898, and is particu-
larly interesting in that means for lateral control and wing warping
were incorporated, but in practice were unsuccessful.

The Herbert Ward collection of African ethnologica was shipped
from Paris on June 25, 1921, but was not received at the Museum
until after the close of the fiscal year. This rare and valuable ma-
terial includes 19 pieces of sculpture by Mr. Ward and about 2,600
specimens of the arms and implements of the Africans of the Congo.

The usual large number of meetings and congresses were held in
the auditorium of the Museum. Visitors to the Natural History
Building during the year totaled 364,281 for week days and 103,018
for Sundays, and to the Arts and Industries Building 286,397. The
publications issued during the year comprised the annual report, 8
bulletins, and 60 separate papers including 4 parts of bulletins, 5
parts of the Contributions from the National Herbarium, and 51
proceedings papers.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

An event of great importance in the development of Washington
as an art center was the organization, at the beginning of the year, of
the National Gallery of Art, previously a dependency of the United
States National Museum, as a separate administrative unit under
the Smithsonian Institution. This step, which was made possible
through an appropriation contained in the sundry civil bill for the
year 1921, will enable the institution to carry out the provisions of
the act of establishment in which art was placed on an equal footing
with science in the proposed development of the institution. The art
feature has heretofore been held in abeyance through lack of funds
and of proper means for administering the National Gallery. All
that is now necessary for the full development of the Nation’s art
collections is a suitable building to house the treasures at present on
hand and contributions that may confidently be expected in the
future.

The first real impetus to the growth of the gallery was the bequest
of a valuable collection of art works by Harriet Lane Johnston in
1906. Since that time the national collections have increased rap-
idly, chiefly through gifts and bequests of art works by patriotic

A

citizens, until now the value of the material already assembled is
estimated at several million dollars. The gallery has never had any
funds for the purchase of pictures until recently, when a liberal
private fund has become available. The will of the late Henry
Ward Ranger provides that the interest on the sum of $200,000 shall
be used for the purchase of works of art which may ultimately come
to the National Gallery. A number of valuable paintings have
already been purchased from this fund.

Two other agencies which will do much toward building up the
National Gallery are the National Portrait Committee, which secured
for the gallery the portraits of many of the distinguished leaders of
America and the Allies in the World War, and the National Gallery
of Art Commission. whose functions are “ to promote the administra-
tion, development, and utilization of the National Gallery of Art,
including the acquisition of material of high quality representing the
fine arts and the study of the best methods of exhibiting material to
the public and its utilization for instruction.”

An illustrated catalogue of the present collection was in prepara-
tion and nearly ready for the press at the close of the year. A start
was made, also, during the year toward the building up of an art
library. The income from a bequest to the Smithsonian Institution
by the Rev. Bruce Hughes, of Lebanon, Pa., will be used for the
purchase of reference works on art which will serve as a permanent
memorial to the donor.

FREER GALLERY OF ART.

In the first report on the Freer Gallery of Art (Appendix 3 of
this report), the curator, Mr. J. EK. Lodge, gives a list indicating
the nature and number of objects in the Freer collection, all of
which had-been received at the Freer Building by November, 1920.
Art works of various kinds from the following sources are included
in the collection: American, Babylonian, Byzantine, Cambodian,
Chinese, Cypriote, Egyptian, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Near
Eastern and East Indian, Palmyran, and Tibetan. The total num-
ber of art objects, including a small amount of unclassified material,
is 9,566.

During the past year, the collection was unpacked and the objects
placed in their respective storage spaces. The Japanese pottery and
Chinese paintings were classified, and the task of checking and cata-
loguing the entire collection was begun. The interior fittings of the
building were completed during the year, with the exception of a
few minor items, and in June the Institution formally accepted the
building from the architect, Mr. Charles A. Platt.
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

The plan of installation is first to catalogue and arrange the col-
lections in the storage rooms so that they will be accessible for study,
then to select objects for exhibition, and finally to arrange the public
exhibits. This method delays the opening of the building to the
public, but in the long run of years it will make the collection more
valuable for purposes of study and exhibition, and will assure a far
more accurate record of every object. Such an art gallery as this
will exert its influence for centuries, and a year of delay in the begin-
ning will not materially decrease its usefulness.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology calls attention
to the desirability of increasing the membership of the staff in order
to meet the requirements of modern ethnological research. ‘The
service that the bureau should render to the state is somewhat dif-
ferent from what it was when the bureau was organized by Major
Powell, its director. American ethnology of the future, having
passed its descriptive stage, will demand a synthetic comparative
treatment of the vast mass of facts accumulated in the last 25 years.
There is an urgent call for generalizations that will be immediately
useful to the community; and as there is an ever-growing interest
in the history of the Indians, the future of this science lies along
the line of the historical development and appreciation of pre-
historic culture.

Nature has made the Rocky Mountains a vacation ground for the
people of this country who love mountain scenery, and parks and
monuments containing natural attractions are being set aside by
presidential proclamation and placed under the direction of the De-
partment of the Interior. One line of usefulness that ethnology can
follow is to turn the minds of our people to the educational value
of this area.

The aim of the chief during the year has been to cover as fully
as possible with the funds available the comprehensive fields of the
ethnology and archeology of the American Indian. This plan em-
braces the many aspects of the cultural life of the Indians, their
languages, dwellings, social and religious customs, music, mythology,
and ritual. In many cases it is urgent that this valuable material
be recorded immediately, as certain of the tribes are rapidly ap-
proaching extinction. It is the purpose of the chief to increase
as much as possible the field-work of the bureau, especially in the
branch of archeology, which is becoming more and more popular
as shown by the increasing demand for publications on this subject.
Researches were carried on during the year on the Algonquian In-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

dians, the Iroquois, various members of the Muskhogean stock,
Kiowa, Pueblo, Osage, Pawnee, and others. Archeological explora-
tions were conducted in Texas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Colo-
rado, New Mexico, and the Hawaiian Islands.

Successful archeological field-work was accomplished by Dr. J.
Walter Fewkes on the Mesa Verde National Park, Colo. An ex-
tremely interesting ruin on which work was begun during the pre-
vious year was completely excavated and repaired. Owing to its
undoubted use in connection with the worship of fire by the Indians,
it was named Fire Temple. In Tennessee a number of prehistoric
mounds were excavated which yielded interesting and valuable data
on the Indians of that region, and similar work was conducted in
Texas under the auspices of the bureau. Researches on Indian music
were continued by Miss Densmore, the music of the Papago being
studied this year.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The work of the exchange service was greatly increased during the
past year owing to the resumption of exchange relations with Ger-
many. The total number of packages of publications handled during
the year was 451,471, an increase of 82,099 over the total for the pre-
ceding year. The weight of this material was 605,312 pounds, an
increase of 108,934 pounds.

During the year exchanges of publications were inaugurated with
the Czechoslovak Republic and with the Polish Government. Ex-
change relations will be established with Roumania and Jugoslavia
as soon as transportation and other facilities are sufficiently stabilized.

To the list of countries receiving full sets of United States Gov-
ernment documents there was added the Government of Poland, mak-
ing a total of 57 foreign depositories, while to the list receiving par-
tial sets were added Latvia and the Library of the League of Nations
at Geneva, bringing the total number of partial sets up to 39.

As an example of the value of the exchange service in securing
special series of publications in this country for establishments
abroad, a set of publications which would tend to make the United
States better known in Belgium was obtained from the various Goy-
ernment bureaus in this country and forwarded to the Société Belge
UEtudes et d’Expansion, at Liege, at their request.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

That the National Zoological Park is becoming more and more
valuable to the people of Washington and out-of-town visitors from
all parts of the country as a source of recreation and natural history
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

instruction is evident from the fact that the record of attendance

has again been broken during the past year. The previous year’s

visitors numbered 2,220,605, which figure was this year exceeded by
171,232, making a total of 2,400,837. One hundred and twenty-four
schools and classes, numbering 13,629 individuals, visited the park
during the year for instruction purposes. The number of animals
exhibited to the public is greater than at any time since 1912, while
the number of species represented in the collection is greater than ever
before. The scientific importance and monetary value of the collec-
tion also are much greater than in any previous year. Gifts of ani-
mals during the year numbered 178, including many rare and
valuable specimens. Mr. Isaac Ellison, of Singapore, presented the
park with a male orang-utan, the first of these interesting animals
to be shown for many years. Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington,
continued his previous generosity to the park by presenting a young
Kadiak bear, a pair of birds of paradise, a species never before
shown here, and some valuable parrots. A full list of the animals
presented and their donors is given in the full report on the Park,
Appendix 6. Many valuable specimens were also secured by ex-
change and transfer, and a few by purchase. The total number of
animals in the collection on June 30, 1921, was 1,545, representing
478 species, an increase over the year before of 118 individuals and
59 species.

Owing to a drop toward the end of the year in the cost of food
for the animals, it was possible to undertake a few much-needed and
long-deferred improvements. Sections of roads were rebuilt and
repaired, one of the fords across Rock Creek was rebuilt with
cement, a sidewalk was laid from the much-used Harvard Street
entrance, the great flight cage for birds was scraped and painted,
and several minor improvements were completed. With the aid of a
small sawmill, 140,000 feet of lumber and 80,000 shingles were
salvaged from dead chestnut trees in the park.

The purchase of land necessary for the protection of the Connecti-
cut Avenue entrance, mentioned in several previous reports, was
completed during the year, and a small unexpended balance of the
money available for this purpose was reappropriated for the purchase
of certain much-needed lots near the Adams Mill Road entrance.

The most urgent needs of the park are a suitable public restaurant
building, a building for the exhibition of small mammals, and funds
for the completion of grading and filling operations, which would
provide a large area of flat space for deer and other animals, and
would make possible the elimination of a dangerous curve in the
main automobile road.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The most important event during the year was the location of a
new solar observing station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., probably
the most cloudless region in the United States. This station, which
was erected through the generosity of Mr. John A. Roebling, of New
Jersey, will be used for the purpose of securing solar-constant obser-
vations on all possible days for several years, Slich it is hoped will
furnish, in conjunction with similar observations to be made at the
Smithsonian station at Montezuma, Chile, a sound basis for the study
of the relation between solar variation and our weather conditions on
the earth.

At Washington the preparation of Volume IV of the Annals of the
Astrophysical Observatory, mentioned in last year’s report, was
brought nearly to completion. A large amount of delicate instru-
ment work was carried out at the observatory instrument shop, and
Doctor Abbot was invited by Doctor Hale, of the Mount Wilson Solar
Observatory, to prepare a special spectrobolometer to observe the
energy spectra of the stars. This extremely delicate apparatus was
nearly completed at the close of the year.

In the field the usual solar observations were conducted at Mount
Wilson, Calif.; Montezuma, Chile; and at the new station in Ari-
zona. At Mount Wilson Dr. Abbot and Mr. Aldrich also carried
on observations on the distribution of radiation over the sun’s
disk, and various investigations with the pyrheliometer, the spectro-
bolometer, the pyranometer, and the Angstrém pyrgeometer. The
solar lakes on which Dr. Abbot has jes working for several
seasons, was brought to perfection, and practically all the cooking
operations required by the observers were performed with the
apparatus.

At the new Arizona station observing was begun about the middle
of September, and from then until February conditions were even
better than had been hoped for. It was possible to make observa-
tions on about 70 per cent of the days during that period. March,
April, and May were less satisfactory, but this was apparently due
to the unusual character of the weather all over the world, and it is
confidently hoped that continued observations of the sun here and
at the Chile station will lead to important results bearing on weather
prediction on the earth.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERA-
TURE.

This international cooperative enterprise has been in’ existence
since 1900, having as its object the systematic indexing and classify-
ing of all original scientific publications. Beginning with the litera-

101257—22——_3
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

ture of 1901, the catalogue has been completed through 1914, and
there is now on hand much material from that date up to the present
time.

Until the beginning of the late war the catalogue was practically
self-supporting, but owing to the international chaos caused by the
war the finances of the enterprise are now in a very precarious
condition. For this reason the Royal Society of London, the finan-
cial sponsor of the catalogue, called a conference which was held
in London during September, 1920. At this conference delegates
were sent from 13 of the principal countries of the world, exclusive
of the enemy countries, who were not included in the Royal Society’s
invitation. The United States was represented by delegates from
the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council,
the Smithsonian Institution, and by a representative from the
Rockefeller Foundation, who had just returned from the Continent,
where he had been making an investigation of the Concilium Biblio-
graphicum of Zurich.

The consensus of opinion resulting from this meeting appeared to
be that it was essential for all organizations, such as the International
Catalogue and existing and proposed abstract journals, whose com-
mon aim is to supply information required by scientific workers and
libraries, to cooperate for their mutual benefit, and that when some
definite plan of consolidation was agreed on financial aid would be
forthcoming. Plans looking to this most desirable condition are now
under way, but it appears that for the present, at least, the necessary
funds will have to be supplied from the United States, for although
we have felt the burden of war expenses in this country our finances
are not in the deplorable condition now common to all of the Euro-
pean countries, which, in addition to the havoc caused by the war,
are at a very great additional disadvantage owing to the unprece-
dented condition of monetary exchange. There is no question as to
the need of abstract journals for the immediate use of scientific work-
ers and also of a catalogue and index as a permanent record of scien-
tific literature for the use of libraries, as well as for scientific work-
ers, and as the present organization of the International Catalogue
has still the official support of all of the principal countries of the
world, and as this organization was founded after years of endeavor
by representatives of practically all of the scientific societies of the
world, it would now be a calamity to allow it to lapse merely on ac-
count of temporary financial difficulties. I can not therefore too
strongly urge that this assistance be furnished by some of the several
wealthy organizations in this country whose aims are to further the
interests of science. A more detailed account of the findings of the

conference and of the present condition of the catalogue will be
found in the regular annual report of the United States Regional
Bureau of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, ap-
pended hereto.

NECROLOGY.

EDWARD DOUGLASS WHITE.

Edward Douglass White, Chief Justice of the United States and
chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution, died May 19, 1921. It is
not necessary to here review the life of this distinguished American
whose name has been for so many years before the public. At a spe-
cial meeting of the Board of Regents held May 27, 1921, the follow-
ing resolutions in memory of Chancellor White were adopted:

Whereas: The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution having re-
ceived the announcement of the death on May 19, 1921, of the Hon. Edward
Douglass White, Chief Justice of the United States, Regent of the Smith-
sonian Institution for ten years, eight years of which he presided as chancellor :

Resolved, That the board here expresses profound sorrow at the passing
away of their beloved colleague, who, as a statesman, jurist, and chancellor,
brought always to his work that remarkable ability and high conception of
duty that made him so strong an influence for good.

Resolved, That this minute be made a part of the records of the board, and
that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the family of the late chan-
cellor as an expression of the sympathy of the Regents at the irreparable loss
sustained in the death of this distinguished public servant and citizen.

NELSON R. WOOD.

Nelson R. Wood, for over 32 years a taxidermist in the National
Museum, died on November 8, 1920. Mr. Wood was one of the best
men in the country in his line of work, and his loss is keenly felt by
the Museum.

WILLIAM PALMER

William Palmer, taxidermist in the National Museum, died on
April 8, 1921, after 30 years’ faithful work in that capacity. Mr.
Rathbun, late assistant secretary of the Institution, said of him:

Mr, Palmer has been one of the best all-round taxidermists and preparators
in the Museum service. He is not only efficient and a hard worker, but is

especially valuable because of his diversified talents, which permit of his being
utilized in practically all zoological subjects.

JOSEPH P. IDDINGS.

Dr. Joseph P. Iddings, associate in petrology, department of
geology, United States National Museum, died September 15, 1920.
Doctor Iddings was one of the leading petrologists of America,
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

indeed of the world. He was for many years connected with the
United States Geological Survey, and for a time professor of
petrology in the University of Chicago. He was the author of two
privately printed volumes on Rock Minerals and Igneous Rocks
and numerous papers in the Government reports. He was also a
joint author of the Quantitative System of Rock Classification.
The important collections made and studied by him are all in the
custody of the National Museum.
Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 1.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States National Museum for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1921:

The fiscal year was an unusually busy one. The separation of the
National Gallery of Art from the Museum, the completion of the
building for the Freer collections, the opening of the Aircraft Build-
ing, the preparation of data for the schemes of reclassification of
Government employees and reorganization of Government depart-
ments, the inauguration of the retirement system for civil employees,
and the impending inauguration of a budget system for Government
accounts, all added to the usual Museum activities of the year.

The National Gallery of Art, which had for a number of years
been administered as the fine arts department of the Museum, be-
came an independent bureau under the Smithsonian Institution on
July 1, 1920, through provision for its separate maintenance in the
sundry civil appropriation act for the year 1921. To the new bureau
were transferred such of the Museum’s collections as had been in the
custody of the curator of the National Gallery of Art, consisting of
paintings, sculptures, and a few miscellaneous pieces. For the pres-
ent the gallery continues to be housed in the Natural History Build-
ing of the Museum.

Dr. William H. Holmes severed his connection with the Museum
as head curator of anthropology on July 1, 1920, to become director
of the National Gallery of Art, and carries with him to his larger
field the good will of the entire Museum staff. When in 1906 it
became necessary to provide a somewhat definite organization for the
department of fine arts of the Museum, the curatorship of the Na-
tional Gallery of Art was tendered to Dr. Holmes and accepted by
him in addition to his duties then as Chief of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology. Since that time Doctor Holmes has given freely of
his time and strength for the National Gallery without financial re-
turn. It is gratifying that he is now enabled to devote all of his
energies to his chosen field.

As a separate administrative unit of the Institution a rapid growth
is predicted for the National Gallery, of which the Freer collection,
housed in its own building, forms a distinct unit. It is hoped that

25
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

in a few years an additional building, suitable for the permanent
home of the National Gallery, will be authorized by Congress.

Dr. Walter Hough, curator of ethnology, was made acting head
curator of the department of anthropology upon Dr. Holmes’s
resignation.

On April 31, 1921, the final work in the construction of the build-
ing for the Freer collections was completed, and the structure was
formally transferred to the Smithsonian Institution, being accepted
on May 3, 1921, just four years and seven months after ground was
broken for its erection. That results were not reached earlier, as
was anticipated at the beginntng, was largely due to unforeseen
delays incident to the war, but the work was at all times conducted
with that deliberation and attention to details necessary to stability
and permanency of structure—and these, it is believed, have been
obtained. Planned with special reference to accommodating a col-
lection whose various units were known, and of affording unusual
facilities for study and research, the building is an object of art in
itself, and is bound to become a mecca for art lovers from all over
the world. Under the officer in charge of public buildings and
grounds, driveways and walks were constructed leading to the Freer
Gallery, and the land immediately surrounding it was seeded and
has now been brought up to the standard of the balance of the
Smithsonian Reservation. During the summer and autumn of 1920
the remaining portions of the Freer collections were brought to
Washington from Detroit and stored in the building. The work of
unpacking and installing the specimens was begun in the late autumn
under the able direction of Miss Katharine N. Rhoades, who had
been associated with Mr. Freer in their care for several years. It is
anticipated that some time must elapse before the exhibits are all
in readiness and the halls can be opened to visitors, as there is a great
amount of critical study necessary before the objects can be accu-
rately labeled and classified.

In December, 1920, Mr. John E. Lodge, curator of the department
of Chinese and Japanese art in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts,
was appointed curator of the Freer Gallery and placed in charge.
The Freer Gallery is being administered as an independent unit of
the National Gallery of Art, but the heating, lighting, and guarding
of the building continue to be carried on in connection with the
National Museum system, since the Freer Gallery is dependent upon
the Museum plant for heat, light, and power.

By the opening to the public of the Aircraft Building, on October
7, 1920, the Museum added about 14,000 square feet of floor space to
its exhibition halls. This metal structure, erected by the War De-
partment on the Smithsonian Reservation in 1917 for the use of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Art

United States Signal Service, was transferred to the custody of the
Smithsonian after the close of the war. In it has been assembled
a collection of aircraft and accessories in production during the war
period.

Changes during the year in the organization of the Museum, aside
from the separation of the National Gallery of Art, included the re-
moval of two divisions from the department of anthropology at the
beginning of the year—the division of graphic arts being trans-
ferred to the department of arts and industries and the division of
history becoming an independent division reporting directly to the
administrative assistant in charge of the Museum. In biology, the
division of marine invertebrates was subdivided on February 1,
1921, the collections of mollusks being segregated by the reestablish-
ment of the division of mollusks. In the department of arts and
industries a combination of all the strictly engineering units was
effected in May, 1921, by the appointment of the curator of mechani-
cal technology, Mr. Carl W. Mitman, as curator also of mineral tech-
nology. He will be aided by an assistant curator in each division.

The Museum lost by death during the year Dr. J. P. Iddings, asso-
ciate in petrology, Messrs. Nelson R. Wood and William Palmer,
taxidermists, and Mr. T. W. Reese, watchman.

As at present organized, the Museum comprises, besides an admin-
istrative office, 4 scientific and technical departments, and 1 independ-
ent division, with a total of 49 recognized subdivisions. The scien-
tific staff of the Museum comprises 94 persons, of whom less than
half receive pay from the Museum. This by no means represents,
however, all the scientific workers on the collections, for the Museum
also has much regular assistance from employees of various govern-
mental agencies in Washington in classifying, arranging, and plac-
ing on exhibition specimens in their respective fields of investigation.

As the museum organization of the Government, the National Mu-
seum has important assistance from the executive departments and
other governmental agencies. Particularly was this true during the
fiscal year 1921. Credit is due to the Navy Department for trans-
porting and installing in the Museum building many attractive ex-
hibits in the World War collections; to the War Department for
similar service, including the detail to the Museum of one officer for
several months; to the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and
the Interior, and the Bureau of American Ethnology for many valu-
able contributions of specimens and much assistance in classifying
and labeling objects in the Museum; to the Interior Department also
for transferring exhibition cases no longer needed by it; and to the
Post Office Department for large series of valuable and interesting
postage stamps.
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

This cooperation is mutual, as the Museum renders aid to other
governmental establishments whenever possible, as evidenced by the
work of Dr. Ale’ Hrdlitka for the Department of Justice, by which
over a million of dollars in land and money was saved for the
Indians.

The maintenance and operations of the National Museum for the
fiscal year 1921 were provided for by items appropriated in the
sundry civil and in two deficiency bills, amounting in all to $483,-
322.70.

The item for preservation of collections, from which are paid the
administrative, scientific, preparatorial and clerical staff, the watch,
labor and cleaning force, and the cost of all preservatives, has
remained at $300,000 from 1911 until the present time. An addi-
tional $12,620 granted for this year meant the extension of the
service to cover the Freer Gallery of Art, for which it provided
watchmen, cleaners, and clerical help and the necessary miscellaneous
supplies needed in connection therewith. It afforded no cessation of
the strictest economy by means of which only is it possible to con-
tinue the operations of the Museum. Present conditions can per-
haps best be realized when it is stated that 10 years. ago the item
of $300,000 was considered insufficient to cover the needs of the
Museum in these lines. Within this decade, with its tremendous
decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar, some 3,000,000 speci-
mens have been added to the collections, the scope of the Museum
has been materially enlarged, and an additional building has been
added to the Museum group, aside from the Freer Gallery.

During this period, however, increases have been granted in the
items for heating and lighting and for printing and binding, owing
to the increased cost of coal and the tremendous increase in the
cost of labor, paper, and other materials used in printing. On the
other hand, even with the greatly extended service, the item for
building repairs is now $5,000 less than it was 10 years ago, at a
time when the Natural History Building was new and naturally re-
quired comparatively little in the way of repairs. The amount for
furniture and fixtures is likewise $5,000 less than it was for a number
of years prior to the war, when prices of labor and material were
from 50 to 75 per cent lower.

Of the $64,202.70 appropriated this year for printing, $37,500 was
the regular item and $26,702.70 a deficiency item to permit of the
completion during the year of an unusual accumulation of work at
the Government Printing Office. The Museum printing had for
several years been held back for lack of sufficient available funds.

A comparison of the operating expenses of the United States Na-
tional Museum with museums of similar size and scope in this coun-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

try and abroad is extremely interesting, and brings out very strongly
the inadequacy of the appropriations, especially with reference to the
salaries paid to all classes of its employees. ‘The scientific staff is
paid from 40 to 50 per cent less than scientific men of the same grade
in similar museums elsewhere.

The upkeep of the buildings during the year involved the usual
repair work, including the painting of walls and ceilings in several
halls, the painting of all the exterior window frames of the Natural
History Building, those of the east end of the Smithsonian Building,
and a beginning on those of the Arts and Industries Building; and
the painting of the roofs of the latter. A locker room for the en-
gineer force was constructed at the east entrance, ground floor, of the
Natural History Building, and the east court of that building was
seeded with grass.

When the Freer Building was being planned, arrangements were
made to procure heat, light, and power from the central heating
plant, which the Institution was assured would be in a position to
furnish the same before needed. In the absence of such service,
however, the Freer Gallery was connected with the Museum power
plant, from which was furnished this year the necessary heat, light,
and power. This additional load on the Museum plant required the
use of the old boilers in the Arts and Industries Building during the
coldest portion of the heating season. By the removal of the old
flat grates for burning anthracite coal in these boilers and the instal-
lation of hand-operated stokers, bituminous coal could be used with-
out the production of unlawful smoke. The antiquated blow-off
valve combination on the boilers in the Natural History Building
was also replaced. Though the winter was a comparatively mild
one, heat was supplied the buildings from October 6, 1920, to May
20, 1921, with a consumption of 3,224 tons of coal. The ice plant, in
operation for 4,017 hours, produced 324.7 tons of ice. As a matter of
economy the power plant was shut down as usual during July and
August, 1920, and was again closed on June 4, 1921, the electric
current being purchased from a private concern during the summer
months.

The Museum acquired 62 exhibition cases and 165 pieces of storage,
iaboratory, and office furniture.

COLLECTIONS.

The total number of specimens acquired by the Museum during the
year was approximately 338,120. Additional material to the extent
of 794 lots, mainly geological, was received for special examination
and report. About 25,000 specimens were sent out in exchange, for
which the Museum received much valuable material.
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

The distribution of specimens for educational work was broadened
this year to include objects from the department of anthropology.
Of the 6,000 specimens distributed as gifts in aid of education, over
5,000 were comprised in classified and labeled sets of specimens pre-
pared for schools and colleges, nearly 2,000 being ores and minerals.
Lhe other subjects represented were rocks, rock weathering and soil
formation, mollusks, marine invertebrates, fishes, birds and birds’
eggs, insects, pottery, and prehistoric implements.

Anthropology.—The department of anthropology accessions were
scientifically more valuable than in the former year, because of the
number of professionally collected specimens. The great majority
of the aceessions are unconditional gifts. The geographical source
of the accessions in order is the United States, Asia, Africa, Poly-
nesia, and scattering. The department received and recorded 2,324
specimens, and the work was well in hand at the close of the year.

Of especial note in ethnology are a collection of rare Mission In-
dian baskets given by Miss Ella F. Hubby, of Pasadena, Calif.; a
remarkable Cowichan Indian blanket with totemic paintings, a gift
of Mrs. Charles C. Hyde, of Washington, D. C.; a finely carved
ancient wooden idol from Hawaii, collected many years ago by Rear
Admiral J. V. B. Bleecker, United States Navy; a collection of
carved horn dishes and spoons from the Flathead Indians, gift of
Dr. KE. A. Spitzka, of Washington, D. C.; and a group of ancient
ivory fetishes from the Lower Congo, Africa.

The division of American archeology received a noteworthy col-
lection from an ancient ruin near Taos, N. Mex., excavated by Mr.
J. A. Jeancon for the Bureau of American Ethnology; antiquities
from cliff dwellings, collected by Mr. N. M. Judd for the same
bureau; and antiquities from the ruins of Chaco Canyon, N. Mex.,
collected by Mr. Judd while conducting the expedition of the
National Geographic Society to this region. Very interesting carved
stone fetishes and ancient pottery from Santo Domingo were con-
tributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott.

Old World archeology reports the receipt of Buddhist bronze
figurines from China and kakemonos from Japan, gift of Mrs. Mur-
ray Warner, of Eugene, Oreg.; other Buddhist bronze figures, given
by Mrs. John Van Rensselaer Hoff, of Washington, D. C., fill gaps
in the collection.

Physical anthropology received an immense consignment of skele-
tal material of individuals of known sex, age, color, and nationality.
This collection, which doubles the value of the material in the divi-
sion and will require several years’ work to put in order and to cata-
logue, was received from the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
New York City, through Dr. George S. Huntington. An important
collection of human brains was donated by Dr. E. A. Spitzka, of

EE ee ee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. aL

Washington, D. C. A number of skulls and skeletons of American
Indians was added to the collection through the University of South
Dakota and the Bureau of American Ethnology. These specimens
are of much importance to the division.

Mr. Hugo Worch, of Washington, D. C., added to the Worch col-
lection a copy of the Bach harpsichord and a dulcitone and 11 other
pianos illustrating the history of the pianoforte. Mrs. Gouverneur
Morris, of Washington, D. C., presented a piano handsomely deco-
rated by Cottier, of New York.

A selection of rare oriental rugs from the collection of a con-
noisseur of Washington was hung in place of the collection pre-
viously on exhibit in the hall of art textiles.

The section of ceramics received a set of Japanese porcelain given
Prof. Joseph Henry by the first Japanese minister to the United
States, a bequest from Miss Caroline Henry. Miss Freeman and
Mrs. B. H. Buckingham, of Washington, D. C., presented some richly
decorated Japanese plaques.

Biology—From the numerical standpoint, as well as from the
standpoint of the scientific interest of the collections, the year was
a very prosperous one for the department of biology. The outstand-
ing features of this year’s accessions are the Australian collections
made by Mr. Charles M. Hoy, which were the result of Dr. W. L.
Abbott’s continued interest in the Museum, and the great collection
of Japanese mollusks donated by Mr. Y. Hirase, of Kioto, Japan, one
of the most valuable accessions that has ever come to the division
of mollusks. Doctor Abbott is also responsible for the addition of an
important collection of birds and mammals made by Mr. C. Boden
Kloss in Siam, Cochin China, and Anam. While engaged in geo-
logical work in the Rocky Mountains, Secretary Walcott procured
for the Museum several desired Canadian mammals, including mule
deer and mountain goats. Another valuable accession is that of Dr.
J. P. Iddings’s collection of butterflies and moths, presented by the
heirs of Doctor Iddings, consisting of about 2,500 named species,
mostly from the Tropics and mounted ready for exhibition. Through
the continued generosity of Mr. B. H. Swales, bird skins, represent-
ing 38 species and 7 genera not hitherto contained in the national
collection, were added. The botanical material accessioned during
the year embraced over 14,000 specimens from Haiti and Santo
Domingo, collected by Doctor Abbott and Mr. Leonard, besides a
large number of valuable collections both from the Old and the
New World.

Geology—The additions to the collections in this department
showed a marked increase over those recorded in any one of the past
15 years. The total number of accessions listed is 231, a gain of 51
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

over last year and of 29 over the number recorded in 1914-15, next
highest on the list. |

The greatest bulk of material was received by transfer from the
United States Geological Survey, but numerous valuable specimens
were acquired chiefly by exchanges and gifts. ‘These include a
quantity of South American material comprising Bolivian tin and
tungsten ores, and rare copper minerals from Chile, secured by
Custodian F. L. Hess through Guggenheim Bros., New York City;
Messrs. L. L. Ellis and Don Stewart, Oruro, Bolivia; and Prof.
Joseph T. Singewald, of Johns Hopkins University. In addition,
a representative series of ores from Argentina was presented by the
ambassador, Mr. Tomas A. Le Breton.

Interesting additions were made to the exhibit of radioactive min-
erals, including carnotite, euxenite, torbernite, and uraninite.

The meteorite collection was augmented by representatives of four
falls—Forsyth County, N. C.; Chinautla, Guatemala; Troup, Tex.;
and Owens Valley, Calif.

New and rare specimens were added to the mineral collection
chiefly through exchanges. An attractive suite of precious opal in
the matrix, ranging in color from the “black” opal to the pale,
opalescent tints, was presented by the Rainbow Ridge Mining Co.,
operating in Humboldt County, Nev., and important additions to
the collection of cut gems were acquired through the Frances Lea
Chamberlain fund.

The petrological collection was enriched by the extensive series
of igneous rocks from islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, col-
lected by the late Dr. Joseph P. Iddings and presented by his sister,
Mrs. Francis D. Cleveland. Including also the scientific portion of
Doctor Iddings’s library as well as valuable collections assigned to
other departments of the Museum, this is considered one of the most
notable accessions of the year.

Accessions of paleontological material aggregate at least 50,000
specimens and include much material-from foreign sources. Several
thousand specimens of Cambrian fossils, collected chiefly by Secre-
tary Walcott, and approximately 25,000 specimens of Silurian and
Devonian forms from Maine are also among the year’s acquisitions.

Vertebrate remains of unusual interest and in large quantity were
obtained by Mr. J. W. Gidley, collecting in Arizona under the joint
auspices of the National Museum and United States Geological Sur-
vey. A portion of this, including a rare species of mastodon and
a large glyptodon, is sufficiently complete to afford material for
restoration and exhibition.

New exhibits include two cases containing gem minerals in the
matrix, supplemental to the gem collection; an entirely new install-
ment of the exhibit illustrating radioactivity, and instructive and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

showy biological series selected from the crinoid collection of Dr.
Frank Springer; skeletons of the unique horned dinosaur, Brachy-
ceratops montanensis, a wolverine, or Gulo, and a bear; and a bio-
logic series illustrating the evolution of fossil plants.

Textiles, medicine, wood technology, and foods.—The collections
under the supervision of the curator of textiles, which, besides tex-
tiles, embrace medicine, food, wood technology, and miscellaneous
animal and vegetable products, were increased by many gifts and
by transfer from other Government bureaus, amounting to nearly
1,000 objects. The most important of these are as follows:

From the Director of Air Service, War Department, specimens of
the fabrics used in the construction and equipment of airplanes for
military use; also examples of the same fabrics which had been con-
verted to demonstrate the value for civilian use of the large surplus
sold by the War Department to the public. There were added by
gift many beautiful specimens of silks, fur fabrics, plushes, and
velvets contributed by American manufacturers to show the progress
of textile industries in this country.

The collections in the division of medicine were enlarged by a
series of the most frequently prescribed pharmaceutical prepara-
tions, arranged, according to their therapeutic action, into 26 groups,
by a large series of models, specimens, and photographs illustrating
vaccine and serum therapy and arranged to demonstrate the methods
used to combat smallpox, lockjaw, pneumonia, cerebrospinal menin-
gitis, and hay fever. The collection illustrating pharmacy received
valuable specimens of pharmaceutical apparatus and a large number
of additional documents and publications bearing on the history of
the United States Pharmacopeia.

Increased interest in the exhibition collections of the section of
wood technology resulted from the gift by the British Government
of a large section of one of the heavy oak beams taken from the roof
of Westminster Hall during recent repairs to that historic structure.
The roof was built under the orders of Richard IT, in 1399, and oak
timbers used therein, allowing for the age of the tree, must be at
least 1,000 years old. The timber presented to the Museum exempli-
fies the durability of British oak and gives an idea of the beauty of
the old craftsman’s work.

Interest in the exhibits of the section of foods was increased by the
addition of over 100 examples of canned fruits, vegetables, fish, and
meats, which had been packed and preserved so as to present a most
attractive appearance. This appetizing array of canned foods was
all put up by children according to the cold-pack method and repre-
sented a selection from the jars winning prizes in 17 State contests
between members of boys’ and girls’ canning clubs.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

Mechanical and mineral technology—One of the most important
fields of the division of mechanical technology is educational exhibits
visualizing the developments in the transportation systems of the
country and the details of such progress. In this connection there
were received a number of accessions, among which might be men-
tioned the gasoline automobile designed and constructed by Charles
E. Duryea in 1892-93, which represents probably the beginnings of
the automotive industry in this country. Another valuable acces-
sion was that of an operating model showing the cylinder mechanism
of the type of internal-combustion engine developed by the Willys-
Overland Co., of Toledo, Ohio.

In the branch of aeronautics the extensive collections of the Institu-
tion were further enhanced by the receipt of the original experi-
mental hydroplane model devised by Mr. Edson F. Gallaudet, chair-
man of the board of directors of the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation,
East Greenwich, R. I. This model was constructed and experi-
mented with in 1898, and is particularly interesting in that means
for lateral control and wing warping were incorporated but in prac-
tice were unsuccessful.

The collections devoted to horology were increased through the
efforts of Mr. George W. Spier, honorary custodian of watches, by
the receipt of 10 valuable old watches; and Mr. Emile Berliner, of
Washington City, very generously presented two gramophones of
importance in the development of the talking machine, namely, the
first commercial type developed in 1893, and an electrically operated
machine devised by Mr. Berliner in 1896.

Among the accessions received in mineral technology was one con-
sisting of over 400 specimens visualizing the interrelationship of the
several chemical industries of importance in the production of
aniline dyes, war gases, pharmaceuticals, and explosives.

Graphic arts—The increment in graphic arts included an exhibit
of hand-made paper; two books made along sixteenth century lines,
all the work of one man, type, composition, and paper; facsimiles
in type metal of 50 characters of supposedly the first font of metal
type ever cast; wood block prints by Thomas Bewick, the father of
wood engraving as used to-day; engraved wood block with pro-
gressive proofs in color by Rudolph Ruzicka; an exhibit of lead
molding electrotypes and the McKee treatment of electrotype plates;
photogelatine and photogravure work extending over 30 or 40 years;
historical examples of rotary photogravure; beautiful examples of
modern printing in black and white and color; soft ground etchings
in color by Benjamin C. Brown; etched plate with trial proofs by
Frank W. Benson, and dry-point etchings of President Harding,
taken from life by Walter Tittle. To the photographic section were
added a Jenkins camera making 30,000 exposures a minute; a print

a eee TE <<
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

from the first negative made in the United States by the Belin
method of sending portraits by wire; Civil War photographs by
Brady and large toned bromides of the World War showing com-
parative methods of warfare and photography; and illustrations of
a number of hitherto unrepresented photographic processes.

History.—The historical collections received important additions
during the past year. Those relating to the World War were for
the most part of a naval character. The Navy Department trans-
ferred to the Museum a large aggregation of materials illustrating
the part played by that branch of the service during the war, in-
cluding naval airplanes of the type and design used for patrol and
convoy duty during the conflict, models of naval vessels used during
the same period, various examples of marine instruments used on
these ships, and a large number of guns and miscellaneous ordnance
material. The Navy Department also increased its exhibition by a
number of naval objects captured from the enemy in the war zone.
These include the engines of a German submarine, a submarine tor-
pedo, and a number of smaller German naval projectiles. The ex-
hibit of the Navy Department already presents in a striking and
graphic manner the leading features of the work of the Navy during
the war, and plans have been made to develop it into one of the most
notable collections of the kind in existence. The numismatic and
pictorial sections of the war collection received valuable additions,
the former including a number of war decorations and commemo-
rative medals and the latter two large paintings by Arthur M. Haz-
ard, entitled “ Not by Might” and “The Spirit of the Armistice.”
The collection was increased by British and Canadian uniforms, and
documents relating to the services of Lieut. Louis Bennett, of the
Royal Air Force, killed in action in France, given the Museum by
his mother, Mrs. Louis Bennett, of Weston, W. Va.; and a collection
of French military objects, including a steel listening post, a steel
cupola with guns, a catapult, a Brandt cannon, a number of hand
and rifle grenades, and miscellaneous relics presented by the French
Government.

Of the antiquarian material may be mentioned a watch seal of
carnelian set in gold, bearing the Washington crest and owned by Gen-
eral Washington subsequent to the War of the Revolution. This
exceptionally interesting and valuable object was presented to the
Museum by Mr. William Sloane, of New York. The National So-
ciety of Colonial Dames of America added to their collection a
number of interesting pieces. Of special interest also is a very
handsome silver punch bowl with tray, ladle, and 10 mugs, pre-
sented to Col. George Armistead by citizens of Baltimore in recogni-
tion of his services in connection with the defense of Fort McHenry,
Baltimore Harbor, in 1814. These have been presented to the Mu-
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

seum by Mr. Alexander Gordon, jr., of Baltimore, a great grandson
of Colonel Armistead. The military, the naval, the numismatic, and
the philatelic sections of the original historical collections also re-
ceived large additions during the year.

The Herbert Ward collection—The Herbert Ward collection of
African ethnologica, together with sculptures of African subjects
by Mr. Ward, forming a unique assemblage illustrative of the
culture of the unmodified natives, was packed and shipped. from
Paris on June 25, 1921. This collection, in accordance with Mr.
Ward’s wishes, was given to the Museum by his widow, Mrs.
Sarita Sanford Ward. Mr. Ward was born in London, England,
in 1862. At the age of 15 he set out on travels which took him
over many of the unexplored lands of the world, and at 21 he
began his work in Africa. While in the Congo, in the employ of the
Belgian Government, he rendered important aid to Stanley in his
explorations. For more than five years Mr. Ward lived among
the natives of Centra] Africa, and during this time he developed
the idea of preserving an epitome of the primitive life with which
he was then surrounded and which would be an index of the primi-
tive life of all men. The African Negro that Mr. Ward studied
impressed him as possessing fine qualities of simple dignity and
loyalty. Mr. Ward was by instinct and training a lover of art and
constantly recorded his impressions of the natives at first hand.
The records which he made on the spot were used in his subsequent
famous works of sculpture, which portray the soul of Africa. Mr.
Ward in this collection has contributed a noble effort for the benefit
of art, science, and humanity.

Partello bequest.—By the terms of the will of Dwight J. Partello,
offered for probate during the year, the Museum is bequeathed his
collection of musical instruments, bows, and cases, gathered during
many years of collecting; 37 paintings; a gold and silver bowl or
casket presented to Mr. Partello by the Czar of Russia; and a diploma
and medal] awarded him for his exhibit of violins at the Chicago Ex-
position in 1893, This well-known collection illustrating the Italian
school of violins is of great intrinsic value and numbers 25 instru-
ments of the violin family, made by the best masters in pure con-
struction, including Amati, Stradavari, Bergonzi, Guarnerius, and
others. At the end of the year the estate had not been settled.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD-WORK.

Owing to very limited appropriations, the Museum is unable to
undertake field-work except in cooperation with individuals or other
scientific institutions where the expenses are mostly borne by them.
The expeditions sent out during the past year have been financed al-
most entirely from outside sources.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

Archeological survey in the Pueblo region—Mr. N. M. Judd,
curator of American archeology, made an extensive reconnaissance in
Arizona and New Mexico in the summer of 1920 in connection with
the projected archeological work to be taken up by the National
Geographic Society, resulting in valuable accessions to the Museum.
At the date of this report he was in the field conducting explorations
in the ancient ruins of Chaco Canyon, N. Mex., for that society.
Good results are reported in the preliminary CES of this work,
which is expected to cover five summers. Under the arrangement
with the society most of the specimens obtained will come to the
National Museum.

Australian eapedition—Mr. Charles M. Hoy, who has been col-
lecting vertebrates in Australia since June, 1919, supported by a
fund placed at the disposition of the Institution by Dr. W. L. Abbott,
continued his field-work during the year. He collected at several
stations in South Australia, where he also visited Kangaroo Island,
at two stations in West Australia, and in the Northern Territory.
Forty-four days were spent in working an area of 30 miles in extent.
Later on two camps were established in New South Wales, one near
the highest point on the northern tableland at an elevation of 5,000
feet and one 1,000 feet lower. Altogether, the year’s work was very
successful. The two shipments received during the year totaled 571
mammals and 534 birds, well prepared, many of which were hitherto
unrepresented in our collections. A number of interesting reptiles,
amphibians, and marine invertebrates were also included.

Dr, Abbott’s explorations in Santo Domingo.—Late in 1920 Dr.
W. L. Abbott undertook personally another expedition, this time
visiting the north side of Santo Domingo (Villa Riva, Pimentel,
Catui, Mao, in the Yaqui Valley, and several points on the Samana
Peninsula) and returning in May, 1921. He brought back a small
but select collection of birds, but his main efforts were devoted to the
collecting of plants, approximately 4,000 of which have been received
and will doubtless prove of great value.

The Smithsonian African expedition—The expedition mentioned
in last year’s report as having been sent out in conjunction with the
Universal Film Manufacturing Co. to South and Central Africa
concluded its biological work on July 14, 1920, after which Mr. H. C.
Raven, the Smithsonian collector and naturalist, returned to the
United States. Though not numerically large, the collections
brought home are of unusual interest on account of the manner in
which they supplement those obtained by other expeditions in which
the Smithsonian Institution has been interested.

Field-work in vertebrate palcontology.—Karly in the year Assist-
ant Curator J. W. Gidley was detailed to visit Williamsburg, Va.,

401257—22—_-4
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

to investigate a reported find of some fossil bones in that vicinity.
These proved to be the remains of an extinct species of whale of
Miocene age, but were incomplete and too badly damaged to make
possible the recovery of a sufficient number for an exhibition mount.

Two other important field expeditions were undertaken by Mr.
Gidley, the first as the result of reports from Mr. Kirk Bryan, of
the United States Geological Survey, who had discovered some
promising localities for fossil vertebrate remains while making an
extensive survey of the underground water resources of the San
Pedro Valley of Arizona. Mr. Gidley spent two months or more in
the Arizona field, visiting three localities in the San Pedro Valley
and one in Sulphur Springs Valley. The last yielded only frag-
mentary remains of Pleistocene mammals, but much better results
were obtained in the San Pedro Valley, where two localities, one
about 2 miles south of Benson, the other at the Curtis ranch, about
14 miles south of Benson, yielded remains of about 30 species, mostly
mammals, which seem to represent a new or little-known Pliocene
fauna. Mr. Gidley shipped 21 boxes, with an aggregate weight of
about 4,630 pounds. A portion of this material will be suitable for
exhibition, the most important being remains sufficiently complete
to form the basis of skeleton restoration of a rare species of mastodon
and a large edentate. Other remains represent extinct species of
camels, carnivorous animals, rodents, turtles, and birds.

The second expedition, entirely under Museum auspices, included
a trip to Agate Springs, Nebr., where was secured a large slab, or
block of limestone, containing remains of the little rhinoceros,
Diceratherium cooki. This will be cleaned and exhibited with the
bones in situ.

Mr. C. W. Gilmore was detailed in April to visit a fossiliferous
area some 36 miles north of Santa Fe, N. Mex., for the purpose of
making collections of paleontological material, and for determining
the advisability of reserving certain lands for national monument
purposes. A skull, lower jaws, and other bones of an extinct rhi-
noceros, various limb and foot bones of a camel, and a small collection
of miscellaneous specimens were obtained as a result of this trip.

Other expeditions in which the Museum was interested are briefly
described in the first part of this report which relates to the affairs
of the Smithsonian proper.

MEETINGS AND CONGRESSES.

The accommodations afforded by the auditorium and committee
rooms in the Natural History Building were utilized on many occa-
sions. A course of evening lectures on the history and nature of
international relations, extending from October to May, was given
under the auspices of the school of foreign service of Georgetown

' University, while two local scientific societies, the Anthropological
_ Society of Washington and the Entomological Society of Washing-
ton, made the building their regular meeting place.

The National Academy of Sciences held its annual meeting from

_ April 25 to 27, the first evening being given over to an address by

His Serene Highness, the Prince of Monaco, followed by a recep-

tion by the Regents and secretary of the Institution in the halls

assigned to the National Gallery of Art. Other societies holding

here their annual gatherings, some lasting several days, included the

Northern Nut Growers’ Association; the American Ornithologists’
Union; the American Farm Economic Association; the American
Society of Mammalogists; the Audubon Society of the District of
Columbia; and the American Institute of Architects. In connection

with the last, the Second National Architectural Exhibition, installed

in the near-by lobby and foyer, was inaugurated by a special evening
opening of the building.

During its convention in Washington in May, the American Fed-
eration of Arts held an afternoon session in the Museum auditorium,
and the delegates were tendered a reception by the Regents and secre-
tary of the Institution in the National Gallery of Art on the evening
of that date, with a special view of the collection of war portraits,
brought together by the National Portrait Committee as a nucleus of
a national portrait gallery. In connection with the visit of Madame
Marie Curie to this country, a meeting was arranged in her honor in
the auditorium with a lecture by Dr. R. A. Millikan on radium, the
exhibition halls on the two lower floors being thrown open for in-
spection during the evening.

The program of the Washington convention of the American
Bankers’ Association also included an evening reception by the
Board of Regents and Secretary of the Smithsonian in the Natural
History Building. The Southern Commercial Congress, during its
meeting in Washington, used the auditorium for presenting to the
Department of Agriculture a portrait of the late David Lubin, the
Italian ambassador assisting in the ceremonies.

Meeting facilities were afforded governmental agencies as follows:
The Bureau of Public Health Service of the Treasury Department,
for an institute on venereal disease control, lasting several days,
and for showing motion pictures relating to its work on several
occasions; the Department of Agriculture, for numerous meetings
and conferences in relation to the work of the Federal Horticul-
tural Board, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Plant Industry, the
‘States Relations Service, and the Bureau of Markets; the Army
Medical School of the War Department, for a lecture by Dr. Hideyo
Noguchi, and for the closing exercises of the 1920-21 session of the

school; the Post Office Department, for a lecture by Mr. D. F. Gar-
land; the Commission of Fine Arts; and the Federal Board of Vo-
cational Education. Single lectures were given under the auspices
of the National Research Council, the Geological Society of Wash-
ington, the Washington Academy of Sciences, Georgetown Univer-
sity, and the Osteopathic Association of the District of Columbia.

At the First Pan Pacific Scientific Congress, held in Hawaii from
August 2 to 20, 1920, the Museum was represented by the following
members of the staff of the Smithsonian Institution: Mr. John B.
Henderson, Regent of the Institution; Dr. Paul Bartsch; Dr. Gerrit
S. Miller, jr.; Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan; and Mr. Gerard Fowke.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The attendance of visitors to the Natural History Building dur-
ing the year aggregated 364,281 for week days and 103,018 for
Sundays, being a daily average of 1,167 for the former and 1,981 for
the latter. At the Arts and Industries Building the total attend-
ance was 286,397, a daily average of 917. The Aircraft Building
had an attendance of 31,235 for the portion of the year it was open,
an average of 147 persons daily. The total attendance in the Smith-
sonian Building on week days was 90, 097, an average of 288, and on
the one Sunday 138.

The publications of the year comprised the annual report for 1920,
8 bulletins, and 60 separate papers. The latter consisted of 4 parts
of bulletins, 5 parts of Contributions from the National Herbarium,
and 51 proceedings papers. The total number of copies of publica-
tions distributed was about 89,000.

The library obtained, by purchase, gift, and exchange, 2,041 com-
pleted volumes and 2,719 pamphlets. The more important dona-
tions were from Mrs. Francis D. Cleveland, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.
and Dr. W. H. Dall, the former contributing the scientific library of
the late Joseph Paxson Iddings, petrologist.

While it is the primary duty of a museum to preserve the objects
confided to its care, as it is that of a library to preserve its books
and manuscripts, yet the importance of public collections rests not
upon the mere basis of custodianship nor upon the number of speci-
mens assembled and their money value, but upon the use to which
they are put. Judged by this standard, the National Museum may
claim to have reached a high state of efficiency. From an educa-
tional point of view it is of great value to those persons who are so
fortunate as to reside in Washington or who are able to visit the
Nation’s capital. In its well-designed cases, in which every detail
of structure, appointment, and color is considered, a selection of rep-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

resentative objects is placed on view to the public, all being carefully
labeled individually and in groups. The child as well as the adult
has been provided for, and the kindergarten pupil and the high
school scholar can be seen here supplementing their classroom games
or studies. Under authority from Congress the small colleges and
higher grades of schools and academies throughout the land, espe-
cially in places where museums do not exist, are also being aided in
their educational work by sets of duplicate specimens, selected and
labeled to meet the needs of both teachers and pupils.

Nor has the elementary or even the higher education been by any
means the sole gainer from the work of the Museum. To advance
knowledge, to gradually extend the boundaries of learning, has been
one of the great tasks to which the Museum, in consonance with the
spirit of the Institution, has set itself from the first. Its staff,
though chiefly engaged in the duties incident to the care, classifica-
tion, and labeling of collections in order that they may be accessible
to the public and to students, has yet in these operations made im-
portant discoveries in every department of the Museum’s activities,
which have in turn been communicated to other scholars through its
numerous publications. But the collections have not been held for the
study of the staff nor for the scientific advancement of those be-
longing to the establishment. Most freely have they been put at
the disposal of investigators connected with other institutions, with-
out whose help the record of scientific progress based upon the ma-
terial in the Museum would have been greatly curtailed. When it
is possible to so arrange, the investigator comes to Washington;
otherwise such collections as he needs are sent to him, whether he
resides in this country or abroad. In this manner practically every
prominent specialist throughout the world interested in the sub-
jects here well represented has had some use of the collections, and
thereby the National Museum has come to be recognized as a con-
spicuous factor in the advancement of knowledge wherever civiliza-
tion has a foothold.

APPENDIX 2.
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith the following report on
the affairs of the National Gallery of Art for the year ending June
30, 1921.

ORGANIZATION AND HISTORY OF THE GALLERY.

The National Gallery of Art, which is the legal depository of all
objects of art belonging to the Nation, has heretofore been admin-
istered in connection with the United States National Museum. By
the action of the Sixty-sixth Congress in providing “ for the admin-
istration of the National Gallery of Art by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, including compensation of necessary employees and necessary
incidental expenses,” its connection with the Museum was severed
and it became the seventh administrative branch under the Institu-
tion on July 1, 1920.

A full account of the inception of the art activities of the Institu-
tion and of the early struggles of the incipient Gallery of Art, pre-
pared by the late Assistant Secretary of the Institution, Dr. Richard
Rathbun, is given in Bulletin 70 of the United States National
Museum (edition of 1916), and a brief résumé may be given here
as a suitable introduction to the first annual report of the gallery
under the new régime, and at the same time emphasizing the im-
perfectly recognized fact that art was placed on an equal footing
with science in the foundation of the Institution.

The Smithsonian Institution was founded in 1846 by a fund pro-
vided by James Smithson and was organized under the control of a
board of regents. By act of the Congress of the United States
approved August 10, 1846, establishing the Smithsonian Institution,
it was provided:

That, so soon as the Board of Regents shall have selected the said site [for
a building], they shall cause to be erected a suitable building, of plain and
durable materials and structure, without unnecessary ornament, and of suffi-
cient size, and with suitable rooms or halls, for the reception and arrange-
ment, upon a liberal scale, of objects of natural history, including a geo-
logical and mineralogical cabinet; also a chemical laboratory, a library, a gal-
lery of art, and the necessary lecture rooms, etc.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

Immediately upon the organization of the Board of Regents, in
September, 1846, a committee from its membership was appointed
to digest a plan for carrying out the provisions of this act. The
committee’s report, submitted on January 25, 1847, contained the
following recommendations on the subject of the fine arts:

The gallery of art, your committee think, should include both paintings
and sculpture, as well as engravings and architectural designs; and it is
desirable to have in connection with it one or more studios, in which young
artists might copy without interruption, being admitted under such regula-
tions as the board may prescribe. Your committee also think that as the
collection of paintings and sculpture will probably accumulate slowly, the
room destined for a gallery of art might properly and usefully meanwhile be
occupied during the session of Congress as an exhibition room for the works
of artists generally; and the extent and general usefulness of such an exhibi-
tion might probably be increased, if an arrangement could be effected with the
Academy of Design, the Arts Union, the Artists’ Fund Society, and other
associations of similar character, so as to concentrate at the Metropolis, for a
certain portion of each winter, the best results of talent in the fine arts.

The Smithsonian Building was completed in 1855, and served for
a period of eight years to accommodate the collections of all classes.
Serious discouragement of the art interests in the Institution re-
sulted from the disastrous fire, which in 1865 burned out the second
story of the building, destroying its contents, including portions of
the art collections. The remaining works were removed, the paint-
ings and statuary to the Corcoran Gallery and the engravings to
the Library of Congress. Many years later they were in large part
returned to the Institution, and but little of importance transpired
until 1906, when a collection of paintings and other art works was
bequeathed to the Corcoran Gallery of Art by Harriet Lane John-
ston, mistress of the White House during President Buchanan’s ad-
ministration, subject to the condition that should a national gallery
be established in Washington they should become the property of
that gallery. This led to an inquiry regarding the status of the
Institution as a national gallery, and the question was referred to
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, which rendered the
decision that the Institution is the duly constituted National Gallery
of Art. The text of the decision is as follows:

It is, therefore, on this eleventh day of July, in the year 1906, by the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia, sitting in Equity, and by the authority
thereof, adjudged, ordered, and decreed,

hat there has been established by the United States of America in the City
of Washington a National Art Gallery, within the scope and meaning of that
part of the codicil bearing date April 21, 1902, made by the said Harriet Lane
Johnston to her Last Will and Testament, in the proceedings in this case men-
tioned, wherein she gave and bequeathed the pictures, miniatures, and other
articles to the Trustees of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and in the event of the
Government establishing in the City of Washington a National Art Gallery, then
that the said pictures and other articles above mentioned should be delivered

to the said National Art Gallery and become its property; and that the said
National Art Gallery is the National Art Gallery established by the United
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

States of America at, and in connection with, the Smithsonian Institution, located
in the District of Columbia, and described in the Act of Congress entitled an Act
to establish the “ Smithsonian Institution” for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men, approved August 10, 1846 (9 Stat. L., 103; Title LX XIII,
sec. 5579, R. S., U. S.), and the subsequent acts of Congress amendatory thereof;
and it is further adjudged, ordered, and decreed that the United States of
America is entitled to demand and receive from the surviving Executors of the
said Harriet Lane Johnston, the Complainants named in the bill of complaint
in this case, all of the above-mentioned pictures, articles of sculpture, engravings,
miniatures, and other articles, the same to be and become a part of the said
National Art Gallery so established by the United States of America at, and in
connection with, the said Smithsonian Institution.

WENDELL P. STAFFORD, Justice.

The collection was therefore assigned to its care. Since that time
the national collections have increased rapidly, chiefly, however,
through gifts and bequests of art works by patriotic citizens.

It is a noteworthy fact that until the beginning of the year 1920-21
no appropriation had been made tor the gallery or for the purchase
of art works, and no provision for the employment of a salaried
curator or other employees of the gallery, all works of art being
associated with the department of anthropology of the National
Museum. It happened thus that the organization of the gallery as a
separate unit of the Institution did not require any radical change
in the personnel of the gallery, the curator of the department of
anthropology, who had previously cared for the art collections, be-
coming director, and the recorder of that department becoming the
recorder of the gallery.

THE HENRY WARD RANGER FUND.

Fortunately, a liberal private fund has recently become available
for the increase of the collections. The will of the late Henry Ward
Ranger provides the sum of $200,000, the interest of which is to be
devoted to the purchase of works of art for the National Gallery, the
carrying out of the bequest being intrusted to the National Academy
of Design. The provision is as follows:

All pictures so purchased are to be given by the Council to art institutions in
America, or to any library or other institutions in America maintaining a gal-
lery open to the public, all such gifts to be upon the express condition that the
National Gallery at Washington, administered by the Smithsonian Institute,
shall have the option and right, without cost, to take, reclaim, and own any
victure for their collection, provided they exercise such option and right at any
cime during the five-year period beginning ten years after the artist’s death
and ending fifteen years after his death; and, if such option and right is not
exercised during such period, the picture shall remain and be the property of
the institution to which it was first given.

‘The purchases so far made by the council of the academy are as
follows:

The advisory committee of the gallery took up the question of the
acceptability of these works, but it was later decided that the ques-
tion of acceptance could more appropriately await final consideration
until the dates of recall provided for by the bequest, namely, the five-
year period beginning ten years after the artist’s death in each case.

THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT COMMITTEE.

A second agency of primary importance to the gallery and to
American history is found in the organization and activities of the
National Portrait Committee. In January, 1919, a number of patri-
otic citizens and patrons of art realized that if the United States
was to have a pictorial record of the World War it would be neces-
sary to take immediate steps. A number of the distinguished leaders
of America and of the Allied Nations were approached and their
consent secured for the painting of their portraits by prominent
American artists. With the indorsement of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution as custodian of the National Gallery of Art, the American
Federation of Arts, and the American Mission to Negotiate Peace,
then in session at Paris, the National Portrait Committee came into
being for the purpose of carrying out this idea and thus initiating
and establishing in Washington a National Portrait Gallery. The
members of the committee as organized are: Hon. Henry White,
chairman; Herbert L. Pratt, secretary and treasurer; Mrs. W. H.
Crocker, Robert W. deForest, Abram Garfield, Mrs. E. H. Harriman,
Arthur W. Meeker, J. Pierpont Morgan, Charles P. Taft, Charles D.
Walcott, and Henry C. Frick (deceased).

That the gift of these paintings to the National Gallery might be
thoroughly national in character, it was decided that a group of
these portraits, financed by the art patrons of any city, would be in-
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

scribed as presented to the National Gallery by that city and that a
representative of that city should become an honorary member of the
National Portrait Committee. It was further decided that a tablet or
other permanent record in the National Portrait Gallery should bear
the names of the National Portrait Committee, including the chair-
men of all local committees; and that there should be a record of the
names of each subscriber to the purchase fund.

Twenty portraits completed under this arrangement were exhibited
in the National Gallery during the month of May, 1921; and these,
with such others as may be subsequently completed, will be shown in
a number of cities throughout the United States before being per-
manently installed in Washington. The exhibition is being circu-
lated under the auspices of the American Federation of Arts. The
portraits available for exhibition at the close of the year are as
follows:

By Cecilia Beaux:
Admiral, Sir David Beatty.
Premier Georges Clemenceau.
Cardinal Desiré Joseph Mercier.
By Joseph De Camp:
Premier, Sir Robert Laird Borden.

tee, are:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

Through the courtesy of the American Federation of Arts these
portraits were exhibited for a short period (May 5-22) in the large
middle room of the gallery, where they attracted much attention.
During this period the federation held its annual meeting in Wash-
ington, and on May 18 the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
gave a reception to the federation in the halls of the gallery, which
was well attended by the members and by the citizens of Washington.

ART WORKS ACQUIRED DURING THE YHAR.

a Saint-Gaudens exhibit at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, Pa.,
in the early part of 1921. It was returned to the gallery at the close
of the exhibit.

THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION.

An important forward step in the development of the gallery was

~ made during the year. On May 27, 1921, the Board of Regents of

the Institution, having the future of the gallery in mind, took the
initial steps in the establishment of the National Gallery of Art
Commission, formulating a plan of organization and naming the
following board to take the steps necessary to its elaboration :

Public men interested in fine arts: W. K. Bixby, Joseph H. Gest,
Charles Moore, James Parmelee, Herbert L. Pratt.

Experts: John E. Lodge, Frank Jewett Mather, jr., Charles A,
Platt, Edward W. Redfield.

Artists: Herbert Adams, Edwin H. Blashfield, Daniel Chester
French, Gari Melchers, William H. Holmes.

Dr. Charles D. Walcott, secretary of the Institution, was named a
member of the commission ex officio.

The primary functions of the commission are “to promote the
administration, development, and utilization of the National Gal-
lery of Art, including the acquisition of material of high quality
representing the fine arts; and the study of the best methods of ex-
hibiting material to the public and its utilization for instruction.”

At the first meeting of the commission, June 8, the organization
was completed and committees were appointed to take charge of
the various branches of the work. These are: Executive committee,
Charles Moore (chairman), Herbert Adams, Daniel Chester French,
W. H. Holmes (secretary), James Parmelee, and Charles D. Walcott;
advisory committee (chairman to be named), Herbert Adams, Edwin
H. Blashfield, W. H. Holmes, Gari Melchers, Charles A. Platt, and
Edward W. Redfield; and 12 special committees: (a@) On ancient
European paintings, Frank Jewett Mather, jr., chairman; (0) on
prints excepting the oriental, James Parmelee, chairman; (¢c) on

sculpture, Herbert Adams, chairman; (d) on American paintings,
Edward W. Redfield, chairman; (¢) on mural paintings, Edwin H.
Blashfield, chairman; (/) on ceramics, Joseph E. Gest, chairman;
(7) on oriental art, John E. Lodge, chairman; (4) on modern Euro-
pean art, Gari Melchers, chairman; (7) on architecture, Charles A.
Platt, chairman; (j) on portrait gallery, Herbert L. Pratt, chair-
man; (%) on textiles, — ———-, chairman; and on building,
Charles Moore, chairman. The executive committee met and or-
ganized on June 17, 1921, and at the close of the year considerable
progress had been made in the organization of the special committees.

The value of the National Gallery collections already in hand is
estimated at several million dollars, their acquirement being due en-
tirely to the generous attitude of American citizens toward the
National Gallery of Art, no single work of painting or sculpture
now in its possession having been acquired by purchase. It can
hardly be doubted that when a building is provided in which contri-
butions can be cared for, and exhibited to the public in the manner ~
they deserve, many collectors seeking a permanent home for their
treasures will welcome the opportunity of placing them in the cus-
tody of a national institution. The providing of a suitable building
for the gallery is all that is necessary to make Washington in the
years to come an art center fully worthy of the Nation.

The act of Congress establishing the institution provided for a
department or gallery of the fine arts and limited its scope to paint-
ings, sculpture, engravings, and architectural designs—limitations
which experience has shown lack elasticity, since the fine arts extend
in various directions into other fields of culture. The chief difficulty
in confining the collections to this narrow field is that, while the
institution has depended, and must depend very largely, on gifts and
bequests for its development, these gifts and bequests contain a large
percentage of art material quite outside of the limitations indicated,
as illustrated in the Freer, the Harriet Lane Johnson, and the Pell
collections. It would thus appear that the gallery may well antici-
pate that when a building is provided for art, the scope of the subject
matter will necessarily extend to all branches furnishing art ma-
terial rising into the realm of the fine arts, as manifestly contem-
plated in the organization of the gallery commission.

A chief undertaking of the year was the preparation of an illus-
trated catalogue of the collections, which is practically ready for the
printer at the close of the year. An illustrated catalogue of the
Ralph Cross Johnson collection of paintings by old masters, written
by Mr. George B. Rose of Little Rock, Ark., was published in the
September (1920) number of the journal, Art and Archaeology (Vol.
X, No. 3), and copies of this have been on sale during the year in the
room devoted to these works.

LIBRARY—THE HUGHES ALCOVE.

Considerable advance was made during the year in the accumula-
tion of an art library, numerous art books and art periodicals having
been added to the publications previously acquired by the gallery.
By the will of the Rev. Bruce Hughes, of Lebanon, Pa., who died on
March 20, 1916, a sum estimated at about $9,000 was bequeathed to
the Institution, “the sum so received to be invested and the income
alone used to found the Hughes Alcove of the said Smithsonian
Institute.” It is intended to devote this income to the interests of
the National Gallery, as the Institution feels that the desire of the
testator can most fittingly be accomplished by the establishment and
maintenance of an alcove or section in the library of the gallery,
for reference works on art which shall serve as a permanent memorial
tothe founder. No part of the fund has as yet been expended.

GALLERY HOUSING.

The national collection of art works so far as intrusted to the
Smithsonian Institution, were first accommodated in the Smithson-
ian Building and later in the National Museum Building, now the
Museum of Arts and Industries. In 1910 they were transferred
to the central sky-lighted hall of the recently erected Museum of
Natural History. This hall was appropriately subdivided by. par-
titions for the purpose. The space thus made available is, however,
entirely inadequate to the actual needs of the gallery, and until an
additional building is provided expansion must be at the further
expense of the already seriously embarrassed natural history and
associated departments.
59 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

The art collections are open to the public on every week day during
the year, holidays included, from 9 o’clock a. m. to 4.30 o’clock p. m.,

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION.

The principal work accomplished during the year includes com-
pletion of certain electrical equipment and of gallery equipment such
as register faces, pipe rails, and skylight glass; the installation of
two additional lavatories and a carpenter’s workshop; the provision
of asbestos screens for the windows of the peacock room to prevent
condensation of moisture on the glass; the building of partitions in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

study room 2; the construction of storage cases for Chinese and Japa-
nese panel pictures, for pottery, and for stone sculpture. Still under
way is the rebuilding of the dais in gallery 18; the recoloring of the
gallery walls throughout; the construction of storage bags and boxes
for Japanese screens.

Early in June, the Institution formally and with certain reserva-
tions accepted the building from the architect, Mr. Charles A. Platt.

Thanks are due Mr. Stephen Warring, to whose care in packing
and unpacking the collection may be attributed the transference of
the whole from Detroit to the storages of the Freer Gallery without
a mishap; Prof. Edward S. Morse for his expert opinion on the
Japanese pottery; Mr. H. E. Thompson for his skillful work of
restoration on the Whistler oil paintings; and, above all, Miss
Rhoades and Miss Guest, both of the staff, without whose constant
devotion to the Freer Gallery and its every interest, most of the
progress here recorded would have been impossible.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 4.
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Sir: In response to your request, I have the honor ¢o submit the
following report on the field researches, office work, and other opera-
tions of the Bureau of American Ethnology during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1921, conducted in accordance with the act of Con-
gress approved June 5, 1920. The act referred to contains the fol-
lowing item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including necessary employees and the purchase of necessary books
and periodicals, $44,000.

In the expenditure of this money the chief has tried to cover the
field as economically as possible and to broaden the researches of
the bureau staff in order to include as many stocks of Indians as
the limited appropriation will allow. The science of ethnology is
so comprehensive-and its problems so numerous and intricate that
to do this scientifically is extremely difficult. Work has been done
on the Algonquian, Iroquois, various members of the Muskhogean
stock, Kiowa, Pueblo, Osage, Pawnee, and others. The plan of
work embraces many different aspects of the cultural life of the
Indians, including their languages, social and religious customs,
music, mythology, and ritual.

Researches have been made on the condition of the Indians in their
aboriginal state before or directly after the advent of the Europeans,
and the desire has been to increase the relative amount of field-work.
Archeological explorations have been prosecuted in Texas, Missouri,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Colorado, New Mexico, and the Hawaiian
Islands. This line of study is destined to become the most popular
in anthropology, and publications on the subject are always eagerly
sought by the correspondents of the bureau.

To the development in recent years of the movement known as
“ See America First ” we owe in part the creation of a bureau of the
Department of the Interior called the National Park Service. Inci-
dentally the movement has stimulated a desire for research in both
ethnology and archeology. Several monuments and one national
park have been set aside by presidential proclamation to preserve

56
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

Indian relics which they contain. The main attractions of most of
these reserves are ancient buildings more or less dilapidated and
buried underground, and to increase their educational value it is
necessary that they be excavated under the supervision of men trained
in the scientific methods of the archeologist. They should also be
repaired by equally competent hands. This work is now being shared
with other institutions, but it is desirable that the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology should continue to occupy a very prominent place in
this work, in which it was the pioneer, as its appropriation was made
in part fo this service.

While the majority of these monuments are prehistoric cliff dwell-
ings or pueblos situated in our Southwest, there are others of equal
interest in other parts of the country. For instance, among the most
instructive of these monuments is the Kasaan Monument, an aban-
doned Haida village situated in Alaska. This village has many of
the old totem poles, several “ grave houses,” and other buildings
still standing, but rapidly going into ruin, lable to be destroyed by
fire or by vandals. It is very desirable that steps should be taken
to preserve this deserted town and that ethnological studies be made
before these relics are lost to science. The bureau is also contributing
its part, in an unobtrusive manner, in the efforts to preserve Cahokia,
the largest aboriginal mound in North America.

In his previous reports the chief has annually called attention to
the time consumed by the staff in answering correspondence asking
information regarding American ethnology and related subjects.
Some of these letters request elementary knowledge, others demand
more or less research. Whether for the one or the other purpose,
they often necessitate investigation and absorb considerable time,
which tends to distract the attention of the experts from intensive
scientific research, thus causing the scientific output*to be reduced
to a greater or less degree. The chief regards this aspect of the
work of the bureau as a very important one and indicative of the
respect in which the bureau is held by its correspondents. For this
reason replies have been prepared with great care, so that they may
be reliable and authoritative.

FIELD RESEARCHES OF THE STAFF.

‘'wo members of the staff, the chief and Dr. Truman Michelson,
engaged in field exploration at some time during the year.

During the past year the chief made three visits to the Mesa Verde
National Park, Colo.; one in July and August and another in Novem-
ber, 1920. On the second visit he was the guest of Mr. Stephen T.
Mather, Director of the National Park Service, Mr. F. A. Wad-
leigh, general passenger agent of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad,
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

and other gentlemen. The object of this visit was an inspection of
past work in the park and formulation of plans for the future. The
work in July and August was a continuation of cooperative work
of the Bureau of American Ethnology and the National Park Service,
with an allotment by the latter for the excavation and repair of the
ruins in the park. A third visit was made in May and June, 1921.
at the expense of the bureau.

In the report for 1920 attention was called to the beginning of the
work of excavating a ruin known as Painted House, which is situated
near the head of Fewkes Canyon, 23 miles south of Spruce Tree
Camp. The result of this work, which was not finished at the close
of last year, intensified the suspicion that this large cliff building
was used for some communal purpose, and that it was connected with
the worship of fire. The further excavation of this ruin was con-
tinued in July, when the floor of a great court was laid bare, veri-
fying this suspicion and giving undoubted evidence of the existence
of a large fireplace in the middle of the court. Taken in connection
with other evidence, the statement that this was a building devoted
to fire worship is practically proven. Fire Temple, as it may be
designated, was completely excavated and its walls repaired. Lad-
ders were so placed as to make it accessible to the public.

To facilitate the opening of Fire Temple to visitors, a road was
constructed along the southern rim of Fewkes Canyon, ending in
what is now called Sun Point, from which a magnificent view can be
obtained of Sun Temple, Cliff Palace, and other important ruins of
the Mesa. The importance of this road is reflected by its popu-
larity ; it is now the most frequented road on the park. Its construc-
tion also opened to visitors two little-known ruins near Fire Temple,
one of which has been known for several years as Oak-tree House and
the other as Fare Temple House. The walls of the latter were deeply
buried, but were completely excavated, bringing to light a most inter-
esting cliff dwelling, with kivas in a lower and storage rooms in an
upper cave. A number of large ollas and a few unique specimens of
black and white pottery and other artifacts were found in this ruin.
The indications are that this was the dwelling and granary of the

New Fire clan or of the priests who controlled the ceremonies in the .

Fire Temple. The ventilator of one kiva of this cliff dwelling re-
sembled those of Sun Temple.

Oak-tree House lies in a symmetrical cave in full sight of Sun
Point Road, about midway between Fire Temple and Sun Temple.
The excavation of this ruin, which has unique features, was com-
pleted in September, and it is now in condition for inspection by
visitors. A trail was constructed along the top of the talus con-
necting the ruins in Fewkes Canyon and ladders placed on the rim
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

of the canyon, making access to the ruins easy. These ladders follow
the Indian trails, formed of foot holes cut in the perpendicular walls
of the cliff.

One of the most interesting results of work in July, 1920, was
the excavation of a tower situated in the cedars about a mile north
of Spruce-tree Camp, and described in 1892 by Baron G. Norden-
skiédld. This tower, which will in the future be called Cedar-tree
Tower, enlarges our knowledge of the use of towers, as it is a type
of a large number of these structures found on the Mesa Verde
and in McEImo and Yellowjacket Canyons. The special feature of
this type before excavation is indicated by a saucer-like depression
on the surface of the ground south of the walls above ground. The
significance of this depression was unknown previously to the work
here mentioned. It marks the existence of a circular subterranean
kiva which once had a vaulted roof and pilasters like those repeat-
edly described in cliff-house kivas. This tower was completely
repaired and a road built around it to make it accessible to tourists.

In his field-work at Mesa Verde 30 years ago Baron Nordenskidld,
whose Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde has become a classic, par-
tially excavated a ruin in Soda Canyon about half a mile north of
Cedar-tree Tower. The approach to this cliff dwelling was very
difficult, but has been much improved by a trail constructed under the
direction of the chief, making this ruin readily accessible, aided by
several ladders where necessary.

The attractive feature of this ruin is a kiva the inner wall of
which still retains on its plastering decorations almost as brilliant
as when they were first made. On this account “ Ruin 9,” as it was
formerly called, will be referred to in the future as Painted Kiva
House. The decoration consists of a red dado below and white
above, with triangles in clusters of three at intervals on the upper
border of the dado. These decorations are identical with those on
the court and rooms of Fire Temple and those used by the Hopi in
decorating their walls 30 years ago. The row of dots which accom-
panies this mural decoration is also a common feature on the archaic
black and white pottery from Step House, one of the most ancient
cliff dwellings on the park.

Many specimens were found in Painted Kiva House, among which
may be mentioned pottery, stone implements, metates, axes and celts,
bone needles, fabrics, sandals and problematic wooden objects. Sev-
eral ears of corn with kernels intact, seeds of squash and pumpkin,
and abundant cornstalks and shucks left no doubt of the food of
the inhabitants. A fragment of the so-called paper bread called
by the Hopi piki, possibly over 500 years old, found at the bottom
of an Oak-tree House kiva, allays any doubt on this point.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

Future field-work on the Mesa Verde ought to be especially di-
rected to the study. of the relation of the Earth Lodge culture and
that of the pueblo, in which is included the cliff dwellings and
pueblos on top of the mesa. Both are characterized by distinctive
pottery as well as architecture, although the essential features of
the former are not very well known. Aztec and the Chaco ruins have
local differences from the Mesa Verde, but it is not known which
area first lost its population. Both populations flourished at about
the same time, and it is believed the cliff dwellings on the Mesa
Verde were older than the community houses of the Chaco Canyon.

In May, 1921, the chief resumed his work on the Mesa Verde,
remaining there until the close of the fiscal year. During this time
he completed the excavation of Far View House, and protected with
a cement groat the tops of about two-thirds of all the walls of rooms.

About 385 feet north of Far View House, on higher land, in about
the center of the cluster of 16 mounds that are included in the
Mummy Lake group, the excavation of a most interesting building
wholly buried under fallen walls was begun. Enough work was done
to show that it is a remarkable type of building, consisting of a
central circular tower with several subterranean rooms or kivas on
the south side, overlooking a large cemetery. It has all the appear-
ance of a necropolis of the cluster, and important results await its
final excavation. Unfortunately work on this mound had to be sus-
pended at the close of the fiscal year.

The Mummy Lake cluster of mounds is a typical village and is
duplicated again and again on the mesa and the surrounding valleys.
The complete village consists of buildings of several forms and func-
tions, isolated or united, although the components are largely habita-
tions of the unit type. Evidently the tower, with its accompanying
kivas and cemetery, was the necropolis but not a habitation. The
spade alone can divine the true meaning of members of this group.

In May the tops of all the walls of Sun Temple were recemented
with groat to protect the walls from snow and rain, a work of no
small magnitude.

During the entire year Mr. James Mooney, ethnologist, remained
in the office, engaged in formulating replies to ethnologic inquiries
and in digesting material from former western field seasons. No
new material was collected or completed. His work during the win-
ter was interrupted by a period of serious illness.

During the last fiscal year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist,
practically completed the proof reading of Bulletin 73, Early History
of the Creek Indians and Their Neighbors, which is now going through
the press. He also copied the Koasati texts which were collected a

a A a i
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

few years ago, and completed the extraction of words from these
texts, of which a beginning was made last year.

Doctor Swanton has added a few hundred cards to his material
bearing on the economic basis of American Indian life, and has gone
over Mr. James Murie’s paper on the Ceremonies of the Pawnee twice,
in order to make certain necessary changes in the phonetic symbols
employed. He has also devoted some time to studies of the Alabama,
Hitchiti, and Muskogee languages.

Doctor Swanton also continued the preparation of a paper on the
Social Organization and Social Customs of the Indians of the Creek
Confederacy, covering over 700 manuscript pages.

During the entire fiscal year Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was
engaged in office work. His first work was devoted to the completion
of the preparation by retyping of the Onondaga texts of the second
part of the Iroquoian Cosmology, the first part having appeared in
the Twenty-first Annual Report of the Bureau. Not only is the
orthography of a large number of the native terms being standard-
ized to conform in spelling with the other Iroquoian texts recorded
by Mr. Hewitt but the statements and phrasing of numerous pas-
sages are also amplified or amended in such manner as to utilize in-
formation obtained by Mr. Hewitt since the recording of the original
texts.

Mr. Hewitt also took advantage of the opportunity presented by
the presence in Washington of Mr. George Gaboosa, a mixed-blood
Chippewa Indian of Garden River, Ontario, Canada, who speaks
both Chippewa and Ottawa dialects of Algonquian, by securing his
aid in revising and translating a number of Ottawa texts supplied in
1900 by John Miscogeon, an Ottawa mixed-blood, then in Washing-
ton, D. C. These texts are either myths or traditions embodying
myths. Mr. Gaboosa supplied the Chippewa versions of these stories.
In addition to this work he supplied interlinear translations to all the
texts. The following is a list of these texts: The Myth of Nana-
bozho’s Mother; Living Men Visit the Sky-Land; The Myth of Sum-
mer and Winter; The Myth of Daylight-Maker, or Daymaker; The
Myth of Nanabozho.

Mr. Hewitt is at work on some material relating to the general
culture of the Muskhogean peoples, especially that relating to the
Creeks and the Choctaw. In 1881-82 Maj. J. W. Powell began to
collect and record this matter at first hand from Mr. L. C. Perryman
and Gen. Pleasant Porter, both well versed in the native customs, be-
liefs, culture, and social organization of their peoples. Mr. Hewitt
assisted in this compilation and recording. In this way he became
familiar with this material, which was laid aside for lack of careful
revision, and a portion of which has been lost; but as there is still
much that is valuable and not available in print it was deemed wise
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

to prepare the matter for publication, especially in view of the fact
that the objective activities treated in these records no longer form
a part of the life of the Muskhogean peoples, and so can not be ob-
tained at first hand.

In additiion to this material, it is designed to add as supplemen-
tary matter some Creek tales and mythic legends collected by Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin.

The following brief list of topics treated may give some idea ot
the nature of these field notes: “Towns and clan lists,” “Crime
and murder,” “ The government of the clan,” “ The town government
or organization of a town,” “ The council square,” “The chief,” “The
system of councils,” “The clan,” “The ranks and the titles of persons,”
“The busk or puskita,” “ Medicine practices,” “ Names and naming,”
“ Festivals,” “Marriage customs,” “Insanity,” “Prophets,” “Souls
or spirits,” “ Mythic notes,” and the short list of tales collected by
Mr. Curtin. Much of the material here recorded is not available
either in any other manuscript or in print.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, devoted nearly all of his time
to putting into book form his notes for the second volume of his
work on the Osage tribe. This task was twice interrupted by the
reading of the galley and the page proofs of the first volume. .

The second volume is nearing completion and embraces two ver-
sions of an ancient rite entitled “ No’-zhi"-zho" Wa-tho", Songs of
the Rite of Vigil.” Up to this date the completed part of this manu-
script, exclusive of the illustrations, contains 582 typewritten pages.

Sho"’-ge-mo"-i", who gave the No"’-zhi"-zho" ritual of his gens,
the Tsi’-zhu Wa-shta-ge, died in the autumn of 1919. He was the
fourth to die of the old men who aided in the recording of the
ancient tribal rites of the Osage. Two old men died before the time
set by them to give the ceremonials of their gentes arrived. Sho*’-ge-
mo"-i" remarked, as he was recording the child-naming ritual, to be
published in a later volume, “The Osage people are fast dying out
since they abandoned the supplicatory rites formulated by their an-
cesters.”

The beginning of the fiscal year found Mr. J. P. Harrington, eth-
nologist, engaged in the preparation of his material] on the language
of the Kiowa Indians. The entire material was copied, collated, and
analyzed, and constitutes a manuscript of more than 1,000 pages.

Kiowa is a typical Tano-Kiowan dialect, closely related in pho-
netics, vocabulary, and structure with the Tanoan languages of New
Mexico. This proves again, as in the case of the Hopi, that culture
areas cut across linguistic ones. The Tano-Kiowan is furthermore
genetically related to the Keresan and Zufian groups of New Mexico,
also to the Shoshonean, and certain languages of California. Mr.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

Harrington has in hand a comparative study of these languages
which is very bulky.

Upon finishing the manuscript of the Kiowa paper, Mr. Harring-
ton took up the Taos material, aided by a set of excellent texts dic-
tated by Mr. R. Vargas, and comprising 400 typewritten pages. He
finished this for publication before the close of the fiscal year.

On July 1, 1920, Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was at Tama,
Iowa, engaged in researches among the Sauk and Fox of that State
and preparing for publication by the Bureau a manuscript entitled
“The Autobiography of a Fox Indian Woman,” as far as practical
in the field. A good deal of the work on this had been done in the
previous fiscal year. Near the close of July he left for Saskatchewan,
Canada, where he made a reconnaissance of the Plains Cree at File
Hills Agency. From his study it appears that physically the Plains
Cree have a cephalic index of about 79, thus belonging to the so-called
Mississippi Valley type of North American Indian, which confirms
the results of Doctor Boas’s work many years ago. Linguistically
Cree clearly belongs to the central division of Algonquian languages,
but it is not as archaic as has usually been believed. The folklore
and mythology here show from an analysis of the culture cycle that
both woodland and plains elements are to be found, as well as a few
plateau elements. Ethnologically we have the same combination,
save that plateau elements are lacking.

Doctor Michelson returned to Washington at the close of August,
where he completed the autobiography mentioned above, and in
January submitted the manuscript for publication by the bureau.
The remainder of his time at Washington was spent working out
English translations of various Fox texts written in the current syl-
labary on mortuary customs and observances, as well as one or two
folk tales.

Doctor Michelson left Washington in the latter part of May, 1921,
to renew his researches among the Sauk and Fox of Iowa. Arriving
at Tama near the end of the month, Doctor Michelson spent nearly
all his time on the Fox mortuary customs and observations, mentioned
above, with a view to their publication by the bureau. The Indian
texts were restored phonetically, the translations corrected where
needed, a grammatical analysis begun, and additional data secured,
so that with the close of the fiscal year only about two weeks more
field-work was necessary to complete the preparation of the volume
so far as practical in the field. He took advantage of a favorable
opportunity just before the end of the year to obtain data on the
society called “ Ki-wa-ka-mo A-ki.”

While in the field and also in the office Doctor Michelson cor-
rected proofs of Bulletin 72, The Owl Sacred Pack of the Fox
Indians.
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.
SPECIAL RESEARCHES.

Four manuscripts have been submitted during the year, entitled
“Papago Songs,” “Legend Music of the Papago,” “Songs Con-
nected With Expeditions to Obtain Salt,” and “ Viikita and Wakita
Ceremonies of the Papago.” This material comprises 148 pages of
text, 75 transcriptions of songs (with phonographic records and
technical analyses), and 27 photographic illustrations.

Special researches in the field were conducted by Miss Frances
Densmore, Mr. W. E. Myer, Prof. J. KE. Pearce, Mr. Gerard Fowke,
and Mr. J. A. Jeancon.

In September Miss Densmore resumed her work on Papago music,
and in December, 1920, returned to the Papago Reservation in Ari-
zona, where she had worked a few months previously. She revisited
San Xavier, but her work centered at Sells, formerly called Indian
Oasis, but now the location of the Papago agency. Trips were made
from there to Santa Rosa village, in the extreme north, and to
Vomari village, in the extreme south of the reservation. Photo-
graphs, specimens, and records of songs were obtained at these
places.

The principal subject of study at this time was the belief of the
Papago in supernatural agencies controlling their food supply.
Information was obtained regarding two ceremonies connected with
this belief; i. e., the making and drinking of “cactus wine,” and the
Viikita. Numerous songs connected with these ceremonies were
recorded.

Other classes of songs not previously recorded among the Papago
were those received in dreams, those sung on expeditions to obtain
salt, and those connected with stories told to children; also songs for
success in the kicking-ball race and in hunting. Songs of war and
of medicine were recorded, as well as others concerning the deeds of
Elder Brother and including songs he was said to have sung after
creating the spirits, winds, and clouds. Mention may be made of a
song that was said to have been sung in order to produce the death
of an aged woman. It was said that “her grandsons decided to kill
her by means of a song,” as her advanced age made her an incum-
brance to them. Many songs have been recorded whose purpose
was to procure health, but this is the first instance of a song in-
tended to cause death. An important phase of the musical work was
the hearing of a certain class of very old dance songs, a portion of
which was in three parts, 1. e., the voices of the men, the voices of the
women singing the same melody an octave higher, and the voices of
two or three women singing (for a brief period) a still higher part,
different from the melody. This song was accompanied by the shak-
ing of a gourd rattle and the striking of a basket drum, also by
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 65

stamping the feet, which is the most primitive manner of marking
time. “This dance is seldom held at the present time, but was wit-
nessed on the desert late Christmas night.

As a development of the year’s work Miss Densmore notes the im-
portance of recognizing estheticism as a factor in Indian music. Her
analyses have shown the presence of tones whose interval distances
correspond to those of the first, second, third, and fourth upper par-
tial tones of a fundamental. Thus, in a portion of his melody, the
Indian appears to find satisfaction in intervals which are under
natural laws. Apart from these tones and intervals it appears, from
the evidence in hand, that his choice of tonal material is controlled
by a sense of pleasure rather than by “ keys ” or “ modes.”

Miss Densmore continued work on her manuscript entitled
“Chippewa Arts and Customs.” Tabulations of the botanical por-
tions of this book were made as follows: Lists of botanical names
with bibliography, showing the uses of these plants by other tribes;
lists of plants used as food, dyes, charms, and for general utility.
Miss Densmore made more than 100 blue prints of birch-bark trans-
parencies, showing a wide variety of interesting patterns. These
transparencies are made by folding thin birch bark and indenting it
with the teeth, the bark, when unfolded and held toward the light,
revealing the pattern. This form of Chippewa art is almost extinct
at the present time.

In September and October Mr. W. IE. Myer, of Nashville, Tenn.,
excavated, under the auspices of the bureau, Indian village sites on
the Gordon farm near Brentwood, Davidson County, Tenn., and also
the Fewkes Group at Boiling Spring Academy, Williamson County,
in the same State. The remains of an old Indian town at the Gordon
site had walls and towers very similar to those of Pacaha, visited by
De Soto in 1541. The walls covered an area of 11.2 acres.

When the former inhabitants for some unknown reason abandoned
this site they appear to have left nearly all the buildings still stand-
ing. The locality was never again occupied or disturbed, but gradu-
ally the buildings of the silent and deserted town decayed, and what-
ever vestiges were not destroyed by the elements were slowly buried
under a layer of black loam, which is now from 14 to 20 inches deep.

In the course of time the site of the buried village gradually
became a beautiful grassy glade, set here and there with giant forest
trees. The charm of the site appealed to one of the first white set-
tlers, who built his home here and preserved the grassy glade for a
lawn. No one suspected that an ancient Indian town was lying
buried a few inches beneath the surface; but on the surface of this
undisturbed lawn there were very faint saucer-shaped depressions
and other evidences marking the sites of about 125 dwellings.
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

When the accumulated superficial black loam was removed from
some of these circular depressions floors made of hard packed clay
were brought to ight. Some of these floors were very pleasing to
the eye, being covered with a smoothed and polished coating of fine
black, glossy material. The stone slab tops of the coffins of little
children were exposed here and there, projecting an inch or two above
the level of the floor. .

A building was uncovered in the center of which was an altar
filled with the pure white ashes of the ancient perpetual fire. The
neighboring buildings were dwellings with fire beds used for do-
mestic cooking. Stone metates, mullers, and other utensils used for
household purposes were likewise found on the floors of these rooms.

Mr. Myer also explored an unnamed group of five mounds and a
surrounding village site at Boiling Spring Academy in Williamson
County, Tenn. At the request of many citizens of Tennessee he gave

this the name of Fewkes Group in honor of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes;

Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, who had visited the site,
recognized its importance, and caused it to be explored.

Archeological field work was carried on by Prof. J. E. Pearce, of
the University of Texas, in cooperation with the bureau. The area
examined is situated in the vicinity of the city of Athens, in Hender-
son County, and during this work Professor Pearce received many
courtesies from Judge A. B. Watkins, who has long manifested an
interest in the archeology of the region. Professor Pearce finds that
the eastern Texas region contains numerous mounds, village sites,
and burial places, the objects from which are quite different from
those found in the central and western portions of Texas. Three
interesting mounds on the Morrall farm, 4 miles east of Cherokee
County, were investigated. The highest of these mounds measures
80 feet across the base and 45 feet above the level of the base. The
second mound is 180 feet long by 75 feet wide, but is only 15 feet
high. Most of the mounds in the neighborhood of Athens have been
plowed over and have no regularity in form. Several mounds situ-
ated in Harrison County, particularly those on the farm of Mr. Lane
Mitchell, of Marshall, were examined and remains of earth lodges
discovered, in the floor of which are central fire pits. These are
probably recent. Numerous other sites were explored, yielding col-
lections of pottery, stone implements, and other objects illustrating
the life of the prehistoric aborigines of eastern Texas. Everything
found implies that the Indians of this region lived in settled vil-
lages, were agriculturists, and made pottery of a high grade of
excellence. Their culture was higher than that of the Indians who
occupied the central region of Texas, investigated in 1919.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

With a small allotment, Mr. J. A. Jeancon carried on important
archeological work on a ruin at Llano, near Rancho de Taos, N. Mex.,
and obtained a valuable collection from a locality not represented in
the Museum.

The architectural features and relations of the kiva and secular
rooms of this ruin recall those of the cliff dwellings and pueblos of
the Mesa Verde. The cireular subterranean kiva that was excavated
proved to be almost identical with a typical Mesa Verde kiva, veri-
fying the legends that the modern Taos Indians are a mixed type
containing Pueblo elements, probably of northern origin.

This kiva was embedded in house walls not free from secular
buildings as in modern Taos and showed evidences of two occupa-
tions, or one kiva built inside another. It had no pilasters for the
support of a vaulted roof, but there were in the floor four upright
posts upon which a flat roof formerly rested. In the floor was an
excellent fireplace and a plastered pit the purpose of which is prob-
lematical.

Mr. Jeancon’s work attracted wide attention, and many persons
visited the site while he was at work. Members of the chamber of
commerce in Taos declared their intention to protect the excavated
walls by means of a shed.

The chief visited the ruin before excavation began and inspected
the excavations after they had been completed.

Mr. Gerard Fowke represented the bureau at the meeting of the
Pan Pacific Congress in Honolulu and made a special study of the
archeology of the Hawaiian Islands. He found that all the aborogi-
nal remains on the islands are the work of the present Hawaiian race,
indicating that when the earliest of these people came there the islands
were without inhabitants. No archeological evidences were found of
any prehistoric population; and, so far as can be ascertained, excava-
tions would not result in the discovery of any specimens essentially
different from those that can be seen on the surface or may be found
slightly covered by very recent natural accumulation. At the same
time, as all the remains are well worthy of study and preservation,
the islands furnish opportunity for further research. His report on
the temples, terraces, and other remains has been received and awaits
publication.

Dr. Clark Wissler has given what time he could spare from his
duties as chairman of the division of anthropology and psychology
of the National Research Council to the completion of a Pawnee
manuscript, in which he has been aided by Mr. James R. Murie. ‘The
music necessary for this has been transcribed by Miss Helen Roberts,
and Dr. John R. Swanton has also assisted in this work.
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

During the fiscal year Mr. D. I. Bushnell, jr., completed a manu-
script bearing the title: “ Villages of the Algonquian, Siouan, and
Caddoan Tribes West of the Mississippi.” While engaged in the
preparation of this manuscript he also secured many notes on the
burial customs of the same tribes, and these, together with much
additional material, are being used in the preparation of another
manuscript, entitled “ Burials of the Algonquian, Siouan, and Cad-
doan Tribes West of the Mississippi.”

Miss Mary Lois Kissell has begun the preparation of the manu-
script of a bulletin on weaving of the Northwest Coast Indians,
which it is hoped will be later followed by others on other geo-
graphical areas.

A small allotment was given to Mr. Gerard Fowke to carry on
special archeological work in Greenup, Ky., near Portsmouth, Ohio,
on mounds figured and described by Squier and Davis, and T. H.
Lewis. On the opposite bank of the Ohio River a celebrated cache
of pipes has been found, and it was hoped that a similar deposit
might be discovered near the effigy mound on the south side. The
results of this examination were negative so far as the object desired
was concerned, but resulted in several interesting observations of a
nature too technical to discuss in this place.

Samuel H. Miller.

During the year 775 books were accessioned, of which 50 were
acquired by purchase, 325 by binding of periodicals, and 400 by gift
and exchange. The periodicals currently received number about
900, of which 30 were received by subscription, the remainder being

received through exchange. The bureau has also received 269 pam-
phlets, giving at the close of the year a working library of 24,155
volumes, 14,777 pamphlets, and several thousand unbound periodicals.

During the year an increasing number of visitors have applied to
the library for books. Information has been furnished and biblio-
graphic notes compiled for the use of correspondents. The officials
of the Library of Congress and of the Government departments have
also made use of the library through frequent loans during the year.

In addition to the use of its own library, which is becoming more
and more valuable through exchange and by limited purchase, it
was found necessary to draw on the Library of Congress for the loan
of about 500 books.

As mentioned in the last annual report, one of the most urgent
needs of the library at the present time is more shelf room for its
books.

COLLECTIONS.

The following collections, acquired by members of the bureau or
by those detailed in connection with its researches, have been trans-
ferred to the United States National Museum:

APPENDIX 5.
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper-
ations of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1921:

The estimate submitted for the support of the service during 1921,
including the allotment for printing and binding, was $50,200, and
this amount was granted by Congress. The repayments from de-
partmental and various other establishments aggregated $4,779.47,
making the total resources available for carrying on the system of
exchanges during the year $54,979.47.

The work of the exchange service during the past year has been
very heavy, due, principally, to the reopening of relations with Ger-
many. One hundred and eighty-eight boxes were received from
Germany and 691 boxes were forwarded to that country. These con-
signments weighed a total of 186,037 pounds, or about 31 per cent
of the weight of all the packages handled by the exchange service
during the year.

The total number of packages passing through the service during
the year was 451,471—an increase over the number for the preceding
year of 82,099. The weight of these packages was 605,312 pounds—
a gain of 108,934. For statistical purposes the packages handled by
the exchange service are divided into several classes.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are in-
dicated in the following table:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

As explained in previous reports, the disparity between the number
of publications sent abroad and those received in return is not so
great as would appear from the above figures. Packages sent abroad
in many instances contain only a single publication, while those re-
ceived in return often comprise several volumes—in some cases the
term “ package” being applied to large boxes containing a hundred
or more publications. Furthermore, some foreign establishments
send their publications directly to their destinations in this country
by mail and not through exchange channels.

As I have already stated, shipments were resumed during the year
to Germany. Relations have also been reestablished with Austria.
The steps taken by the Institution toward the reopening of ex-
changes with Roumania and the establishment of relations with the
newly formed Government of Jugoslavia, referred to in my last re-
port, have not yet led to a successful result. The Roumanian authori-
ties state that, in view of the difficulties of railroad transportation,
the service can not at the present time be reorganized, but as soon as
those difficulties are overcome the Roumanian Government will at
once resume the service. The Government of Jugoslavia, in a note
received near the close of the year, states that it will be glad to renew
the interchange of publications as soon as the Belgrade Exchange
Bureau is reorganized. Conditions in Russia and Turkey have not
yet reached a state where steps can be taken to renew the exchange
of publications between those countries and the United States.

Reference was made in my 1920 report to the fact that an exchange
of publications had been inaugurated with the Czechoslovak Repub-
lic. As a matter of record it should be stated here that notification
was received through the Department of State from the Belgian
ambassador in Washington of the adherence of the Government of
Czechoslovakia to the exchange conventions concluded at Brussels on
March 15, 1886. One of those conventions provides for the inter-
national exchange of official documents and scientific and literary
publications; the other, for the immediate exchange of the official
journal, parliamentary annals, and documents. Articles II and IX
of the conventions provide that the States which have not taken part
in the convention are admitted to adhere to it on their request, this
adherence to be notified diplomatically to the Belgian Government
and by that Government to all the other signatory States.

I am glad to report that the Polish Government has also adhered
to the Brussels convention providing for the establishment of a sys-
tem of international exchanges and that the Bibliothéque du Minis-
tere des Relations Extérieures, at Warsaw, has been designated to
assume charge of the Polish International Exchange Service. Under
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

date of May 14, 1921, the first shipment, consisting of 18 boxes, was
dispatched to Poland.

The Government of the free city of Danzig, in reply to a letter
from this Institution asking whether it would be willing to under-
take the distribution of packages intended for correspondents in the
territory comprising that city, stated that the Stadtbibliothek had
been designated to act as its exchange bureau.

Among the requests received from foreign establishments for as-
sistance in procuring especially desired publications may be men-
tioned one from the Société Belge d’Etudes et d’Expansion at Liége.
That society stated that, having in view a closer relationship between
its peoples and the nationals of friendly and allied countries, it had
established a new service of general documentation, and was anxious
to receive for the use of that service publications which would tend
to make the United States better known in the Kingdom of Belgium.
The Institution procured for the Society of Studies and Expansion
from the various bureaus of this Government such publications as it
was thought would answer the purpose in question.

Last year mention was made of the fact that a shipment weighing
over 25,000 pounds had been made to the library of the University of
Louvain, and that that consignment was the largest single shipment
ever forwarded through the Smithsonian Exchange Service to one ad-
dress at one time. While that statement still holds good, it might be
of interest to note here that during the last three months of the cur-
rent fiscal year three shipments were made to the German Exchange
Agency for distribution to various addresses throughout Germany
which weighed over 30,000 pounds each. These shipments, as I have
mentioned in the foregoing part of this report, were made up of
exchanges suspended during the war.

During the year 2,752 boxes were used in forwarding exchanges
to foreign agencies for distribution, being an increase of 393 over
the number for the preceding 12 months. This is the largest number
of boxes shipped abroad through the exchange service in one year,
being about 300 more than are handled during a normal year. It is,
of course, due to the accumulations received for the countries with
which exchange relations were resumed. The gross weight of the
boxes forwarded abroad aggregated a total of 546,279 pounds, being
an increase of 81,093 pounds over the preceding year.

Of the total number of boxes sent abroad, 383 contained full sets
of United States official documents for authorized depositories and
2,369 included departmental and other publications for depositories
of partial sets and for miscellaneous correspondents.

The number of boxes sent to each country is given in the following
table:

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTAL
DOCUMENTS.

In accordance with the terms of a convention concluded at Brussels
March 15, 1886, and under authority granted by Congress in resolu-
tions approved March 2, 1867, and March 2, 1901, there are now sent
through the exchange service regularly to depositories abroad 57
full sets of United States official documents and 39 partial sets—
Poland having been added during the year to the list of those coun-
tries receiving full sets, and Latvia and the Library of the League of
Nations, located in Geneva, Switzerland, to the list of those receiving
partial sets. The number of full and partial sets now being sent
abroad, it will be seen, is 96. The total number provided by law for
the use of the Library of Congress and for international exchange
is 100.

The full set of documents sent to Poland is deposited in the
Bibliothéque du Ministére des Relations Extérieures, Warsaw. The
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

partial set for Latvia is deposited in the office of the prime minister
at Riga.

I stated last year that it was understood that the Czechoslovak de-
pository would be the Ministére de l’Instruction Publique, at Prague.
Information has since been received from the Government of
Czechoslovakia to the effect that the United States official documents
would be deposited in the Bibliothéque de Assemblée Nationale in
Prague.

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL JOURNALS.

The interparliamentary exchange is separate and distinct from the
exchange of official documents referred to above and is carried on
by this Institution in behalf of the United States Government in
accordance with authority granted in a resolution of Congress ap-
proved March 4, 1909, the purpose of that resolution being to carry
into effect the provisions of the second convention, concluded at
Brussels March 15, 1886, providing for the immediate exchange of
the official journal as well as of the parliamentary annals and docu-
ments, to which the United States was one of the signatories.

While the Government of Poland has not signified its adherence
to the above-mentioned convention, it has entered into the immediate
exchange with the United States.

APPENDIX 6.
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1921:

The appropriations allowed by Congress in the sundry civil act
included $125,000 for the regular maintenance of the park, $80,000
for the purchase of additional land, and $200 for miscellaneous print-
ing and binding.

Prices on almost all necessary supplies remained high during the
early months of the year and, as a consequence, only very limited
funds were available for repairs or permanent improvements. In
the later months there was a decided drop in the prices of several
items of food for animals, and particularly in forage, so that a few
long-delayed repairs and improvements, some of them begun five
years ago but discontinued for lack of funds, could be undertaken.

The number of animals on exhibition is greater than at any period
since 1912; the number of species represented is greater than ever
before; and the scientific importance and actual monetary value of
the collections far exceed any previous year in the history of the
park. A new record for attendance was also reached, due in a meas-
ure to the recent rapid development of near-by residential sections,
but in a greater measure due to increased interest by the public in the
animal collections and in the recreational features offered by such
an establishment.

ACCESSIONS.

Gifts—An unusual number of animals were added to the collec-
tion as gifts, or were placed by friends of the park on indefinite
deposit. The total number of specimens received in this manner was
178, and the donations included numerous rare and important species.

Mr. Isaac Ellison, of Singapore, presented to the park a fine young
male orang-utan, about 3$ years old. No specimen of this ape had
been on exhibition in Washington for many years, and the addition to
the collection of an example so thrifty is gratifying. Mr. Ellison
brought the orang-utan, together with a Javan macaque, with him
from Singapore, while on a visit to America.

The Canadian Government, through Mr. J. B. Harkin, Commis-
sioner of Dominion Parks, presented four mountain goats and two

82
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

Rocky Mountain sheep, all captured in the Rocky Mountains Park
and shipped from Banff, Alberta. The sheep, both ewes, are most
welcome additions to the small herd received from the same source
in 1917, which has done so weil in our paddocks. The mountain goats
are the first on exhibition here in many years, and in the large range
prepared especially for them have attracted great attention. A
young male, born here May 20, 1921, appears to be a thrifty animal.

Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., who has for many
years taken great interest in the National Zoological Park, and has,
from time to time, added many rare and unusual animals to the col-
lection, presented during the year a young male Kadiak bear, a pair
of Count Raggi’s birds of paradise, and some valuable parrots. The
bear gives promise of becoming an exceptionally large individual,
and no species of bird of paradise has before been shown in the park.

Four shipments from tropical America added, by gift, a number
of species new to the collections. Dr, F. W. Goding, American con-
sul general at Guayaquil, Ecuador, transmitted specimens of the
giant Galapagos tortoise, one each from Albemarle Island and In-
defatigable Island. The Indefatigable Island species is very rare
and had never before been on exhibition. Hon. Henry D. Baker,
American consul at Trinidad, British West Indies, sent specimens
of the Trinidad brocket deer and agouti. Mr. Stuart H. Gillmore
and Mr. Walter C. B. Morse, of Washington, brought with them
from Surinam a small collection of animals, including specimens of
the golden-hooded oriole and weeping capuchin. Dr. Paul Bartsch,
of the National Museum, collected and presented four large ground
iguanas from Andros Island and an additional specimen of the great
white heron from the Florida Keys.

Mr. A. K. Haagner, director of the zoological garden at Pretoria,
South Africa, brought to America, as a gift to the park, a specimen
of his recently discovered Rhodesian baboon.

Seventy-two individual donors contributed to the collection during

the year. The complete list is as follows:

Mr. H. EB. Allen, Washington, D. C., red-and-blue-and-yellow macaw.

Dr. Wade H. Atkinson, Washington, D. C., Virginia opossum.

Births —Fifty-five mammals were born and 21 birds were hatched
in the park during the year. As usual, these records include only
such as are reared to a reasonable age, no account being made in these
published statistics of young that live only a few days. The births
include: European brown bear, 4; dingo, 2; great gray kangaroo, 1;
red kangaroo, 3; black-tailed wallaby, 2; rufous-bellied wallaby, 1;
brush-tailed rock wallaby, 1; Australian opossum, 1; rhesus monkey,
4: mona, 1; mountain goat, 1; Rocky Mountain sheep, 1; Indian
antelope, 2; American bison, 8; llama, 3; guanaco, 1; Virginia deer,
4; black-tailed deer, 3; fallow deer, 1; Japanese deer, 3; hog deer, 3;
barasingha, 2; red deer, 6; American elk, 2. Birds hatched were of
the following species: White ibis, American coot, wood duck, canary,
and peafowl.

Exchanges.—Vhere were received during the year, in exchange for
surplus stock, 57 mammals, 152 birds, and 6 reptiles. The most
important of these accessions were a large collection of Australasian
birds from Mr. E. S. Joseph, the well-known animal dealer of Syd-
ney, Australia, and a collection of African mammals from Mr.
A. K. Haagner, Pretoria, South Africa. Among the birds received
from Mr. Joseph are such desirable species as the pied goose, Kyton’s
tree duck, Australian black duck, Pacific gull, white-bellied sea eagle,
golden-shouldered paroquet, and satin bower-bird. African mam-
mals included in the exchange from Mr. Haagner were a lechwe ante-
lope, 2 blesboks, a springbok, an African porcupine, a chacma baboon,
and a specimen of Wahlberg’s mongoose. Other valuable mammals
received in exchange from miscellaneous sources are 2 Barbary apes
from Gibraltar, white-collared, black, and sooty mangabeys, an

101257—22—_7
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

Arabian baboon, 2 ruffed lemurs, 2 Malay porcupines, 2 palm civets,
and a Florida manatee.

The birds received in exchange include also 2 sun-bitterns, 2 black-
necked swans, 2 Cape Barren geese, 4 upland geese, an Indian jabiru,
a sarus crane, scarlet ibis, yellow-wattled lapwing, and numerous
small birds of various kinds. Five tree iguanas and a large boa con-
strictor were received from South America.

Purchases.—Only 9 mammals, 45 birds, and 9 reptiles were pur-
chased during the year, as the limited funds available would not per-
mit of much expenditure for stock. The mammals purchased were
4 armadillos, 2 gray foxes, a Florida lynx, a pigtailed monkey, and
one bandicoot. Birds purchased were mostly hawks, owls, and water-
fowl at low cost, but some exceptionally valuable specimens were also
obtained. A specimen of the rare kagu from New Caledonia Island,
and of the Nepalese paroquet from India, represent species new to
the collection.

Transfers.—The Biological Survey of the Department of Agricul-
ture continued its contributions to the collection. Two young pumas
or mountain lions from the Kaibab Forest, Utah, through Mr.
George E. Holman; and three young pumas from Arizona, through
Mr. M. E. Musgrave, were among the most valuable transfers from
the survey. Mr. Vernon Bailey, chief field naturalist, contributed
an interesting collection of small mammals, including various species
of pocket mice, kangaroo rats, spermophiles, and other rodents. Two
little brown cranes from Nebraska were also transferred from field
agents of the Biological Survey.

Captured in the park.—F ive birds and 2 reptiles, captured within
the National Zoological Park, were added to the collection.

Deposited.—A. few parrots and other birds and one reptile, needed
for exhibition, were accepted on deposit. Owing to the greatly
increased work at the park and the small force of keepers employed
to care for the growing collections, it has been necessary to refuse
birds and mammals offered on deposit, and subject to recall by the
owner, unless the specimens represent species which add distinctly
to the exhibition value of the collection.

REMOVALS.

Surplus animals sent away in exchange for other stock during
the year included 62 mammals, 45 birds, and 12 reptiles. Most of
the surplus animals were born in the park. Among the specimens
so exchanged were a young hippopotamus, 5 American bison, 1 yak,
1 East African eland, 1 Indian antelope, 4 llamas, 2 American elk,
11 European red deer, 2 Japanese deer, 2 red kangaroos, 2 European
brown bears, 2 African lions, 1 mountain lion, 4 gray foxes, 2 wolves,

i, a ——
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87

2 coypus, 3 rhesus monkeys, a number of waterfowl, peafowl, and
other birds, and 12 alligators.

A number of animals on deposit were returned to owners.

The death rate remains very low; for mammals and birds about as

- in the past four years; for reptiles much lower. Among the most

serious losses of mammals long in the collection must be mentioned
the death of the vicuia (Lama vicugna) from enteritis on Septem-
ber 7, 1920. This animal was received at the park on November 24,
1908, and thus had been in the collection nearly 12 years. A female
zebu (Los indicus), received when about 3 years old, on April 11,
1899, died on March 25, 1921, only a few days under 22 years from
date of arrival. A male American elk, born in the park May 31,
1910, died November 5, 1920. The male Kenai Peninsula black bear
(Ursus americanus perniger), received when a cub of about 2 years
of age, March 5, 1903, died of internal. hemorrhage, June 23, 1921,
after 18 years and 3 months in the park. A coyote (Canis latrans),
received April 26, 1906, died September 28, 1920; a paca (Cuniculus
paca), received April 11, 1908, died January 3, 1921, of acute conges-
tion of the lungs; and a brown macaque (Jfacaca speciosa), received
July 30, 1910, died of gastroenteritis on November 26, 1920.

Three birds with long records were lost during the year. A red-
and-blue macaw (Avra chloroptera), received as a gift from the gov-
ernor of the State of Para, Brazil, August 7, 1899, died nearly 21
years later, on July 3, 1920. A yellow-shouldered parrot (Amazona
barbadensis), received from Hon. E. H. Plumacher, American consul
at Maracaibo, Venezuela, September 10, 1902, died on January 26,
1921; and a demoiselle crane, received July 2, 1903, died on June 18,
1921.

Other serious losses were a female bison, died of metritis, July 7,

This is a gain in the collection of 59 species and 118 individuals
over the total for June 30, 1920. The number of species shown is
greater than ever before in the history of the park.

VISITORS.

For the second time the official attendance records exceed 2,000,000.
The total number of visitors to the park for the fiscal year, as deter-
mined by count and estimate was 2,400,837, a gain of 171,282 over
the record of last year. The greatest attendance in any one month
was 390,988, in March, 1921, an average per day of 12,612.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 95

The attendance by months was as follows: In 1920—July, 172,500;
August, 211,600; September, 190,900; October, 323,150; November,
104,548; December, 78,050. In 1921—January, 171,776; February,
103,375; March, 390,988; April, 193,975; May, 276,475; June, 183,500.

One hundred and twenty-four schools and classes, with a total of
13,629 individuals, visited the park during the year. The number
is eae in excess of previous years, which have shown a steady
increase. The American Ornithologists’ Union, then in convention
in Washington, visited the park on Nocenher 12, 1920; and the
American Society of Mammalogists held an informal meeting, with
luncheon, at the superintendent’s office May 4, 1921.

IMPROVEMENTS. ©

About 150 chestnut trees, many of large size, that had been killed
during the past few years by the prevalent bark disease, were logged
during the winter. A small, secondhand sawmill and a shingle mill
were purchased at low cost, and 140,000 feet of choice chestnut lum-
ber and about 80,000 shingles were Balvaeed by the operations. The
dead chestnut trees were “scattered through the undeveloped forest
area in the northwestern part of the park, bordering Klingle Road;
and as great care was taken in logging, there has resulted very little
lees to the beauty of the odd A few young chestnut trees not
yet affected by the blight were left standing. With the sawmill on
hand it will be possible to save much choice lumber from time to
time as trees die or are removed in the development of the park.

In continuation of the policy inaugurated two years ago, of widen-
ing the main automobile roads crossing the park, the section of road-
way between the concourse and the scales near the camel yards and
stable was broken up and rebuilt. Other sections of the roads were
repaired, and the ford across Rock Creek near Klingle entrance was
rebuilt with cement and the approaches improved. A cement side-
walk, 10 feet wide, corresponding to the walk on the north side of
the entrance road at the Harvard Street gate was constructed on the
south side from this entrance to the cement bridge. The number of
visitors entering the park by this gate has greatly increased with
the development of the Mount Pleasant section of the city, and the
increased sidewalk area has been badly needed for several years.

The great flight cage for large birds has been entirely cleaned, the
steel framework and wire covering scraped, and treated to two coats
of paint. The roof of the camel and Ilama house has been repaired ;
and a new hot-water heating boiler installed in the monkey house.

Minor improvements made during the year include Telford pave-
ments in several of the paddocks, a shed for tools at the machine
shop, preparation of a large paddock for the mountain goats, new
96 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

guard rails bordering the inclosure for the Sumatran elephants,
‘ painting of the puma cages and other ironwork, and the construc-
tion of new trash receptacles and park benches.

CLEAN-PARK CAMPAIGN.

Regardless of park regulations, the paper and trash nuisance
reached such serious proportions during the early spring months
that a special campaign to enforce the laws against throwing and
leaving rubbish on the lawns was inaugurated. With few excep-
tions visitors have taken kindly to the requests of officers that all
papers and other refuse be gathered up and deposited in the trash
receptacles, and a very distinct improvement in the appearance of
the grounds has resulted.

With the greatly increased attendance, and especially with the
present popularity of the grounds for picnic purposes, the absolute
enforcement of the rubbish law is imperative. Additional trash
baskets have been provided, and it is the intention to carry the cam-
paign to a point where every visitor will realize the importance of
the regulations and the seriousness of a disregard for park cleanli-
ness. The aid of the public has been solicited by signs calling at-
tention to the paper and trash nuisance, with a request for help.
The response from the majority of visitors is gratifying, and the
untidy small minority will, if necessary, be dealt with by sterner
methods.

ALTERATIONS OF BOUNDARIES.

The purchase of the land necessary for the protection of the
Connecticut Avenue entrance was completed during the year. The
area acquired by purchase, and the included highways which by the
same act become a part of the National Zoological Park, make an
addition of 247,261.9 square feet or approximately 5% acres. The
total area of the National Zoological Park is now about 175 acres.
The unexpended balance of $2,403.66, left from the appropriation of
$80,000 made for the purchase of this land, is reappropriated in the
sundry civil bill for 1922 toward the purchase of certain lots near the
Adams Mill Road entrance to the park, between the park and Adams
Mill Road. The owners having declined to sell these lots within
the price limits set by the act, steps have been taken toward the
institution of proceedings of condemnation.

IMPORTANT NEEDS.

Restaurant.—The most urgent improvement needed for the park
is a suitable public restaurant. As pointed out in previous reports,
the old refreshment stand, originally constructed as a temporary
building when the attendance was only a small fraction of its present
.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97

figures, is not only in a bad state of repair but is wholly inadequate
for the required service. The estimated cost of a suitable building
a year ago was $65,400. Since the park has now obtained, as men-
tioned above, a large quantity of first-class chestnut lumber, includ-
ing many heavy timbers, new plans have recently been drawn by the
municipal architect with the idea of utilizing this lumber to ad-
vantage. It is now believed that a restaurant building in every way
suitable to the demands of the place, and probably more in keeping
with the surroundings, can be constructed for $40,000.
Small-mammal house—A. building properly constructed for the

- exhibition of small mammals has long been needed, but never so

much as at the present time. Numerous small animals now in the
collection can not be shown for lack of quarters, and it is evident that
more and more interest is being taken by visitors in the smaller
species now on exhibition.

Grading banks and filling ravines—During the present year some
progress will be made in continuing the work of grading in the west-
central part of the park. This work was begun five years ago but
was discontinued during the war. Not only will a large area of
comparatively flat space for deer yards and other paddocks result
from the work, but the filling in of a near-by ravine will make
possible the elimination of a dangerous curve in the main automobile
road. It is greatly to be hoped that it will be possible to complete
this work within the next year, so that the unsightly condition of
that portion of the park adjoining the principal highway of traffic
can be corrected and the ground utilized to advantage for the ex-
hibition of animals.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Sir: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the fol-
lowing passage of the sundry civil act, approved June’5, 1919:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assistants,
purchase of necessary books and periodicals, apparatus, making necessary ob-
servations in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, and miscel-
laneous expenses, $13,000.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within an
inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian admin-
istration building at Washington, and also a cement observing station
and frame cottage for observers on a plot of 10,000 square feet leased
from the Carnegie Solar Observatory, on Mount Wilson, Calif.

A new solar observing station was erected in July, 1920, at the ex-
pense of funds donated for the purpose by Mr. John A. Roebling, of
Bernardsville, N. J., and this station has been occupied as a solar
radiation observing station by the Astrophysical Observatory since
October, 1920.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory owned by the Government is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace the
outfit for the purposes of the investigation.

WORK OF THE YEAR.

At Washington.—The preparation of the manuscript for Volume
IV of the Annals of the Observatory was continued. Owing to the
postponement of its publication, it has required to be brought up to
date by repeated additions and modifications, and it is now expected
to publish in Volume IV all the results up to September, 1920, when
the solar radiation apparatus which had been employed on Mount
Wilson was removed to Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz. A great deal of
measuring and computing was required to bring up to date the work
of 1919 and 1920 on the solar constant of radiation and to work up
the results of the observations of the distribution of light over the
sun’s disk, which have been carried on since 1916 with only partial
reduction. This work went on under Mr. Fowle’s direction, assisted
by Mrs. Bond, computer, and for a few months by temporary com-
puters, Miss Inez Ensign and Miss Esther Weaver. The cost of em-

98
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 99

ploying these computers temporarily was borne by a gift of Mr.
John A. Roebling. At the close of the fiscal year the computations
of the Annals had been very nearly completed. The manuscript of
the volume was also almost ready for publication, and it is hoped to
put the whole to press early in the autumn of 1921.

As usual, a large amount of delicate instrument work has been
done by Mr. A. Kramer, instrument maker, and still more delicate
parts have been prepared by Mr. L. B. Aldrich, of the observatory
staff. They have prepared and standardized a number of pyrhelio-
meters, pyranometers, galvanometers, and bolometers for the use of
the observatory and its stations.

By invitation of Dr. George E. Hale, director of the Solar Observa-
tory at Mount Wilson, Calif., Doctor Abbot has undertaken the prepa-
ration of a special spectrobolometer for the observation of the energy
spectra of the stars in the same manner in which we are accustomed
to observe the energy spectrum of the sun. This outfit comprises a
special spectroscope, a vacuum bolometer of special dimensions and
construction, and a vacuum galvanometer designed to be of the very
highest order of sensitiveness. The construction of this apparatus
had been almost completed at the close of the fiscal year.

Work in the field—As stated in last year’s report, by the gener-
osity of Mr. John A. Roebling, of Bernardsville, N. J., not only has
the private station of the Smithsonian Insitution located near Cal-
ama, Chile, been removed to the top of a mountain about 8 miles
farther south, but the station of the Astrophysical Observatory has
been relocated on the mountain called Harqua Hala, situated about 100
miles to the northwest of Pheonix, Ariz. In June, 1920, Doctor Abbot
selected the site for the latter station and arranged with local con-
tractors for the erection of an adobe building about 40 feet long,
10 feet wide, of two stories. The lower story, underground, was
designed for the instruments, and the upper story for a dwelling
house and computing rooms for the observers. Proceeding from
Arizona to Mount Wilson, Doctor Abbot was joined early in July by
Mr. L. B. Aldrich, and together they carried out at Mount Wilson, in
July, August, and part of September, the usual observations on the
solar constant of radiation and on the distribution of radiation over
the sun’s disk. In addition, they conducted a number of other in-
vestigations, including a redetermination of the constants of the
secondary pyrheliometers employed in the research, a redetermina-
tion of the transmission of the spectrobolometer for different wave
lengths, various investigations with the pyranometer and the
Angstrém pyrgeometer, and, assisted by Mrs. Abbot, investigations
on the use of solar radiation for cooking purposes.

The solar cooking outfit erected on Mount Wilson some years ago
was in 1920, for the first time, brought to a reasonable degree of per-
100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

fection. The mirror, which is of parabolic cylindrical shape, about 10
feet long and 7 feet wide, brings the solar radiation to focus on a tube
filled with oil which passes up the axis of the mirror, parallel to the
earth’s axis, and about this tube, on suitable rollers, the mirror is
rotated by means of a simple and inexpensive clockwork, in order that
it may always face toward the sun. The oil tube is connected with a
reservoir of oil about 10 feet higher up and from this a return tube
coes underneath the mirror, thus completing the circuit for the
flow of oil which the mirror, by focusing the sun rays, strongly
heats. The reservoir contains about a barrel of oil, which is such
as is used for lubricating gas-engine cylinders. The reservoir and
the oil circuit tubes are protected from the loss of heat, as far as
possible, by insulation. The greatest loss of heat, however, occurs
with the naked tube which passes through the mirror. This, how-
ever, is protected by a glass tube 4 inches in diameter, and this, in
turn, by flat sheets of glass covering the whole mirror and protecting
it from dust and wind. Two ovens are inserted in the rear of the
reservoir, which is just outside the door of the observer’s cottage
on Mount Wilson, and food after being prepared in the kitchen,
may be baked, boiled, or stewed in these ovens, according to the
character of the dish. Nearly all of the food prepared for the use
of the observers during their stay on Mount Wilson, from July 1 to
September 15, was cooked by this solar cooker. The great advantage
of the cooking is that the reservoir stays hot for a good many hours,
so that cooking may be continued through the night or even through
a partially cloudy day. The apparatus proved to be especially satis-
factory for the canning of fruit.

In the early part of September Messrs. Abbot and Aldrich packed
the apparatus which had been used on Mount Wilson for observing
the solar constant of radiation and shipped the same to Wenden,
Ariz., the nearest railroad station leading to Mount Harqua Hala.
The apparatus was set up for observations by the end of September,
and Doctor Abbot, with Mr. F. A. Greeley as assistant, carried on
solar radiation measurements beginning October 3 continuously
until January 20, 1921, when Doctor Abbot was relieved by Mr. L. B.
Aldrich, who in turn was relieved by Mr. A. F. Moore, formerly
director of the observatory at Calama and Montezuma, Chile, who
reported for duty about April 20. It is intended to carry on the
solar constant observations at Mount Harqua Hala on all days when
the weather permits for several years in cooperation with the similar
observations being made at Montezuma, Chile. With the results of
the two stations, it is hoped to furnish a sound basis for the study of
. solar variation and the dependence of terrestrial weather conditions
thereon. The station at Mount Harqua Hala was erected after a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 101

considerable investigation by the United States Weather Bureau of
sites in California, Arizona, and Nevada. From the middle of Sep-
tember, when Messrs. Abbot and Aldrich arrived in the vicinity,
until some time in February the conditions were found to be superior
to what had been expected. About 70 per cent of the days during
that interval were fit for observation. The months of March, April,
and May proved to be less satisfactory than was anticipated, owing
to a thick haziness and much cirrus cloud. This defect, however,
seems to be attending the generally unusual character of the weather
in large areas of the globe. During the first four months of the
year 1921, for instance, hardly more than half of the usual number of
observations were made at the station in Chile, and other facts might
be cited which would tend to show that the earlier part of the year
1921 was of very unusual character from a weather standpoint.

The station on Mount Harqua Hala, being 15 miles from Wenden,
the railroad station, and 5 miles from a wagon road, is very isolated.
The effect of such isolation on the morale of observers was very
thoughtfully considered by Mr. John A. Roebling, and he added con-
siderably to his first gift in order to provide a great many things for
the comfort and recreation of the observers, both in Arizona and
South America. Not all of these arrangements had been completed
at the close of the fiscal year, so that mention of them may be de-
ferred more properly to next year’s report.

PERSONNEL.

Miss F. A. Graves resigned as computer on August 10, 1920.

SUMMARY.

The year has been marked by the transfer of the solar radiation
measurements from Mount Wilson, Calif., to Mount Harqua Hala,
Ariz., to secure more perfect weather conditions. It is intended to
continue solar constant observations there daily when possible
throughout the entire year for several years. Similar duplicate ob-
servations are to be carried on at Montezuma, Chile, at the private
station of the Smithsonian. Thus it is hoped to provide an excellent
basis of solar radiation measurements to compare with weather
phenomena. This may lead to advance in methods of weather fore-
casting. Volume IV of the annals, covering the years 1912 to 1920,
is practically ready for the press.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Bureau of the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921:

All volumes of the fourteenth annual issue have been published,
completing the catalogue through the year 1914. Financial condi-
tions, brought about by the war and the excessive advance in the
cost of publication, have since made it necessary to temporarily sus-
pend printing the catalogue. Much of the material for 1915 and
subsequent years is in the hands of the London central bureau ready
for publication as soon as financial support is assured and publica-
tion costs are more nearly normal.

The work of this bureau during the year has consisted in collect-
ing data from periodicals regularly publishing scientific papers, of
which there are about 550 in the United States. In addition to these
there are over 400 occasionally containing scientific matter. Book
notices, reviews, and publishers’ lists and the publications received
through exchange by the Smithsonian Institution are also system-
atically used in order to make sure that no paper coming within the
scope of the catalogue is overlooked. Reference slips are prepared
for each paper thus collected, and the contents classified to conform
to the International Catalogue subject schedule. Practically all of
the classification is done by specialists, and much difficulty is ex-
perienced in obtaining suitable aid for this part of the work, owing
to the very limited funds available. This lack of funds has always
seriously interfered with the work of the bureau; but as much of the
data through the year 1920 have been classified and are now held
pending the resumption of publication, it is hoped that by the time
it is called for by the central bureau most of the index cards will be
ready, and that when the published volumes have been brought up
to date a larger annual appropriation will be granted, so that all cur-
rent publications may be immediately dealt with.

When it is considered that between 25,000 and 30,000 reference
cards have annually been furnished by this bureau, some idea of the
amount of expert and clerical labor involved is apparent.

As a résumé of the history of the enterprise was published in the
report of this bureau for the last fiscal year, it is unnecessary to again
repeat it excepting to state that financial difficulties have not been
relieved, although, owing to assurances made by influential delegates

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 103

to a conference held under the auspices of the Royal Society in
London during September, 1920, it appears that if certain conditions
can be met financial support may be looked for from the United States.
This conference, called by the Royal Society to consider the future of
the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, was held in
London September 28 and 29, 1920. The following delegates at-
tended, representing the countries named: Denmark, Prof. M.
Knudsen; France, M. A. Lacroix; Holland, Dr. G. van Rijnberk;
Japan, Dr. Hantaro Nagaoka; Norway, Mr. Rolf Laache; Sweden,
Baron Alstrémer; Switzerland, Dr. Hermann Escher, Dr. Marcel
Godet, Dr. H. Field; United States, Dr. Robert M. Yerkes (National
Research Council), Dr. L. E. Dickson (National Academy of
Sciences), Mr. L. C. Gunnell (Smithsonian Institution) ; India, Sir
H. H. Hayden, F. R. S.; New Zealand, Prof. A. Denby, F. R. S.;
Victoria, Prof. E. W. Skeats; South Africa, Sir Thomas Muir,
¥, R. S.; West Australia, Mr. C. B. Rushton. Representing the
Royal Society: Sir Joseph Thompson, president R. S.; Sir David
Prain, treasurer R. 8.; Mr. J. H. Jeans, secretary R. S.; Prof. H. E.
Armstrong, F. R. S.; Dr. F. A. Bather, F. R.S.; Dr. P. C. Mitchell,
F. R. S.; Sir Arthur Schuster, F. R. S. There were also present
Dr. S. I. Franz (United States of America), representing the Rocke-
feller Foundation, and Sir F. G. Ogilvie and Mr. L. 8. Lloyd (Great
Britain). Two Italian delegates, Prof. Raffaello Nasini and Comm.
Ing. Ernesto Mancini, were delayed on the journey and did not arrive
until the end of the conference. These two distinguished Italian
representatives were very earnest in their desire to see the catalogue
continued, and both agreed with the decisions of the other delegates.

After two days taken up in considering the financial situation as
presented by the Royal Society, and discussion of the general affairs
of the enterprise, the following resolutions were agreed on unani-
mously:

1. That the catalogue should be temporarily continued in its present form
for the year 1915 and possibly also as a single issue for the period 1916-1920,
provided adequate financial support can be obtained.

That at the earliest possible date opportunity be taken to reconsider the whole
character of the subsequent work of organization.

That one of the first questions to be considered be the possibility of convert-
ing the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature into a cumulative sub-
ject and authors’ index, the volumes of which shall be published at intervals
of 3, 5, or 10 years, in accordance with the status and needs of their respective
sciences; and that the materials shall be obtained so far as practicable in co-
operation with the abstracting journals of the world and other agencies afford-
ing rapid information, including regional bureaus.

Tt was also agreed unanimously—

2. That, inasmuch as the Royal Society is no longer able to accept financial

responsibility for the catalogue, it is essential that adequate financial support,
including working capital, be provided.
104 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921,

Further, the opinion was expressed by the delegates generally (other than
those representing the Royal Society) that the Royal Society, being relieved of
financial responsibility, should otherwise act as heretofore.

Finally the conference resolved—

3. That a committee be appointed to draw up definite proposals in accordance
with the above resolutions and that the report of the committee be forwarded
to the council of the Royal Society.

4. That the council of the Royal Society be requested to take such steps with
regard to the recommendations of this committee as they think fit.

The committee appointed under the resolution 3 made the follow-
ing recommendations, subject to adequate financial provision being
assured :

(a) That the central bureau be instructed to proceed with publication of
the 1915 issue.

(b) That the central bureau be further instructed to collect material for the
period 1916=1920 with a view to the early publication of the issue 1916-1920.

The committee further recommended—

(c) That the council of the Royal Society request the executive committee
of the International Council of the Catalogue to proceed to collect information
as to the various issues raised in the foregoing resolutions of the conference
and to report at as early a date as possible.

The fourteenth issue was not completed at the time of the meet-
ing. Below is a table showing the receipts and expenditures of the
London central bureau on account of the first 13 issues:

1 The war began before the eleventh issue was completed, so that the falling off in receipts during the
last three years may be attributed to loss of subscriptions from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and
Belgium.
2 The increased expenditures on the thirteenth issue arises from that issue having taken two years instead
of one to complete.

From this table it will be seen that on the completion of the tenth
‘ issue, before war conditions interfered, receipts and expenditures
practically balanced, and it is apparent that had not these unex-

pected conditions arisen the whole enterprise would have been self-
sustaining. Before war began many changes were contemplated to
improve the service rendered by the catalogue and bring it more
nearly to the high standard set by the original brilliantly conceived
plan which so many of the world’s leading men of science had taken
part in formulating and which was referred to in some detail in the
last annual report of this bureau.

There is and has been no question of the need and value of an
International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, and it is the opinion
of almost everyone interested in such matters that no better plan has
ever been presented to accomplish the ends sought. Any new en-
terprise would lack the greatest present asset of the catalogue, which
is the official support of most of the civilized nations, and it is with
this support practically assured for the future that the catalogue
will start in its endeavor to gain the financial assistance necessary
to compensate for losses caused by the late war.

New agencies, such as abstract journals representing all branches
of science, are to be undertaken by other organizations, and it is
through cooperation with these that the catalogue is to be produced
in the future, thus meeting all requirements of scientific workers as
well as those of reference libraries and of those engaged in general
investigation.

From the attitude of the foreign delegates at the conference it is
apparent that there exists no lack of interest or desire to continue
the work, but all of these countries are now under unprecedented
financial strain, which is greatly increased by abnormal rates of ex-
change, so for the present, at least, their aid must be less than it
would be during normal times. There is in this country a growing
interest in supplying the needs of scientific workers, and plans are
under way to publish abstract journals in all branches of science not
already represented. These plans were brought to the notice of the
conference by the American delegates, representing the National
Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council, and by a repre-
sentative of the Rockefeller Foundation, who was present. Irom
statements there made it appears that the money needed to establish
these enterprises is available and the resolutions of the conference
took into account cooperation with these new organizations for the
common benefit of the publishing bodies and of scientific investi-
gators.

Very respectfully, yours,
Lronarp C. GUNNELL,
Assistant in Charge.
Dr. CHartes D. Watcort,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 9.
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the library of the Smithsonsian Institution for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1921:

The number of packages received was 27,327, an increase over
the preceding year of 3,577. Of these 25,156 were received by mail
and 2,171 through the International Exchange Service. Many of
the packages received through the international exchanges, it might
be mentioned, were exceptionally large, consisting of publications
issued during the years 1914 to 1920, when it was not possible to
send them on account of the war.

SMITHSONIAN MAIN LIBRARY.

In order that material received for the Smithsonian Library may
be made available to the public at the earliest possible moment,
publications have been transmitted daily, as in years past, to the
Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress. The number of
publications so transmitted was 6,250, composed of 4,910 complete
volumes, 607 parts of volumes, 721 pamphlets, and 12 charts. The
accession numbers extended from 534,619 to 537,229. Four thousand
four hundred and sixty-four foreign government documents, pre-
sented to the Smithsonian Institution were transferred to the
Library of Congress in accordance with the established practice.

Material from abroad has been steadily coming in, and the re-
ceipts for the year have been much larger than was anticipated. The
number of authors’ reprints and theses from German universities and
institutes of technology has been exceptionally large, covering the
years 1914 to 1920. These were received from the universities of
Berlin, Breslau, Frankfurt-am-Main, Freiburg-im-Breisgau, Halle-
an-der Saale, Heidelberg, Kiel, Leipzig, Marburg, Ziirich, Dorpat,
Helsingfors, Lund, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Delft, Ghent, Leiden,
and Utrecht; and from the institutes of technology at Berlin,
Braunschweig, Stockholm, Utrecht, and Ziirich.

Cataloguing.—As will be seen by comparison, the cataloguing ac-
complished has been more than double that of last year.

Large as the amount of cataloguing has been, however, in com-
parison with last year, it has not been sufficient to meet the demands
occasioned by the receipts; and many of the reprints and theses
remain uncatalogued.

Periodicals—The number of entries at the periodical desk was
14,008. Nine hundred and forty-five volumes were completed.

Hachanges—The securing of publications in exchange for the
completion of sets in the Library of Congress has been continued,
with the following results:

OFFICH LIBRARY.

Accessions to the office library, including the aeronautical collec-
tion, the collection of Bonaparteana, the art room collection, and
the employees’ library, numbered 317 volumes, 4 parts of volumes,
and 468 pamphlets. This does not include many periodicals, of
which the current numbers are kept on file in the reading room, and
the completed volumes transmitted at the end of the year to the
Library of Congress. The library is greatly indebted to Dr. Frank
Wigglesworth Clarke for the presentation of his unique collection of
authors’ reprints on the determination of the atomic weights, num-
bering 482 titles.

Circulation.—The total circulation of the Library was 3,485, con-
sisting of 2,708 magazines borrowed from the reading room, 506
books from the employees’ library, and 171 from the reference room.
Many volumes which are not permitted to leave the building were
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

consulted, especially reference works and the books of the aero-
nautical collection and the De Peyster collection. .

Bibliography.—rTVhe second volume of the Bibliography of Aero-
nautics, prepared by the assistant librarian, covering the period from
1909 to 1916, was completed and published by the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics. This volume contains approximately
35,000 citations and cross references, and supplements the material
contained in the volume published by the Smithsonian Institution
as volume 55 of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. The
aeronautical library is growing and becoming more and more im-
portant.

MUSEUM LIBRARY,

Continued interest has been manifested during the year in the
increase of the scientific collections of the United States National
‘Museum, Among those who have donated valuable material to the
library may be mentioned Dr. J. M. Aldrich, Mr. H. S. Barber, Mr.
A. H. Clark, Dr. William H. Dall, Dr. O. P. Hay, Dr. W. H. Holmes,
Dr. Walter Hough, Dr. AleS Hrdlicka, Mr. W. R. Maxon, Dr. G. S.
Miller, Dr. C. W. Richmond, Mr. J. H. Riley, Mr. S. A. Rohwer,
Mr. W. Schaus, Mr. W. L. Schmitt, Dr. R. W. Schufeldt, Dr. L.
Stejneger, Mr. B. H. Swales, Dr. Charles D. Walcott, and the late
Dr. Joseph Paxson Iddings.

Especially worthy of mention is the library of the late Doctor
Iddings, comprising upward of 1,000 books and pamphlets, chiefly
on geological subjects. Doctor Iddings, as is well known, was one of
America’s leading petrologists, and his 40 years’ accumulation of
authors’ excerpts on this branch of science was unusually large.
The donation, made through his sister, Mrs. Francis D. Cleveland, is
therefore important. Indeed it forms the most important single
acquisition to the geological section of the library since the founda-
tion of the department in 1880.

The geological and paleontological collections have been further
augmented during the year by the continued gifts of the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Charles D. Walcott, most of the
books donated being volumes of highly technical content and of great
value to those undertaking advanced researches along these lines.

The additions to the sectional library of the division of mollusks
through the gift of Dr. William H. Dall have made possible a con-
tinued study in the United States National Museum of the more re-
cently discovered mollusks and tertiary fossils. The library is greatly
indebted to Doctor Dall, during these times when scientific books of
this character are so expensive and so difficult to secure, for the con-
tinued interest year by year in the selection and presentation of so
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 109

many volumes for this section. The number of titles added this year
by Doctor Dall was 317.

Accessions.—l our thousand seven hundred and sixty volumes were
accessioned during the year, including 2,041 completed volumes and
2,719 pamphlets. The number of books in the library is now 150,067,
of which 58,658 are bound volumes and 91,409 pamphlets and un-
bound papers.

Cataloguing.—Seven hundred and seventy-seven volumes and 2,643
pamphlets were catalogued.

Periodicals —The number of periodicals entered was 15,427,

Loans.—The number of books loaned was 7,432. Of these, 1,778
were borrowed from the Library of Congress, and 105 from other
libraries.

Linding.—Owing to the increased cost of binding, it has been pos-
sible to have only 692 books bound, most of these being volumes
which could not be bound last year, when the funds for this purpose
were exhausted in January, the allotment being sufficient for a period
of six months only. This year the funds were exhausted in Novem-
ber, some two months earlier. An increased allotment for binding
is earnestly recommended.

Technological series —The compiling of a subject and title cata-
logue for material in the technological series is slowly progressing,
and it is hoped that it may be brought to completion within the
course of a year. Additions to the series, exclusive of duplicates,
number 216 bound volumes, 133 pamphlets, 6,372 periodicals. To
the scientific depository catalogue, 1,180 cards have been added, in-
cluding author, title, and subject entries. The books and periodicals
loaned number 210.

Sectional libraries —Y¥ ollowing is a list of sectional libraries:

Administration. Mechanical technology.

States under act of Congress is a permanent fund, having been

of the Charles L. Freer estate stocks of Parke, Davis & Co., repre-
senting a book value of $1,252,710. These stocks pay a quarterly
dividend which is credited proportionately to the several specific
purposes provided for by the testator. The total dividends received
by the institution during the period from October, 1920, to the end
of the year, June 30, 1921, amounted to $25,676.

All payments are made by check, signed by the secretary of the
institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account, except in some in-
stances small deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collec-
tion and later are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the
Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven highly satisfactory. During the year the interest derived
from this source has amounted to $1,066.67.

priations for the fiscal year 1921 intrusted by Congress to the care

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE.

The secretary presented the report, as follows:

DECEMBER 9, 1920.
To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: Your permanent committee hereby submits the following report
on the matters under its supervision for the past year:

Hodgkins fund—Report has already been made of the allotment from this
fund of a total of $23,200 for the establishment and maintenance of a station
at Calama, Chile, at which researches in solar radiation are being conducted
under the direction of Dr. C. G. Abbot, assistant secretary of the institution
and director of its Astrophysical Observatory.

Under an allotment of $5,000 from this fund Dr. R. H. Goddard, of Clark
College, Worcester, Mass., is continuing his work in developing certain devices
to be used in connection with the study of the temperature of the higher atmos-
pheric strata.

The Roebling donation—Dr. Abbot decided that it would be advantageous
if the Calama (Chile) station should be removed to a more satisfactory site.
He planned also to establish a station in the Harqua Hala Mountains of Ari-
zona. There being no funds of the institution available for these purposes,
the matter was placed before Mr. John Roebling, of New Jersey, who generously
contributed $11,000.

Freer Gallery of Art building fund.—The condition of the fund is as follows:

The institution has received $353,004.75 from the Freer estate as a fund pro-
vided by Mr. Freer for a permanent endowment for certain specified purposes.

The residuary legacy has not yet been received by the institution.

In reply to an inquiry, the secretary stated that the residual bequest
consisted of 16,773 shares of Parke, Davis & Co. stock, estimated at
present to be worth $1,677,000. The State of Michigan had assessed
an inheritance tax of over $400,000 on the estate, but efforts were
being made to have this remitted.

Avery bequest——One piece of improved property, yielding a nominal rent,
remains to be sold. The bequest now amounts to $31,527.

Poore bequest.—Several parcels of unimproved land near the city of Lowell,
Mass., constitute the residue of this bequest. They are being sold as favorable
opportunities offer. The bequest now totals $32,588.

The Bruce Hughes bequest, to be used for founding the Hughes Alcove, is
now $10,410.

Consolidated fund.—This fund, which is made up of miscellaneous bequests
and is in excess of the main fund of $1,000,000 deposited in the Treasury of
the United States, amounts to $82,896.02.

On motion, the report was accepted.
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

The secretary submitted his annual report for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1920, with explanatory remarks.
On motion, the report was accepted.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. Tei
THE SECRETARY’S SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT.

The secretary brought before the board a brief statement of the
various activities of the Institution since the issuance of his annual
report.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

One of the most notable additions to the museum will be the col-
lection of the late Herbert Ward, sculptor, of Paris, consisting of
his sculptures of African subjects, and a large collection of African
ethnologica, comprising 7,000 specimens, described as a more com-
plete collection of African material than that even of the late King
of the Belgians. Mrs. Ward has agreed to present this collection
under certain conditions, and the form of agreement is now being
negotiated.

Probably the most interesting accession recorded in the Depart-
ment of Biology since July 1, 1920, is a skeleton of a medium-sized
finback whale from Florida, presented by the Miami Aquarium
Association through its president, Mr. James Asbury Allison.

The beautiful collection of butterflies which the late Prof. J. P.
Iddings had brought together from all parts of the world was pre-
sented to the museum by his estate. It consists of about 2,000 speci-
mens, mostly mounted in glass-covered drawers, so arranged that
they can be pulled out by the public and the contents examined.
The collection will form a separate exhibit.

The Division of Plants also reports a large number of valuable
accessions to the National Herbarium.

The most notable accessions received by the Division of History
since the beginning of the present fiscal year have been connected
with the War Collection. These include a number of objects of ex-
ceptional military interest used during the World War by the French
Army and presented to the museum by the French Government.

The United States Navy Department has added a number of im-
portant exhibits to the already large and interesting series of objects
illustrating the part played in the World War by the United States
Navy.

The collection of objects relating to the war already deposited
by the War Department has also been materially increased.

Among the more important accessions received by the Division
of Mechanical Technology are:

One-quarter size model of Leonardo da Vinci’s aircraft, designed
in 1490 A.D. Model made in the museum from photographic copies
of da Vinci’s own notes.

Mechanical Navigator. A mathematical instrument for solving
all problems in spherical triangles, lent by Col. Willard French
through Mrs. Louise D. French.
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921,

The original United States Trade-Mark No. 1, issued by United
States Patent Office, October 25, 1870, lent by Enoch A. Chase.

The Section of Wood Technology has received through Ambas-
sador Davis, a large piece of timber recently removed from the
unique hammer-beam roof of Westminster Hall, which has been
undergoing extensive repairs under Sir Lionel Earle. The roof was
built by Richard II, between the years 1393 and 1899, and is probably
the most interesting piece of construction of any ancient roof in
existence.

The American Pharmaceutical Society and the United States
Pharmacopeial Convention (Inc.), have deposited in the museum
several boxes of valuable historical documents consisting of manu-
scripts, corrected proof, and circulars, bearing on the development
of the U. S. Pharmacopeeia.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

During the past summer the Chief of the Bureau of American
Ethnology unearthed on the Mesa Verde National Park, Colo., a
temple formerly used by the early inhabitants of this region in the
worship of fire as a symbol of life.

It is highly probable that this lost race, which constructed a large
special building for their fire cult, must have practiced most elaborate
fire ceremonies, far more complicated than the rites of their few
descendants, the Hopi Indians, among whom, however, the new fire
rites still survive as the most elaborate ceremony in their ritual.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Research work.—A new observing station has been established by
Dr. C. G. Abbot, assistant secretary of the institution and director
of the Astrophysical Observatory, on Mount Harqua Hala, in
Arizona, for the purpose of carrying on solar constant measure-
ments, the instruments used in the work having been taken from
the old station on Mount Wilson, Calif.

The instruments were restandardized with the result that the
secondary instruments in daily use were shown to have not altered
appreciably in the many years during which they have been em-
ployed on Mount Wilson.

A new instrument called the “ honeycomb pyranometer ” was used
for measurements of nocturnal radiation. It derives its name from
the fact that it is composed of 200 deep, narrow cells, like a honey-
comb, so that rays which enter the cells, although they may not be
completely absorbed at first, yet by repeated reflections as they go
deeper and deeper within the cells, at length attain to complete
absorption and conversion into heat. These preliminary results give
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 129

promise of much advance in the measurement of rays such as the
earth sends out into space at all Sook which as a whole balance in
their energy the energy of the sun’s rays by which the temperature
of the earth’s surface is maintained.

Through the interest and generosity of Mr. John A. Roebling, of
New Jersey, who gave the institution $11,000 for this purpose, and
through the energy displayed by the several observers concerned,
the solar radiation observing station of the institution, located near
the city of Calama, Chile, was removed to a much more favorable
site on a aotmtain called “ Montezuma,” about 10 miles farther
south, which is between 9,000 and 10,000 feet above sea level.

Details of this work will appear in later reports.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Recent accessions.—Several valuable collections of animals have
reached the park in recent weeks. A young male orang-utan, about
3 years old, together with other animals from that region, was pre-
sented by Mr. Isaac Ellison, of Singapore, Straits Settlements.

Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., who has frequently
shown his great interest by obtaining for the park rare animals
otherwise beyond the limits of park funds, has recently purchased
for the collection a fine young male Kadiak bear and a pair of beau-
tiful Count Raggi’s birds of paradise.

Attendance-——The attendance at the park continues to increase
month by month. Although the fiscal year ending June 30, 1920,
in the number of visitors, over 2,250,000, exceeded all Pope rte the
figures for the first four months of the current year, exceed those for
corresponding months of 1919 by over 67,000. The monthly record
for the first third of the current fiscal year is as follows: July,
172,500; August, 211,600; September, 190,900; October, 323,150.

EXPEDITIONS.

Smithsonian African expedition—Thus far about 100 birds and
100 mammals have arrived, and notice of three additional shipments
has been received. The collection contains three chimpanzees, be-
sides a large number of species from South Africa, a region hitherto
. poorly represented in our museum.

Australian expedition —Dr. William L. Abbott’s generosity toward
the institution has been continued, and an expedition to Australia
financed by him is at present collecting biological specimens for the
museum, while Doctor Abbott himself collected natural history and
anthropological material in Haiti. Since July, 1919, he has provided
$6,000 for collecting in Australia, together with the unused balance
from his previous expedition to Borneo and Celebes, which was trans-
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

ferred to the Australian work, which brings the total of Doctor Ab-
bott’s contributions for field-work to $27,000. ‘Two important collec-
tions have been received recently—one of mammals, birds, and
reptiles from Siam, Annam, and Cochin China, a joint contribution
from Doctor Abbott and Mr. C. B. Kloss, who collected most of the
material; the other from South Australia, collected by Mr. Charles
M. Hoy.

Far East expedition—This expedition was financed by the Rocke-
feller Foundation to the amount of $2,500. Early in 1920 Dr. Ales
Hrdlitka proceeded to Japan and China, to make anatomical studies
of the natives of those countries.

Canadian expedition—TVhe secretary mentioned briefly his geo-
logical work during the past summer in Alberta, Canada, in connec-
tion with the Upper Cambrian formation of that region.

FREER ESTATE MATTERS.

The secretary brought to the board’s attention the clauses in the
will of the late Charles L. Freer, providing funds for various pur-
poses in connection with the Freer Gallery of Art, and for the study
of the civilization of the Far East, and after full discussion resolu-
tions covering these matters were adopted by the board..

Mr. John E. Lodge, of the Boston Museum of Fine Aris, had been
placed in charge of the Gallery, with Miss Katherine N. Rhoades as
temporary assistant. In view of the fact that they and their assist-
ants were responsible for the valuable collections now being un-
packed and distributed through the building, and that visitors seri-
ously interrupted their work, it seemed best to close the building en-
tirely to unauthorized visitors during the period of installation.

Judge Gray offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the recommendation of the secretary that the Freer Building

be closed to visitors during the work of installation be approved by the Board
of Regents.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION,

The secretary said that in view of the steady growth of the Na-
tional Gallery of Art and the position which it should assume in the
development of the fine arts in America, the time had come to con-
sider the method of providing for its administration and develop-
ment.

The officers of the Smithsonian Institution should not be burdened
with responsibility for the formulation of questions of policy as to
purchase and acceptance of art objects, utilization and exhibition of
collections, best methods of future development, securing of funds,
etc. There should be an advisory commission established by the
authority of the Board of Regents, which may consider not only the

PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. TSA.

local questions that would come up from time to time in relation to
the National Gallery but also the broad field of art in America, and
the best methods of the National Gallery cooperating with art insti-
tutions and interested individuals throughout the country and the
world, in order that this phase of the Smithsonian Institution’s
activities shall be made most effective in the increase and diffusion
of knowledge of the fine arts in America.

In view of the completion of the building for the Freer collections
and the receipt of valuable and notable additions to the collections
now deposited in the Natural History Museum, the permanent com-
mittee submits for the board’s consideration the following resolution :

Resolved, That the chancellor is hereby authorized to appoint a committee
of five members of the Board of Regents, with the secretary as an ex officio
member, to consider the question of the appointment of a commission to be
known as the National Gallery of Art Commission; and to report with recom-
mendations to the board either at a special meeting or at its next regular
meeting.

On motion, the resolution was adopted. :

The chancellor appointed the following committtee: Mr. Henry
White, chairman; Senator Lodge; Mr. Henderson; Mr. Brookings;
Mr. Greene; and the secretary.

NEW BUILDING FOR HISTORY AND ART,

The secretary spoke of the need for a suitable building for the
historical and art objects now in the care of the institution, stating
that last year an estimate of $5,000 was submitted for the prepara-
tion of plans for such a building, but that no action had been taken;
and that there was scarcely any probability of its receiving favor-
able action at the present time owing to the condition of the national
finances.

He added that whenever it was practicable a request for the build-
ing should be strongly presented to the Congress.

BEQUEST OF MISS CAROLINE HENRY.

The secretary announced that under the will of Miss Caroline
Henry, a daughter of Prof. Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the
institution (1846-1878), an immediate bequest of $1,000 is made to
the institution, which is also to receive, with the exception of about
$7,500 in direct bequests, the remainder of the estate after the death
of certain beneficiaries.

BEQUEST OF MRS. VIRGINIA PURDY BACON.

The secretary stated that by the will of Mrs. Virginia Purdy
Bacon, of New York, who died in 1919, the institution was given
$50,000 to establish the Walter Rathbone Bacon (traveling) scholar-

ship for the study of the fauna of countries other than the United
States. This estate can not be finally settled for some time, but the
executors are prepared to transfer to the institution securities to
the value of $45,000 at the tax appraiser’s valuation.

The secretary read a list of the securities comprising the amount
to be turned over to the institution.

Judge Gray, and Dr. Bell.

ELECTION OF TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN.

On motion of Senator Lodge, Judge Gray was elected as tempo-
rary chairman and assumed the chair.

MINUTES OF ANNUAL MEETING.

The secretary stated that the minutes of the annual meeting held
December 9, 1920, had been supplied to the regents, and that a
majority ad iaeted their approval.

On motion of Senator Lodge, the minutes were approved.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS.

The secretary said that under the act organizing the institution,
the Vice President of the United States became a regent ex officio,
and that by virtue of his election to that office, the Hon. Calvin
Coolidge was now a regent.

The secretary also announced that under date of January 5, 1921,
the Hon. A. Owsley Stanley, Senator from Kentucky, had been
appointed a regent by Vice President Marshall.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 133
DEATH OF THE CHANCELLOR.

Judge Gray announced the death of the Hon. Edward Douglass
White, Chief Justice of the United States, chancellor of the institu-
tion, and presented the following resolutions:

Whereas: the Board of Regents of the Smithsonion Institution having received.
the announcement of the death, on May 19, 1921, of the Hon. Hdward Douglass
White, Chief Justice of the United States, regent of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion for 10 years, 8 of which he presided as chancellor;

Resolved, That the board here expresses profound sorrow at the passing away
of their beloved colleague who, as statesman, jurist, and chancellor, brought
always to his work that remarkable ability and high conception of duty that
made him so strong an influence for good.

Resolved, That this minute be made a part of the records of the board, and
that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the family of the late chan-
cellor as an expression of the sympathy of the regents at the irreparable loss
sustained in the death of this distinguished public servant and citizen.

On motion, the resolutions were adopted.
ELECTION OF CHANCELLOR.

Senator Lodge here offered the following resolution :

Resolved, That the vacancy in the office of chancellor caused by the death
of the late Chief Justice Edward Douglass White be filled by the election of
the Hon. Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United States.

On motion, the resolution was adopted, and the Vice President took
the chair as chancellor.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART
COMMISSION.

On behalf of the committee the secretary gave a brief statement
explaining the inauguration of the National Gallery of Art, its
growth and importance, including the proposed National Portrait
Gallery, mentioning certain gifts of paintings and art objects, and
repeated his views, already expressed to the board, as to the necessity
for the provision of some means for the administration of the
National Gallery of Art, under the authority of the Board of
Regents.

The secretary then reported that the committee had adopted a
plan of organization covering the operations of the National Gal-
lery of Art Commission, as well as a list of names of individuals
proposed for membership on the commission.

Senator Lodge read in detail the plan of organization and the list
of names, both of which were approved by the board.

The committee was then discharged.

INHERITANCE TAX—FREER ESTATE.

The secretary reminded the board that he had spoken at the
annual meeting of the inheritance tax of over $400,000 which the
State of Michigan was about to exact from the Freer estate and
of the efforts that had been made to have this canceled, but thus far
without success.

NEEDS OF INSTITUTION.

The secretary brought to the board’s attention the needs of the
institution in the way of endowments to permit the carrying on of
large projects in scientific research. He stated that the fund was
smal] and inadequate, and among the methods adopted to bring these
needs before public-spirited persons a small pamphlet has been pre-
pared, which he brought to the board’s consideration in the hope that
should opportunities arise they would direct the attention of pros-
pective donors to the usefulness of the institution.
GHNERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1921

135
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the Genrrat Appenptix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the an-
nual report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the
more remarkable and important developments in physical and bio-
logical discovery, as well as showing the general character of the
operations of the Institution; and this purpose has, during the
greater part of its history, been carried out largely by the publica-
tion of such papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by
scientific progress.

In 1880 the secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of
an annual summary of progress which for 30 years previous had
been issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared
by competent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool-
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1921.

THE DAILY INFLUENCES OF ASTRONOMY.2

By W. W. CAMPBELL,
Lick Observatory, University of California.

In the great struggle through which the principal nations have
passed, men and women at home labored intensively to maintain
their ideals; countless millions of men fought valiantly and many
millions died for the ideals of their nations. Quick results, short
cuts to the end in view, the achieving of victory regardless of costs,
were the order of the day. Suddenly the problems of war gave way
to the problems of peace. The intensive methods of war carried over
to an unfortunate degree into the days of peace. Human energy,
mobilized in behalf of the nation, applied unselfishly for the good
of every person in the nation, for the well-being of all the nations,
was diverted in regrettable measure to promoting selfish interests.
The moral exaltation of the war period was replaced in too many
cases by the selfishness of individuals and organizations; by profit-
eering—a new word, coined to describe widespread conditions. The
struggle in Russia, as the extreme case, is direct action for the sud-
den attainment of certain results, without due consideration for the
rights of others. In all countries there are those who, seeing condi-
tions not to their liking, in commerce, in education, in religion, in
many phases of daily life, would cut and slash their way through the
good, in order to uproot what, in their sight, is bad. This spirit
exists in America, and throughout the world, in various degrees.
Disturbances in the body politic may ensue for years or a generation
by virtue of these attempted short cuts to results, but radical trans-
formations in the social structure of the great modern nations, to
endure, must find the people ready for them. The influences which
prepare the way for desirable and enduring reforms are not those
applied suddenly, but such as operate day and night, continuously,
through long periods of time. The revolutions in Russia, in Mexico,
in many parts of Latin America attract our attention, but the really
serious misfortunes of those lands he much deeper, in their bad

social, educational, economic conditions, which are operating un-
favorably upon their civilizations every day of the year.

We may well inquire what it is that bears a nation onward and
upward to greater things. It is unquestionably the spirit of idealism
radiating from its various activities. It is the idealism in commer-
cial life: that part of every man’s affairs which is conducted with
full respect for the rights of others; that part of every man’s busi-
ness which would not, through its publication, injure his good name.
It is the idealism of the transportation system, which interchanges
commodities to mutual advantage, and acquaints one section of the
world with the good things of other sections. It is idealism in bank-
ing, in farming, in the honest day’s labor at an honest wage. It is ©
idealism in the intellectual life: reverence for the truth, a desire to
know the truth, and to live in harmony with the truth in one’s
surroundings.

A pessimist would to-day, as always, receive short shrift, yet I
venture to say the world was perhaps never more urgently in need
of the biblical advice, “ Prove all things; hold fast that which is
good.” This expression of great wisdom has never been surpassed
as a statement of the principles which govern men of science in their
search for the truth.

The chief value of scientific method and accurate knowledge lies
not in their worship by the intellectual few, not in their applications
to industry, but in their influence upon the daily life of the people.
The remarkable advance in civilization within the leading nations
in recent centuries has been due to the daily and hourly influence ot
the scientific spirit, more than to any other element. Those nations
which possess it are forging ahead by leaps and bounds, and those
which do not are dropping out of the race. The unscientific nations
are threatened with absorption by their more scientific neighbors,
not so much because they do not invent or perfect the most powerful
cannon, the sturdiest dreadnaught, the speediest airplane, or the
subtlest submarine, but because the scientific nations are forging
ahead of them in the arts of peace, in the modes of thought, in the
affairs of daily life. The unscientific nations are without serious
influence in the world, not because they are unwarlike—the Turks
and essentially all Mohammedans are warlike enough to suit every-
body—but because they are lacking in the vision and the efliciency
which accompany the scientific spirit.?

History affords no more remarkable phenomenon than the retro-
grade movement in civilization which began with the decline of the
Roman power and continued through more than a thousand years.

*This and the following paragraph have been taken, with but few changes, from one
of my earlier addresses.—W. W. C.
DAILY INFLUENCES OF ASTRONOMY—CAMPBELL. 141

There had once existed a wonderful Greek civilization, but for twelve
or fifteen centuries it was so nearly suppressed as to be without seri-
ous influence upon the life of the European peoples. Greek litera-
ture, one of the world’s priceless possessions, not surpassed by the
best modern literatures, was as complete two thousand years ago as
it is to-day. Yet in the Middle Ages, if we except a few scattered
churchmen, it was lost to the European world. A Greek science
never existed. Now and then, it is true, a Greek philosopher taught
that the earth is round, or that the earth revolves around the sun,
or speculated upon the constitution of matter; but excepting the
geometry of Euclid and Archimedes, we may say that nothing was
proved, and that no serious efforts were made to obtain proofs.
There could be no scientific spirit in the Greek nation and Greek
civilization so long as the Greek religion lived, and the Greek people
and government consulted and were guided by the oracles. If there
had been a Greek science equal in merit to modern science, think you
that stupidity and superstition could have secured a stranglehold
upon Greek civilization and have maintained a thousand years of
ignorance and mental degradation? Intellectual life could not pros-
per in Europe so long as dogma in Italy, only three hundred years
ago, in the days of Bruno and Galileo, was able to say, “ Animals
which move have limbs and muscles; the earth has no limbs or mus-
cles, therefore it does not move;” or as long as dogma in Massachu-
setts, only 250 years ago, was able to hang by the neck until dead the
woman whom it charged with “ giving a look toward the great meet-
ing house of Salem, and immediately a demon entered the house
and tore down a part of the wainscoting.” The morals and the in-
tellect of the world had reached a deplorable state at the epoch of
the Borgias. It was the re-birth of science, chiefly of astronomy, as
exemplified by the work of Columbus and Copernicus, and secondly
the growth of medical science, which gave to the people of Europe
the power to dispel gradually the unthinkable conditions of the
Middle Ages.

It has been said that we may judge of the degree of civilization
of a nation by the provision which the people of the nation have
made for the study of astronomy. <A review of present-day nations
is convincing that the statement represents the approximate truth. It
is essentially true even of sections of our own country. In our first
years as a nation a few small telescopes were in private hands, here
and there; they were used merely for occasional looking at the stars;
there were no observatories in the United States—no telescopes
suitably mounted and housed for the serious study of the stars. The
founding of the third American observatory, at Hudson, Ohio, about
1839, only a year or two after the completion of the second observa-

tory, at Williams College, Massachusetts, was an admirable index
to the intellectual outlook of the Western Reserve.* The laying of
the cornerstone of the Cincinnati Observatory in 1843, a wonderfully
ambitious institution for its day, was an event considered by Ex-
President John Quincy Adams to be worthy of a hard trip, in the
seventy-seventh year of his life, by rail from Massachusetts to Buf-
falo, by lake steamer to Cleveland, by four days of miserable canal
boat to Columbus, and thence on to Cincinnati, to deliver the formal
address—then called an oration. Adams’s task was, to quote his
words, “ To turn this enthusiasm for astronomy at Cincinnati into a
permanent and persevering national pursuit, which may extend the
bounds of human knowledge, and make the country instrumental in
elevating the character and improving the condition of man upon
earth.”

Our former slave states have to-day only one active observatory, at
the University of Virginia, presented by McCormick, of Chicago.
Barnard and other astronomical enthusiasts, born and grown to man-
hood in the south, have found their opportunities in the great north-
ern observatories, with Olivier, of the University of Virginia, as the
sole exception. What is true of astronomy in the south is true, in
general, of the other sciences. This unfortunate situation is the
natural product of the false, unscientific system of labor which, pre-
vailing through many generations, taught that it is undignified for
the white man to eat bread by the sweat of his own brow. Financial
recovery, following 1865, has accordingly been slow. The future
will correct this, for the men of the south are our blood brothers.
We should be, and are, sympathetic.

Shall we try to estimate what astronomy, the oldest of the sciences,
sometimes called an ideal and unpractical science, has done for man-
kind?

Here are some of the applications of astronomy to daily life:

1. Observations of the stars with the transit instrument, such as
exists in this observatory, are supplying the nations with accurate
time. ‘Two astronomers, with modern instrumental equipment, sit-
uated on the same north and south line, may observe the stars so
accurately, in comparison with the beats of their common clock, that
they will agree within two or three hundredths of a second as to how
much that clock is fast or slow.

2. The accurate maps of the continents and islands depend upon
the astronomical determinations of the latitudes and longitudes of
their salient features.

3. The sailing of ships over long courses, say from the Golden
Gate to Sydney, Australia, or from New York to the Cape of Good

DAILY INFLUENCES OF ASTRONOMY

Hope, depends upon the A B C’s of astremony. Given fair skies
the navigator may locate his ship in the middle of the broad ocean
within a mile of its true position.

4. In America it is the habit to call upon the astronomers to fix the
boundary lines between nations by observations of the stars; for
example, along the 49th parallel of latitude, from Rainy Lake, Minn.,
westward almost to the Pacific Ocean. The uncertainty as to where
this imaginary line falls upon the ground is nowhere greater than
10 or 15 feet, and it has not been found necessary by us, nor by
our friends in Canada, to maintain military forts along that line.

5. The times of high and low tides, vital to mariners in entering
many harbors, are determined by or from the work of the astrono-
mers.

We do not dwell upon these responses to the immediate needs of the
world, for they are unimportant in comparison with the contributions
of the pure knowledge side of astronomy to progressive civilization.

Let us think of the earth as eternally shrouded in thick clouds, so
that terrestrial dwellers could never see the sun, the moon, the comets,
the stars, and the nebula, but not so thick that the sun’s energy would
fail to penetrate to the soil and grow the crops. Under these conditions
we might know the earth’s surface strata to the depth of a mile or two.
We might know the mountains and the atmosphere to a height of 4 or
5 miles. We might acquire a knowledge of the oceans, but we should
be creatures of exceedingly narrow limits. Our vision, our life,
would be confined to a stratum of earth and air only 4 or 5 miles
thick. It would be as if the human race went about its work of
raising corn for food and cotton for raiment, always looking down,
never looking up, knowing nothing of the universe except an insig-
nificantly thin stratum of the little earth. This picture is only a
moderately unfair view of life as it existed on our planet 400 years
ago, before the days of the telescope, the spectroscope, and the pho-
tographic plate, before the days of freedom of speech and thought,
which came with the scientific spirit. The earth is for us no longer
flat, supported on the back of a great turtle, which rests upon noth-
ing. It is round, and every civilized person knows that it is. Exists
there an intelligent man in the world whose thoughts, every day and
many times a day, are not unconsciously adapted to this fact? This
knowledge is a chief inheritance of the new generations. It is funda-
mental in our civilization. People know that the sun will rise in the
morning and set in the evening, and why. A round earth, rotating
upon its axis in a dependable way and revolving around the sun in
exact obedience to law, are truths incomparably more sublime than
the fiction of the flat earth which was pictured hazily in men’s minds
during pre-Copernican days. Who can estimate the value of this
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

knowledge to the human race? It can not be expressed with the
few figures which suffice for the total of present-day financial trans-
actions.

The stars are not lanterns hung out in the sky by angels at night,
but something inconceivably grander; they are suns, hundreds of
millions of suns, on the average comparable in size and brightness to
our sun. Is not this ascertained fact of nature a most ennobling one
to aspiring souls? Do not these facts suggest and develop becoming
modesty in the minds of those who would know the truth and pattern
their lives in accordance with it?

The following conversation occurred one Saturday evening in the
month of June, 1912, at the eyepiece of the great telescope which
Mr. Warner and Mr. Swasey constructed and erected for the Lick
Observatory. I mention the time, June, 1912, because it is of the
essence of the story. ;

Said the astronomer to the party of visitors: “The object which
you will see through the great telescope this evening is the star
cluster in Hercules, the finest cluster in the northern sky. Without
the telescope, by naked eye, this cluster may be seen if the observer
knows exactly where to look and has first-class eyes, but he will see
it as apparently a single star on the limit of vision, so faint that
many eyes will not see it at all. The telescope separates the cluster
into a multitude of stars. If you had the time to count them, they
would number fully six thousand, closely. grouped in the center of
the cluster, but thinning out as you approach the edges. This one
object, then, which to the naked eye seems to be a single star on the
limit of vision, consists of at least as many stars as the eye alone
is able to see in the sky as a whole, northern and southern skies, sum-
mer and winter skies combined, and we do not doubt that long pho-
tographic exposures on the cluster, with a large reflecting telescope,
would record many more than six thousand. Each of these stars
is a sun and probably every one of those which you will see is larger
than our sun, for we are observing merely the brightest members
of the system. We do not know whether these suns have planets
revolving around them or not, as the cluster is entirely too far away
for us to see such planets, but planets probably exist there in great
numbers; possibly there are planets revolving around all of those
stars; possibly and probably there are moons revolving around the
planets; and finally, there may be life, vegetable, animal, intelligent
life upon those planets.”

One of the visitors upon descending from the observing chair,
much interested, questioned the astronomer: “Did you say those
stars are all suns?” “ Yes, sir.” “Did you say that those stars are
really larger than our sun, on the average?” “ Yes, sir.” “Can you
DAILY INFLUENCES OF ASTRONOMY—CAMPBELL. 145

give me an idea how large our sun is?” “ Well, if it were a hollow
shell, of its present size, you could pour more than a million earths
into it, and there would still be much unoccupied space between the
earth balls.” “You say there are possibly or probably planets re-
volving around many of the cluster stars?” “Yes, sir.” “And
many of those planets may be inhabited?” “ Yes, sit? |% Well;
then, I think it does not matter very much whether Roosevelt or
Taft is nominated next week at the Chicago Convention.” *

Of course the visitor’s interest in the outcome at Chicago was just
as keen as ever, but he had evidently received a valuable lesson con-
cerning man’s place in nature.

The wonders of our sun are many and most remarkable and are
but little known. I have referred to its enormous size. The quan-
tity of heat which the sun is radiating into surrounding space—to
the earth, to Mars, and to all other objects which intercept its rays—
is stupendous and not to be comprehended by the astronomer or the
man of affairs. It is, and has been, the.source of all the energy upon
which we draw, save only a negligible residual. A great quantity
of heat is indeed stored up in the interior of the earth, but it reaches
the earth’s surface in such minute quantities that in all practical
details of life, save to those who labor in deep mines or live near
voleanoes or are interested in hot springs, this source of energy
may be neglected. If this statement should be difficult to accept,
let your thoughts travel to the south pole of our planet. What does
the interior heat of the earth do for that region? The antarctic con-
tinent’s perpetual covering of ice and snow is unaffected by it, nor
does the actually enormous quantity of solar heat falling upon that
continent suffice to remove the white mantle. If aught should inter-
vene to cut off the sun’s energy from the earth for one short month,
the tropics would attain to a state of frigidity to which the south
polar continent, as now observed, would be a rose garden in com-
parison.

It is the sun’s heat which grows the farmer’s crops, the trees of
the forest and all vegetation. The coal deposits upon which we
draw to-day for the running of trains, ships, factories, and rolling
mills, are but the solar energy of an earlier age, compressed, trans-
formed and preserved for our comfort and power. In the moun-
tainous regions of our land, where water can be stored in high-level

Following the publication of this address I learned that incidents illustrating the
same philosophy of life and politics occurred to Professors Frost and Barnard at the
Yerkes Observatory in the heat of the presidential campaign of 1908, to Professor Wood
at his Long Island observatory in the same campaign, and to others in later years. Com-
ments similar in all essential respects are made frequently by the visiting public at
Mount Hamilton. There is no reason whatever for doubting that the many reported
cases are absolutely independent of each other and are merely illustrative of human
nature,
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921,

reservoirs, and, passing through water wheels at lower levels, be
made to generate electric power for lighting, for heating, and for
the running of motors, it is the sun’s energy which is transformed to
meet the needs of men. The sun’s rays evaporate the surface waters
of the oceans, lakes, streams, and lands; the winds, generated by the
unequal solar heating of our atmosphere, transport some of the
water vapor to the high mountains, where it is deposited as rain or
snow. It is merely the descent of these waters to the lower levels
that is controlled by man and transformed into electric power for
his own purposes.

It would take more than two billion earths placed side by side to
form a continuous spherical shell around our sun at distance equal
to the earth’s distance, and thus to receive the total output of solar
heat. Therefore, less than one two-billionth part of that output
falls upon the earth. The earth’s share of solar energy, expressed
in horse-power or other familiar units, is too great to set down in
figures. If you should happen to own 250 acres of land in one of
the tropical deserts of the earth, you will be interested to know that
your quota of the solar energy, near the middle of a summer day, is
falling upon your tract of land at the rate of about 1,000,000 horse-
power—more than enough heat and power to supply all the needs
of this great city (Cleveland)—and this is but two-thirds of the
sun’s good intentions toward you, for some 40 per cent of the energy
is intercepted by the atmosphere overlying your farm, and returned
forthwith to outer space.

Your neighbor’s tract of 250-acres is also receiving solar energy
at the rate of 1,000,000 horsepower. Figuring backward, if one
farm area receives 1,000,000 horsepower, and there are more than
a hundred million such farm areas on the earth turned toward the
sun at one time, and the whole earth intercepts less than one two-
billionth of the sun’s energy output, is it any wonder that sun wor-
ship became one of the recognized religions? Accurate knowledge
saves us from that, but it is becoming in us to give the sun our due
respect.

A great problem ahead of the scientific world is the storage of
the sun’s beneficent heat rays for release as needed. Astronomers
are seeking intently for the sources of the sun’s outpouring of en-
ergy: How can the sun maintain the supply for tens of millions of
years, as it undoubtedly is doing? One important source has been
found—the sun’s own gravitation which tries constantly to pull
every particle of its material to the sun’s center—but dnother and
greater source seems to await discovery. Does any one say, since
the supply of solar energy will surely meet our needs for ten or a
hundred million years, why look further for the cause? Why not
DAILY INFLUENCES OF ASTRONOMY—CAMPBELL, 147

let it go at that? This selfish spirit, if applied to all subjects, would
retrograde our civilization. Even the possession of the truth is not
so potent for good as the desire to know the truth and the struggle
to discover it. Practically, a knowledge of the origin of the sun’s
heat may be the key for locking up great quantities of it on summer
days and unlocking it when and where needed.

Who is not interested in Mars, a planet much smaller than the
earth, a little over four thousand miles in diameter, which revolves
around the sun in somewhat less than two years, at an average
distance from the sun 50 per cent greater than the earth’s distance?
Mars is literally one of the earth’s brothers, and we should be sin-
cerely interested in his welfare. Does life exist on that planet?
Almost certainly there is vegetable life. We have no reason to
doubt it. Certain areas of the planet change in color as the climatic
seasons come and go, very much as we should expect if these colors
were controlled by the natural stages of vegetable life. However, in
precaution, I should guard against the drawing of the conclusion
that vegetable life on Mars has actually been proved to exist. I can
merely say that we see no reason to doubt its existence. Is there
animal life on Mars? There probably is, but we have no positive
evidence that such is the case. If the physical conditions on the
planet as to water, air and soil are such that vegetable life may ex-
ist, the chances are strongly in favor of animal life also. However, 1
think we must leave unanswered for the present the question whether
such animal life is highly intelligent. The forests of the St. Law-
rence Valley and the prairies of the Mississippi Valley put on their
green coats in the spring and change them to brown coats in the
fall, perhaps even better before the coming of man than after his
destructive influence descended upon them. If you had the means
to ascend several thousand miles above your present position, and
could dwell there throughout the year, you would witness the forma-
tion of a polar snow cap upon the earth early in the autumn. The
southern edge of this cap would extend farther and farther to the
south up to the time of midwinter. Its edge would extend well
down toward the southern limits of the United States, to the Hima-
layas in Asia, and soon. With the coming of spring the north polar
cap would decrease in size and probably disappear, save as to snows
on the higher mountains and the possible ice and snows of the im-
mediate polar region. An observer similarly situated above South
America, would witness similar phenomena as to the south polar
regions; and these are indeed the phenomena observed on the planet
Mars. The white polar caps on Mars wax and wane with the com-
ing and going of the winter as they do upon the earth. Super-
ficially, the Martian conditions seem not very different from the
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

terrestrial, though we know that the Martian atmosphere is highly
attenuated, and if we were suddenly set down upon that planet’s
surface we should certainly suffocate for lack of air. Water is
probably scarce upon that planet in similar degree. However, these
facts do not militate strongly against animal life upon that planet,
for such life would undoubtedly be developed with respiratory and
other organs adapted to their environment. A solution of the Mar-
tian problems, as to a possible counterpart of terrestrial man on
that planet, is apparently not now hopeful, but present-day failures
may be the prelude to future successes, and I prefer to offer no dis-
couragement.

The planet Venus, only a shade smaller than the earth, and but two-
thirds as far from the sun as we, presents a similar but apparently
more difficult problem. We know that it has extensive atmosphere,
no doubt comparable with that of the earth, but concerning the pres-
ence of water we are justified in making no statement other than
we remain in apparently total ignorance. If Schiaparelli was right,
as he appears to have been, that Venus always presents the same face -
to the sun, just as the moon always turns the same hemisphere toward
the earth, then one hemisphere of Venus undoubtedly remains in-
tensively hot in perpetuity, and the other hemisphere in perpetual
darkness and excessively low temperature. Can the twilight zone
between the hemispheres of day and night offer abode and comfort
to living forms, vegetable and animal? We have found no answer
to this question, and we know not how to progress to the solution.

Are the moon and Mercury inhabited? Certainly not by such
forms of life as we are familiar with, for neither object has an
appreciable atmosphere. Both bodies undoubtedly suffer from ex-
tremes of heat and cold, without the protecting blanket of atmos-
phere with which the earth is blessed. The other planets, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, may be dismissed as uninhabitable by
life forms of our acquaintance. There seems no reason to doubt that
these great bodies, from four to eleven times the earth in diameter,
are still devoid of solid footing for man or beast, such as the rock
and soil strata afford upon the earth.

Have astronomers been able to prove that planets revolve around
other suns than ours? No, the distances of the nearest stars pre-
clude that possibility to our means in hand. Such planets would
need to be manyfold brighter than Jupiter, the greatest of our
planets, and our great telescopes would need multiplication many
times in diameter to let us see them as attendants of their suns. We
are able to prove, and have proved, however, the existence of hun-
dreds of bodies, in distant space, whose rays of light we have not
perceived. The spectrograph has shown with certainty that, of the
naked-eye stars, one in four on the average is not the single star
DAILY INFLUENCES OF ASTRONOMY—CAMPBELL. 149

which it appears to be to the naked eye, or when viewed in the tele-
scope, but that it is a double sun, the two bodies revolving continu-
ously about their mutual center of mass. These hundreds of binary
systems are so far away that even under the highest telescopic mag-
nification they blend into a common and essentially mathematical
point. It is the expectation that the future, possibly the present
century, will establish that one star in three, on the average, is a
double solar system. It may even prove to be the truth that our
solar system, consisting of one great central sun and many attendant
planets, is not the average and prevailing system, but is the exception
and not the rule. However, we have no good reason to doubt that
tens of thousands, more probably tens of millions, of distant suns
are the centers of planetary systems, and that countless planets are
the abode of life. As our sun is but one of hundreds of millions of
suns, it is absurd and essentially inconceivable that our planet, or
two or three of our planets, should be the only bodies throughout
the universe supporting life. It is vastly more probable that if our
vision could penetrate to other stellar systems, lying in all direc-
tions from us, we should there find life in abundance, with degrees
of intelligence and civilization from which we could learn much, and
with which we could sympathize. The spectroscope proves abso-
lutely that dozens of chemical elements in the earth’s surface strata
exist’ in our sun: that iron, the silicon of our rocks, hydrogen, helium,
magnesium and so forth exist in the distant reaches of our stellar
system. If there is a unity of materials, unity of laws governing
those materials throughout the universe, why may we not speculate
somewhat confidently upon life universal ?

In the days of my youth, here in northern Ohio, the opinion pre-
vailed throughout the community, and widely over the earth, that
comets were the forerunners of wars, plagues or other forms of dire
distress. Did not the great comet of 1811 herald the war of 1812,
and that of 1843 the Mexican War and Donati’s comet of 1858 our
Civil War.? Even in the twentieth century the fear that a comet
may collide with the earth and destroy its inhabitants comes to the
surface, here and there, every time a comet is visible to the naked
eye. ‘The findings of astronomers concerning these visitors to our
region of space have taught that we have nothing to fear from them,
and that their close approaches may be welcomed, for they are in-
teresting members of our sun’s family. They revolve around our
sun as the planets do, and render unto it homage and obedience. It
is undoubtedly true that the earth has plunged through the tails of
comets many a time and without appreciable effects upon our health
and happiness. In fact, the inhabitants have at the time been bliss-
fully unaware of the passage. It is true that a collision of the con-

150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

densed head of a comet with the earth is not impossible; it may
some time occur; but comprehensive studies of this question, based
upon observational data concerning many of these bodies, lead indu-
bitably to the conclusion that we must not expect these collisions
to occur, on the average, more than once in 15 or 20 million years.
The so-called shooting stars, which we have all observed in the night
sky, are in many cases, perhaps in all, though we do not know, the
burning of minute pieces of comets which have disintegrated and
disappeared as comets forever from our sight. Colliding with the
earth, rushing through the upper strata of our atmosphere with
speeds up to 40 or more miles per second, the frictional resistance
of the air heats them to the burning point, and they are turned into
ashes and the vapors of combustion. A very few get through to
the earth’s surface and are found and placed in our museums. It is
not certain that any of those in the museums are parts of disinte-
grated comets, but some of them probably are. The number of small
foreign bodies which collide with our planet every day i8 very great;
a conservative estimate is 20,000,000. Except for our beneficent at-
mosphere man would suffer many tragedies from the bombardment.
There is reason to believe that the earth is growing larger very
slowly, from these accretions, and this may have been the process
by which the earth grew from a small nuclear beginning up to its
present size.

Astronomers have determined that our solar system is very com-
pletely isolated in space. We are widely separated from our neigh-
bors. I shall not try your patience by quoting the tremendous dis-
tances in miles, for they are incomprehensible to all of us. Rays
of light sent out by the sun require a little more than eight minutes
to reach the earth. The outermost known planet in our system,
Neptune, would be reached in four hours and a half. Rays of light
leaving the sun at the same time and traveling at the same rate,
186,000 miles per second, must travel continuously during four years
and a half to reach our nearest known neighbor in space, the bright
double star, Alpha Centauri. If the distance from the sun to the
earth is 7, the distance to our outer planet is 30, and the distance
to Alpha Centauri is 275,000. There appears to be an abundance
of room in the great stellar system to meet the requirements of all.
The spectrograph attached to the Lick telescope has determined
that our sun and its family of planets is traveling through the great
stellar system with a speed of 12$ miles per second, equivalent to
400,000,000 miles per year. The earth is certainly hundreds of mil-
lions of years in age, the sun is no doubt at least as old, and the
early youth of the earth was lived, not where we now are, but: far

elsewhere in the stellar system; and its future journeyings will lead
to quite other points of observation.

The question of greatest interest to present-day astronomers is
that of stellar systems other than our own. The chances seem strong
that the hundreds of thousands of spiral nebule known to exist,
in very distant space are other and independent systems of stars.
many of them perhaps containing as many stars as our stellar
system. In other words, our stellar system may be but one of
hundreds of thousands of isolated stellar systems distributed through
endless space. This is not an established fact, but the evidence
seems to run in its favor.

I have referred to some of the problems and results of astronomi-
cal science. The list of interesting items is a long one, but available
time has its limits. In brief, it is the astronomer’s duty to discover
the truth about his surroundings in space, and make it a part of
the knowledge of his day and generation. The ultimate and real
value of his work lies in its influence upon the lives of the people
of the world, in the change for the better which it induces in their
modes of thought, and in the impulse which it gives to an advancing
civilization.

Would that the attractions of the sky to the average man were
more potent. It is a curious comment upon the attributes of city
life that hundreds of thousands of people, especially children, in
London and Paris, in the darkness which gave them semiconceal-
ment from the enemy’s destructive airships, should have obtained
their first real vision of the starry heavens. What must have been
their sensations? On the other hand, those who can view its beauties
and wonders are prone to neglect it; to look down instead of up.
Kmerson has said somewhere in his immortal essays that if our
sky should be clear of clouds but one night in a century, the people
of this globe would look forward to the rare event, and not only
prepare to behold its beauties themselves, but make sure that their
friends far and wide were likewise minded. How the beauties of
the night sky would surpass the expectations of the most lively
imagination! The wondrous vision would be the prevailing sub-
ject of conversation for years and years, and the repetition of the
vision, 100 years later, would need no advertising.

Our knowledge of the heavens is in its infancy. We have
but made a start upon the discovery of the truth about the
stars, and the results of astronomical research are not so widely
known amongst the people as they should be. This splendid
institution, The Warner & Swasey Observatory, presented
by men who were masters in telescope and observatory de-
sign and construction, by men who have thought much of relative

values in life, this institution has a field of great usefulness lying
before it. In their administration of the generous gift, the trustees,
the president and the faculty of the Case School of Applied Science,
whether for research, for school instruction or for community edu-
cation, will have the sympathetic interest of astronomers, of all
lovers of the truth. This observatory may assist in the solution
of important problems concerning the universe of which we form
a part. The universities, the colleges, and the technical schools
of our country, and of other countries, are graduating every year
many hundreds of young men, ready to start upon the more serious
phases of their lives, who can tell us all about the lights in our
houses, but not one word about the lights in our sky. This insti-
tution will do its quota in approximating to a liberal education.
The casual visitor who enters its portals in search of knowledge,
yea, the passerby in the street who merely sees a dignified and pur-
poseful observatory set upon a hill, will have his thoughts directed
to higher levels.
COSMOGONY AND STELLAR EVOLUTION.2

By. J. Hi. Jeans, FR S8.

I. THE EVOLUTION OF GASEOUS MASSES.

The progress of observational astronomy has made it abundantly
clear that astronomical formations fall into well-defined classes:
they are almost “manufactured articles” in the sense in which Clerk
Maxwell applied the phrase to atoms. Just as atoms of hydrogen or
calcium are believed to be of similar structure no matter where they
are found, so star-clusters, spiral] nebule, binary stars are seen to be
similar, although in a less degree, no matter in what part of the sky
they appear. The problem of cosmogony is to investigate the origins
of these comparatively uniform formations and the process of transi-
tion from one class to another.

In attacking this problem the cosmogonist of to-day stands upon the
shoulders not only of previous cosmogonists, but also, what is of even
greater importance, upon the shoulders of the brilliant and indus-
trious astronomical observers of the past century. We shall find it
convenient to take as our starting point the most famous theory of
cosmogony ever propounded—the nebular hypothesis of Laplace—
and we shall examine to what extent it remains tenable in the light
of modern observational and theoretical research.

Laplace’s hypothesis referred primarily to the genesis of the solar
system, which he believed to have originated out of a hot nebulous
mass that shrank as it cooled. The nebula was supposed to be in
rotation, so that the principle of conservation of angular momentum
required that as the mass cooled its speed of rotation should increase.
It is well known that a mass either of gas or of liquid in rotation
can not rest in equilibrium in the spherical shape which would be
assumed in the absence of rotation. If the rotation is very slow the
equilibrium shape will be an oblate spheriod of small eccentricity.
As the rotation increases, the ellipticity will increase, but it is found
that the spheroidal shape is soon departed from. Laplace believed, as
a matter of conjecture rather than of reasoned proof, that with con-

154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

tinually increasing rotation a mass of gas would in time reach a stage
at which it could no longer exist as a single continuous mass. When
this stage was reached he believed that a ring of particles would be
discharged from the equator through the centrifugal force of rotation
outweighing the centripetal force of gravitation. The mathematical
researches of Roche (1873) provided some support for this general
conjecture, and more recent investigations put its genera] accuracy
beyond doubt.

It is found that the changes of shape which accompany increase of
rotation are, in their general features, the same for all masses, whether
gaseous or fluid, provided only that there is sufficient central con-
densation of mass. When the rotation becomes so great that the
spheroidal figure is departed from, the equator of the mass is found
to pull out into a pronounced edge, which ultimately becomes per-
fectly sharp (see fig. 1). The mass has now assumed a lenticular
shape, and any further increase of rotation results in matter being
discharged from this sharp edge. The lenticular shape is retained
from now on, the sharp edge acting like a safety valve and emit-
ting just so much matter as is necessary to carry off the excess of an-
gular momentum beyond the maximum which can be carried by the
central mass. Figure 1 shows the configurations of the lenticular figures

for masses of gas in adiabatic equilibrium,in which y (ratio of specific
heats) has the extreme values 1.2 and 2.2, respectively. Other calcu-
lated lenticular figures show generally similar shapes. With a fur-
ther increase of rotation beyond that for which these curves are
drawn, the figures would remain unaltered save for the addition of a
distribution of matter in the equatorial plane—the matter already
thrown off from the sharp edge of the lens.

If gaseous stars assume these forms our telescopes refuse to reveal
them. Even in the most powerful telescopes the stars remain in-
finitesimal points of light; the only bodies which show any observable
shape are the nebule. It is highly significant that a number of these
exhibit precisely the lenticular shape just described. This is in most
cases accompanied by a distribution of matter in the plane through
the sharp edge of the lens. A number of such nebule have been
found by direct spectroscopic observation to be in rotation about an
axis perpendicular to this plane. Thus there is very strong justifica-
tion for supposing that these nebule are masses of gas or other mat-
STELLAR EVOLUTION—JEANS. 155

ter with high central condensation behaving precisely as imagined by
Laplace—rotating and throwing off their excess of angular mo-
mentum as they cool by the ejection of matter in their equatorial
planes.

There is, however, almost incontrovertible evidence that the nebule
which have just been described are nothing but ordinary spiral nebule
seen edgewise, for observation discloses a continuous sequence of
nebule the shapes of which bridge completely the gap between
the lenticular nebule, in which we are looking at right angles to the
axis of rotation, and the familiar spiral nebula in which we look ap-
proximately along this axis. The characteristic nebula shows a nu-
cieus which we can now identify with the lenticular figure demanded
by theory, having two arms emerging symmetrically from opposite
points of the nucleus. If our identification is correct these arms
must be formed out of the matter already discharged from the nu-
cleus. It has in point of fact been found by van Maanen and Kostin-
sky that the matter in the arms appears to be in motion approxi-
mately along the arms and in the outward direction.

Any external gravitational field, whether of the universe as a whole
or of neighboring stars or nebule, would produce a tidal field similar
to that produced by the sun and moon on the surface of our earth, a
field specified mathematically by a second harmonic. This field, no
matter how small in amount, would suffice to destroy the exact circu-
lar shape of the “equator” of the nucleus and so would concentrate
the emission of matter at two opposite points on this equator. Thus
it is easy to understand why the nebule, as a rule, exhibit two sym-
metrical arms emerging from antipodal points. It is very much less
easy to understand why these arms should be of the universal spiral
form—the absence of any explanation of this form must be regarded
as a serious drawback to our interpretation of the spiral nebule. It
is readily proved that the ejected filaments of matter, whatever the
shape they assume, could not remain of uniform line-density. Such a
distribution of density would be unstable, and it can be proved that
nuclei would form at approximately equal distances, around which
the matter of the arms would condense. In this way it is possible to
explain the nuclei and condensations which are observed in the arms
of the spiral nebule. 1t is also found possible to calculate the amount
of matter which will condense around each nucleus; the mass of each
is found to be of the order of magnitude of the known masses of the
stars.

In this way I have been led to conjecture that the spiral nebule
are whirling masses of gas which, owing to their rapidity of rotation,
throw off gaseous stars much as a “ Catherine-wheel ” firework throws
off sparks. If so, the condensations in the arms of these nebule are
stars in the process of birth. Dynamically the mechanism is almost

identical with that imagined by Laplace as resulting in the birth of
systems of planets and satellites, but on a far more stupendous scale.
The final product of the chain of events we have been considering
must be some type of star cluster—perhaps a globular star cluster,
or possibly an “island universe” similar to our galactic system.
The difficulties in the way of an exact mathematical investigation
into the history of the ejected gas, as the filaments condense around
nuclei and as these form stars and begin to move as detached bodies,
are enormous. On the other hand, the determination of the final
steady states possible for a system of stars created in this way is
quite simple. There is found to be only one type of final steady
state possible for a system of stars created out of a rotating mass
of gas, and this shows exactly the features presented by the system
of stars of which our sun isa member. The system of stars will be
of a flattened shape, symmetrical about the plane of greatest cross-
section (the galactic plane in our system); the velocities in any
small region of space will not be distributed at random, but will
show a preference for two opposite directions (“star streaming ”) ;
these directions will be parallel to the plane of symmetry and per-
pendicular to the radius to the center of the system. This last direc-
tion is that given by Charlier for the direction of “ star. streaming ”
in our system. Our system passes all tests for having been born out
of a spiral nebula the plane of which was what is now the plane of
the Milky Way; indeed, Easton and others have claimed to find
traces of the two spiral arms still surviving in the distribution of
stars in this plane, as though the final steady state had not yet been
reached.

[Added February, 1922.—The test, however, is not a very stringent
one. For if a number of stellar systems, each one of which had been
born out of a rotating nebula in the way we have imagined, were to
fall together as the result of gravitational action and unite into a
single giant system of stars, it can be shown that this giant system,
if or when it attained a steady state, would show precisely these
same properties. Thus our test leaves it an open question whether our
universe has been born out of a single nebula or out of a great num-
ber of smaller nebulz. It probably accords best with present obser-
vational knowledge to suppose that our universe has been formed
by the intermingling of a large number of separate star groups each
of which is the product of a single spiral nubula. The globular
clusters may well be groups of this type which have not yet mingled
with the main mass of stars, while the moving star clusters, such as
the Taurus cluster, the Ursa-major cluster, and possibly also the
whole system of the B-type stars, may be groups, or the remains of
groups, which have fallen into the main mass and become inter-

mingled with it spatially while yet preserving suflicient uniformity
of motion among their members to enable us to recognize them as
distinct groups of stars. |

Let us now turn to a study of the lives of individual stars. To
the naked eye the stars appear as mere points of light of varying
brightness. The telescope adds little except possibly differences of
color. The spectroscope appears at first to add a wealth of new
information, but a detailed study of stellar spectra discloses the un-
expected fact that all stellar spectra, apart from a few exceptions,
fall into one single linear series. Photographs of the spectra of all
stars, in which varying exposures have been made to compensate for
varying brightnesses, can be arranged uniquely in a consecutive
order in which each spectrum differs only imperceptibly from its
neighbor. All the complicated diversities of stellar spectra appear
to be determined, in the main, by one single variable. This is be-
lieved, with good reason, to be the temperature of the star’s surface.

Positions on this linear series are specified by reference to six
selected points denoted by the letters B, A, Ff, G, K, M, in this order.
The order given is that of decreasing surface temperature. Stars
having B spectra are of bluish color with a surface temperature of
10,000° C. or more. Stars of type M are red with a surface tem-
perature of only 3,000° C. Our sun is of type G, with a surface tem-
perature of about 6,000° C.

We might also arrange the stars in order of brightness. The dis-
tances of many stars are known, and for these we can calculate the
“absolute brightness” or “ luminosity ”—i.e., the amount of light
omitted as compared with our sun. Since the masses of the stars
are all approximately the same, it might be expected that the order
of “luminosity ” would prove to be substantially the same as that
of surface temperature, but this does not prove to be the case. Hight
years ago it was found by Hertzsprung and H. N. Russell that the
red M stars fell into two widely different classes, one class having
abnormally high luminosity, and the other abnormally low. ‘The
ratio of luminosities in the two classes is of the order of 10,000 to 1,
and since the surface temperatures are the same, this ratio must imply
a corresponding ratio in the areas of the radiating surfaces. Thus
the two classes of M stars must have volumes in a ratio of about
1,000,000 to 1, for which sufficient reason they have been designated
“oiants” and “dwarfs.” From a comprehensive discussion by
Russell, recently confirmed by Adams and Joy, it is clear that the
demarcation between “giants” and “dwarfs” extends, although
with diminished intensity, through the types K, G, and F, while at
types A and B the classes coalesce.

Lately Shapley, by determining the distances of the globular
clusters, has greatly increased our knowledge of stellar luminosi-
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

ties, and has calculated the individual luminosities of 1,152 giant stars
in clusters. If we plot the logarithms of the luminosity (or the
absolute magnitude) against spectral type as in figure 2, the vast
majority of Shapley’s 1,152 stars are found to lie within the belt
marked “ giants,” while of the stars previously discussed by Russell
and by Adams and Joy nearly all lie either within this belt or within
that marked “ dwarfs.” In this diagram a few typical stars have

stellar neighbor, « Centauri, are marked as typical dwarfs of type G,
and Sirius is a representative A-type star.

From the known luminosity and surface temperature of any star
it is easy to calculate its surface and so its density. Giants of types
G and K are found to have densities of the order of 0.004 and 0.0005,
respectively, agreeing with the known densities of binary stars of
these types. Sirius, with a luminosity of forty-eight times, and a
surface temperature about one and a half times, those of our sun,
must have a surface nine times as great. Its mass is 3.4 times the
solar mass, so that its density must be about 0.2. In general it is
found that all giant stars must be gaseous, of density so low that the
ordinary gas laws will be approximately obeyed. Dwarf stars may
be gaseous or liquid or solid, but, if gaseous, they are so dense that the
gas laws will be nowhere near the truth. It is now easy to see why,
in the giant stars, increase of temperature and density go together;
this is merely a consequence of Lane’s law. But the dwarfs may be

thought of as approximating rather to masses of fixed dimensions,
and for these the luminosity falls off as the temperature decreases.

Our sun radiates light at a rate of about 2 ergs per second per
gram of its mass. Gravitational contraction, as Lord Kelvin showed,
could provide energy at this rate for only about 20,000,000 years,
and radio-active and chemical energy could only slightly lengthen
this period. For a giant star, radiating at 1,000 times the rate of the
sun, the maximum period would be only a few thousand years. This
period is far too short, and it is now generally accepted that, so far
from gravitation and known sources of energy providing the whole
of a star’s radiation, they can provide only an insignificant fraction.
Energy of adequate amount can originate only from subatomic
sources, as, for instance, from interna] rearrangements in the posi-
tive nuclei of the atoms or from the transformation of a small frac-
tion of the star’s mass into energy. It is a matter of simple calcu-
lation to show that all other stores of energy in a star can constitute
only an insignificant reservoir of energy which, unless continually
replenished from subatomic sources, would be exhausted in, astron-
omically, a moment. Thus the rates of radiation and of generation
of subatomic energy must be practically equal, and the luminosity
of a star will be determined by the latter rate at any instant.

We may now think of the evolution of the stars as represented by
the march of a vast army through our diagram (fig. 2), the indi-
viduals keeping, for the most part, within the marked belt. Each
individual takes his marching orders from the supply of subatomic
energy, and so long as we remain in ignorance of the exact source
and nature of this we can not be certain whether the motion of the
army is up or down, or even that it is all in the same direction. But
if we are right in conjecturing that the stars were born out of a nebula
of very low density, the order of march will be from low density
to high; our army will be marching downwards in the diagram. Its
tail, except for a few stragglers, is about at absolute magnitude —4,
its head is lost in darkness. In the next lecture we must study the
incidents which may occur during the march of this army of stars.

Il. THE EVOLUTION OF STELLAR AND PLANETARY SYSTEMS.

In the last lecture we followed up, so far as is permitted by mod-
ern theoretical and observational research, the train of ideas on
which Laplace had based his nebular hypothesis. Theoretically we
found that a shrinking mass of rotating gas ought in time to assume
a lenticular shape, after which further shrinkage would result in the
ejection of matter from the sharp edge of the lens. It is suggested
that the spiral nebulz form instances of this process, the spiral arms
being the ejected matter and the central nucleus the remnant of the
original rotating mass of gas. The spiral arms are observed to
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

break up into condensations, a process of which a theoretical ex-
planation can readily be given. But on inserting approximate
numerical values it is found that each condensation must have a
mass comparable with that of a star. In the spiral nebule we are
watching, not the birth of planets, which Laplace attempted to
explain by his nebular hypothesis, but the birth of the stars them-
selves. The process is, in its main outlines, identical with that imag:
ined by Laplace, but is on a more stupendous scale.

The separate stars when set free from the parent nebula are
themselves shrinking and rotating masses of gas; they may be
thought of as small-scale models of the nebula which gave them
birth. We naturally inquire whether the process of evolution of
these small-scale models will be the same as in the parent nebule.
The answer is provided by a mere inspection of the physical dimen-
sions of the formule which govern the dynamical processes of evo-
lution. It is found that, as regards the central mass of lenticular
shape, the small-scale model operates precisely like the bigger mass.
Any rotating mass of gas, provided only that it is sufficiently great
to hold together under its own gravitation, will in due course assume
the lenticular shape and discharge matter from its equator. But as
regards the ejected matter, the small-scale model does not work in the
same way as the bigger mass. If the matter ejected from a big mass
forms a million condensations, the matter ejected from a small mass
of one-millionth part of the size will not form a million tiny con-
densations—it will form only one condensation, and will, moreover,
form this one only if other physical conditions are favorable. In
actual fact, when regard is had to numerical values, it is found that
other physical conditions are not favorable. The matter will be
ejected at so slow a rate that each small parcel of gas will simply
dissipate into space without any gravitational cohesion at all. Some
molecules will probably escape altogether from the gravitational
field of the central star, while the remainder will form merely a
scattered atmosphere surrounding the star. For this reason, in addi-
tion to others, the conception of Laplace does not appear to be capable
of providing an explanation of the genesis of planetary systems.

So far we have studied the way in which a mass of gas would
break up under increasing rotation. As a matter of theoretical re-
search it is found that a mass of homogeneous incompressible sub-
stance, such as water, would break up in an entirely different fashion.
It is further found that there are only these two distinctive ways in
which a break-up can occur, so that if a mass, the rotation of which
is continually increasing, does not break up in one way it must break
up in the other. As a star, from being a mass of gas of very low
density, shrinks into a liquid or plastic mass of density perhaps
STELLAR EVOLUTION—JEANS. 161

comparable with that of iron, it passes through a critical point at
which there is a sudden swing over from one type of break-up to
the other. This critical point occurs when the density of the star
has become such that the ordinary gas laws are substantially de-
parted from throughout the greater part of the star’s interior. This
density is, however, precisely that which marks the demarcation
between giant and dwarf stars. Thus the general conclusion of
abstract theory is that a giant star will break up under increasing
rotation in the way we have already had under consideration, but
that a dwarf star will break up in the same way as a homogeneous
incompressible mass, such as a mass of water.

The discovery of the method of break-up in this second case forms
one of the most difficult problems of applied mathematics. In spite
of the labors of many eminent mathematicians, among whom may be
mentioned Maclaurin, Jacobi, Kelvin, Poincaré, and G. H. Darwin,
the problem is still far from complete solution. It is found that,
as the rotation of a homogeneous mass increases, the boundary re-
mains of exact spheroidal shape until an eccentricity of 0.8127 is
reached, at which the axes are in the ratio of about 12:12:7. With
a further increase of rotation the boundary ceases to be a figure of
revolution; it becomes ellipsoidal and retains an exact ellipsoidal
shape until the axes are in a ratio of about 23:10:8. Beyond this
it is impossible for the mass to rotate in relative equilibrium at. all,
and dynamical motion of some kind must ensue. At first a furrow
forms round the ellipsoid in a cross-section perpendicular to the
longest axis, but the cross-section in which the furrow appears does
not divide the figure symmetrically into equal halves. The furrow
deepens, and at this stage the problem eludes exact mathematical
treatment. It appears highly probable, although it cannot be rigor-
ously proved, that the furrow will continue to deepen until it sepa-
rates the figure into two unequal masses. On the assumption that
this is what would actually happen we may conjecture that the
process we have been describing is that of the fission of a single
star into a binary of the familiar type, but the conjecture is beset by
many difficulties. To mention one only: if we have truly described
the history of a star before fission, the star ought during a mod-
erate part of its life to possess an ellipsoidal figure, and as this
rotated the light received from the star ought to vary to an extent
which just before fission might amount to 0.9 magnitude. Yet I
believe there are only three known stars whose variation of light is
such as could possibly be accounted for by an ellipsoidal surface,
and even in these cases the interpretation is doubtful. On the other
hand, very considerable reassurance is provided by the researches
of Russell on multiple stars, After a star has broken into two
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

parts by fission both parts will continue to shrink, so that either or
both may in turn again break up, and a triple or quadruple system
be formed. Russell finds that in a multiple system which has been
formed in this way the distance between the stars formed by subse-
quent fissions can not be more than a small fraction, at most about
one-fifth, of the distance between the pair generated by the original
fission. A mere glance at a catalogue of multiple stars will show
that this condition is fulfilled by the majority of observed systems.
On account of foreshortening the apparent separations will not
always appear to conform to the rule, but Russell has shown, as the
result of a careful statistical discussion, that the exceptions agree,
both in kind and in number, with what might be expected from
foreshortening.

We have now traced out the life-history of a rotating and shrink-
ing mass from beginning to end, from its start as a gaseous mass
of very low density, through its assumption of a lenticular shape
and its first break-up as a spiral nebula, through its subsequent con-
densation into separate stars, to their final fissions into binary and
multiple systems. The picture has been distressingly incomplete,
and it can not be denied that the story is beset by many difficulties
and uncertainties. The mathematical investigation is far from per-
fect; gaps in theory have frequently been bridged by nothing more
substantial than conjecture; in many cases there has been room
for grave doubt as to the identification of observed formations with
those predicted by theory; in one instance at least a formation pre-
dicted by theory, the ellipsoidal star, is practically unknown to the
observing astronomer. But, after allowing for all imperfections,
we have a tolerably complete knowledge, so far as the main out-
lines are concerned, of the whole chain of configurations which will
be assumed in turn by the rotating shrinking mass of Laplace, and
on this chain there does not appear to be any room for the solar
system.

Apart from this, there are weighty reasons for thinking that our
system has not been formed as the result of a rotational break-up.
The angular momentum of a system remains constant during a
process of breaking up, and, as was pointed out by Babinet in 1861,
even if the whole angular momentum of the solar system were now
concentrated in the sun it would still have less than a quarter of
the angular momentum requisite for breaking up at its present
density. Except in the improbable event of the solar system, since
fission, having been robbed by a passing star of by far the greater
part of its angular momentum, its rotation can never have been
sufficient to cause a break-up. Clearly there is a case for examin-
ing whether some other agency can not produce a system such as
ours.
STELLAR EVOLUTION—JEANS. 163

The sun and moon, as we know, raise tides on our earth the height
of which forms only an inappreciable fraction of the earth’s radius.
If our earth were replaced by a mass of liquid or gas of low density
the fraction would be greater, varying inversely as the density of the
mass. If the sun and earth were placed much nearer to one another
than now the tides would be increased in the ratio of the inverse
cube of their distance apart. We can easily imagine conditions un-
der which the heights of the tides would be comparable with the
radius of the earth, and here the simple formule which the mathe-
matician uses to calculate the heights of terrestrial tides become use-
less. The general investigation of the succession of shapes which
will be assumed by a gaseous or plastic mass as the tidal forces on
it continually increase presents a difficult but not altogether intract-
able problem for the mathematician.

It is found that the tides will be of the general type with which
we are familiar on the earth until a certain critical height of tide is
reached. ‘This criical height is comparable with half the radius
of the mass, being greater or smaller according as the mass is of
more or less uniform density. After this critical height has been
passed, there is no longer a configuration of equilibrium under
the tidal forces. Dynamical motion ensues, and the general nature
of this motion will consist in the ejection of two arms or jets of
matter, one towards the attracting mass and one, which may be
smaller, or may be absent altogether, in the exactly opposite direc-
tion. If the tide-generating forces should be suddenly removed at
this stage the jets would, of course, fall back into the mass from
which they emerged, and this would in time resume its spherical
form. But if the tidal forces persist, the jets will continue to be
thrown out, and it can be shown that a continuous distribution of
density in these jets would be unstable, just in the same way, and
for similar reasons, as in the case we previously discussed of the
jet thrown out from a rotating mass of gas. Condensations would
form in the jets, and ultimately the jet would break up into separate
detached masses,

According to the tidal hypothesis of the origin of the olar system,
the sun was at some past time subjected to intense tidal forces from
a passing star, the sequence of processes we have just described took
place, and the emitted jet broke into fragments which are our pres-
ent system of planets. From the mathematical investigation on
which this hypothesis is based, it appears that the fragments would
-each be comparable in mass with the original sun if the matter of
the sun had been of approximately uniform density, but would be
very small by comparison if the sun had been gaseous with high
central condensation. The smallness of the masses of the planets
in comparison with that of the sun must, therefore, be taken as in-
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

dicating that the sun was in a gaseous state with high central con-
densation when the planets were born. The jets of matter thrown
out would also be gaseous, but would rapidly cool in the process of
ejection, and might soon liquefy or even solidify. It can be shown
that the planets which would be formed out of the middle portion
of such a jet ought to be much more massive than those formed near
the ends, and this may possibly provide an explanation of the com-
paratively great masses of Jupiter and Saturn. We imagine that
the planets at first described orbits under the combined gravitational
action of the sun and the passing star by which the cataclysm was
caused, but as this star receded they were left revolving, as at pres-
ent, around the sun. During their earlier motion they may them-
selves have been broken up by the tidal action of one or both of
the big masses present, and such a process may explain the origin
of the satellites of the planets. ;

Such, in its main outlines, is the tidal theory of the genesis of
the solar system. So far as can be seen, a vast amount of further
mathematical research is needed before it can be either definitely
accepted or finally condemned. For myself, I find it more acceptable
than the rotational theory, or any other hypothesis so far offered,
of the origin of the solar system. Time does not permit of a dis-
cussion of its difficulties, but I may perhaps conclude by stating what
seem to me to be its main advantages over the rotational theory.

(1) It escapes the well-known criticism of the rotational theory
that the present angular momentum of the solar system is too small
to be compatible with a previous rotational break-up, and I do not
know of any similar quantitative criticism which can be brought
against the tidal theory.

(2) The solar system is arranged with reference to two planes—
the invariable plane of the system, which contains the orbits of the
outer planets, and a second plane inclined at about 6° to the former
plane, which contains the sun’s equator and the orbit of Mercury.
A system which had broken up by rotation alone ought to be ar-
ranged symmetrically about one plane—the original invariable plane
of the system. On the tidal theory the two planes of the solar
system are readily explained as being the plane in which the tide-
raising star moved past the sun, and the original plane of the sun’s
rotation.

(3) Theoretical investigations suggest that there is only one pos-
sible end for a rotating system, namely, a binary or multiple star of
the type familiar to astronomers, and it is quite certain our system
is not of this type. Similar investigations on tidal action suggest
that the final end of a system broken up by a tidal cataclysm ought
to show many of the features of our present solar system.
THE DIAMETERS OF THE STARS.

By A. DANJON,
Astronomer at the Strasbourg Observatory.

[With 1 plate.]

Stellar astronomy is now taking its place definitely in the ranks of
sciences. For 20 to 30 years the census of the starry heavens grew,
star after star, nebula after nebula, without any definite bond, any
generalization, any law emerging showing the connections existing
among their number. Astronomers seemed yet in the dark as to
any general plan of the universe. Similarly before Ptolemy and
Hipparchus, except for the existence of the planets, the plan of the
solar system was not known. The astronomers of Alexandria made
their names forever illustrious in showing that the planets were
subject to laws. They gained the first approximation to the plan of
the solar system. True, it fell to the lot of others, of Kepler, of New-
ton, to give a more thorough solution of the problem and a deductive
status to planetary astronomy. But without their predecessor’s
steps, how halting would have been their progress.

The solving of the problems of sidereal astronomy began when
physics produced the appropriate tools. The elder Herschel had
marked out the way, helped by his great ingenuity but handicapped
by paucity of instrumental means. The American school of astrono-
mers has put on foot the work which we of to-day admire both for
its rich promise and the germs of truth it contains. Truly hypo:
thesis plays a preponderant part in the interpretation of the observa-
tions. We are yet far from the completion of a magnificent logical
structure such as planetary astronomy has gained. A mathema-
tician would be ill at ease before the numerous publications which
bring us the echo of the discoveries gleaned from the stellar universe.
At present astronomers are garnering facts; the near future may
bring the Newton or the Kepler who will place them in their proper

relationships. In a few generations doubtless the time will come to
use the rich harvest of observations now patiently being accumulated.
Then in its turn sidereal astronomy will become clear, logical, deduc-
tive. At least it is a patriotic wish that it may be so, for it is a task
especially suited to the French genius.

EQUIVALENT DIAMETERS.

The direct measurement of star diameters fills a whole chapter in
astronomy till now rather hypothetical. A jong time ago all hope
had been lost of detecting the disks of the stars with the ordinary
instruments of our observatories. At the focus of our telescopes,
diffraction spreads the light received from a luminous point into a
circular diffuse spot surrounded by rings. Since such a spot is much
larger than the true geometrical image of a star, it is impossible to
distinguish between the image of a star and that of a point. If we
try to measure with a micrometer the angular diameter of a star,
the value obtained will have no relationship with the true dimen-
sions. The measurements will give merely the diameter of the
diffraction spot which depends solely on the aperture of the objec-
tive of the telescope.”

It is true, we can measure extraordinarily small relative displace-
ments of stars, of the order of a few hundredths of a second of are.
For instance, the annual parallax* has long since been determined.
The two problems are really very different in nature and difficulty.
We can determine with great precision the center of the diffraction
spot and its displacements, although some special device is necessary
to force it to deliver up its secret of the true nature of the luminous
source. .

The measurement of stellar diameters is therefore a difficult task
to approach since we are unable to produce true images of stars by
any direct means. Consequently, for some time we have exercised
our ingenuity in avoiding this difficulty by evaluations more or less
hypothetical. Sometimes the evaluations have rested on solid foun-
dations. We know, for example, the fruitful researches relative to
eclipsing variables, but the information thus gathered does not
suffice for an exhaustive study. Let us leave aside this aspect of our
subject, very interesting though it be in itself, in order to consider
a general method based upon the comparison of the relative bright-
ness of stars and the sun.

*The diameter of the diffraction spot is inversely proportional to that of the objective.
An aperture of 12 centimeters (5 inches) gives a spot about two seconds of are (2”) in
diameter. An aperture of at least 5 meters (16 feet) would be necessary before the disk
of the greatest star (0.”05) would begin te be appreciable.

*The annual parallax of a star is the angle which the radius of the earth’s orbit about
the sun occupies as seen from the star.
DIAMETERS OF THE STARS—DANJON. 167

The apparent intensity of a luminous source depends upon two
factors; its intrinsic brilliance and its surface. If two stars have
the same intrinsic brilliance, their apparent brightnesses will be pro-
portional to their surfaces.

Let us take as an example Sirius and our sun, of which the “ mag-
nitudes ” are —1.6 and —26.7. The difference is approximately 25
magnitudes, corresponding to a ratio of apparent brightness

(Sun) / (Sirius) = 10,000,000,000.

If we admit for the moment that the two stars have the same
brightness per unit surface, we must then also admit that their ap-
parent surfaces are in the same ratio, 10,000,000,000. The apparent
diameters are in the ratio of the square root of this, or 100,000.
Since the diameter of the sun is 1,800’’, that of Sirius is 0’’.018.

Let us consider another example: Betelgeuse is 2.5 magnitudes
fainter than Sirius. Its brightness is therefore 10 times smaller ana
its diameter the square root of 10 times smaller or 0’’.006.

These diameters correspond to their true diameters only provided
that the intrinsic brightnesses of these stars and of the sun are all
the same. A priori, nothing could be less certain. However, these
values, taken in their proper significance, are precise. They are the
diameters which we must assume for fictitious stars of the same sur-
face brightness as the sun, in order that if substituted for the real
ones, their brightnesses would be of the same magnitude as the real
ones. EK. C. Pickering has designated such values as equivalent
diameters.

Having reached this far, to go farther we need to know more of
the surface brightnesses of the stars. This becomes possible through
the advance of spectroscopy and the physics of radiation. From the
laws of radiation we glean two essential properties of radiating
bodies :

First, the energy of radiation per unit surface increases with the
temperature; it is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute
temperature when the body is a “black body.” (Law of Stefan.)

Second, the spectrum composition of the emitted light also varies
with the temperature; in the spectrum of a black body, the wave-
length corresponding to the maximum intensity of energy is in-
versely proportional to the absolute temperature. (Law of Wien.)
In simpler words, as a body becomes hotter, its emitted light changes
from red to white to blue.

We therefore have reason to think the yellow and red stars are
colder than the white or blue ones. Consequently the former radiate
much less light than the latter for equal surfaces. The equivalent
diameters cannot in general be equal to the true diameters. The
stars of superior intrinsic brightness to the sun are smaller than our
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

calculations indicate, and inversely. That our determinations may
be more precise, it will be next necessary to summarize briefly the
principal basic facts of stellar spectra.

SPECTRUM CLASSIFICATIONS AND STELLAR TEMPERATURES.

The classification now universally adopted is that of Harvard. We
will pass in review the principal classes. The classes have been ar-
ranged in the order of decreasing* temperatures. We can assure
ourselves of this in verifying that, from one class to the next, the
maximum intensity retreats toward the red (at the right) and that
the blue end progressively disappears.

The first spectrum shows the type of class B, or heliwm stars.’ Their
temperatures are very high. Their light is very white or blue. Their
absorption spectrum contains helium lines. Hydrogen lines present
are usually dark but at times bright. The metallic lines are absent.

We pass next to the classes A and F characterized by the intensity
of the absorption spectrum of hydrogen. The lines of this element
belonging to the Balmer series are very noticeable (types A and F
and intermediate type F,) huddling together in the violet. The
metallic lines make their debut in class A, but they do not become
very abundant until in the spectra of type F. The latter class is
especially noteworthy for the extraordinary development of the
H and K violet lines of calcium which are faint in the preceding
classes.

The temperature becomes still lower in passing to class G where
our sun belongs. The metallic lines become definitely preponderant ;
those of hydrogen are yet more intense (C and F Fraunhofer lines)
but less so than those of calcium. The Balmer series ceases to give
the spectrum its characteristic aspect. The absorption lines of helium
have disappeared. We know that they cannot be observed in the
sun’s ordinary spectrum. Helium was discovered in the sun because
of its bright line spectrum in the chromosphere.

The stars of class K are distinctly yellow or reddish. The metallic
lines are so numerous and strong that the continuous spectrum is re-
duced to a few bright rays upon a sombre background. The scale
of the figure is perhaps not large enough to show this structure but
what can be surely seen is the weakening of the blue part of the
spectrum. This indicates a comparatively low temperature.

*The letters designating the classes are not now arranged in alphabetical order. It
would take too long to recount the history and evolution of. the Harvard classification.
Experience has arranged the classes in the order indicated.

5 We are leaving out of consideration the planetary nebulae which make up the class P,
the nebular stars, placed in class Q, and also the so-called Wolf-Rayet stars constituting
class O. The spectra of the Jast class contain a number of bright lines upon a feeble
ground. They seem related to novae or ‘‘new stars’? and are apparently yet hotter
than the stars of type B. The study of them is not so far advanced as for the stars
described in the body of the text.
DIAMETERS OF THE STARS—DANJON. 169

The same thing is yet more apparent in the case of type M which
includes a part of the red stars. The appearance of a banded spec-
trum belonging to titanium oxide confirms a considerable lowering of
temperature in the case of class M. The temperature of these stars,
indeed, cannot exceed that of the electric arc. At higher tempera-
tures, these bands characteristic of composite molecules, vanish be-
cause of atomic separation of the molecules.

We come finally to the stars of class N which are especially
characterized by bands due to carbon. This group contains only very
red and at the same time faint stars.

The essential features of the Harvard classification are given in
the following table. It also contains the probable values of the
effective temperatures of each spectrum class as indicated from a
consideration of all the values published.

If we now assume Stéfan’s law applicable, at least as a first ap-
proximation, we can, based upon these temperatures, make calcula-
tions of the relative amounts of energy emitted per unit surface by
the various stars. For example, let us calculate the diameter of
Sirius. Taking its temperature as 8,500° and that of the Sun as
6,000°, we obtain from the fourth powers of these temperatures a
ratio of about 4 to 1. Therefore, for equal surfaces, Sirius radiates
four times more energy than does the Sun. Accordingly we have
assigned to it a surface four times too great. We should divide the
equivalent diameter by 2 in order to obtain a more probable value for
its true diameter. Thus we finally get 0’’.009.

A number of writers have applied the preceding considerations
to the determination of stellar diameters. They have utilized the
best possible observational data, searching to reduce to a minimum
the share taken by hypotheses.

The angular diameters calculated for Betelgeuse by Eddington,
Nordmann, and Russell are respectively 0’7.051, 0’.059, and 0/7.031.
We must fix our ideas only on the “orders” of magnitude and not
regard these as precise determinations. With this reservation, the
accordance is satisfactory. It will appear even more so when we see
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

that the diameter measured by Michelson is exactly the mean of
the values just given.

THE DENSITY OF THE STARS.

If we know the angular diameter, we must then have the parallax
in order to calculate the linear diameter and compare it, say with
that of the sun. The calculation is simple enough, for the quotient
of the angular diameter by the parallax gives the real stellar diame-
ier expressed in astronomical units, that is, in terms of the distance
from the earth to the sun. This may then be expressed in solar
diameters. The following results are based on a table of Russell’s

data:

The contrast between the two sections of this table is striking.
To the right we see stars whose diameters average scarcely greater
than the sun’s; to the left they average 100 times greater. It is not
unlikely that there are stars three or four times smaller than the
sun. We arrive therefore at the fundamental conclusion that the
diameters of the stars vary through a range of 1 to 1,000. The ex-
treme volumes are therefore as 1 to 1,000,000,000.

The capital interest of this result appears when we consider a
parallel comparison of the masses. We find that the stars with such
different volumes have almost the same masses. We can actually
calculate the masses only in the case of binary stars whose orbital
elements and radial velocities are known. These are unfortunately
small in number, perhaps 150. Their masses he within the range
0.17 and 30, the mass of the sun being taken as unity. Can we draw
general conclusions applicable to all the stars? We do not know.
The discovery of an optical method for the determination of the
masses of single stars might help us. The principle of relativity has
perhaps opened the way to such a discovery, but while waiting on
that we are reduced to theoretical methods. The most natural is to
admit that there is no systematic ditference between single stars and
the components of double ones. We will suppose then, what appears
otherwise probable, that the masses of both are of the same order
of magnitude.
DIAMETERS OF THE STARS—DANJON. flayed

As we have just seen, the masses found in the case of double sys-
tems fall within rather narrow limits, and the ratio between the ex-
treme values is not above 1,000. We are thus forced to conclude that
the amount of condensation attained by the stars varies very much
from one to another for the range of masses stretches from 1 to 1,000
whereas that of the volumes is from 1 to 1,000,000,000. -We must
conclude that certain stars have a density a million times smaller
than others. A specific comparison will emphasize the difference:
platinum is only 250,000 times as dense as hydrogen under normal
circumstances.

We can foresee the importance of such a result for cosmogony and
the theory of evolution. Despite its acknowledged dependence to
some extent on hypotheses it conforms to all the known facts as well
as to the theoretical researches of Eddington.

The immense diversity of stellar densities seems to be thus well
established.

DWARF AND GIANT STARS.

So far we have been forced, in order to estimate stellar diameters,
to get first the angular diameter and then to correct for the distance of
the star from the earth. We can perform the operation in a single
step by starting from the absolute magnitudes since these are referred
to a standard distance.

A list of 1,646 stars whose absolute magnitudes were directly ob-
tained by the remarkable method of Adams has just been published.
This carries to nearly 2,500 the number of stars for which we have
this datum.

Interesting consequences follow from a statistical study of these
stars. In order legitimately to infer diameters from these results we
must first assort the stars into classes. It is only with stars of the
same spectrum type that we may infer equality of surface bright-
ness.

Figure 1 shows graphically the results. The abscissae refer to
absolute magnitudes, the ordinates, the numbers of stars of the
different spectrum classes. A capital result at once catches the eye.
It is the separation of the stars in each of the advanced classes into
two perfectly distinct groups. While the curves for classes B, A,
and F show only one summit, corresponding to the most frequent
magnitude, the other curves each have two maxima. The first cor-
responds to giant stars, the second to dwarfs. Thus we here find
verified with an unexpected definiteness the existence of stars of
very different volumes. Further there is not a continuous variation
in the number of stars as we pass from the giants of one class to the
dwarfs of the same class.

The mean frequency of the giant stars of class G and that of the
dwarfs of the same type are separated by an interval of five magni-
tudes. Calculation easily shows that the former are therefore 1,000
times less dense. In class M the ratio of volumes amounts to
1,000,000. Greater values naturally are obtained by comparing the
greatest giant stars with the smallest dwarfs. Our conclusions of
the preceding section are strikingly confirmed.

Let us consider a moment the cosmogony developed by Russell.
He was the first to call attention to this separation of the stars into
dwarfs and giants. According to him, giant stars are young stars.
As they age they contract and grow warmer. The dwarfs are stars
already condensed and in the process of cooling off and becoming
dark.

A star thus commences life as a giant, relatively cold. Gravitation
leads to its contraction, the energy due to the compression raising
the star’s temperature. Thus in measure as its radiating surface
(lecreases, its intrinsic brightness increases in such a manner that its
apparent brightness remains practically constant. As another result
of the increasing temperature the spectrum type alters and the star
mounts from one class to another in the order, M, K, G, F, etc.°

The density of a star, however, tends to a limit and the contraction
becomes slower and slower. When the giant star enters the hot
classes A and B, its diameter will be scarcely greater than the sun’s.
The converted gravitational energy then ceases to compensate for the
radiation losses. The temperature passes a maximum and commences
to decrease. The star becomes a dwarf whose diameter from then on
decreases almost insensibly and retrogrades down the series of spec-
trum classes in the order, B, A,______ K,M. During their evolution
stars pass twice through each spectrum class, first as a giant and
finally as a dwarf. ‘The second time its surface brightness decreases
rapidly. The star grows fainter and fainter and redder as it passes
to its final extinction. Thus Betelgeuse is a young star, Sirius has
attained a ripe age, and the sun is in its decline.

6It was thought evident before the data just given was obtained that stars like

Betelgeuse and Aldebaran were in the process of cooling off and extinction. We see now
how risky such @ priori conclusions are.
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921,

What has been stated shows how, without direct measures, the astro-
physicists have succeeded in obtaining the dimensions of stars, and
also that they have brought to light a number of quite unexpected
facts. Despite the likelihood of the hypotheses developed on the
way, a direct verification becomes increasingly desirable. Back in
1868 Fizeau proposed a method for the direct measurement of stellar
diameters. Stéphan approached the problem at Marseilles with a
telescope of 0.80 meters, but only showed the extreme minuteness of
the stellar disks. He proved that in order to measure them a much
larger instrument would be necessary. The task came to Prof. ALA
Michelson of developing the exact theory and of making its first
successful application to the stars. We will in the succeeding sec-
tions outline his methods saying here only that his measurements con-
firm in a remarkable manner the most hazardous deductions of the
astrophysicist.

THE INTERFERENTIAL METHOD.

We have said that in 1868 Fizeau proposed the application of the
interference of light to the measurement of star diameters. ‘The
method rests upon the following principle. When we try to pro-
duce interference by Young’s apertures, Fresnel’s mirrors, or a
biprism, we find that the apparent diameter of the luminous source
must be very small if the fringes are to be pure.*| If we employ as the
source of light a hole of variable diameter, lit from behind, we find
in fact that the sharpness of the fringes decreases as the diameter
of the hole increases. For a certain value of the diameter the
fringes become completely invisible. The finer and more marked
the fringes, the smaller must be the source. There is a proportion-
ality between the separation of the fringes and the limiting diameter
of the source. Michelson, to whom we owe the complete theory of
the phenomenon, showed in 1891 that the fringes of Young and of
Fresnel become invisible when the angular diameter of the source is
a little greater than the interval 8 which separates one fringe from
the next. He found indeed that

= 1.99

Why do the fringes disappear in the case of an extended source?
It is easy to see why. Each separate point of the source will give,
if it alone exists, a system of pure fringes. But the systems
corresponding to the different points of the source will trespass
upon each other’s ground and mutually blend together. The com-
plete disappearance comes when the superposition of the various

about to speak, if he will admit sunlight through an almost vanishingly narrow slit
upon white paper within a darkened room.
DIAMETERS OF THE STARS—DANJON. L75

systems produces a uniform intensity. The application of these
considerations to the angular diameters is direct. If we have a star
for our source whose angular diameter we may call , and if we
can cause the fringes to vary and disappear at will, we can find by
trial the value of 8 for which they first disappear. From the formula
just given we at once obtain o.

THE APPARATUS OF STEPHAN.

The method suggested by Fizeau was put into practice by Stéphan
at the Marseilles Observatory in 1873. The telescope objective of 80
centimeters aperture was covered with an opaque screen having two
apertures symmetrically placed with regard to the center (fig. 2).

Vic. 2.—Plan of Stéphan’s apparatus (1873).

A screen, shown in plan at the left of the figure, limits the portion of the objective
utilized to two openings, O, and Oy. The fringes are observed with a powerful eye piece
at the image of the star BH.

Under such conditions the objective utilizes only two narrow pencils
of rays coming from the star. These converge at the focal plane E
to the image of the star. If the image is examined with a powerful
 eye-piece the usual diffraction spot will be seen furrowed now with
dark equidistant bands perpendicular to the line O,O, which joins the
centers of the apertures. ‘These are the interference fringes, exactly
analogous to those which form on the retina in Young’s famous
experiment and of which the angular separation is

8=2/D where d is the wave length of light and D the distance O,0.,.

In the experiments of Stéphan, the apparatus could not dis-
tinguish angular diameters less than 1/5 of a second of arc. Now
all the stars observed by Stéphan in 1873 and 1874 gave very clear-_
cut fringes. None of them could therefore equal 0’’.2 in diameter.
Probably the largest were far beneath this value. We know to-day
that they do not exceed 0’’.05,

The interferometer method was later independently applied by
Michelson and Hamy to the measurement of the satellites of Jupiter.
As this meant working with diameters of 0’’.5 to 1’’ a telescope of
30 centimeters aperture was amply sufficient, and positive results
were obtained.
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921,

Apart from this encouraging result, the measurement of stellar
disks seemed more and more difficult to undertake. It is easily
calculated that an aperture of 2.50 meters (nearly 7 feet) is large
enough only for stars whose diameter exceeds 0’’.05. There now
exists at Mount Wilson a telescope of that aperture, the Hooker
telescope. Furnished with an apparatus similar to that of Stéphan,
it showed fringes no matter what star was examined. Stars of
diameter greater than 0’’.05 therefore do not seem to exist.

Must we therefore renounce the measurement of stellar diameters
or rather await the production of an objective of 5 to 10 meters aper-
ture? An artifice, conceived and carried out with incomparable
ability by Prof. A. A. Michelson, of the University of Chicago,
rescued astronomy from this perplexing dilemma.

THE STELLAR INTERFEROMETER OF MICHELSON.

The advantages and uniqueness of the interferential method lie in
that we may measure stars whose diameters are smaller than the
resolving power of the telescope.

In fact the problem consists in causing to interfere two bundles
of rays of which the initial linear separation D is considerable.
But it is not necesary to employ a telescope objective of diameter D.
This principle guided Michelson. Therefore the interferometer
which he constructed gives a most simple solution to the problem.
Four plane mirrors (fig. 3) gather two bundles of rays and reflect

them parallel but nearer together into the objective of a small tele-
scope. It is no longer necessary to have a giant telescope but in its
place plane mirrors and an ordinary objective carried by a rigid mount-
ing. The difficulties are now purely mechanical. The problem
becomes approachable through the resources of modern mechanical

technique. Nevertheless many physicists might have hesitated,
despite this simplification, at the idea of causing two bundles of
rays to interfere which at their start were situated 5 or 10 meters
apart. For approaching this startling feat, the audacity of the
American physicist, his profound knowledge of optics and long
experience with the most delicate apparatus was necessary.

The first interferometer, constructed in 1920, had the two receiy-
ing mirrors 6 meters apart. They were mounted upon the Hooker
telescope (fig. 4), not because of its optical power, which was not

necessary, as we have just seen, but because of the advantages which
accrued from its massive and rigid equatorial mounting, which
admitted the extra load without accompanying trouble. Another
interferometer of 16 meters, now actually under construction, will,
on the contrary, be an independently mounted instrument.

We will give some details of the 6-meter instrument. The mirrors,
15 centimeters in diameter, are carried by a trussed girder. The
two central mirrors are mounted 1.14 meters from each other. The
other two can be reciprocally displaced. In order to accomplish
this their supports are mounted on slide rests moved by two screws.
178 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

The simultaneous motion of the screws is accomplished by a small
electric motor worked from a distance by the observer (fig. 5).

The method of observing consists in separating and approaching
the first two mirrors and observing the sharpness of the fringes.
When they become invisible the distance D of the mirrors M,M, is
recorded. The theory is not wholly identical with that of the experi-

ment of Stéphan, so that his formula is not applicable. However,
the formula for the angular diameter is still

o=1.22 2/D.

A readjustment is necessary after each displacement of the mirrors.
For easing the labor of this, Michelson has devised various cunning
contrivances without which the observations would have been exces-
sively laborious if not impossible.

THE DIAMETER OF BETELGEUSE.

The decisive observation was made by Pease and Anderson on the
15th of December, 1920. The definition was fine and the images were
observed without difficuty. The stars @ Persei,  Orionis, and « Canis
Majoris gave fringes with D equalling 306 centimeters. But when
the apparatus was trained upon Betelgeuse without changing the dis-
tance of the mirrors the fringes could not be seen. At a distance of
250 centimeters they appeared, although hazy. It was allowable
then to call the value of D equal to 3 meters with an accuracy of
about 10 per cent. We thence have

=0’’.047.

A restriction is, however, necessary. The theory postulates that
the star disk is uniformly bright. It is more probably progressively

DIAMETERS OF THE STARS—DANJON. 179

darker from the center outwards just as is the solar disk. Admitting
that Betelgeuse has the same distribution of brightness as the sun,
the value obtained from the formula must be increased by an amount
which can not be exactly computed but which is about 15 per cent.
Michelson even proposes to determine the law of distribution of
brightness upon the disk of Betelgeuse by a thorough study of the
change in the sharpness of the fringes in approaching the minimum.
Admitting for the present the value 0’’.047, let us get the linear
diameter of the star. The best parallax from measures by several
observers is 0.017. The diameter of Betelgeuse is therefore

0.047/0.017=2.7 astronomical units
—300 solar diameters.

The equator of this giant star would thus contain the earth’s
orbit (two astronomical units in diameter) and nearly that of Mars
(3.4 astronomical units.) That is in full accord with the earlier
estimates,

The measurement of Arcturus made by Pease February 12, 1921,
has also checked with the theoretical value. For this star it was
necessary to use the total available length of the interferometer, 6
meters. This gives for Arcturus a diameter of 0’’.024. The diam-
eter predicted by Russell was 0’’.019. The parallax of the star is
0’’.095, according to van Maanen and Russell. Its diameter in
linear measure is, therefore, 28 times that of the sun. _

Finally, more recent observations have led to the value 0’’.040 for
the angular diameter of Antares. The most probable parallax is
0’7.023. Whence we deduce a diameter for Antares 200 times larger
than the sun’s. Again the order of magnitude predicted is con-
firmed.

tions either the act of section would become impossible, or the result
would be lead no longer. Bacon, Descartes, Gassendi, Boyle, and
Hooke were all partial to the latter theory, and Newton in 1675 tried
to explain Boyle’s Law on the assumption that gases were made up
of mutually repulsive particles.

The accuracy of modern knowledge is such that we can carry out,
indirectly at least, the experiment suggested by the old philosophers
right up to the stage when the second school is proved correct, and
the ultimate atom of lead reached. For convenience, we will start
with a standard decimeter cube of lead weighing 11.37 kilograms,
ATOMIC WEIGHTS—ASTON. 183

and the operation of section will consist of three cuts at right angles
to each other, dividing the original cube into eight similar bodies
each of half the linear dimensions and one-eighth the weight. Thus
the first cube will have 5 cm. sides and weigh 1.42 kilograms, the
second will weigh 178 grs., the fourth 2.78 grs., and so on. Diminu-
tion in the series is very rapid and the result of the ninth operation
is a quantity of lead just weighable on the ordinary chemical balance.
The results of further operations are compared with suitable objects
and a scale of length in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The last operation pos-
sible, without breaking up the lead atom, is the twenty-eighth. The
twenty-sixth cube is illustrated in Figure 3. It contains 64 atoms,
whose size, distance apart, and general arrangement can be repre-
sented with considerable accuracy, thanks to the exact knowledge de-
rived from research on X rays and specific heats. On the same scale
are represented the largest atom, cesium, and the smallest atom, car-
bon, together with molecules of oxygen and nitrogen, at their aver-
age distance apart in the air, and the helical arrangement of silicon
and oxygen atoms in quartz crystals discovered by X-ray analysis.
The following table shows at what stages certain analytical methods
break down. The great superiority of the microscope is a noteworthy
point.

Just as any vivid notion of the size of the cubes passes out of our
power at about the twelfth—the limiting size of a dark object visible
to the unaided eye—so when one considers the figures expressing the
number of atoms in any ordinary mass of material, the mind is stag-
gered by their immensity. Thus, if we slice the original decimeter
cube into square plates one atom thick the area of these plates will
total one and one-quarter square miles. If we cut these plates into
strings of atoms spaced apart as they are in the solid, these decimeter
strings put end to end will reach 6.3 million million miles, the dis-
tance light will travel in a year, a quarter of the distance to the near-
est fixed star. If the atoms are spaced but one millimeter apart the
string will be three and a half million times longer yet, spanning the
whole universe.

air outside for a hundred million years. Perhaps the most striking
illustration is as follows: Take a tumbler of water and—supposing
it possible—label all the molecules in it. Throw the water into the
sea, or indeed, anywhere you please, and after a period of time so
great that all the water on the earth—in sea, lakes, rivers, and
clouds—has had time to become perfectly mixed, fill your tumbler
again at the nearest tap. How many of the labeled molecules are to
be expected in it? The answer is, roughly, 2,000; for although the

number of tumblers full of water on the earth is 5 by 10 *, the number
of molecules of water in a single tumbler is 10 ”°.

From the above statements it would, at first sight, appear absurd
to hope to obtain effects from single atoms, yet this can now be done
in several ways, and, indeed, it is largely due to the results of such ex-
periments that the figures can be stated with so much confidence.
Detection of an individual is only feasible in the case of an atom
moving with an enormous velocity when, although its mass is so
minute, its energy is quite appreciable. The charged helium atom

against a fluorescent screen can be visibly detected, the ionization
caused by its passage through a suitable gas can be measured on a
sensitive electrometer and, in the beautiful experiments of C. T. R.
Wilson, its path in air can be both seen and photographed by means
of the condensation of water drops upon the atomic wreckage it
leaves behind it.

In the first complete Atomic Theory put forward by Dalton in
1803 one of the postulates states that: “ Atoms of the same element
are similar to one another and equal in weight.” Of course, if we
take this as a definition of the word “ Element” it becomes a truism,
but, on the other hand, what Dalton probably meant by an element,
and what we understand by the word to-day, is a substance such as
hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, or lead, which has unique chemical prop-
erties and can not be resolved into more elementary constituents by
any known chemical process. For many of the well-known elements
Dalton’s postulate still appears to be strictly true, but for others,
probably the majority, it needs some modification.

The idea that atoms of the same element are all identical in
weight could not be challenged by ordinary chemical methods, for
the atoms are by definition chemically identical and numerical ratios
were only to be obtained in such methods by the use of quantities
of the element containing countless myriads of atoms. At the same
time it is rather surprising, when we consider the complete absence
of positive evidence in its support, that no theoretical doubts were
publicly expressed until late in the nineteenth century, first by
Schutzenberger and then by Crookes, and that these doubts have
been regarded, even up to the last few years, as speculative in the
highest degree. In order to dismiss the idea that the atoms of such
a familiar element as chlorine might not all be of the same weight,
one had only to mention diffusion experiments and the constancy of
chemical equivalents. It is only within the last few years that the
lamentable weakness of such arguments has been exposed and it has
been realized that the experimental separation of atoms differing
from each other by as much as 10 per cent in weight, is really an
excessively difficult operation.

There are two ways by which the identity of the weights of the
atoms forming an element can be tested. The one is by the direct
comparison of the weights of individual atoms, the other is by
obtaining samples of the element from different sources or by differ-
ent processes, which, although perfectly pure, do not give the same
chemical atomic weight. It was by the second and less direct of
these methods that it was first shown that substances could exist
which, though chemically identical, had different atomic weights.

In 1906 Boltwood,? at Yale, discovered a new element in the radio-

186 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1921.

active group which he called ionium, and described as having chem-
ical properties similar to those of thorium. So much was this the
case that if, by accident, salts of these two elements were mixed,
he found it impossible to separate them again by any of the chemical
processes. This chemical identity was confirmed in the most con-
vincing manner by the later work of Marckwald, Keetman * and
Welsbach,! although the two elements certainly had different radio-
active properties and it was extremely probable that they had dif-
ferent atomic weights. More identities of a similar nature among
the radioactive elements were discovered by Soddy,’ Hahn,’ and
others, and the situation in 1910 will be found admirably summed
up by Soddy in his report to the Chemical Society for that year.’
In 1912, Russel and Rossi*® showed that the spectra of ionium and
thorium were indistinguishable and Rutherford’s theory of the
“Nucleus Atom” supplied a possible explanation. The association
of the chemical and spectroscopic properties of an element with
something more fundamental than its atomic weight, namely, the
charge on the nuclei of its atoms or its “ Atomic Number,” was
proved by the epoch-making work of Moseley in 1913.° This idea
gave a simple and entirely satisfactory meaning to the chemical laws
of the radioactive disintegrations discovered a little earlier and pre-
dicted that among the numerous products of these disintegrations
there must of necessity be some having identical chemical properties
but different atomic weights.

To the latter the name “Isotopes” was applied by Soddy in the
following words: “The same algebraic sum of the positive and nega-
tive charges in the nucleus when the arithmetical sum is different
gives what I call ‘isotopes’ or ‘isotopic elements, because they
occupy the same place in the periodic table. They are chemically
identical, and save only as regards the relatively few physical prop-
erties which depend upon atomic mass directly, physically identical
also.”

The theory of isotopes received its most triumphant vindication,
as far as it concerned the products of radioactivity, from the results
of work on the atomic weight of lead. Study of the radioactive
disintegrations shows that the final product of every series is lead.
If we take the main chain of the uranium-radium transformation,
this lead must have an atomic weight 206, for it has lost 5 alpha par-
ticles—each of weight 4-since it was radium, and the atomic weight
of radium is 226. On the other hand, if we take the main thorium

chain, the lead end product must be 6 alpha particles lighter than
thorium (232.15), and so should have an atomic weight about 208.

Now, ordinary lead from nonradioactive sources has an atomic
weight 207.20, so Soddy ? suggested in 1913 that the lead derived
from minerals containing uranium but no thorium might have a
smaller atomic weight than ordinary lead, and, on the other hand,
the atomic weight of lead from minerals containing thorium but no
uranium might be greater.

The first experiments were made by Soddy and Hyman” with a
very small quantity of lead from Ceylon thorite. This gave a per-
ceptibly higher atomic weight than ordinary lead. Later a large
quantity of the same mineral was available. The lead from this when
carefully purified gave a density of 0.26 per cent higher than that
of common lead. On the assumption that the atomic volumes of iso-
topes are equal, this figure corresponds to an atomic weight of 207.74.
A chemical atomic weight determination gave 207.694. A sample of
the same lead was sent to Vienna, where Professor Honigschmid, a
well-known expert in such matters, obtained from it a value 207.77
as a mean of eight determinations. These figures not only showed
that thorium lead had a higher atomic weight than ordinary lead
but also that their atomic volumes were identical, as expected from
theory.”

At the same time as this work was in progress the leading Ameri-
can authority on atomic weights, T. W. Richards,* of Harvard,
started a series of investigations on lead derived from various radio-
active minerals. The samples of lead from uranium minerals all
gave results lower than ordinary lead, as was expected, and one par-
ticularly pure specimen of uranio-lead from Norwegian cleveite gave
206.08,"* a very striking agreement with theory. The following table
of properties is taken from his presidential address to the American
Association at Baltimore, December, 1918:

In further confirmation Maurice Curie in Paris reported 206.36
for a lead from carnotite, and a still lower figure, 206.046, was ob-
tained by Honigschmid in Vienna for a lead from the very pure cry-
stallized pitchblende from Morogoro.** This is the lowest atomic
weight found so far. The highest, 207.9, was also determined by
Honigschmid for lead from Norwegian thorite.

In the absence of the special radioactive evidence which can be
used in special cases such as that of lead, the presence of isotopes
among the inactive elements can only be detected by the direct
measurement of the masses of individual atoms. This can be done
by the analysis of positive rays.

The condition for the development of these rays is briefly ioniza-
tion at low pressure in a strong electric field. Ionization, which may
be due to collisions or radiation, means in its simplest case the de-
tachment of one electron from a neutral atom. The two resulting
fragments carry charges of electricity of equal quantity but of op-
posite sign. The negatively charged one is the electron, the atomic
unit of negative electricity itself, and is the same whatever the atom
ionized. It is extremely light and therefore in the strong electric
field rapidly attains a high velocity and becomes a cathode ray. The
remaining fragment is clearly dependent on the nature of the atom
ionized. It is immensely more massive than the electron, for the
mass of the lightest atom, that of hydrogen, is about 1850 times that
of the electron, and so will attain a much lower velocity under the
action of the electric field. However, if the field is strong and the
pressure so low that it does not collide with other atoms too fre-
quently, it will ultimately attain a high speed in a direction opposite
to that of the detached electron, and become a “ positive ray.” The
_ simplest form of positive ray is therefore an atom of matter carry-
ing a positive charge and endowed, as a result of falling through a
high potential, with sufficient energy to make its presence detectable.
Positive rays can be formed from molecules as well as atoms, so that
it will at once be seen that any measurement of their mass will give
us direct information as to the masses of atoms of elements and mole-
cules of compounds, and that this information will refer to the atoms
or molecules individually, not, as in chemistry, to the mean of an
immense aggregate. It is on this account that the accurate analysis
of positive rays is of such importance.

In order to investigate and analyze them it is necessary to obtain
intense beams of the rays. This can be done in several ways. The
one most generally available is by the use of the discharge in gases at
low pressure.

1®M. Curie: Compt. Rend., 158, 1676, 1914.

ATOMIC WEIGHTS—-ASTON. 189

It is somewhat remarkable that notwithstanding the immense
amount of research work done on the discharge at low pressure its
most obvious phenomena are almost entirely without explanation;
modern measurements and other data have merely destroyed the
older theories without, as yet, suggesting others to replace them.
In discussing positive rays it is of importance to consider the phe-
nomena taking place immediately in front of the cathode of the
discharge tube.

The comparatively dimly lt space between the cathode and the
bright “negative glow” is named after its discoverer the “ Crookes’
Dark Space.” Its length is roughly inversely proportional to the
pressure of the gas in the tube. Its boundary, the edge of the nega-
tive glow, is remarkably sharp in most gases, quite amazingly so in
pure oxygen. If large plane cathodes are used so that the effect of
the glass walls—so far a complete mystery—does not come in, very
accurate and consistent measurements of the Crookes’ dark space can
be made. Working with a very large “ guard-ring” cathode, the
writer showed in 1907 *" that its length Y could be expressed as

/alypion 5)
D= pt Pe
where ? is the pressure, 2 the current density on the surface of the
cathode and A and & constants. This expression is fairly exact for
ordinary gases, but only approximate for those of the helium group.*®
A varies both with the nature of the gas and the metal used as
cathode. With the same metal as cathode it is four to five times as
big for hydrogen as for oxygen; using the same gas, it is about twice
as big with a silver cathode as for one of aluminum.’®- The value
of the remarkable constant &, which is independent of the pressure,
is also practically unchanged either by the nature of the gas, or the
nature or even the shape of the cathode.

During these investigations it was also demonstrated that in the
absence of the positive column, the whole of the potential V required
to maintain the discharge, takes place between the cathode and the
negative glow, and its relation to the current may be expressed by
the equation

# and F being constants which depend on the nature of the gas and
the metal used as cathode.

Measurements of the distribution of potential in the dark space
by a method which appears free from objection *° show that the field

is practically zero in the negative glow itself and increases in a
linear manner as we move towards the cathode. ‘This means that the
density of the positive electrification (excess of positive over negative
ions) in the dark space is constant.

No theory yet put forward can account for these numerical] rela-
tions; one can, however, be certain that ionization is going on at all
points throughout the dark space, and that it reaches a very high
intensity in the negative glow.*_ This ionization is probably caused
for the most part by electrons liberated from the surface of the cath-
ode (cathode rays). These, when they reach a speed sufficient to
ionize by collision, liberate more free electrons which, in their turn,
become ionizing agents, so that the intensity of ionization from this
cause will tend to increase as we move away from the cathode.

The liberation of the original electrons from the surface of the
cathode is generally regarded as due to the impact of the positive
ions (positive rays) generated in the negative glow and the dark
space. Even this idea, for which there is a fair amount of definite
evidence, is now called in question for Ratner *? has recently described
experiments proving “ that the initial discharge of electricity through
vacuum tubes is not brought about by the impact of positive ions
against the surface of the cathode, and that positive ions impinging
upon the cathode with velocities corresponding to a fall through a
potential difference up to 2000 volts, are unable to liberate electrons
from the surface of the cathode.” It must, however, be borne in mind
that the nature of the positive ions used in Ratner’s experiments is
not known with certainty, and that the intensity of bombardment
was of an entirely different and smaller order than that usually asso-
ciated with normal discharge.

During the work on the length of the dark space a very curious
and interesting phenomenon was observed in hydrogen and all
the gases of the helium group. This consisted of a dark space
very small and very dark, immediately in front of the cathode,
inside the Crookes’ dark space.?* It can only be clearly seen by look-
ing across the face of a large plane cathode when its appearance in
pure helium or neon is very striking. Its properties are completely
different from those of the Crookes’ dark space. Its length, which is
usually less than a millimeter, is independent of the pressure and
varies roughly inversely as the square root of the current density.
As the field close to the cathode varies directly as the square root of
the current density this suggested at once that the new dark space
represented a definite constant fall of potential. There is now little

doubt that this “ Primary Dark Space,” as it has been called, defines
the distance through which an electron, starting from rest at the sur-
face of the cathode, must fall before it acquires sufficient energy to
ionize the gas by collision. This explanation is supported in a strik-
ing manner by the appearance of the phenomenon when the current
density is greatly reduced. Under these conditions alternate dark
and bright bands, equally spaced, appear in front of the cathode
exactly as would be expected from the production of successive gen-
erations of ions. Further support is given by the measurements in
hydrogen and helium, which indicate that the actual fall of potential
across the primary dark space is twice as great for helium as for
hydrogen and, on certain assumptions, is approximately equal to the
ionization potential of these gases determined by other means.

In addition to cathode ray ionization the positive rays traveling
towards the cathode themselves are capable of ionizing the gas, and
radiation may also play an important part in the same process. The
surface of the cathode will therefore be under a continuous hail of
positively charged particles. Their masses may be expected to vary
from that of the lightest atom to that of the heaviest molecule capa-
ble of existence in the discharge tube, and their energies from an
indefinitely small value to a maximum expressed by the product of
the charge they carry the total potential applied to the electrodes.
The latter is practically the same as the fall of potential across the
dark space. If the cathode be pierced, the rays pass through the
aperture and form a stream heterogeneous both in mass and velocity
which can be subjected to examination and analysis.**

A powerful and ingenious method of generating positive rays of
metallic elements has been worked out and used with great success
by Dempster at Chicago.?® He employs the element in the metallic
state and ionizes its vapor by means of a subsidiary beam of cathode
rays. The ions so produced are allowed to fall through a definite
potential and being therefore of constant energy can be analyzed by
the use of a magnetic field alone. By this arrangement Dempster
discovered the three isotopes of magnesium ** and confirmed those
of lithium. A full account of this work has lately appeared.?* Still
more recently he has obtained results with calcium and zine which
indicate that the former consists almost entirely of an isotope 40
with probable traces of another 44, and that the latter has four
isotopes—64, 66, 68, and 70. Since the vast majority of the elements

By far the most important general result of these investigations
is that, with the exception of hydrogen, the weights of the atoms of
all the elements measured, and therefore almost certainly of all ele-
ments, are whole numbers to the accuracy of experiment. In the
majority of the figures obtained by means of the mass-spectrograph
this accuracy is one part in a thousand. Of course the error ex-
pressed in fractions of a unit increases with the weight measured,
but with the lighter elements the divergence from the whole number
rule is extremely small.

This enables the most sweeping simplifications to be made in our
ideas of mass. The original hypothesis of Prout, put forward in
1815, that all atoms were themselves built of atoms of protyle, a
hypothetical element which he tried to identify with hydrogen, is
now reéstablished, with the modification that the primordial atoms
are of two kinds: Protons and electrons, the atoms of positive and
negative electricity.

The Rutherford atom, whether we take Bohr’s or Langmuir’s
development of it, consists essentially of a positively charged central
nucleus around which are set planetary electrons at distances great
compared with the dimensions of the nucleus itself.

As has been stated, the chemical properties of an element depend
solely on its atomic number, which is the charge on its nucleus ex-
pressed in terms of the unit charge, ¢. A neutral atom of an element
of atomic number JW has a nucleus consisting of A+ protons and
K electrons, and around this nucleus are set V electrons. The weight
of an electron on the scale we are using is 0.0005, so that it may be
neglected. The weight of this atom will pleEeteae be X-L-N, so that
if no restrictions are alecedl on the value of A any number of isotopes
are possible.

A statistical study of the results given above shows that the
natural restrictions can be stated in the ae of rules as follows:

In the nucleus of an atom there is never less than one electron to
every two protons.—There is no known exception to this law. It is
the expression of the fact that if an element has an atomic number
N the atomic weight of its lightest isotope can not be less than 24.
