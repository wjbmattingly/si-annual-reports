JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITH-
SONTAN INSTITUTION.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, January 28, 1891.

In accordance with aresolution of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, fixing the time of the beginning of the annual ses-
sion on the fourth* Wednesday of January in each year, the Board met
to-day at 10 o’clock A. M.

Present, Chief-Justice FULLER, Chancellor of the Institution, Hon.
J.S. MORRILL, Hon. S. M. CULLom, Hon. R. L. Grsson, Hon. H. C.
LopGE. Hon. JOSEPH WHEELER, Dr. HENRY CoPPEE, Dr. JAMES
C. WELLING, Gen. M.C. Meigs, Dr. ANDREW D. WHITE, and the
Secretary.

The minutes of the last meeting (January 8, 1890) were read and
approved.

A letter from Dr. J. B. ANGELL was read, stating the reasons for
his absence from the meeting.

The Secretary informed the Board that the following resolution had
been passed by Congress and approved May 22, 1890:

No, 23. Joint resolution to fill vacancies in the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the vacancies in the Board
of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, of the class other than mem-
bers of Congress, shall be filled by the appointment of Charles Devens,
of Massachusetts, in place of Noah Porter, of Connecticut, resigned ;
and by the appointment of James C. Welling, of Washington City,
whose term of office has expired.

Approved, May 22, 1890.

The Secretary read a letter from Judge Devens, September 20, 1890,
declining the honor of the position of one of the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, on account of a provision in the constitution of the
State of Massachusetts, that ‘ Justices of the supreme judicial court

“Resolution of the Board, January 8, 1890.
xi JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

of the Commonweaith shall not hold any other place or office, or receive
any pension or salary from any other State, government, or power
whatever.”

Judge Devens stated that were it not for this provision of law ‘ it
would have afforded ” him “sincere pleasure to have been associated
with the Regents and the Secretary in the administration of this great
national trust for the diffusion of knowledge among men.”

The Secretary stated to theBoard that since the receipt of this decli-
nation he regretted to announce the death of Judge Devens very sud-
denly on the 7th of the present month.

Dr. Welling, chairman, presented the annual report of the executive
committee for the year ending 30th June, 1890.

On motion the report was accepted.

On motion the following resolution was adopted:

hesolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1892, be appropriated for the service of the Instituticn, to
be expended by the Secretary, with the advice of the executive com-
mittee, upon the basis of the operations described in the last annual
report of said committee, with full discretion on the part of the Secre-
tary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of the
heads embraced in the established conduct of the Institution.

Doctor Welling, on the part of the Executive Committee, stated that
he had a resolution to introduce, which he desired to preface by a few
remarks.

The resolution of the committee, after certain verbal alterations,
was adopted and is as follows:

Resolved, That the action of the Executive Committee, during the
recess of the Board, in authorizing the Secretary of the Institution to
act for and in the name of the Regents in all matters pertaining to the
National Zodlogical Park is hereby approved, and that the Regents
authorize and direct the Secretary of the Institution to sign in their
name all requisitions on the United States Treasury for the money ap-
propriated by Congress for the National Zodlogical Park, and to
approve for payment by the disbursing officer of the Smithsonian In-
stitution all bills for services and supplies for said Park.

On motion, the following resolution was adopted:

Whereas Congress in the sundry civil act, approved August 30,
1890, made the following provision: “ Repairs, Smithsonian Building:
For fire-proofing the so-called chapel of the west wing of the Smith-
sonian Building, and for repairing the roof of the main building and the
ceiling and plastering of the main hall of the building, $25,000, said
work to be done under the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol
with the approval of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and no
portion of the appropriation to be used for skylights in the roof*nor for
wellhole in the floor of the main building:” Therefore,

Resolved, That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
authorize the Secretary of the Institution to sign all requisitions on
the United States Treasury for the money appropriated by Congress
(sundry civil appropriation act, approved August 30, 1890) for repairs,
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII

Smithsonian Building, to approve of plans submitted by the Architect
of the Capitol, and to certify to all vouchers for payments by the Treasury
Department for work done or materials furnished for said repairs.

The Secretary called attention to an estimate he had submitted to
Congress at the beginning of the session in relation to an astro-physical
observatory as follows:

Astro-physical Observatory, Smithsonian Institution.—Maintenance of
astro-physical observatory, under the direction of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, within the limits of the National Zodlogical Park, including
salaries of assistants and the purchase of additional apparatus (Sub-
mitted), $10,000.

Novre.—An astro-physical observatory and laboratory exists now
under every considerable civilized government but that of the United
States which has none, except that the Institution commenced one on
the most modest scale in 1888, which now occupies a temporary struc-
ture on the grounds south of the Smithsonian building. Private citi-
zens have subscribed $10,000 for an astro-physical observatory under
the charge of the Regents, in the hope that Congress would maintain
it, and the Smithsonian Institution proposes, in this case, to contribute
the most recent apparatus to the value of $5,000 more.

The sum now asked is to be applied to the completion of the plant
and to pay the current expenses, including the salaries of three assist-
ants, to be engaged in researches of great scientific and economic value,
wholly distinct in apparatus, methods, and objects from the quite
otherwise important ones of those of the U. S. Naval Observatory.

It seems proper to state that the present appropriation is not asked
for as an introduction to a larger one later, but that owing to the scale
on which it is proposed to found and maintain this small establish-
ment, no larger appropriation is contemplated as necessary for many
years at least.

He stated that if Congress saw fit to make the appropriation asked
for, even if it did not set apart a site in the Zodlogical Park for the
observatory, it would be desirable for the Board of Regents to take
action in accordance with the suggestions made in his estimates and
annual report.

On motion, it was—

Resolved, That if an appropriation should be made by Congress for
the maintenance of an astro-physical observatory under the direction
of the Smithsonian Institution, the Regents will expend for this pur-
pose from money already donated to them $10,000 for the construction
of buildings for said observatory whenever a suitable site shall be desig-
nated by Congress and obtained for the purpose, and will present to it
suitable apparatus of the most recent construction, now in their charge,
to the value of not less than $5,000.

The secretary stated that the following bill had been passed in the
Senate of the United States on the 5th of April, 1890:

AN ACT to provide for the erection of an additional fireproof building for the
National Museum.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That for an additional fire-
proof building for the use of the National Museum, three hundred feet
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

square, with two stories and a basement, to be erected by the Super-
vising Architect of the Treasury, under the direction of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution, in general accordance with plans now
on file with the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, on the
southwestern portion of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution,
there shall be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated, the sum of five hundred thousand dollars;
said building to be placed west of the Smithsonian Institution, with
its north front on a line with the north front of the present Museum
building, and constructed as far as practicable, after proper advertise-
ment, by contract or contracts, awarded to the lowest responsible bid-
der, and all expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned shall be
audited by the proper officers of the Treasury Department.

The Committee on Public Buildings in the House of Representatives
had made on the 9th of January, 1891, a favorable report on this bill,
and it had been submitted to the House as follows:

The Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, to whom was re-
ferred the bill (S. 2740) for the erection of an additional fireproof build-
ing for the National Museum, submit the following report:

To demonstrate the pressing necessity for additional accommodations
for the vast amount of materials which has been accumulated for ex-
hibition in the National Museum it will, perhaps, be sufficient to pre-
sent the communication of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

It may also be stated that in view of acquiring a large quantity of
the exhibit of the World’s Fair of 1892, as was the case in the exhibi-
tion of 1876, such material being presented by various foreign countries,
the pressing necessities are clearly demonstrated.

Your committee therefore recommend the passage of the bill as
amended.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM,
Washington, April 29, 1290.

Sir: I have the honor to lay before you certain considerations set-
ting forth the necessity of an additional building for the National
Museum and respectfully request your attention to them and your
recommendation to Congress that the money necessary for this purpose
be appropriated.

A set of provisional plans for the proposed new building has already
been prepared, and I understand that these are in the possession of
your committee. They have been prepared with the utmost care and
represent the results of exhaustive study, which has extended over
several years, of the plans of the best modern museum buildings in
Europe and America, nearly all of which have been personally inspected
by officers of the Smithsonian Institution.

The proposed building will contain about 220,000 square feet and
the net area available for exhibition space and for storage and _ office
room would be between five and six acres. The exhibition space would
thus be nearly three times as great as in the present buildings, in
which only 80,000 square feet are available both for exhibition and
storage purposes.

The total cost of the present building was $315,400, including expen-
ditures for steam-heating apparatus, marble floors, water and gas
fixtures, and electrical apparatus.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. DW

The proposed building can, I believe, be constructed at a propor-
tionately smaller cost. Lam not prepared to state the exact sum which
would be necessary for its completion; but, from estimates already fur-
nished by responsible contractors, I feel sure that $500,000, if not suffi-
cient to complete it, would be all that would be required to be expended
during the present year, and I would earnestly urge the desirability of
appropriating this amount for the purpose in question.

The necessity for anew Museum building is caused by the large in-
crease in the accessions to the collections. In 1882, the first year of
active work in the present building, the Museum contained less than
195,000 specimens. This number has now been increased to nearly
3,000,000 specimens, and the increase during the past eight years has
been more than half as large again as during the previous twenty -one
years.

The collections of the Smithsonian Institution and of the Govern-
ment are especially rich in representations of the natural history of
this country. <A careful estimate made at the end of the last fiscal
year showed that there were at that time in the zodlogical collections
1,850,721 specimens, in the botanical collections 48 637 Specimens, in
the geologic al collections 106,766 specimens, in the paleontological
collections 172 O40 specimens, in the anthropological collections 651,868
specimens, and in the various collections illustrating the arts and
industries 45,540 specimens. Since this estimate was made, it is prob-
able that more than 50,000 specimens of all kinds have been received.

The natural-history collections include the zodlogical collections,
the botanical collections, and the geological collections, in which are
contained not only all the geologic al and mineralogical specimens, but
also the greater portion of the “‘paleontologic: il materi al, the study of
fossil animals and plants forming an essential feature of modern geo-
logical work.

"The anthropological collections illustrate the history of mankind at
all periods and in every land and also serve to explain the develop-
ment of all human arts and industries. There are in addition consid-
erable collections illustrating the processes and products of the various
arts and industries, as well as the historical collections, which are of
especial interest to a very large number of the visitors to the Museum
on account of the associations of the objects exhibited with the personal
history of representative men or with important events in the history
of America.

It is also noteworthy that among the accessions of more recent years
many collections of great extent have beenreceived. Among these are
the bequest of Dr. Tsaac Lea, of Philadelphia, which contains 20,000
specimens of shells, besides minerals and other objects; the Jeffries
collection of fossil and recent shells of Europe, including 40,000 speci-
mens; the Stearns collection of mollusks, numbering 100, 000 specimens;
the Riley collection of insects, containing 50,000 specimens; the Catlin
collection of Indian paintings, and the collection of the American In-
stitute of Mining Engineers.

In addition may also be mentioned the extensive collection obtained
at the Fisheries Exhibitions at Berlin and London, at the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial Exposition, and at the Ohio Valley and Central
States Exposition. To these may be added the collections received
annually from U, S. Fish Commission, the Geological Surve y, the

Sureau of Ethnology, and from many other Government de partments
and bureaus. These are very extensive and are yearly increasing in
bulk and value,
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

There is in the present Museum Building no exhibition space avail-
able for the collection of reptiles, mollusks, insects, marine inverte-
brates, vertebrate and invertebrate fossils; and the space now afforded
for the exhibition of the vast collections of fishes, birds’ eggs, plants—
fossil and recent—and the geological collections, aggregating not less
than 350,000 specimens, is entirely inadequate.

In a letter addressed in 1888 to the chairman of the Senate Commit-
tee on Public Buildings and Grounds [ endeavored to demonstrate the
remarkable increase which had characterized the growth of the col-
lections in the National Museum, and I there stated that in the five
years between 1882 and 1887 the number of specimens in the collection
had multiplied no less than sixteen times. Since 1887 the pressure for
additional room has, of course, grown greater, and during the last year
it has become necessary to decline many offers of collections for want
not only of exhibition space, but even of storage room where they may
be temporarily cared for.

The armory building, which for more than ten years had been used
by the Museum for storage purposes, is now entirely occupied by the
U.S. Fish Commission, with the exception of four rooms, used by some
of the Museum taxidermists, who are now working in very contracted
space, and whom it is impossible to accommodate elsewhere.

livery space is now fille to its utmost capacity, and no more collec-
tions of any considerable extent can be received until additional room
is provided for their reception.

In a few words it may be stated that for exhibition, storage, and
laboratory space 316,400 square feet are needed instead of 100,675
square feet, which now constitute the available area for all of these
purposes.

In conclusion, I reaffirm without hesitation that unless additional
space is provided it will be impossible to take any further important
steps toward the improvement of the Government collections.

Your obedient servant,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
Hon. SETH L. MILLIKEN,
Chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings
and Grounds, House of Representatives.

In view of the probability of the passage by Congress of the bill
providing for a new building for the Museum, it was—

Resolved, That the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents, or
a majority thereof, and the Secretary, be, and they are hereby, autho-
rized and empowered to act for and in the name of the Board of Regents
in carrying into effect the provisions of any act of Congress that may
be passed providing for the erection of a new building for the United
States National Museum.

A memorial was read from Doulton & Co., of London, England,
calling attention to the deposit in the institution in 1876 of certain
articles of terra-cotta, the principal one being the colossal group
“America,” a copy of one of the marble groups by Bell on the pedestal
of the Albert Memorial Monument in Kensington, and asking that the
Board of Regents be pleased to recommend to the Government that
an appropriation be made for the purchase of the goods now in their
possession.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XVII

The whole subject had been carefully considered by the Executive
Committee and was now submitted to the Board without recommenda-
tion.

After some discussion and inquiries by members of the Board of the
Secretary and Chairman of the Executive Committee as to the value
of the articles as works of art and the desirability of their acquisition
for the Institution, it was—

Resolved, That the memorial of Doulton & Co. be re-referred to the
Secretary with power to act.

The Secretary stated that he had been authorized by the President,
the Vice-President, the Chief-Justice, and other members of the Estab-
lishment to ask for legislation the effect of which would be to modify
the organic act so that the “ Establishment” would consist of these high
officials and of all the heads of Departments.

The proposed change . . . is covered by the following words:

Be it enacted, etc., That “ An act to establish the Smithsonian Insti-
tution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” ap-
proved August 10, 1846, Revised Statutes, Title Lxxu1, be, and the
same is hereby, amended in section 5579 of said act, by striking out
the words, “the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the
Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General,
the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of the Patent-Office, and the
Governor of the District of Columbia, and such other persons as they
may elect honorary members,” and inserting the words, ‘the heads of
Executive Departments,” so that the section will read:

Sc. 5579. The President, the Vice-President, the Chief-Justice,
and the heads of Executive Departments are hereby constituted an
establishment by the name of the “Smithsonian Institution” for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men; and by that name
shall be known and have perpetual succession, with the powers, limi-
tations, and restrictions hereinafter contained, and no other.

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the instructions given
him at the last meeting of the Board he had prepared the following
memoranda relative to the re-imbursement of money expended by the
Institution for the Governmental system of exchanges.

[Memorandum relative to the re-imbursement of the Smithsonian fund for expendi-
tures on account of Government exchanges. |

At a meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
on January 8, 1890, it was

Resolved, That the Regents instruct the Secretary to ask of Congress
legislation for the repayment to the Institution of the amount advanced
from the Smithsonian fund for Governmental service in carrying on the
exchanges.

In pursuance of this instruction the Secretary has the honor to sub-
mit the following statement:

Under the act of Congress accepting a donation from James Smith-
son for “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and giv-
ing effect to this trust by the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution,
the Board of Regents in 1851 established a system of international ex-

change of the Transactions of learned societies and like works; but, in
addition to such publications, it voluntarily transported between 1851
and 1867 somewhat over 20,000 packages of publications of the bu-
reaus of the National Government at an estimated cost to the private
funds of the Institution of about $8,000. This however was understood
to be a voluntary service, and no request for its reimbursement has
been made or is contemplated.

Congress however in 1867, by its act of March 2, imposed upon the
Institution the duty of exchanging fifty copies of all documents printed
by order of either House of Congress or by the United States Govern-
ment or bureaus, for similar works published in foreign countries, and
especially by foreign governments.

The Institution possessed special facilities and experience for such
work, the propriety of its undertaking which, in the interests of the
Government, is evident; but it was hardly to have been anticipated
that the Government should direct this purely administrative service
and make no appropriation for its support. Such however was the
case, and with the exception of a small (presently to be noted) sum, re-
turned by some bureaus, it was wholly maintained during the next
thirteen years, or until the first appropriation to the Institution for
Exchanges in 1881, at the expense of the private fund of James Smith-
son.

From January 1, 1868, to June 30, 1886, 292,483 packages containing
these official Government publications, having little to do with the
object to which Congress devoted the Institution’s private funds, were
transported by the exchange bureau ata pro rata cost of $92,943,36,
of which $29,706.85 accrued between 1881, when the first specifie appro-
priation was made, and 1886. Of this $92,943.36, $19,302.35 was re-
turned from various departments and bureaus, leaving a balance of
$73,641.01 expended in carrying exclusively governmental publications.

What has preceded refers to the transportation of official documents,
and not to that of Transactions of learned societies and other like works;
but it is now necessary to mention that in 1878 the honorable Secretary
of State designated the Smithsonian Institution as the special agent
of the United States Government for carrying out the provisions of an
international convention at Paris, which made the respective Govern-
ments assume the cost, not only of the transportation of official
documents, but of scientific and literary publications between the
States interested, and it would seem that Congress itself adopted this
view of its responsibility, for from July 1, 1881, to June 30, 1886, while
the Congressional and bureaucratic exchange represented a pro rata
cost of $29,706.85, and the scientific publications $39,034.90, Congress
appropriated directly $35,500—somewhat more than the cost of the
Government exchange, but leaving a balance of $3,534.90 for scientific
and literary exchanges unpaid. This latter sum, $3,534.90, added to
the $73,641.01 mentioned above, makes a total of $77,175.91 for which,
in equity, repayment might be requested.

In 1886, on the 15th of March, plenipotentiaries of the United States
and various other nationalities signed a convention, more formal than
that at Paris, by which the respective Governments definitely assumed
the exchange of official documents and scientific and literary publica-
tions between the states interested.

The Institution prefers to adopt the latter date as a basis for its re-
quest rather than the earlier date, though, as mentioned above, equity
would seem to allow it the entire sum expended for exchanges, at least
since its official recognition by Congress in 1831 as the Government
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIX

exchange agent. No claim for the exchange of a purely scientific
character is made for the years 1881 to 1886, so that the $35,500 that
Congress appears to have appropriated for this end is treated as hav-
ing a retro-active effect, and this amount deducted from the crude obli-
gation of $75,641.01 leaves $38,141.01 as the amount due the private
fund of James Smithson from 1868 to 1886.

Considering separately the period from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889,
we find that the amount expended in these years under the direction
of the Smithsonian Institution on account of international exchanges
was $47,126.56; of this sum $37,000 were paid by Congressional appro-
priations, $3,091.75 were paid by Government Departments and others,
and the balance, $7,054.81, by the Smithsonian Institution.

The action of the Board of Regents contemplates the presentation to
Congress of a request to return to the Smithsonian fund the sums here
shown to have been expended in the interests and by the authority of
the National Government, namely, $38,141.01 in excess of appropria-
tions advanced from January 1, 1868, to June 30, 1886, for the exchange
of official Government documents, and $7,034.81 in excess of appropri-
tions from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889, advanced for the purpose of
carrying out a convention entered into by the United States, or an
aggregate of $45,175.82.

DRAFT OF BILL.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, Thatthe following sums be, and
the same are hereby, appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury
not otherwise appropriated, in repayment of moneys expended from
the Smithsonian fund in exchanging with foreign countries the official
publications of the United States Government, and in carrying out the
provisions of a convention for the exchange of literary and scientific
publications signed by a representative of the United States at Brus-
sels, March fifteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-six, namely:

Sec. 2. For exchanging the official publications of the United States
Government from eighteen hundred and sixty-eight to eighteen hundred
and eighty-six, as provided for by resolution seventy-two, Fortieth
Congress, second session, the sum of thirty-eight thousand one hundred
and forty-one dollars and one cent.

Src. 3. For exchanging from July first, eighteen hundred and eighty-
six, to June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, official docu-
ments and scientific and literary publications, as provided for by the
‘convention between the United States of America, Belgium, Brazil,
and other nations,” concluded at Brussels March fifteenth, eighteen
hundred and eighty-six, the sum of seven thousand and thirty-four
dollars and eighty-one cents; in all, forty-five thousand one hundred
and seventy-five dollars and eighty-two cents.

The foregoing memoranda had been placed in the hands of one of
Regents in the House of Representatives, to present whenever it was
deemed advisable, but no action had as yet, so far as the Secretary
was informed, been taken.

The Secretary informed the Board that the executors of the late Dr.
Jerome H. Kidder had refunded $100 to the Institution, which had
been paid by the latter for legal services in relation to the bequest of
Dr. Kidder to the Smithsonian, and the family of the testator did not

desire that “the action of the Regents in regard to the bequest should
be attended by any financial burden to the Institution”.

The announcement was made that a bequest of a medical library
had been made to the Institution by Dr. Jonathan R. Bailey, of Olm-
stead, Ky., but the books had not yet been received.

A letter of thanks was submitted from Mrs. Cox, thanking the Board
for the resolutions transmitted to her in regard to the death of her
husband, the late honorable Samuel 8. Cox.

The Secretary presented his annual report for the year ending June
30, 1890, which, in accordance with the instructions of the Board, had
been printed and distributed to the Regents.

On motion the report was accepted.

Dr. Welling presented the followiig:

WHEREAS, The late George Bancroft was for several years a member
of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and rendered
useful service on its executive committee: Therefore, be it

Resolved, That while, for obvious reasons of propriety, we should
abstain at this time and in this place from any full or formal commemo-
ration of the manifold titles to distinction which clustered around the
head of our late illustrious colleague, we can not forbear from testifying
the special gratitude we owe to him for the interest he ever took in the
weltare of this Institution, nor can we forbear from associating our-
selves with the grief of his fellow-citizens throughout the length and
breadth of the land, now that, in the fullness of his years and in the
fullness of his honors, he has been called to rest from the labors which
brought to him such a revenue of fame, alike in the walks of high
executive administration, of diplomacy, and of literature,

The resolution was adopted by a rising vote.
On motion, the Board then adjourned sine die,

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1891, all of
which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, or, in his ab-
sence, of the Assistant Secretary as Acting Secretary, and a certificate
that the materials and services charged were applied to the purposes
of the institution.

The committee has also examined the accounss of the “ International
Exchanges,” and of the “ National Museum,” and of the “ National
Zodlogical Park,” and finds that the balane»s above given correspond
with the certificates of the disbursing clerk of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, whose appointment as such disbursing officer was accepted and
his bonds approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

At the last session of Congress a change was made in the phraseology
of the appropriation made for ethnological researches (or the Bureau
of Ethnology). Heretofore the appropriation was placed under the
direction of the “Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,” and the
Executive Committee decided that it was not their provinee to examine
the vouchers, although the abstracts of expenditures and balance-sheets
were exhibited to them quarterly. The expenditures were made by the
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. XXAIX

disbursing clerk of the Bureau of Ethnology, a bonded officer approved
as such by the Treasury Departinent, and had the approval of Maj.
Powell, the Director of the Bureau, and also of the Secretary of the
Institution.

The appropriation for 189091 has been placed by Congress “ under
the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,” and the committee de-
cided that the accounts and vouchers should be examined by them in
the same manner as other expenditures for which the Regents of the
Institution are in any degree responsible.

The disbursement of the balance of last year’s appropriation has con-
tinued in the hands of the disbursing clerk of the Bureau (Mr. J. D.
McChesney), but those of the new appropriation will be made by the
disbursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution (Ma. W. W. Karr), ac-
cepted as a bonded officer by the Secretary of the Treasury.

REPORT OF 8. P. LANGLEY,
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1891.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report for the
year ending June 30, 1891, of the operations of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, including the work placed by Congress under its charge in the
National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the International Ex-
changes, the National Zodlogical Park, and the Astro-physical Observ-
atory.

[ have spoken personally and briefly of matters of chief importance
concerning these various Bureaus, and have then added, for the sake of
completeness, detailed reports from the Bureau of Ethnology, the In-
ternational Exchange Bureau, the Library, the National Zodlogical Park,
and the Editor in charge of Publications, which are contained in the
Appendix. The work of the National Museum is reported on at length
in a separate volume by the Assistant Secretary in charge.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

I have to record a change in the establishment during the year, in
the death of the Hon. William Windom, Secretary of the Treasury,
on 29th January, 1891, and the appointment of his successor to the
Secretaryship, the Hon. Charles Foster.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents fixing the
time of the stated annual meeting of the Board on the 4th Wednesday
of January in each year, the Board met on January 28, 1891, at 10
o'clock a. m.

The Hon. Charles Devens, of Massachusetts, whose appointment as a
member of the Board by joint resolution of Congress on May 22, 1890,
was noted in the report for last year, formally declined the appointment
on account of a provision in the constitution of the State of Massachu-

H. Mis. 334, pt. 1——1
7 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

setts whereby justices of the supreme judicial court of the Commonwealth
are rendered incapable of holding any place or office from any other
State, Government, or power whatever. I regret to add that Judge
Devens died on the 7th of January, 1891.

The vacancy in the Board has not yet been filled.

The Hon. George Bancroft and Gen. William T. Sherman have died
during the year. The lives of these two eminent men have made their
loss a national one, so widely known, and accompanied by obituary no-
tices so general and so complete, that to repeat them here would be a
work of superfluity. Reference is made to them elsewhere in the nec-
rologic notices only so far as relates to their connection with the Board
of Regents.

Mr. Justice Miller, whose death occurred on the 16th of November,
1890, is also to be mentioned here, having been, as acting Chief Justice,
elected temporarily Chancellor of the Board. He served in this capac-
ity from March 27, 1888, to January 9, 1889. It would be superfluous,
as in the former cases, to do more than to note the fact and with it to re-
call the sincerity of the respect and the warmth of the regard which all
felt for him who knew him in this or in any other capacity of his eminent

official life.
ADMINISTRATION,

T wish again to remark that the great extension of the interests con-
fided to the Institution make the duties of the Secretary and his assist-
ants altogether different from what they were in its early history. The
change brought about by constant growth of its activities has been so
uniform in its progression that there has been no particular moment at
which it seemed possible to say that the burden of the work had grown
to transcend wholly the means for effecting it. At present I feel confi-
dent that I am justified in saying that such is the case, and that some
provision must now be made for enabling the Secretary and his imme-
diate assistants to have additional aid in this administration of the
affairs of the General Government from some source not provided for
out of the already insufficient funds of the parent institution.

This institution administers large Government interests, while no ap-
propriation has been made by Congress for the expense of such admin-
istration, such as is made in all other analogous cases, and this expense
is directly represented by an increment of the expenditure of the parent
institution, chiefly under the head of salaries, which are not needed for
the purposes of the original fund alone.

FINANCES.

I have in a previous report referred to the fact that owing to the
changing value of money, the purchasing power of the Smithsonian
fund, in the language of a committee of the Regents—

“while nominally fixed, is growing actually less year by year, and of
less and less importance in the work it accomplishes with reference to
‘

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

the immense extension of the country since the Government accepted
the trust; ”

so that it seems most desirable that the fund should be enlarged, if
only to represent the original position of its finances relatively to those
of the country and institutions of learning.

Everything which has occurred since this was written increases the
force of the observation. I only remark upon it here to say that [have
taken some pains to invite the attention of those who are seeking a
trustee for the disposition of means intended for the advancement of
knowledge, to the especial guaranties for security offered by the admin-
istration of the Regents.

It is proper to mention, in this connection, that I have during the past
year come into communication with a gentleman who desires to donate
$200,000 to the fund, provided he can do so on certain conditions, with
regard to which I have not felt myself authorized to act without con-
sulting the Regents, and as, nevertheless, they can not be assembled
during the present year, [ have taken the unusual step, justified by the
occasion, of telegraphing to each individual member of the body to ask
his opinion.

Favorable opinions have been received in answer to this from nearly
all the Regents and I may anticipate a statement properly belonging
to a later report when I say that the sum in question has sincé been
placed in my hands by the donor, Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, of Setau-
ket, Long Island, to be tendered to the Regents at their next meeting.

The invested funds of the Institution are as follows, being in the
same condition as in my last report:

Interest on the invested fund, amounting to $42,180, has been received
from the Treasurer of the United States during the year, and from sales
of publications and miscellaneous sources, including repayments on ac-
count of international exchanges, $6,762.37, making a total of $79,135.02.
The total expenditures, as shown in detail in the report of the exee-
utive committee, have been $39,072.91, leaving an unexpended balance
on June 30, 1891, of $40,062.11. This includes a sum of $10,000, the
amount of a bequest of $5,000 from the late Dr. J. H. Kidder and a
donation of a like amount from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell personally
to the Secretary for physical investigations, which was, with the donor’s
consent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the funds of the In-
stitution subject to order. Neither of these sums, then, forms a portion

of the invested funds, and both have been held in the hope that Con-
gress would later provide a site for a permanent building for the astro-
physical observatory. The balance then available for the general
purposes of the Institution on July 1, 1891, was $30,062.11, but this is
in part held against various liabilities for scientific purposes.

The Institution Las been charged by Congress with the disburse-
ments during the year of the following appropriations:

To these should be added the unexpended balance of the special
appropriation of $92,000 made April 30, 1890, for the National Zoologi-
cal Park.

The vouchers for the disbursement of these appropriations have been
examined by the executive committee, and the various items of expend-
iture dre set forth in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House of
Representatives in accordance with a provision of the sundry civil act
of October 2, 1888, while the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
have likewise been examined and approved by the executive committee
and are shown in their report.

I may here call attention to a change in the phraseology of the sun-
dry civil act making appropriation for ethnological researches, whereby
the appropriation is placed ‘under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution,” instead of in the charge of the “Secretary of the Smithson-
ian Institution,” as heretofore. The vouchers from the Bureau of Eth-

-nology are therefore now scrutinized by the executive committee, as are
all other expenditures of the Institution.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, forwarded to
the Secretary of the Treasury under date of October 20, 1890, were as
follows:

REPORT OF THis SECRETARY.
BUILDINGS.

T must again urge upon the attention of the Regents the ever-increas-
ing necessity for relief from the overcrowded condition of the National
Museum. The lack of more adequate accommodation has been even
more forcibly presented than ever before in making the necessary prep-
arations for the Museum exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposition
in Chicago.

The present Museum building was finished and occupied in 1881. The
collections increased so rapidly that as early as 1883 the Regents, at
their meeting of January 17, recommended to Congress the erection of
a new building.

Since 1883 the collections have again increased to such an extent that
a new building as large as the present one could now be practically
filled with material held in storage, and I can only repeat with inereased
emphasis the closing sentence of my letter of January 21, 1890, to the
Hon. Leland Stanford, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Publie
Buildings and Grounds, “that unless more space is provided the de-
velopment of the Government collection, which is already partly ar-
rested, will be almost completely stopped.”

Plans for a new museum building of two stories and basement were
laid before the Board in January, 1890, and on February 19, 1890, a
bill appropriating $500,000 was reported by Senator Morrill from the
Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds and passed the
Senate on April 5, 1890. This bill was favorably reported from the
House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds January 9, 1891,
but at the close of the session it had not come before the House for
action.

An appropriation of $25,000 for fire-proofing the so-called chapel of
the west wing of the Smithsonian Building and for repairing the roof
of the main building and the ceiling and plastering of the main hall of
the building, having become available, plans for the contemplated im-
provements were prepared by the Architect of the Capitol, as directed
by Congress, ayd work was begun in April, 1891. The old roof of the
chapel was entirely removed and replaced temporarily by a wooden cov-
ering for the protection of the specimens contained in this part of the
building. By the end of June gratifying progress had been made
towards the construction of a safe, substantial iron and slate roof.

This appropriation of $25,000 was but a portion of the sum asked for
to be used not only for fire-proofing the chapel and repairing the roof
of the main building, but also for making other repairs upon the build-
ing, more especially in making more suitable provision for storing and
handling the Government documents, the distribution of which Con-
gress has intrusted to the Institution. Under the wording of the appro-
priation act it was found, however, that the expenditure of the appro-
priation was confined to the two items mentioned above. I have referred
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

elsewhere in this report to the special needs of the exchange depart-
ment, on account of the over-crowded condition of the store-rooms occu-
pied by the Government.

The new buildings erected or in process of erection for the collection
of living animals, being all in the Zological Park, are mentioned in the
report upon the park.

RESEARCH.

Tam gratified to report that it has been possible by reducing ex-
penses in other directions to revert in some measure to an early prac-
tice of the institution, eminently consonant with its founder’s purpose,
that of offering aid in original research to certain investigations of
much importance which were hindered by lack of means.

Among the special grants may be named that of $500 to Prof. A. A.
Michelson, of Clark University, for continuing his important work upon
a universal standard of measure founded on the wave-length of light;
also a sum of $600 placed at the disposal of Prof. E. W. Morley, to pro-
cure a Special apparatus for determinations of the density of oxygen
and hydrogen, an investigation requiring extreme precision and delicacy
of manipulation, and promising results of wide application; while $200
was placed at the disposal of Dr. Wolcott Gibbs, for investigations
at his laboratory in Newport upon chemical compounds.

To Prof. E. S. Holden, director of the Lick Observatory, California,
a grant of $200 was made, to assist in perfecting his apparatus for
securing photographs of the moon. The results of his studies in this
field Prof. Holden has offered to place at the disposal of the Smith-
sonian Institution for publication at some future day, should it seem
desirable.

Prof. Pickering, director of the Harvard Observatory, has also placed
at the disposal of the Institution for publication a very valuable series
of photographs of the moon, which have been secured at the Harvard
Observatory, and which will be supplemented by photographs to be
taken at the Harvard Observatory high-altitude station in the moun-
tains of Peru. :

The director of the Paris Observatory, Admiral Méuchez, has like-
wise promised his co-operation in securing lunar photographs of the
highest degree of excellence now attainable.

With the aid of these three prominent observatories, which have given
especial attention to the subject of lunar photography, it is proposed to
prepare a volume representing upon a large scale the best results that
can be secured, thus placing on record a detailed description of the
lunar surface, the value of which for comparison with observations and
photographs of the future can scarcely be over-estimated.

In furtherance of the plan for the establishment of standard sizes of
screws and of diameters of tubing, ete., for astronomical and physical
apparatus—a subject which has received the attention of committees of
the National Academy of Science, as also of the American Association
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. i

for the Advancement of Science—a few standards have been tentatively
adopted, and copies of these are attainable by all interested in securing
uniformity in this class of work.

I have referred above to researches in physical science alone; the
work of individual members of the Institution and of others in the nat-
ural sciences is givenin connection with the portion of the report relat-
ing to the Museum. I may, however, state that certain physical inves-
tigations. which have been made under the personal direction of the
Secretary of the Institution at private charge and not at the cost of its
funds, are about being published in a volume of its Contributions,* in
accordance with a policy long since counseled by the Board of Regents.

Astro-physical Observatory.—Il may recall briefly here the cireum-
stances which have led to the establishment of an astro-physical ob-
servatory as a part of the Smithsonian Institution.

In the first report that I had the honor to present to the attention of
the Regents in 1888 I stated that preparations had been made by the
late Secretary, Prof. Baird, to establish an astro-physical observatory
and laboratory, in order that renewed attention might be given to the
study of physical science. It was there reported that, in view of the
fact that the construction of delicate instruments would occupy a con-
siderable time, orders had already been given for the most essential
pieces of apparatus for conducting investigations in radiant energy.

A special interest was taken in the proposed astro-physical observa-
tory by the late Dr. J. H. Kidder, formerly Curator of Exchanges in the
Smithsonian Institution, and the sum of $5,000 was received from his
executors for this purpose under circumstances detailed in my last re-
port. A like sum of $5,000 was presented personally to the Secretary
by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell for prosecuting physical investigations,
and particularly those upon radiant energy, and this sum was, with the
consent and approval of the donor, placed to the credit of the Smith-
sonian Institution upon the same footing as the Kidder bequest.

A temporary wooden building of the simplest possible construction
has been erected in the Smithsonian grounds just south of the main
building, having been begun on the 18th of November, 1889, and finished
about the Ist of March, 1890. This building is not to be regarded as
an entirely suitable or permanent housing for the instruments. Its
location, close to travelled streets, is unsuited for refined physical inves-
tigation, but the preliminary adjustment of the instruments and cer-
tain classes of work can be effectively and conveniently carried on here.

The principal instrument is a specially constructed siderostat by Sir
Howard Grubb, of Dublin, Ireland. This instrument is in position. A
spectro-bolometer, the outcome of many years’ experience, has been
made under my personal direction by William Grunow & Son, of New
York, and has been received and mounted. A galvanometer, designed

for the particular class of work in view, has been received, and was the
last of the principal pieces of apparatus (provided for from the Smith-
sonian fund) to be putin place. The outfit is now in the main com-
plete. :

This country has no observatory devoted exclusively to astro-physical
research, though England, France, and Germany have maintained for
a number of years at a considerable expense observatories for the study
of the physical condition of celestial bodies. I therefore indulged
the hope that, in presenting the matter to Congress as previously re-
ported, a request for a small annual appropriation for the maintenance
of the observatory thus founded and equipped might meet with favor-
able consideration. I may say that the amount asked for ($10,000 for
annual maintenance) has been appropriated, and will be available dur-
ing the coming fiscal year.

In adjusting and determining the constants of the instruments, a work
involving considerable labor, I have had the valuable assistance of Prof.
C. ©. Hutchins, of Bowdoin College, during a portion of the summer
vacation. No permanent appointments of the assistants who will be
required to carry on the investigations contemplated will be made until
after the appropriation shall have become available.

EXPLORATIONS.

The explorations of chief importance carried on by the Institution
have been conducted by the Bureau of Ethnology and by the National
Museum, and to the reports of these departments reference should be
made for details.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications for the year have continued to represent the usual
standard both in the number and in the general character of the sey-
eral issues.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—Mention may be made here
of a publication embracing a collection of twenty-three colored plates
illustrating the forest trees of North America, an unfinished work un-
dertaken by the late Dr. Asa Gray, many years ago, which although in
the quarto form of the Contributions to Knowledge, will not be in-
cluded in volumes of that series. While no memoir has been actually
published during the year, a paper presenting an account of some new
experiments in aero-dynamies (already referred to) is in course of prep-
aration, and will probably be through the pressin Augnst. It will not
much exceed 100 quarto pages of letterpress, and will be illustrated by
about ten plates.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—A memoir on ‘The Corrections
of Sextants for errors of Eccentricity and Gravitation,” by Mr. Joseph
A. Rogers, of this city, presents a good discussion of the subject, and
has a practical as well as a theoretical value. A “ Bibliography of the

vee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

Chemical Influence of Light,” by Mr. Alfred Tuckerman, belongs to the
growing class of reference aids to investigators and students, rendered
necessary by the rapidly increasing volume of scientific literature.

In the Miscellaneous Collections for the year a number of articles
from the general appendix to the annual reports, commonly prepared
at the expense of the Institution, have been considered worthy of re-
publication as separate essays, and will probably find their place ulti-
mately in volumes of this series.

Smithsonian annual reports—The annual report of the Regents to
Congress on the operations and condition of the Institution for the year
ending June 30, 1888, was received more promptly than usual, and has
been largely distributed. The annual report of the Regents on the
operations and condition of the U. S. National Museum for the same
period has also been received and widely distributed. The annual
report of the Regents to Congress on tle Institution, for the year end-
ing June 30, 1889, has in addition been received and distributed, and
the annual report of the Secretary to the Board of Regents for the
year ending June 30, 1890, has been issued during the year.

A full descriptive list of the Smithsonian publications for the year
will be given in the appendix.

SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

The work of the Smithsonian Institution through which it is perhaps
most widely known is its exchange service, whereby in a direct and
tangible manner it effects one of the objects of its founder, ‘“ the diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.”

The exchange service was established very early in the history of the
Institution, when communication between scientific men, particularly
between those of the Old and of the New World, was slow and expen-
sive. Its object was to distribute the Smithsonian publications, and to
furnish at the same time a channel through which the publications of
scientific men, societies, and institutions in this country might be sent
to correspondents abroad, and similar publications from abroad might
bereceived and distributedin America. The Institution received hearty
codperation in every direction. The chief learned societies in different
parts of the world offered their aid as distributing centers of exchange
documents, and many of the larger steamship companies generously
consented to carry exchange boxes free of freight charges; foreign gov-
ernments gave their aid, and in 1854 Prof. Henry announced in his
report that there was “no port to which the Smithsonian parcels are
shipped where duties are charged on them, a certified invoice of con-
tents by the Secretary being sufficient to pass them through the custom-
house free of duty. On the other hand, all packages addressed to the
Institution arriving at the ports of the United States are admitted
Without detention, duty free. This system of exchanges is therefore
10 REPORT GF THE SECRETARY.

the most extensive and efficient which has ever been established in any
country.”

The service was immediately taken advantage of by the Bureaus of
the United States Government, and between the years 1851 and 1867
it is estimated that over 20,000 packages of Government publications
were carried by the exchange service, at an estimated cost to the pri-
vate funds of the Institution of over $8,000.

In 1867 Congress recognized the efficiency and importance of this
branch of the Smithsonian work by assigning toit the duty of exchang-
ing fifty copies of all documents printed by order of either House of
Congress, or by the United States Government Bureaus, for similar
works published in foreign countries, and especially by foreign govern-
ments. This at once absorbed a very considerable part of the funds
which it was deemed expedient to devote to exchange purposes; for
nearly thirteen years the burden of the expense being almost entirely
borne by the Smithsonian fund.

It is not necessary to repeat here the details of the exchange rela-
tions with the Government, as they have been given at length in
previous reports, but I beg to call attention briefly to the summary
presented last year in these words :

The following sums have been expended from the Smithsonian fund
for the support of the international exchange system, in the interests
and by the authority of the National Government, namely, $38,141.01
in excess of appropriations advanced from January 1, 1868, to June 30,
1886, for the exchange of official Government documents, and $7,034.81
in excess of appropriations from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889, advanced
for the purpose of carrying out a convention entered into by the United
States, or an aggregate of $45,175.82.

No account is here made of the rent value of the rooms occupied by
the exchange bureau, though the rooms are urgently needed for the
special purposes of the Institution.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents, a memoran-
dum setting forth the above facts was transmitted on the 20th of May,
1890, to the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth, a member of the Board, in
the House of Representatives, for the purpose of taking the necessary
steps to procure a return by Congress to the Smithsonian fund of the
sum last mentioned, namely, $45,175.82.

The value of the exchange service having become widely known and
appreciated, efforts were made by various countries to establish more
formal international relations for the purpose of securing an increase in
its benefits, and on the 15th of March, 1886, plenipotentiaries from the
United States and various other nationalities signed a convention at
Brussels by which their respective governments definitely assumed the
exchange of official documents and of scientific and literary publica-
tions between the countries interested.

Referring now more ‘especially to the work of the exchange bureau
during the past year and to its steady and rapid growth, it will be seen
in the Appendix that no less than 100 tons of books passed through the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a6

office, representing 90,666 packages—an increase of 8,094 packages over
the number handled during the preceding year. Upon the exchange
books accounts of publications received and transmitted are kept with
18,848 societies, institutions or individuals.

The expenditures on account of the exchange service have amounted
to $20,382.21, of which $17,000 were appropriated directly by Congress,
$3,361.12 were repaid by Government bureaus, and $9.95 were paid by
State institutions and others, leaving a small deficiency to be met by
the Smithsonian Institution.

While the expenses of the exchange service, it will be observed, are
in the absence of rent charge now nearly met by the sum appropriated
by the General Government, this end is only effected at the cost of
dispatch; and even this slow freight is in many cases due to the
liberality of the ocean steamship companies, a fact to which allusion
has been made in all recent reports. While there seemed to be no im-
propriety in accepting the generosity of these companies when it was
to be regarded as a direct contribution to the philanthropic aims of the
Institution, it does not seem proper, where so much of the freight now
carried is Government property and the service is conducted under an
international treaty, that we should impose on this liberality further,
yet if this privilege should be withdrawn the service would be most
seriously crippled.

An appropriation is also needed to give effect to the treaty of Brus-
sels, which calls for an immediate exchange of parliamentary annals.
A bill making an appropriation of $2,000, estimated as necessary tor
this purpose, passed the Senate, but failed to come up for consideration
in the House of Representatives.

I may mention also that the difficulty of making provision for the
storage of the surplus copies of Government publications intended for
foreign exchange is each year becoming greater, and it is necessary to
store many boxes of valuable documents in a basement which past ex-
perience has shown is liable to be flooded with water. This fact I con-
sider it my duty to bring to the attention of Congress that such action
as it deems fit may be taken to protect this public property.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the library have been recorded and cared for as dur-
ing the last fiscal year. The following statement shows the number of
books, maps, and charts received from July 1, 1890, to June 30, 1891:

12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Of these ACCESSIONS, 7,720 (namely 424 volumes, 6,413 parts of volumes,
and 883 pamphlets) were retained for use at the National Museum Li-
brary, and 754 medical dissertations were deposited in the Library of the
Surgeon-General, U.S. Army; the remainder were promptly sent to the
Library of Congress on the Monday following their receipt.

The reading room continues to be well used by those who have ocea-
sion to consult the current scientific literature. As the number of boxes
available for holding periodicals is strictly limited by the size of the
room the only way to make room for the installation of new and desirable
journals is to remove those which are found to be least consulted or which
have ceased publication during the year. This was done by the librarian.
during the spring of 1891.

Four hundred and fifty-six boxes are now occupied, leaving sixteen
to be filled by new accessions during the next fiscal year. Of the
journals removed from the reading room, such as would be of perma-
nent use in the scientific work of the Institution were transferred to the
Library of the National Museum; the remainder were forwarded to the
Library of Congress.

It will be remembered that when I first became connected with the
Institution as assistant secretary I formulated a plan, the details of
which will be found in my report for 188788, for enlarging the acces-
sions to the library so as to cover more completely the field of scientific
knowledge, and also for completing the series of scientific journals
already in the possession of the Institution which for any reason are

imperfect.

As stated in my report for 1889, the work of executing the plan was
commenced on June 1 of that year and has been assiduously carried
on ever since. It is nowrapidly approaching completion, and it is esti-
mated that if will require but a few months of the next fiscal year to
bring the work as originally planned to a termination. So rapid, how-
ever, has been the advance of scientific thought in the interval since the
preparation of the list that, although the utmost vigilance has been ex-
ercised in watching for the appearance of new scientific journals, it is
probable that very many such have newly appeared which have escaped
notice. A certain amount of supplementary work will, therefore, be re-
quired to make the exchange lists conform with the present status of
the periodical literature of science and in a very minor degree of art.

A list of the new exchanges will be found in the Appendix (Report
of the Librarian), which also includes a list of important accessions
outside of the regular serials.

It may be remembered that in my report for 1887~88, I spoke of a
certain limited number of books, not forming part of the Smithsonian
deposit in the Library of Congress, obtained by purchase from the
Smithsonian fund and retained at the Institution under the name of
the ‘“‘Secretary’s Library.”

These books are mostly, but not exclusively, books of scientific refer-

ence, certain art serials being included among them, and though all are
kept in the Secretary’s office they are at the service, under certain neces-
sary restrictions, of all connected with the Institution.

This collection numbers at present nearly 300 volumes, and while it
would be highly desirable to enlarge it still further, this is rendered
almost impracticable, because the Secretary’s office is already filled nearly
to its utmost capacity. It is not possible either to place the collection
of works of reference under the immediate charge of the librarian, as
the rooms which he oecupies are already over-crowded, while the room
on the same floor, which would naturally be the one to which the library
would be extended, is occupied as a shipping office by the Bureau of
International Exchanges.

It is to be hoped in the interest of the library, then, as well as of the
Bureau itself, that Congress will provide the additional quarters which
have been asked for the latter.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Portraits of Regents.—The Institution is under obligation to the Chief
of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing fer copies of engraved por-
traits of several former Regents of the Institution, which had been pre-
pared for official purposes.

Statue of Robert Dale Owen.—A bill appropriating $20,000 for a statue
of Hon. Robert Dale Owen, of Indiana, who was among the first and
most actively interested Regents of the Institution, was introduced
in the Senate on December 9, 1890, by the Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees, and

yas passed on the same day by the Senate, but failed to secure favor-
able action in the House of Representatives.

Statue of Prof. Baird.—\ have the honor again to call the attention
of the Regents to the bill which was passed by the Senate in February,
1888, providing for a bronze statue of Prof. Baird in recognition of the
distinguished services rendered his country, and I venture to express
the hope that this subject may receive the earnest consideration of lis
many warm friends in both Houses of Congress.

Capron collection of Japanese works of art.—An appropriation of
$10,000 for the purchase of the Capron collection, which has been for
several years on deposit in the Museum, was included in the sundry civil
act for the year 189192, thereby securing this valuable collection of
Japanese works of art to the Government.

Perkins collection of prehistoric implements.—The deficiency bill ap-
proved October 1, 1890, contained an appropriation of $7,000 to enable
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to purchase of Mr. Fred-
erick S. Perkins his collection of prehistoric implements. This sum
was duly paid to Mr. Perkins and the collection received and deposited
in the National Museum.

Meteorological records.—In accordance with arrangements made with
the Chief Signal Officer, U. S. Army, Gen, A. W. Greely, the meteoro-
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY:

logical records, forming a portion of the archives of the Smithsonian
Institution, and representing a considerable amount of work accom-
plished by it in earlier days, have been temporarily transferred to the
Signal Office, and deposited there in a fireproof vault for custody and
storage. These records serve to carry back the meteorological obser-
vations of the Signal Service as far as the year 1840. They consist of:
346 bound volumes of monthly reports by observers from 1840 to 1873, inclusive.
6 volumes of records made at the Smithsonian Institution.

47 pasteboard boxes of miscellaneous records by locality.

64 paper packages of miscellaneous records, scraps, ete.

15 miscellaneous note-books.

1 large package of manuscript folio sheets, observations, survey northwestern

lakes.

7 royal octavo bound volumes, printed reports.

Bequest of Dr. J. Rk. Bailey—Information has been received that Dr.
J. R. Bailey, late of Olmstead, Ky., has devised his library to the
Smithsonian Institution, and the necessary steps will be taken to
acquire possession.

Assignment of rooms for scientific work.—A. basement room especially
suited for delicate physical measurements on account of its freedom
from tremor has been used by the officers of the United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey for making pendulum observations.

Stereotype plates.—Owing to the more urgent demands of current
work, but little progress has been made in examining and re-arranging
the stereotype plates of the publications of the Institution. I hope to
make arrangements during the coming year to push this work to an
early completion.

The stereotype plates and engravers’ blocks are cheerfully placed at
the disposal of publishers for supplementing or illustrating scientific
works privately issued.

U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

In my representations to Congress during recent years I have felt
called upon to insist upon two points: First, that the collections have
increased so rapidly that additional space is required for their proper
administration, and that unless more space be provided, the growth of
the national collections must, to a large extent, be interfered with;
and secondly, that the collections, although growing rapidly in certain
directions, are not developing in such a symmetrical and consistent
manner as is essential to the necessities of the work.

I feel justified in assuming that it is the intention of Congress that
the National Museum of the United States shall be, as far as a museum
can be, a worthy exponent of the natural resources and scientific
achievements of the nation, that it shall be worthy of the attention of
visitors to the capital, and that it shall perform its proper functions
as one of the scientific departments of the Government, and shall also
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

promote the scientific and educational interests of the country at large.
This being granted, it is essential not only that the collections should
grow, and grow rapidly, in order to keep pace with the material and
intellectual development of the country, but also that a competent staft
of curators should be constantly at work, developing by scientific study
and publishing under the auspices of the Government the facts which
are essential to the correct understanding of the material under their
charge, preserving the collections from destruction, and arranging and
classifying them in such a manner that they shall be immediately ac-
cessible to the students of science from all parts of this country and
from abroad, who are constantly visiting Washington for the purpose
of consulting the collections of the Government in connection with their
own scientific studies.

On this account it is a critical time in the history of the Museum.
Such is the competition for material that the National Museum of the
United States is unable to hold its own not only with foreign govern-
ments and with local museums in other American cities, but is even at
a disadvantage when its collections are compared with those of many
private collectors. For instance, there are in this country several pri-

vate collections of minerals, archeological objects, as well as of speci-

mens reijating to the various departments of zodlogy, the promoters of
which can seemingly afford to pay more for any choice objects needed
to complete their collections than can the Government of the United
States. It is somewhat mortifying to see collections of American ob-
jects, which a few years hence will undoubtedly be recognized by every-
one as essential to be preserved in the National Museum of this country,
taken away to foreign countries because their value is more highiy
appreciated there than at home. Whatever may be considered the
proper functions of the National Museum of the United States in regard
to other matters, it will always be expected that in the national capi-
tal the collections illustrating ethnology and the natural resources of
this continent will be fully as imposing as in other similar establish-
ments, and that the national collections should compare favorably with
those in other American cities, and will in respect to American material
surpass those in any foreign capital.

It is not my wish to depreciate the importance of what has already
been done by the Government for the advancement of scientific research,
for in most of the fields in which really serious work has been accom-
plished, the National Museum is at least equal, and often superior to, any
other in the United States, but the effort to maintain the collections on
this footing will be much more difficult hereafter than in the past. 1t
would be unfortunate if students of American natural history and ethnol-
ogy, who have hitherto been obliged to come to Washington in connec-
tion with their studies, should hereafter find it more advantageous to
consult private collections in other parts of this country.

Growth of the collections—The growth of the national collections
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

since 1881, when the new building was completed, has been probably
unprecedented in the history of museums; and this has rendered it nec-
essary to employ a force of men proportionately larger than is found in
most museums, in order to utilize the material to the best advantage.
Notwithstanding this fact, the aggregate appropriation made by the
United States for museum purposes is smaller than that of many foreign
governments.

The Museum building has now been occupied one decade, and during
this time the total number of specimens of all kinds catalogued and
ready for exhibition or study has increased from about 193,000 to more
than 3,000,000.

Curatorships.—The scientific departments of the Museum are not yet
all supplied with curators. The number of separate departments and
sections is now 33, and less than one-third of this number is under the
charge of curators paid from the Museum fund and able therefore to
devote all their time to Museum work. By far the larger number of
the scientific departments is under the charge of officers of other depart-
ments of the Government service (for instance, the Geological Survey,
the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Ethnology, and the Fish
Commission), who, although they render most important services in the
way of supervision and general direction of the work, are necessarily
so occupied with their own peculiar administrative duties, that they can
not devote very much of their time to the development of the collec-
tions under their charge. Three important zodlogical departments have
for a great many years been under the charge of officers of the Fish
Commission. Under the administration of Professor Baird, who was
at once Commissioner and head of the Museum, it was considered proper
that they should give a considerable portion of their time to Museum
work, which was directly tributary to the results which Professor Baird
was desirous of producing in connection with the service under his
charge. Soon after the death of Professor Baird it became necessary
for these men, although still retaining their positions as honorary cura-
tors in the Museum, to devote nearly all of their time and attention to
matters relating to the Fish Commission. If it were possible to employ
experienced men as assistants in these departments, as well as under
the other honorary curators, important advantages would manifestly
result. At all events, it is absolutely necessary to have a curator. or
assistant curator appointed to take charge of the work in each depart-
ment, in order that the material collected at considerable expense by
the Government shall be properly arranged and identified, and that the
results of the work shalll be published for the advancement of science.
This, however, can not be done until Congress shall see fit to make
more liberal appropriations for the maintenance of the Museum.

Increase in correspondence.—Within the past three years there has
been an astonishingly large increase in the number of calls upon the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

Museum, very largely by Members of Congress and through them by
their constituents, for scientific information of all kinds, for collections
in various departments of natural history (scientifically arranged and
named, for the use of schools and colleges), for books and services of
many kinds, including the examination and identification of minerals,
ores, animals, plants, etc. It is quite safe to say that during the last
three or four years the correspondence of the Museum has quadrupled.
Special pains have been taken not only to reply to all communica-
tions in full and with great care, but to reply promptly, in accordance
with the constantly increasing demands for rapid action on the part
of the public officers in Washington.

Salaries.—The salaries paid to employes, especially clerks, copyists,and
skilled mechanics, are much less than those which are paid for similar
services in the Executive Departments. Many of our most useful assist-
ants have been drawn away from the staff and called to places in the
Executive Departments, where, although the responsibilities are no
greater, they receive much larger rates of pay. It is quite essential
for the efficiency of the service that the stipend of persons of this class
should be increased—not necessarily to the amounts current in the Execu-
tive Departments, but to such figures as will render it possible to retain
useful employés after they have been laboriously trained and prepared
for their work. Within a year or two, three stenographers and type-
writers have been drawn away from the office of the Assistant Secretary
in charge of the Museum.

Need of additional assistance.—It is absolutely necessary to have the
collections taken care of as fast as they are received, and although they
san not all be prepared for exhibition, owing to lack of assistance as well
as want of exhibition space, yet the mere preservation of the specimens
from destruction implies very great labor, especially in the case of
zoological objects. Taking into consideration the fact that there are now
about thirty-three distinct scientific departments in the Museum, to each
of which, on an average, three persons at least are attached, it will be
readily understood that, after all the expenses have been met for the
preservation, care, and exhibition of the specimens, very little remains
for maintaining the administrative force. The need of additional intel-
ligent clerical assistance is felt in every branch of the administrative
work. For instance, to the regwar duties of the chief clerk’s office has
been necessarily added the management of the financial matters con-
nected with the preparation of the exhibit for the World’s Columbian
Exposition. In the division of correspondence the increase of work has
been very great, and no less than 10,000 letters are now required to be
written where 2,500 sufficed only a very few years ago. A similar in-
crease of work might be cited in all the other administrative offices, but
the means for providing adequate assistance are not at hand. In this
way it has happened that the appropriations have been largely used in the
maintenance of the scientific departments to the great disadvantage and.

H. Mis. 334, pt. 1——2.
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

impairment of the administrative work of the Museum. These matters
have already been represented in strong terms in previous reports, and
the Secretary has taken every available means of calling attention to
the dangers which beset the National Museum owing to the insuffi-
ciency of the appropriations made by Congress for its maintenance. It
is only necessary to add in this place that the sum mentioned in the
statement accompanying the report for 1889 (pp. 35-38), as then required
for services, was prepared in response to a Senate resolution asking for
a “schedule of the classified service of the officers and employés of the
National Museum,” and represented the needs of the Museum at that
time. Since then there have been large increases in almost every de-
partment of the Museum work, and if I were now preparing a similar
statement, I should find it necessary to make a corresponding increase
in the totals of the several divisions of the schedule referred to.

The operations of the Museum in all of its departments for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1891, are fully discussed in the report of the Assist-
ant Secretary in charge of the Museum, and therefore reference to the
work of the Museum will here be restricted to some of the most impor-
tant general features.

Accessions.—Ten years ago the National Museum moved into a new
building, and the present year thus marks the close of a very important
decade in its history. The increase in the collections during this period
has been unexpectedly large, the accessions from all sources now num-
bering 3,028,714 specimens. In 1882, when the first census of the col-
ections was made, the total number of specimens was estimated at less
than 195,000. The totally inadequate space provided for this vast accu-
mulation of material has been so frequently commented upon in pre-
vious reports, that it is not necessary to reiterate the urgent recom-
mendafions which have been made to Congress for another building.

1 No census of collection taken.

2 The actual increase in the collections during the year 1889-’90 is much greater than appears from
acomparison of the totals for 1889 and for 1890. This is explained by the apparent absence of any
increase in the Departments of Lithology and Metallurgy, the total for 1890 in both of these depart-
ments combined showing a decrease of 46,314 specimens, owing to the rejection of worthless material.

3 Although about 200 specimens have been received during the year, the total number of specimens
in the collection is now less than that estimated for 1889, owing to the rejection of worthless material.

4 The collection now contains between 3,000 and 4,000 specimens.

5 No estimate of increase made in 1890 or 1891.

1 No census of collection taken.
* The actual increase in the collections during the year 1889-90 is much greater than appears from
a comparison of the totals for 1889 and for 1890. This is explained by the apparent absence of any
increase in the Departments of Lithology and Metallurgy, the total for 1890 in both of these depart-
ments combined showing a decrease of 46,314 specimens, owing to the rejection of worthless material.

$ Included in the historical collection.

*Only a small portion of the collection represented by this number was received during the year
1889-’90.

5 Up to 1890 the numbers have reference only to specimens received throngh the Museum, and do
notinclude specimens received for the National Herbarium through the Department of Agriculture.

The figures given for 1890-'91 include for the first time the total number of specimens received both
at the National Museum and at the Department of Agricultmre for the National Herbarium.

® Collections combined in October, 1889, under Department of Geology. The apparent decrease of
more than 50 per cent of the estimated total for 1889 is accounted for (1) by the rejection of several
thousands of specimens from the collection, and (2) by the fact that no estimate of the specimens
in the reserve and duplicate series is included. Of the total for 1890, about 16,000 specimens cousist
chietly of petrographical material stored away for study and comparison in the drawers of table cases.

7 Transferred to the National Zoological Park.

Nore.—tThe fact that the figures for two snecessive years relating to the same collection are un-
changed does not necessarily imply that there has been no increase in the collection, but that for some
special reason it has not been possible to obtain the figures showing the increase.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The World’s Columbian Exposition—Mention was made in the last
report of the provision made by Congress for holding an exposition in
the city of Chicago in 1893 for the purpose of celebrating the four hun-
dredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Colum-
bus. Dr. G. Brown Goode was upon my nomination appointed by the
President the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Museum upon the Government Board of Managers and Con-
trol. During the latter part of the year the Treasury Department de-
cided that between $30,000 and $40,000 were available for expendi-
ture in connection with the preparation of the Government exhibits.
This sum was apportioned by the Board among the executive depart-
ments, including the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum
and the Fish Commission: the Smithsonian Institution, including the
National Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology, receiving about
$6,000. This amount is of course entirely inadequate, except as aftord-
ing the means of making a commencement, and would hardly suf-
fice for the preparation of a satisfactory exhibit from any one depart-
ment in the Museum. As soon as this money became available, how-
ever, several of the curators in the National Museum commenced to
prepare plans for the exhibits of their departments, and a small force
of taxidermists and mechanics was engaged. Mr. R. Edward Earll
was appointed chief special agent in April, and will act as the executive
officer under the direction of the representative of the Smithsonian In-
stitution.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnological researches among the North American Indians has been
continued by the Smithsonian Institution in compliance with acts of
Congress, during the year 189091, under the direction of Maj. J. W.
Powell, who is also the Director of the U. 8. Geological Survey.

The work of the Bureau of Ethnology has been conducted during the
year in accordance with the system before reported upon and explained.
A noteworthy feature of it is that the officers who as authors prepare
the publications of the Bureau personally gather the material for them
in the field, supplementing it by study of all the connected literature
and by the consequent comparison of all ascertained facts. The contin-
uance of the work for a number of years by the same zealous observers
and students, who freely interchange their information and-opinions, has
resulted in their training with the acuteness of specialists, corrected and
generalized by the factors of other correlative specialties.

At the close of the last fiseal year specific exploration of the mound

bia, Maryland, Virginia, and the Ohio \ alley, which determined among
other points of interest that the implication of great antiquity to forms
of stone implements of America which have hitherto been classed with
European paloliths in age as well as in fabrication has not been sub-
stantiated by the ascertamed facts.

Careful exploration of the Verde Valley in Arizona followed that be-
fore made of other parts of the large southwestern region of the United
States in which the presence of many extensive ruins has given rise to
fanciful theories. The data as classified and discussed has shown that
the hypothesis of a vanished race enjoying high civilization, which has
been proposed to account for the architecture of the ruined structures,
is unnecessary.

The attention already given to Indian languages has been continued,
in recognition of the fact that some of them are fast passing beyond the
possibility of record and study and that the ethnie classification of all
of the Indian tribes can be made accurate only through the determina-
tion of their linguistic divisions and connections. The studies upon
aboriginal mythology and religious practices has also been continued,
with special attention to the ghost dances and ‘ Messiah religion,”
which have produced important consequences bearing upon the prob-
lem of proper national dealing with the Indians. Official misconcep-
tion of their religious philosophy, which has been forcedly transfigured
by the absorption of Christianity so as to present more apparent than
actual antagonism to civilization, has occasioned needless loss of life
and treasure.

Further details respecting the work of the Bureau will be found in
the report of its director, given in full in the Appendix.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The primary object for which Congress was asked to establish a
National Zoological Park was to secure the preservation of those
American animals that are already nearly extinct, and this object it
was thought would be best seeured by the establishment of a large
inclosure in which such animals could be kept in a seclusion as nearly
as possible like that of their native haunts. It was believed that,
except for initial expenses for buildings and roads for the public,
this could be done with an outlay comparatively small, probably not
exceeding $50,000 a year; for, after the necessary land was once acquired
and fenced in, smaller inclosures and paddocks could be set off and
inexpensive barns erected at about this yearly charge.

It was, in the nature of things, inevitable that some provision should
be made for the convenience of a curious and interested public, as well
as for the care and well being of animals unaccustomed to the pres-
ence of man. For the first of these it was intended to set aside a con-
siderable area, on which the principal buildings should be placed and
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to which should be taken, as was expedient, such of the animals as
might interest the public, the larger portion of the park being still
considered as a natural preserve where animals need be disturbed by
no unusual surroundings, and where it was hoped they might, after the
time necessary for their acclimation, breed their young.

The maintenance of a park devoted to these purposes, that is, pri-
marily to useful and scientific ends, and secondly to recreation, seemed
to those interested in its suecess a legitimate tax upon national re-
sources, but when Congress decided that one-half of the necessary
expense should be raised by local taxation it seemed only fit that the
tax-payers should be heard in their wish to have prominence given to
the feature that principally interested them, and their chief interest was
naturally in the Park as a place of recreation. That this was recog-
nized by a considerable body in Congress became evident from the
subsequent debates.

The moral right of the people of the District to ask consideration
of their wishes for entertainment in return for the outlay which falls
upon them can not be questioned, and so far as this could be recog-
nized it introduced atendency to provide an establishment more like
an ordinary zoological garden, or permanent menagerie, than the com-
paratively inexpensive scheme at first contemplated.

In view of the circumstances an appropriation was asked of Con-
gress, which was believed to be smaller than was consistent with the
proper ultimate development of the park, but on an estimate which
proposed to begin on the most economical scale. Thus, for the general
maintenance of the collection, $35,000 was asked, which is about the
same as the annual sum spent in the Central Park menagerie, New
York, having an area of about 10 acres, and at least $10,000 less than is
spent either at the zoological garden in Cincinnati or Philadelphia, each
having an area of about 40 acres. When it is reflected that these
latter enterprises are conducted for business purposes by business men,
that they have their collections already nearly complete and purchase
but few new animals, it will be seen that the sum asked for the main-
tenance of the 167 acres of the National Zoological Park with all the
expensive animals yet to be procured was certainly not extravagant.
Congress reduced this estimate to $17,500, a sum for which as a year’s
experience has now shown the Park can not be maintained.

For buildings, an appropriation of $36,850 was asked. In this con-
nection it may be recalled that in the Philadelphia gardens the build-
ings and inclosures cost $194,705. The sum estimated was intended to
cover all inclosures and structures of every character indispensable on
the modest scale proposed. Congress reduced this to $18,000.

The average expense of preparing such uncultivated grounds in city
parks elsewhere has proved to be at least $2,900 per acre. The sum of
$29,500 was asked for that purpose, as no more than sufficient to fit
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

such portions of the park as were necessary for the immediate accom-
modation of the public. Congress reduced this to $15,000,

These reductions have not only obliged me to retard the development
on the lines that had been laid down, but have increased the ultimate
cost; for where living creatures are in question it is plain that they
have not only to be fed and guarded but to be housed and all this at
once, under penalty of their loss. Congress has plainly intended that
they should be preserved, and that some sort of roads and access for
the public should be provided this year.

The result has necessarily been, that with every effort to obtain per-
manent results there has been a partial expenditure of the absolutely
insufficient grant on enforced expedients of a temporary character,
which are not in the interests of economy.

It is extremely desirable that a sum for emergencies be secured in
the next appropriation. In carrying forward from the beginning novel
and untried work of such varied character, unforeseen difficulties must
inevitably arise, but no provision has been made for these, nor even for
such readily anticipated emergencies as are caused, for instance, by
floods in grounds traversed by a stream which has been known to rise
6 feet in less than half an hour.

The difficulties which these conditions have imposed on the adminis-
tration of the park may be fairly called extreme, and the amount and
character of what has been effected must be considered in this con-
nection. In spite of these the result, I think, may be said to be, that at
least as a source of interest and amusement to the people the park has
exceeded the most sanguine expectations.

As the available funds were small it was necessary to limit the area
of the park which should be first improved. It was found that the ani-
mals on hand could be accommodated within an area of 40 acres, and a
tract of about that size was selected, extending along the main drive
from Quarry road to Connecticut avenue through the most interesting
portion of the park. This main road was laid out, graded, and metalled
sarly in the fiscal year, and steps were taken to construct a permanent
bridge over Rock Creek at the place where the road should pass. As
was anticipated, the construction of the bridge presented serious en-
gineering difficulties. Rock Creek is usually a quiet shallow stream,
but becomes in times of freshet a powerful torrent. It was necessary to
erect a structure that would withstand these floods and desirable that
it should be one which would not mar the beauty of the valley. After
a careful consideration of several designs, motives of economy com-
pelled the erection of a bridge of wood and iron, resting upon stone
piers 15 feet above ordinary water level, sufficient as an engineering
structure but having no claim to beauty other than that of utility. At
the close of the year these piers had been erected and the superstrue-
ture contracted for but not yet placed. In the meantime temporary in-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

expensive wooden bridges have been in use. During the progress of
the work they have been several times swept away or seriously injured.

A number of trees have been planted in different parts of the park,
in some places for ornament, in others to secure the proper seclusion of
animals. A considerable area of open land has been prepared for lawn
and pasture grgunds.

The development of the park has proceeded steadily during the year,
the minimum of change in the natural features of the picturesque region
being made on principle and independent of any considerations of
economy. As the approach from the city by the way of the Quarry
road could be made available at the least expense to the park, that
road is adopted provisionally as the main carriage entrance. At the
request of the Secretary the Commissioners of the District of Columbia
expended a sum of $1,000 in grading and repairing this road, but while
it has served a useful purpose it is still far from satisfactory as a prin-
cipal avenue of approach. The grade is steep, the carriage way nar-
row, and the roadbed not sufficiently thick to endure heavy travel.

The system of roads contemplates other means of approach, especially
a bridle path by the way of Ontario avenue, a footpath (which will
probably be enlarged to a carriage road as means may permit) by the
way of Woodley Bridge, extending along the creek through the park
as far as the Klingle Bridge, and a carriage road entering from Con-
necticut avenue extended on the west side of the park, by which per-
sons brought by the Rock Creek Railway can readily pass in. A wind-
ing footpath from the Adams Mill road leads by means of rudely con-
structed steps and a simple rustic bridge down the cliffs and across a
narrow ravine into the occupied portion of the park.

Before animals could be safely kept in the park, it was necessary to
inclose it so as to insure control of all the territory within its limits.
A boundary fence was therefore built, and experience has shown it to
be absolutely essential to the safety and well-being of the animals as
well as to the preservation of the trees, shrubbery, and property of the
park.

Near what is for the present the principal entrance is a disused
quarry, from which arise precipitous cliffs and bold rocky ledges. It
seemed particularly well fitted for the construction of dens and yards
for bears. A series of caverns has been blasted in the rock and inclosed
by a stout iron fence. Within the fence are large and commodious
yards in which have been constructed bathing pools, with water flow-
ing constantly from a large spring outside the park at the side of Quarry
road. The result has been a place admirably adapted for the health
and general welfare of the animals, as well as a most picturesque and
striking feature. It has been found necessary, in order to protect the
yards from falling dirt and débris swept down the cliffs by rains, to build
a retaining wall on the ledge above the dens at once, and this has been
done in part, for the reasons already stated, in such a manner as itis to

be feared will necessitate very early removal. It is most desirable that
the boundary of the park, which now runs along the very edge of this
precipice, should be carried back a few yards to thus avoid the expense
of a costly permanent retaining wall.

A house for the bison has been built and another for animals re-
quiring warmer winter quarters is in course of construction, a portion
of it being already occupied. It will not be possible to complete this
house upon the original plan under the present appropriation, but it
was deemed a wise economy to accept a design which could be par-
tially completed and extended as the need for more room became
pressing and other means should become available.

Already the establishment in the United States of a Nationai Zoolog-
ical Park under the management and guidance of the Smithsonian In-
stitution has attracted the attention of similar institutions and of nat-
uralists in other countries, and liberal offers of gifts and exchanges
have been made.

From Sumatra, from the islands of the Pacific, from the shores of
Alaska, and from our own national parks, have come offers of gifts or
terms of purchase, but I regret to say that it has been necessary to
defer acceptance of all these offers owing to lack of funds even to pay
transportation.

NECROLOGY.
GEORGE BANCROFT.

It seems unnecessary to give here more than a brief outline of the
connection of the distinguished historian, the Hon. George Bancroft,
with the Smithsonian Institution.

Mr. Bancroft was elected by Congress a regent from the city of Wash-
ington, December 11, 1874. He was appointed chairman of a special
committee to memorialize Congress for a building for the National Mu-
seum; he served on a committee under whose direction a portrait of
Prof. Henry was painted, and on January 20, 1875, was elected a mem-
ber of the executive committee. Heresigned from the Board in March,
1878, after serving four years. Mr. Bancroft died on January 17, 1891.

WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN.

As in the case of Mr. Bancroft, any extended notice of the life of
Gen. Sherman would seem entirely superfluous, but it is fitting that I
should mention here his interested and valuable services upon the
Board of Regents.

Gen. Sherman was elected by Congress a regent from the city of
Washington, January 30, 1871, and became a member of the executive
committee of the Board, March 9 of the same year. His resignation from
the Board was presented November 12, 1874, on account of a change of
residence from Washington to St. Louis.
26 ‘ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The following extract from his letter of resignation expresses his deep
interest in the Institution and his views as to its policy:

In thus severing my official connection with the Smithsonian, I beg
leave to express to you and your associates my sense of the noble task
in which you are engaged, and of my earnest prayer that the institution
under your management will continue to fulfill its magnificent design.

A knowledge of sc ience, that is, of the laws of nature, iS SO intimately
connected with the advance of higher civilization that Mr. Smithson
displayed unusual wisdom in so endowing his institution that it should
give its principal labor to the increase of knowledge, to accumulating
and securing new knowledge to be added to the old, which should be a
special province of the universities of the whole earth. I therefore coin-
cide with you perfectly in your special construction of the will, and hope
that the Regents will continue to construe it literally as a legacy sacred
in its nature and beneficial in the highest degree.

I beg you will assure your associ iates that among the many causes of
regret at leaving Washington none impresses me more than that which
forces me to sever iny relations with the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution.

Upon his return to the capital he was re-elected by Congress a regent
from the city of Washington, March 25, 1878, and again became a mem-
ber of the executive committee on May 17 following. He served as
chairman of a special committee of the Board to make arrangements for
the funeral ceremonies of Prof. Henry, May 13, 1878, and was elected,
January 15, 1879, by the Board to make an address at the memorial
services of Prof. Henry in the United States Capitol. A few extracts
from his address at the services on January 16, 1879, are eminently
characteristic, and may be most appropriately quoted here:

From the beginning the living have paid homage to the virtues of the
dead; for immortality is the dream of man. From Agra to Washing-
ton scar ce acity, town, or village but contains some monument designed
to perpetuate the memory of one who has passed from earth. Moun-
tains have been excavated, pyramids built, temples have been erected,
and granite, marble, and bronze shaped into every conceivable form to
give expression to honor, respect, affection, and love for some dead hero,
warrior, Statesman, or philosopher. These earthly tributes can be of
no service to the dead, but they form lasting records of deeds held
honorable among men; are strong incentives to noble acts in the pres-
ent, and mark a ‘steady progress towar d that better condition which is
the ultimate destiny of the human race.

We are not assembled to-night to shape in marble, or granite, o1
bronze the human form of our countryman and friend, Prof. Joseph
Henry, but in order that those who knew him best may, by simple trib-
utes of thought and feeling, bear public testimony to the merits of one
who in our day stood forth a most resplendent type of moral and intel-
lectual manhood, and who, with little thought of self, rendered eminent
service in the cause of mankind. He needs no monument, for where-
ever man goes or human thought travels the poles and continuous wires
will remind him that to Prof. Henry of all men we are most indebted
for the inestimable blessings of the telegraph.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. rt |

It was a scientific Englishman, a skillful analytical chemist of Lon-
don, who conceived the thought and provided the means whereby Prof.
Henry was enabled to ac complish so much further good. Arts may
have been lost or forgotton, because no longer needed, and the world’s
libraries and universities already possessed in abundance the vast
accumulations of knowledge which had for ages been garnered and
stored away in these y raluable repositories of learning, yet nature re-
mained so bountiful that there could be no danger that her fountains
would become exhausted, and Mr. Smithson provided for an institution
which accepts all the past, and provides only for the future. He en-
dowed munificently the institution (which bears his name here in
Washington) for collecting new knowledge, and for distributing it to
all parts of the earth. Great was the conception, generous the endow-
ment, and fortunate that the execution fell to the lot of Prof. Henry.

¥* * * * * * *

For this reason the memory of his life and fame should be treasured
by all as an example to the youth of our land to show that honor and
fame may be earned in the school of philosophy as well as in the more
tempting and active scenes of public life.

Many students, who at this moment are hard at work on their studies
for the advantage of mankind, will feel themselves personally encour-
aged and honored by the tokens of respect and affection thus paid their
prototy pe, Prof. Henry; and their stimulated labors in the cause of
that science he loved so well will erect to him a monument more lasting
than of brass or marble.

On January 17, 1879, Gen. Sherman was elected by the Board a mem-
ber of the commission for erecting the National Museum building, and
on March 7 he was chosen chairman of this commission.

“The office of member of this commission,” he says in his first report,
presented January 19, 1880, “has been by no means a sinecure, weekly
meetings having been held with scarcely an interruption from the first
organization.”

The second report Gen. Sherman presented January 18, 1881, and the
final report January 2, 1882. In the latter he ‘‘ begs to refer to the im-
portant fact that, while a building is presented equal in every respect
to what was anticipated - - - instead of incurring a deficiency, the
fund has been so managed as to have to its credit an available balance
of some thousands of dollars.”

Gen. Sherman took a great interest in carrying into effect the act of
Congress providing for a statue of Prof. Henry. He was active in in-
ducing Congress to appropriate money to fireproof the east wing of the
Smithsonian building, and he was elected January 17, 1883, by the
Board with the chancellor and secretary upon a special commission ‘to
act for and in the name of the Board in carrying into effect any act of
Congress which might be passed providing for the erection of an addi-
tional building for the National Musewn.”

His second term as regent expired March 25, 1885, when he removed
his residence to New York. He died February 14, "1891. For eleven
years Gen. Sherman was diligent, active, attentive, and enthusiastic in
his devotion to the Institution.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY FOR THE
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1891.

Sir: Ethnologie researches among the North American Indians were centinued,
under the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in compliance with acts of
Congress, during the year 1890-’91.

A report upon the work of the year is most conveniently presented under two
general heads, viz, field work and office work.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) archeology, and (2) general field
studies, the latter being directed chiefly to religion, technology, and linguistics.

Archeologic field work.—At the close of the last fiscal year general exploration of
the mound region was discontinued and the archeologic field work was placed in the
charge of Mr. W. H. Holmes. During the summer of 1890 he began the work of arch-
wological exploration in the Atlantic coast States. The ancient quarries of quartzite
bowlelers and of steatite within the Districtof Columbia were explored and extensive
excavations were made. This work was continued throughout July, and in August
a quarry site near the new U.8. Naval Observatory on a ridge overlooking Rock Creek
Valley wasexamined. The phenomena observed upon this site were practically iden-
tical with those of Piny Branch described in the last annualreport. A large area of
the Potomac bowlder beds, 2 or 3 acres in extent, had been worked over to the depth
of several feet by the aboriginal quarrymen and all available bowlders had been
utilized in the manufacture of leaf-shaped blades. These were probably the blanks
subsequently specialized as spear and arrow points, perforators, and similar instru-
ments.

In August Mr. Holmes made a trip to the Mississippi Valley for the purpose of re-
examining some mound groups not explored with sufficient care by the assistants
before intrusted with that work. A week was spent in Grant County, Wis., map-
ping the remarkable groups of effigy mounds for which that region is noted. Sub-
sequently he visited Pulaski County, Ark., and made a survey of the Knapp mounds
at Toltec Station, whence he proceeded to the vicinity of Hot Springs, Ark., to ex-
amine the ancient novaculite quarries near that place. Apparently the early inhabi-
tants had quarried this rock on an extensive scale and had used it in the manufac-
ture of spear and arrow points and other articles. The pittings were on a large
scale, even surpassing those of the District of Columbia quarries, and had generally
been attributed by white settlers to Spanish gold hunters of an early period.

In September and October Mr. Holmes resumed his explorations in the District of
Columbia and extended the work into the valley of the Potomac between Point of
Rocks and Cumberland, Md., and into the Ohio Valley as far as Allegheny City. A
trip was next made to the eastern shore of the Chesapeake, aud a very interesting

29
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Indian village site on the Choptank River, 2 miles below Cambridge,was examined.
An ancient community of oyster dredgers had been established on a bluff about 20 feet
above tide level. Subsequently this site was buried by wind-driven sand to the
depth of 20 feet, and. more recently the waves have encroached upon the land, expos-
ing a section of the bluff and its buried village site. The most important feature of
this exposure was the section of an ossuary or burial pit 12 feet in diameter and 5
feet deep, which had been dug upon the village site and filled with a mass of dis-
connected human bones, all of which were in an advanced state of decay. They
were not accompanied by objects of art.

In April Mr. Holmes made a journey to Bartow County, Ga., and to Coahoma
County, Miss., to make necessary observations of the great groups of mounds at
these points. The principal Bartow County mound belongs to the group known as
the Etowah group, and is a splendid example of the work of the unidentified build-
ers. The shape of the great mound is that of a four-sided truncated pyramid but is
not wholly symmetric. It is 63 feet high and measures about 175 feet across the
nearly level top. The measurements of the four sides of the base are 380, 330, 360,
and 350 feet. The slopes are steep, reaching in places 45°, and are broken by two
decided eccentricities of configuration. On the south is a terrace from 40 to 50 feet
wide, sloping to the base level of the mound at the east and ending 1m anearly level
platform about 45 feet square at the west end. This platform is about 20 feet lower
than the mound and does not appear to have had means of communication with its
summit. This irregular terrace has been called a roadway, but it has more the
character of an addition to the great mound in process of construction. The other
eccentricity alluded to is a graded way extending out to the east from the summit
of the mound, and which to all appearances is the real roadway to the summit.
This way is 20 0r more feet in width, though somewhat broken down by erosion,
and has a slope of only 21°. There can be little doubt that this mound was the
stronghold of the village and that its top was inclosed by a stockade.

The Carson mounds in Coahoma County, Miss., form a group of unusual interest.
There are four mounds of large size, two of them being oblong and with thin summits.
The highest has an elevation of 25 feet. Scattered about these large mounds are
nearly a hundred smaller ones from 1 to 6 feet in height and from 10 to 200 feet in
diameter, most of which, as refuse indicates, represent house sites. The house floors
have been of clay well smoothed on the upper surface and the walls and possibly the
coverings have been of clay supported by a framework of canes. The clay has in
many cases been basked, but whether from design in building or through the de-
struction of the structure by fire, is not easily determined. There are numerous
large pits about the border of the site from which the earth used in building the
mounds has been obtained. The area covered by the village is three-fourths of a
mile long by half a mile wide.

In the spring of 1891 Mr. Holmes began the systematic exploration of the tide-
water regions of Maryland and Virginia, which included a study of the art remains
and of the phenomena of shell banks and village sites, as well as the mapping of all
sites which have interest to the historian and the archzologist. In this work he was
as ssited by Mr. William Dinwiddie and for a short period by Mr. Gerard Fowke.

Through documentary evidence it is known that the tide-water region was oceu-
pied by tribes of Algonquian stock belonging to the Powhatan Confederacy. So
thoroughly have they occupied this country that along the water courses nearly
every available site bears evidence of occupation, and in the salt and brackish sec-
tions of the water courses shell banks—the kitchen-middens of this people—coyer the
shores in almost continuous lines. So numerous were the sites that a careful study
of all was found to be impracticable, and it was determined to select for detailed
examination a small number of those that are typical. On the Potomac the follow-
ing localities have been chosen for a special study: The vicinity of the Little Falls,
at the head of tide water; the site of Smith’s town of ‘‘ Nacotchtank,” now Anacos-

tia; ““Chapowamsie” Island at the mouth of the creek of that name; the site of the
village of ‘‘Potowomeck” on Potomac Creek; the shell deposits of Goose Creek, a
branch of Port Tobacco River; the great shell mounds of Pope’s Creek, and the oys-
ter dredging stations about the mouth of Wicomico River. Many sites upon the
west shore of Chesapeake Bay and on the Patuxent River; also many village sites
upon the James, most of them mentioned and located by Capt. John Smith, were
visited and examined. These include ‘‘Chesapeac,” on Lynnhaven Bay, Virginia,
“Nansamund,” on Chuckatuck Creek, west of Norfolk; Jamestown Island; ‘“Cha-
wopo,” ‘‘Paspahegh,” and ‘ Quiyoughcohannock,” near Clearmont; ‘‘Weanock,” on
Eppes Island, opposite City Point; and ‘‘Powhatan” just below Richmond. The
art remains procured from these historic James River sites are identical in nearly
every respect with the Potomac and Chesapeake relics, a fact which bears strongly
upon the question of the unity of the art remains and the identity of the peoples of
the tide-water country.

Mr. Gerard Fowke entered upon his duties as assistant archeologist on May 1, 1891.
He began at once the exploration of the James River Valley, and at the close of the
year was making excavations in an ancient cemetery near Gale, Allegheny County,
Va. The object of that work, aside from the usual archeologic explorations, is to
determine the western limits of areas occupied by the Algonquian tribes and the
eastern limitations of the various groups of peoples belonging to the west.

As above mentioned, the field work upon mound explorations, which for several
years had been under the charge of Prof. Cyrus Thomas, was discontinued except so
far as was found necessary to correct some errors and supply some omissions. Mr.
Henry L. Reynolds was the only one of the former assistants in the mound division
who was retained. He was engaged during the early part of the last fiscal year in
making examinations and resurveys of certain ancient works in Ohio, and in the
spring of 1891 was sent to South Carolina to examine several important works in
that State. Owing to severe illness, which terminated in his death (on April 17,
1891) while in the field, this last trip was unproductive of scientific results. By the
death of Mr. Reynolds the Bureau has lost a skillful and industrious member, and
archeology an enthusiastic student. For some time previous to his death, in addi-
tion to his other duties as assistant to Prof. Thomas, he had been engaged in preparing
a paper on the prehistoric metallic articles of the mound area. The only other field
work performed in relation to the mounds has been above explained. In order to as-
sist Prof. Thomas in obtaining correct illustrations and plats of certain groups in
Mississippi, Arkansas, and Wisconsin, which were deemed of more than ordinary
importance in the study of the archeology of the mound region, Mr. Holmes visited
those groups and made careful survey drawings of them, besides collecting impor-
tant data concerning them.

Late in November Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was ordered to proceed to the Casa
Grande, on the Gila River, in Arizona, and examine that ruin with a view to its
preservation as provided for by act of Congress, also to prepare plans and specifica-
tions and make contracts for the work. He was further directed to make an exami-
nation of the valley of the Rio Verde, and collect the data for a report upon the
archeology of that region. Owing to unforeseen delays the contracts for the Casa
Grande work were not executed until May 15, 1891, and were approved by the Secre-
tary of the Interior late in June, but subsequently the time for the completion of the
work was extended two months. It will be completed by October 1.

During his stay in the vicinity of the Casa Grande Mr. Mindeleff made surveys of
the ruin proper and of the large ruin of which it forms a part, together with photo-
graphs, detailed plans, sketches, and notes, with a view to a detailed report. He
found, among other results of his examination, that the ruin is now standing to
within a very few feet of the height it had when built and occupied.

Pending the execution and approval of the contracts for the Casa Grande work,
Mr. Mindeleff made an examination of the valley of the Rio Verde from its mouth
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to Camp Verde and beyond. This region had never been thoroughly examined, and
it was deemed highly probable that it would prove as rich in archeologic remains
as the region about Camp Verde. Such, however, proved not to be the case. A
chain of settlements was found extending from Camp Verde southward nearly to
Fort McDowell, but ,the ruins are not so numerous as in the region immediately
about Camp Verde. About 10 miles below the latter an extensive and well pre-
served group of cavate dwellings was found.

The buildings throughout the whole Verde Valley now in ruins were constructed
of slabs of caleareous rock, or of river bowlders, or of both, and in their construction,
location, and ground plans are affiliated with the northern type, rather than with
the southern type, of which the best example is the Casa Grande on the Gila River.
Data for a report upon the ruins in the valley of the Rio Verde, and upon the irri-
gating ditches and horticultural systems there pursued, were collected, and will be
prepared for publication at once. Mr. Mindeleff remained in the field until after the
close of the fiscal year.

General Field Studies.—Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson remained at the Pueblo of Sia,
New Mexico, from July to September 15, 1890. She was diligently engaged in com-
pleting her studies of the customs and mythology of the Sia Indians explained in the
last annualreport. Theircosmogony, and the rites of their secret cult societies, were
made by her special subjects of investigation, with the view of securing a clearer
understanding of their mythology and religious practices.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman, in July, visited the Menomonee Reservation at Keshena and the
Ojibway Reservation at Lake Court Oreilles, Wis., the Ojibwa Reservation at La Point,
and the Ottawa Indians at Petoskey, Mich. At Keshena he attended, by request of
the Indians, the annual ceremony of the Mitawit or Grand Medicine Society, an
order of shamans or priests professing the power of prophecy, exorcism of demons,
the cure of disease, and the ability to confer success in the chase. The introductory
portion of the ritual of initiation of this society embraces the dramatization of the
Menomonee ideas of cosmogony and the genesis of mankind, the reception by the In-
dians from the Great Manito of the power of warding off disease and hunger, and in-
struction to candidates as to the proper mode of living, so as to gain admission into
the realm presided over by Naqpote, the wolf, who is brother of Manabush, the
mediator between the Menomonee and the Great Manito. The services of initiation
of these ceremonies are preceded by a mortuary ritual lasting one entire night, in
honor of the deceased member, whose place is filled later on by the initiation of a
substitute.

Investigations were made at the Menomonee ceremony to compare it witha similar
ritual found among the Ojibways. It appears that the Menomonee practices are off-
shoots from the Ojibway, and also that where the Ojibway shamans repeat certain
phrases in an archaic form of language, as handed down to them, the Menomonee
employ Ojibway words and phrases, perhaps to mystify the hearers, or perhaps be-
cause the ritual was obtained from the Ojibway in that form. The preparation of
textile materials used in the manufacture of the several kinds of mats made by the
Menomonee was also investigated and typical specimens were secured. Water color
and other sketches were made to illustrate ceremonies, daily avocations, the abor-
iginal houses, grave boxes, and other objects of interest.

Upon the completion of his work at the above reservations, Dr. Hoffman proceded
to La Point to inquire of the Ojibway shamen concerning certain sacred birch-bark
charts employed by them in the introduction of candidates into the society of sha-
mans, and also to secure additional information relative to the explanation of picto-
graphic cosmogony records. He then visited the Ottawa Indians on the eastern
shore of Lake Michigan, near Mackinaw, to ascertain whether the ceremonies of
the ‘‘ Grand Medicine Society” were still practiced by them. This body of Indians
professes to have discontinued these pagan rites, but assert that a band of the
Ottawa, living farther south, near Grand Traverse, adheres to the primitive belief,
and conducts its ceremonies annually,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 30

Mr. James Mooney made a short visit in July to the mountain region of North
Carolina and Tennessee, the former home of the Cherokees, for the purpose of col-
lecting additional facts for his monograph upon that tribe. In connection with the
same work he had intended to visit the Cherokee Nation in the Indian Territory in
the following winter, but in the meantime the ‘‘ Messiah religion” had begun to
attract so much attention that he was directed to investigate that subject also at
the same time, as well as to gather more material bearing upon the linguistic affini-
ties of the Kiowa tribe. He left Washington December 22, and proceeding at once
to the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reservation in Indian Territory, where the ghost
dances were in full progress, remained for several weeks studying the dance, mak-
ing photographs, and collecting the songs used. This last was the most important
part of the study, as most of the Messiah religion is embodied in songs many of
which go to the root of Indian mythology. That religion is a remodeling of aborigi-
nal beliefs as influenced by the ideas of Christianity lately imbibed from the white
man, to be used for the utter confounding of the white man himself. It is in no
sense a warlike movement. It is somewhat remarkable that the ghost songs in use
by the various tribes are almost all in the language of the Arapahoes, the members of
that tribe being the most active propagators of the new religion and their language
being peculiarly adapted to music.

He then proceeded to the Kiowa Reservation, where linguistic and other materials
were obtained, by which it may become possible to finally classify that hitherto
isolated tribe. Additional ghost-dance material was also collected. After revisit-
ing the Cherokee Nation, where several weeks were devoted to gathering informa-
tion, especially in regard to the Indian geography of upper Georgia, he returned to
Washington early in April.

In accordance with arrangements for the World’s Columbian Exposition it was
decided to make a tribal exhibit from one of the more primitive prairie tribes. The
Kiowas were selected for the purpose and the work was assigned to Mr. Mooney,
who at once prepared to return to their reservation. During May and June he col-
lected a large variety of articles illustrative of the home life, arts, dress, and cere-
monials of the tribe, and was still in the field at the close of the fiscal year.

OFFICE WORK.

The Director during the year devoted all the time he could spare from other offi-
cial duties to the completion of a work on the linguistic families of North America,
His undertaking to classify the North American languages so as to be of scientific
value as well as of practical use has been explained in previous reports. This classi-
fication is recognized to be, when properly made, an indispensable preliminary to
all aceurate ethnologic work relating to this continent. The essay, with its accom-
panying linguistic chart, was delivered to the Publie Printer during the year, to
form part of the seventh annual report of this Bureau, though that volume at this
date has not yet been actually issued.

Col. Garrick Mallery, U. 8S. Army, during the year, when not occupied in special
and occasional duties designated by the director, was engaged in arranging for pub-
lication the material gathered by him during several former years on the general
theme of pictography. That title is used to embrace all modes of expressing and
communicating thoughts and facts in a durable form without reference to sound.
Such modes of expression being at one time if not still independent of oral language,
the study of their history, evolution, and practice may assist in the solution of some
ethnic and psychic problems, and may verify or modify some theories of anthro-
pologie import. In the scheme of arrangement for publication the objective exhibi-
tion of mental concepts by the North American Indians has been classified with
proper predeminance, as it has exceeded in interest all others known which have not
passed beyond the beundaries separating ideograms and emblems from syllabaries
and alphabets. In erder to promote explanation and comparison, however, copies

od REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and descriptions of a large number of petroglyphs and other forms of pictographs
found in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and in many islands have been collated for
the publication of selected and typical illustrations. With the same object, still
more earnest attention has been directed to the synoptic presentation of illustrations
from Mexico and Central and-South America, as being presumably more closely con-
nected than is the eastern hemisphere with the similar developments found in the
present area of the United States, whether enduring on rocks with authorship un-
known, or actually in current use among most of the Indian tribes. At the close of
the fiscal year the treatise was substantially completed, the delay in its delivery to
the Public Printer, as the contents of one of the forthcoming volumes in the series of
annual reports of this Bureau, being occasioned by the preparation of the large num-
ber of illustrations required.

Mr. Henry W. Henshaw during the entire year devoted his time to administrative
work and to continuing the preparation of the Dictionary of Indian Tribes, before ex-
plained in detail.

Prof. Cyrus Thomas was engaged during the year chiefly in the preparation of the
second volume of his report on the archeology of the mound area of the United
States, and other office work necessary in connection with the publication of a
bulletin on the list of mound localities, the preparation of maps therefor, and of illus-
trations for the first volume of his report. When the whole manuscript was taken
up for examination, preparatory to printing, its bulk was found to be too great for
one volume. It was then decided to publish the part relating to mound localities in
a bulletin. As this necessitated some change in the manuscript, the opportunity was
embraced to incorporate the additional data which had been obtained. The bulletin
was in print at the close of the year, though not yet issued.

Mr. W. H. Holmes included in his office work the preparation for the monographs
of Profe Cyrus Thomas of papers upon pottery, shell, textile fabrics, pipes, and
other productions of the mound-building tribes, and the writing of reports upon the
numerous explorations made during the year. These reports have been brought up
to date and are on file. He has adopted the policy of preparing reports upon field
work for file as the work proceeds, and his assistants are expected at the close of each
separate piece of exploration or unit of study to make a report upon it of a sufficiently
finished nature to serve the purpose of record and reference in case of their disability
or separation from the office.

Rey. J. Owen Dorsey prepared the index to his monograph, The ('egiha Language-
Myths, Stories, and Letters, and corrected the proof sheets of the second part of
that volume. He resumed his work on the (egiha-English dictionary, inserting
many new words occurring in the texts and referring to each new word by page and
line of the text. He devoted considerable time to the synonymy of the Athapascan,
Caddoan, Kusan, Siouan, Takilman, and Yakonan families; comparing authorities,
writing historical sketches of the tribes, gentes, and villages of those linguistic
families, and rearranging all the material, in order to have it ready for printing.
From December, 1890, to March, 1891, with the aid of a Kwapa delegate in Wash-
ington, he collected much information respecting the Kwapa or Quapaw tribe, a peo-
ple closely related to the Omaha and Ponka, from whom they separated prior to
1540. Since March, 1891, he has been elaborating that material, which consists of
about 150 personal names, arranged according to sex and gens, with the meaning of
the name whenever attainable; over 3,500 entries for a Kwapa-English dictionary
and several epistles and myths with grammatical and sociologic notes. This material
will be of great assistance to him in the preparation of the Gegiha-English diction-
ary and other papers.

He also prepared for publication the following papers: A study of Siouan cults,
illustrated with numerous sketches colored by Indians; Omaha and Ponka letters,
containing the (egiha epistles, which could not be published in Contributions to
North American Ethnology, Vol. v1; an iHustrated paper on Omaha dwellings, far-
niture, and implements; a paper on the social organization of the Siouan tribes-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

Mr. Albert S$. Gatschet during the fiscal year was engaged in office work only.
After having completed the manuscript of the ‘Ethnographic Sketch ” of his work,
“The Klamath Indians of Southwestern Oregon,” which was published during the.
year as Vol. 1, Part 1, of Contributions to North American Ethnology, he read the
proof of it, which was completed in October, 1890. Since then he has been extract-
ing, copying, and carding the vocabularies and other matter collected by him during
the past ten years. This work is now accomplished concerning the Tonkawe, the
Hitchiti, the Shawano, and Powhatan. That relative to the Creek, willsoon be com-
pleted. A large number of personal tribal and vocal names of Indian origin were
collected and partly explained in the intervals of the above work.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman continued the arrangement and classification of material relat-
ting to the society of shamans of the Ojibwa Indians, which, together with numer-
ous illustrations, was prepared for publication, and will form part of the Seventh
Annual Report of the Bureau. This work will present from aboriginal records an
exposition of the Ojibwa traditions of cosmogony and genesis and the dramatized
ritual of the myths relating to the same. The musical notation of the songs and
chants employed before and during the ceremonies of initiation, and copies of all of
the birch-bark charts bearing the mnemonic characters relating to the ritual will
be incorporated in the paper, together with the original texts. Dr. Hoffman has
also been engaged in the elaboration of the data and sketches relating to the pic-
tography and gesture language of the North American Indians, secured by him
during previons field seasons.

Mr. James Mooney devoted the earlier part of the fiscal year to the elaboration of
his Cherokee material, the first results of which, under the title of ‘‘ Sacred Formu-
las of the Cherokees,” will appear in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau. He
also prepared a short descriptive catalogue of his previous ethnologic collections
from the Cherokees, and began work on a paper contending that the South Atlantic
States were formerly occupied by a number of Siouan tribes, if indeed that region
was not the original home of the Siouan stock. In connection with this investiga-
tion a closer study of the linguistic material from the Catawban tribes of Carolina
confirms the statement which has before been published by this Bureau, that they
belonged to the Siouan family. Mr. Mooney also at intervals assisted on the Dic-
tionary of Tribal Synonymy.

Mr. James C. Pilling has continued his bibliographic work throughout the fiscal]
year. At the date of the last report he was engaged in reading proof of the Bibli-
ography of the Algonquian Languages. The volume is now ready for the press, and
will include 614 pages and 82 full page illustrations, chiefly facsimiles of the title-
pages of rare books, syllabaries, and other interesting bibliographic features. It is
hoped that the work will be ready for distribution during the autumn of 1891,
Among the special articles in it is one relating to the labors of “ Apostle” Eliot
among the Indians of Massachusetts, and more especially to his linguistic work. As
this author was the earliest and the most noted of those engaged in this line of work,
considerable space was devoted to him and his works, and it was thought proper to
issue the article in separate form. It is noted below under the heading of Publi-
cations.

Mr. Pilling has ceased to be connected with the U. 8. Geological Survey, being
transferred to the Bureau of Ethnology, his appointment taking effect May 1, 1891.
The stock or family of languages proposed to form the subject of his next biblio-
graphic memoir is the Athapasean.

Mr. J.N. B. Hewitt has continued his work on the Tuskarora dictionary, the Tus-
karora-English part being well advanced and the English-Tuskarora part com-
menced. Much material for the compilation of a complete grammar of the Tuska-
rora-Iroquoian tongue was added to that before acquired. For this object such
anomalous, redundant, and defective verbs as have been recorded in the dictionary
have been conjugated in all the derivative forms of which they are susceptible; a
difticult but instructive task. Several regular verbs have also been conjugated to
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

develop all their known derivative forms. The number of possible derivative forms
of a regular verb in the several conjugations is estimated by Mr. Hewitt to evary
~ between 2,800 and 3,000. This numeration is of interest, because it has been asserted
" by students of Indian languages that the number of possible derivative forms of an
American Indian verb is infinite, and, secondly, because it has been estimated that
a Greek verb so conjugated would be represented by about 1,300 forms.

Grammatic gender has also received special attention. There are in the Tuskarora-
Troquoian tongue three genders, which Mr. Hewitt names the anthropic, the zoic,
and the azoic, which are expressed through the prefix pronouns only. In the an-
thropic gender alone sex distinctions are found, and hence there are masculine and
feminine pronouns therein. But in the zoic and azoic genders sex is not indicated.
Hence, by the prefit pronouns the objects of discourse are classified into three
genders.

Mr. Hewitt continued making translations from the old French writers, Perrot,
Lafitau, La Potherie, and others, of the notices and accounts of the beliefs, rites, and
ceremonies, superstitions, and mythic tales of Iroquoian peoples. These were col-
lated as aids in explaining and elaborating the matter collected in the field per-
sonally by him. By their confirmative testimony, joined to the evidence of etymology,
the Iroquoian cosmogony or genesis nythis found to originate in the personification
by the Iroquoian mind of the elements, powers, processes, and the living creatures
of the visible and sensible world.

Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson was engaged from the latter part of September, 1890,
to June 30, 1891, in preparing for publication the material collected at the Pueblo of
Sia, New Mexico, during the preceding spring and summer.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff during the first five months of the fiscal year was occupied
upon the card catalogue of ruins referred to in the last Annual Report and in the
compilation and preparation of maps showing the distribution of ruins in the south-
western part of the United States. This work was temporarily discontinued late in
November, when he was ordered into the field, as above explained.

He also has continued to be in charge of the modeling room. Its force during the
year was devoted exclusively to the ‘‘ duplicate series,” reference to which has been
made in previous reports, and no new work was undertaken. Five models were
added to the series, ranging in size from 16 square feet to 250 square feet, and com-
prising the following subjects: Mummy Cave Cliff Ruin, Arizona; Pueblo of Walpi,
Arizona; Pueblo of Sechumovi, Arizona; Ruin of Penasco Blanco, New Mexico; and
Pit of Nelson Mound. This series is nearing completion, and the Bureau now has
material sufficient to form the nucleus of an exhibit such as it is often called upon
to make, without disturbing its series of original models now deposited in the Na-
tional Museum. It has also a small number of models which can be drawn upon to
supply the demand for such material in the way of exchange with colleges and
other scientific institutions.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin was oceupied with office work exclusively during the year.
From July 1, 1890, until February 1, 1891, he arranged and copied vocabularies
which he had previously collected in California, namely, Hupa, Ehnikan, Weitspe-
kan, Wintu, Yana and Palaihnihan. He devoted the later months of the year to
classifying and copying a large number of myths which he had collected among the
Hupa, Ehnikan and Wintu Indians. These myths are for the greater part connected
with medicine, though some are creation myths and myths relating to religion and
the origin of various tribal customs and usages.

Mr. De Lancey W. Gill continued in charge of the work of preparing and editing
the illustrations for publications of the Bureau. The work done for the year ending
June 30, 1891, was as follows:

Drawings of objects and ethnologic specimens and miscellaneous diagrams... 422

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

These drawings were prepared from field surveys and sketches, from photographs,
and from the collections brought in by the ethnologists.

The photographie work remains under the able management of Mr. J. K. Hillers.
Photographic negatives were secured from sittings of Indians representing the fol-
lowing tribes, viz: Sac and Fox, Senecas, Creek, and Cherokee. From these nega-
tives 129 prints were furnished.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications issued during the year are:

(1) Contributions to North American Ethnology, Volume 11, Part 1; The Klamath
Indians of Southeastern Oregon, by Albert Samuel Gatschet, a quarto volume of evi +
711 pages and map. This part includes an ethnographic sketch of the Klamath peo-
ple, texts of the Klamath language, with explanatory notes, and a grammar of the
Klamath language. The second part comprises the Klamath-English and English-
Klamath dictionaries. It was in type at the end of the last fiscal year, but was not
then received from the Public Printer.

(2) Bibliographic notes on Eliot’s Indian Bible and on his other translations and
works in the Indian language of Massachusetts. This is an abstract from a ‘ Biblio-
graphy of the Algonquian Languages,” by James Constantine Pilling, and forms
pages 127-184 of the Algonquian Bibliography to be soonissued. As separately issued
these ‘‘ Notes” constitute a royal octavo pamphlet of 58 separately numbered pages.
Two hundred and fifty copies were printed and issued.

It is with profound pleasure that attention is called to this abstract of the work of
the officers of the Bureau during the term of a single year. By long training, by
great zeal, and by deep scientific insight, these gentlemen are now able to accomplish
results far beyond expectations when the Bureau was originally organized. The
researches in this field have passed beyond the elementary stage, and the significance
of the data being rapidly gathered becomes more and more apparent.

Very respectfully yours,
J. W. POWELL,

Director, Bureau of Ethnology.
Mr. S. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

EXPENSES.

The expenses of the Exchange Bureau are met in part by direct appropriation from
Congress and in part by appropriations made to Government Departments or
Bureaus, either in the contingent funds or in specified terms for repayment to the
Smithsonian Institution of a portion of the cost of transportation. To each of the
Departments or Bureaus sending or receiving publications through the Smithsonian
Institution a charge of 5 cents per pound weight is made under the authority of a
resolution by the Board of Regents in 1878, this charge being necessary, as the ap-
propriation made by Congress directly to the Institution for exchange purposes has
never been sufficient to meet the entire cost of the work. For similar reasons it has
been found necessary to make a charge of the same amount to State institutions, from
which a further small amount has been received.

The direct appropriation by Congress for the year 1890~91 was in the following
terms:

For expenses of the system of International Exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries and compensation of all necessary employés, $17,000.

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian In-
stitution on account of International Exchanges, dated July 1, 1891, for the preced-
ing fiscal year, were as follows:

was $3,371.07, making the sum practically appropriated $20,371.07. Previous reports
have pointed out the desirability of combining in a single item the various appro-
priations for the Exchange service, now divided in comparatively small sums among
several of the large appropriation bills. For the year 1890-91 an estimate for the
entire expense of the service of $29,500* was submitted, this sum being intended to
include these smaller amounts alluded to and also an item of $2,000 to cover the ex-
pense of an immediate exchange of Parliamentary documents with the countries
entering into the treaty of Brussels of 1886, as well as to provide for a proper com-
pensation to several of the larger steamship companies for transportation of freight,
a service now performed without charge. The amount appropriated was $17,000, an
increase of $2,000 over that of the preceding fiscal year.

CORRESPONDENTS.

The name of each correspondent of the Bureau, whether society, institution, or
individual, is entered upon a large card, which shows all packages received at the
Bureau for the person or institution and also the packages sent to the Bureau for
distribution. These cards have now accumulated to the number of 18,848, divided
into foreign societies, foreign individuals, domestic societies, and domestic individ-
uals. The individuals that have died and the societies that have ceased to exist are
still retained for convenience of reference in the same file.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

Under the treaty, the text of which was given in full in Dr. Kidder’s Report on
Exchanges for the year 1887-88, the exchange of the official publications of the
United States Government with the other Governments adhering to the treaty, is
conducted through the Smithsonian Institution Bureau of International Exchanges,

*See report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1890, pages 18and 19.
Al

and this, together with the transmission abroad of the publications of the various
departments or bureaus of the Government, now forms a very large proportion of
the Bureau’s work.

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year, under the provi-
sion of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, was 20,683, and there have been received
in return 8,836 packages or volumes. The United States Government Departments
have forwarded to their correspondents abroad through the Bureau 20,041 packages,
and have received in return 11,764 packages. The total then of the exchanges on
Government account has been 20,600 packages received, and 40,724 sent abroad, a
total of 61,324 packages or 67.75 per cent of the total number handled. This ex-
change on account of the Government Bureaus is shown in detail in the following
table:

* This figure represents fifty sets of the official publications of the United States Government received
from the Public Printer. Forty-three sets are now distributed under the law, and thus the total num-
ber of packages distributed experiences a reduction of 3,369, leaving as a total 61,324 packages.
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Adding the miscellaneous exchanges to the total of Government exchanges, the total
is 90,666 packages. Of this number 61,619 were received for foreign and 29,047 for
domestic distribution.

The Government of Paraguay, the first to carry out the provisions of the treaty of
Brussels for the immediate exchange of parliamentary annals, began at the end of
June, 1890, the regular transmission of the Official Journal and the Gazette of the
Paraguay Congress. Pending the passage by Congress of a bill making special pro-
vision to enable the Institution to carry out this treaty, as the recognized Exchange
Bureau of the United States Government, no return for this exchange has yet been
made. <A bill appropriating $2,000 for the purpose named passed the Senate at the
last session, but failed to reach consideration in the House of Representatives.

It is gratifying to note that on July 25, 1890, announcement was made of the es-
tablishment by the Government of New South Wales of a special board for receiving
and transmitting International Exchange publications. The exchange with that
country has heretofore been effected through the Royal Society of New South Wales.

Notice was also received of the establishment by the Government of Uruguay on
December 10, 1890, of an Exchange Bureau designated as the Oficina de Deposito,
Reparto y Canje Internationales.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

The recommendation for an additional assistant in the shipping room having re-
ceived your approval by the transfer in October, 1891, of Mr. George L. Snider from
the Smithsonian to the exchange roll, it is believed that the exchange work at the
close of the fiscal year was in more satisfactory condition than ever before. Eight
thousand and ninety-four more packages were handled than in the previous year, an
increase of 10.2 per cent, and on June 30, 1891, all that could be disposed of had been
shipped, leaving but 153 packages then on hand.

Packages received from abroad for distribution in the United States are sent out
by registered mail, a record being made of each package showing the sender and the
person or institutionaddressed. As arule, this record can be made, the package can be
rewrapped in stout paper and can be delivered at the post-office on the day, or within
one or two days of its receipt. In some instances where the Bureau is crowded by
the receipt of several thousand Government documents, a little longer delay may
take place.

Books for distribution abroad received from individuals or institutions in the
United States are entered in a similar way and are held until a sufficient number
have accumulated to make a reasonable shipment to any one country. They are
then carefully examined and a list for each country is made up and the volumes
packed and shipped. Where a large number of packages for one country are re-
ceived from any institution they are usually shipped with a delay of from one to four
or five days.

An improvement in foreign transmissions has been made in the Exchange Office
by increasing the frequency of shipments. The number of shipments to each country
and the date of shipment is given in Exhibit A appended, but the great need at
present is a more rapid communication with the principal European countries. This
can only be effected when the appropriation by Congress becomes sufficient to enable
the institution to pay for fast freight. Asitis now, free freight is granted by a
majority of the steamship companies, and where it is necessary to pay for transpor-
tation, the boxes must be sent by slow steamers offering low rates.

Dr. Felix Fliigel in Leipzig, and Messrs. William Wesley & Son, in London, the
foreign agents of the Institution, have paid the same careful attention to its inter-
ests as in former years. I regret to note here the death of the senior member of the
firm of William Wesley & Son, which occurred on April 17, 1891. Ialso have to note
the death of Dr. Felipe Poey on January 28, 1891. Dr. Poey has taken charge of the

offered to continue the work.

srateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation companies
and firms for their continued liberality in granting free freight, or in otherwise
assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while to other firms we
are indebted for greatly reduced rates, in consideration of the disinterested services
of the institution in the diffusion of knowledge.

The system of recording the correspondence of the Bureau adopted on January 1,
1890, has continued to give satisfaction. A further improvement in keeping the
record of packages received has been effected by adopting as a substitute for the
blotter and day book heretofore in use arecord upon separate sheets of paper, which are
subsequently bound up as a day book and upon which a record is made of all packages
received. The packages to or from each institution or individual are then entered
from these sheets upon the ledger cards. The system has the advantages that several
persons can work upon the sheet at the same time, and that no copying of the ree-
ord is required, introducing errors and requiring much time. This form of day-book
sheet was adopted on January 1, 1891. A further duplication of record books is
avoided by having the authorized officer of the Smithsonian Institution, National
Museum, Bureau of Ethnology, U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Fish Commis-
sion acknowledge the receipt of packages addressed to their offices directly upon
these sheets.

A new edition of the list of foreign correspondents of the Bureau is urgently needed
to facilitate current work. The list now in use was printed in 1885, since which
time the list has doubled in number.

REPORT OF THE ACTING MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Smr: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891.

At the opening of the year the land for the park was not yet all acquired. Steps
were taken to expedite the final acquisition as much as possible, yet it was not until
November 4, 1890, that possession was finally obtained of the entire tract.

In the mean time arrangements were made to repair the old Holt mansion, situated
upon the left bank of the creek, in such a manner as to fit it for occupation as an
office for the park. The old building was found to require much more extensive re-
pairs than were anticipated. It is a long, low structure, built rather for coolness
and country retirement than for purposes of business activity; and the walls, al-
though thick, were found to be cracked and crumbling, and the foundations to be
highly insecure. Before anything else could be done several of the walls had to be
replaced and new foundations laid. This consumed the greater part of the appro-
priation and it was only possible to finish two rooms to be occupied as an office. A
small barn with stable was built near the house for the accommodation of the horses
required for the park service.

An inclosure of the park being found imperatively necessary, a design for a fence
was made by Mr. W. R. Emerson and this was erected as fast as the land was finally
acquired by the United States. It is of stout, unpainted, oak palings, intended not
so much to regulate the movements of the public as to keep out dogs and animals
injurious to the creatures in the inclosure.

As a preliminary to the laying out of roads and selecting sites for buildings, Mr. D.
J. Howell was employed to make an accurate topographical survey of the park. The
topographical work of the Coast Survey was used as a basis for this, the contours
being carefully corrected and the highest levels reached by the water in Rock Creek
being noted wherever it was possible to ascertain them,

For reasons of economy it was thought best to lay out for the present but a single
road, which should cross Rock Creek on a continuation of the so-called Quarry road,
which lies mainly outside the gates. This main road within the park was staked out
to a width of 30 feet, and has been carefully graded and macadamized for a distance
of some 3,000 feet from the entrance. Beyond this a road, formerly a cart track,
leads through the park to the western boundary, and has been somewhat improved
for its entire length to afford some partial access for carriages in this direction.

The ‘‘creek,” so called( which it will be remembered is really a quick-running stream),
is ordinarily fordable at a point near that where the road crosses, but this ford is im-
passable in times of flood, and extraordinary precautions had to be taken to secure a
crossing above high-water mark, the narrowness of the stream and the precipitous
character of the surrounding hills which it drains making it necessary to provide
for arise of at least 15 feet. Thusa “fill” of considerable extent was required on
both approaches to the bridge, a condition that greatly increased the expense and
labor of making the road.

Measures were at once taken to erect a bridge suitable for foot passengers and
carriages. Several plans for such astructure were submitted, examined and rejected,

mainly because of the great cost which their execution would entail. A plan pre-
pared by Mr. D. J. Howell was finally selected as being effective for the purpose
required at a minimum of expense. It is a combined iron and wooden structure, 128
feet in length, resting upon two granite piers and two abutments. The plans were
carefully examined, and criticised by skilled experts, and were believed by compe-
tent engineers to be sufficient to withstand any flood likely to occur. At the close
of the fiscal year the piers and abutments had been completed, but the superstruc-
ture was not yet in place.

The quarry near the entrance to the park seemed admirably fitted for the construe-
tion of dens and yards for bears. In order to ascertain its condition, it was cleared
of a great quantity of loose earth and rock which had fallen from the clifts above.
The quarry face was found to be inmost places sufficiently steep to prevent the bears
from climbing it, and where this was not the case the necessary steepness was ob-
tained by blasting. To afford shelter for the bears spacious dens in which shelves
were fashioned were hollowed out from the face of the rock, and in front of these
there was built a strong iron fence 10 feet in height inclosing yards of considerable
extent. The upper ends of the vertical bars of the fence were pointed and turned
inward to prevent the escape of the bears, the floor of the yards was smoothly
cemented, and a large basin,supplied with running water, builtin each. Work upon
these yards has been frequently interrupted by the falling from the slopes of large
quantities of earth and rock. To obviate this Mr, Olmsted, the landscape gardener,
has advised that a retaining wall be built at the top of the cliffs. But, as else-
where stated, the park boundary runs at the upper edge of these cliffs and only a
partial control of the difficulties can be obtained unless the park property is ex-
tended here some yards further back. The system of yards as projected includes
three principal inclosures and a smaller one to be used as a shifting pen. Atan early
day this system will have to be enlarged, as the park has now four species of bears
and one subspecies.

The brow of the first hill overlooking the bridge was selected as a site for a house
for animals requiring heat. The design for this house, furnished by Mr. Emerson,
was somewhat modified to suit the exigencies of the appropriation available, it being
found impracticable to erect more than a portion of the structure. The house is of
stone, 2 handsome gneiss, quarried upon Broad Branch some 24 miles from the park.
Its plan shows a long corridor upon one side of which are arranged the cages for
large animals. Exterior yards and an extension for the accommodation of smaller
animals will be added if funds are appropriated for that purpose. At present the
house is much overcrowded and the animals are not suitably accommodated.

Accommodations for the small herd of bison were early considered. It seemed
desirable to place these animals where they could have considerable range. When
confined even in large yards they cut up the ground so much that they soon destroy
every vestige of grass or other green thing. Still, if the inclosures are too large the
animals keep so far away as not to be seen at all by the public. A site was selected
in a protected locality on a hillside where small paddocks could be made along the
main road and larger yards for grazing grounds could be carried from these down into
the rich bottomland along Rock Creek, where abundance of grass is naturally produced.
Here there was constructed a barn for the buffalo, which is a novel and picturesque
structure of black-oak logs admirably harmonizing with the location. The appro-
priation was so limited that if was found necessary to place the elk also in this barn,
and paddocks for them were accordingly built adjoining it. Inexpensive but strong
fences for these paddocks were made of iron rods running horizontally through
rough cedar posts and coupled together at the ends. Some difficulty has been found
with the elk fence which has not stood the continuous battering given it by the
males during the rutting season as well as was expected. The original plan of ex-
tending the paddocks to the bottom land of the creek will shortly be carried out.

Paddocks for the deer and antelope have been constructed on the left bank of the

ereek along the eastern boundary of the park. This situation is admirably adapted
by nature for the animals, but has the disadvantage of exposing them to the sight
of dogs both on the outside of the park and within it, Three animals have been so
frightened as to lose their lives from this cause, and it will be necessary to make the
fence so tight as to entirely prevent the sight of dogs and probably it will be advisa-
ble to exclude them from this part of the park altogether.

The unexpected gift of an Asiatic elephant by Mr. James E. Cooper made it neces-
sary to hastily prepare a barn. This is a temporary structure, but will be so fitted
as to serve for shelter during the winter. It was prepared for but one animal, but
by Mr, Cooper’s generosity a second elephant was lent to the park, and the two
have been made comfortable within it. The situation of this barn is not wholly sat-
isfactory. Atthe time it was built it was thought desirable to place it at aconsidera-
ble distance from the boundaries of the park in view of the possibility of the ani-
mals becoming unmanageable, ‘These apprehensions were fortunately not well-
founded, and it would be much more convenient to have the elephants nearer the
stream so that they could frequently have immediate access to the water. If funds
for the erection of a permanent elephant house should become available this matter
will no doubt be considered, The expense of the maintenance of the elephants is very
ereat, and it should be remembered that the estimate for the last year’s expenditure

ras made without the knowledge that it would be necessary to meet so heavy an
item as the cost of erecting a special building and providing keepers and provisions
for these two animals.

As acolony of prairie dogs had been for some time a feature of the collection, it
became necessary to provide suitable accommodations for them. Although a broad
open meadow would best resemble their natural habitat it was thought best to
place them in a little thicket of trees to the west of the main drive. Here there was
built an inclosing wall 34 feet high, and from the footing of this, galvanized iron
mesh-work was placed in a trench 8 feet deep. This has been found sufficient to
completely confine them. It is believed that this iron net will not corrode when
buried so deeply in the ground. If this proves successful for a series of years it
will be a great advantage, as it has usually been thought in Zoological Gardens
necessary to excayate completely the inclosures for burrowing animals and to ce-
ment the bottom. This is very expensive, and the result is that but few colonies of
burrowing animals are seen. It is hoped to add several colonies of this nature, in-
eluding some of the most characteristic American rodents.

A list of the accessions to the park during the year is given herewith. (Exhibit
A.) Many of them could not be accommodated in the houses already erected and
have been assigned to quarters more or less temporary or to small cages scattered
along the main road. Many more animals could have been procured had it been
possible to suitably accommodate them. The most important accession is the Asiatic
elephant “Dunk,” which was presented to the park on April 30, 1891, by Mr.
James E. Cooper, the proprietor of the Adam Forepaugh shows. The elephant is
a fine animal, about 25 years of age, very docile and tractable, and a very valuable
addition to the collection. Mr. Cooper not only gave this elephant, but in order
to insure success in keeping him loaned another, “ Golddust,” to serves a a com-
panion, it being well known that solitary elephants suffer greatly from loneliness.

When commissioners were sent to South America to collect material forthe World’s
Columbian Exposition of 1893 it was thoughtfully suggested by Mr. W. E. Curtis,
chief of the Latin-American Bureau of the State Department, that they might be
also willing to collect animals for the park. Authority was therefore given them to
incur expenditures not to exceed $300 for each person, and several accessions have
been made by this means. The experiment has not, however, proved as satisfactory
as could be wished, as the animals sent are usually badly cared for on shipboard.

Several animals have been born in the park during the year, the most noteworthy
being a young female bison. It is believed that these animals will breed freely in
confinement and that by this means the species may be keptindefinitely perpetuated.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Bat

The mortality during the year has been considerable. A great proportion of the
animals that have died have succumbed immediately after arrival, either being in
bad condition from injury or otherwise, when shipped, or being too delicate to stand
transportation. ‘Those who send specimens to the park should always take care to
keep the animals in confinement for some time before shipping and should ask for
directions as to the proper method of boxing. Many animals are killed by being
sent in an improper manner and by being either starved or provided with improper
food. The animals received from South America have been very frequently mori-
bund when received. Thisis partly due to the customs regulations at New York City,
which cause considerable delay in the reshipment of animals to this city.

The beautiful specimen of the big horn sheep (Ovis montana) succumbed to an at-
tack of apoplexy, while the animals were still confined in the contracted yards in
the rear of the Smithsonian Institution. A post-mortem examination showed the
animal to be in an excellent physical condition, and it is believed that lack of
exercise was the principal cause of the disorder that terminated its existence. As
far as can be judged from this case there appears to be no reason whatever why this
sheep, so rare in zoological collections, should not thrive in captivity if a suitable
range of rocks and cliffs such as is found in the National Zoological Park is given
to it.

The close of the year finds the work of the park progressing steadily and as rap-
idly as the funds appropriated by Congress will admit. The interest of the public
is found to be very great, much more in fact than had been anticipated. There can
be no doubt that in the course of a few years the park will become one of the chief
attractions of a city already famous for its sights, offering as it does a combination
entirely unique, exquisitely beautiful natural scenery with the charming aspects of
varied animal life.

It has already been noticed that the one roadway is too narrow for the accommoda-
ion of the large number of carriages that frequent the park on Sundays, the throngs
between the hours of 3 and 5 p. m. being so great as to endanger visitors, and it it
earnestly desired to extend the system of roads in accordance with a plan already
laid ont. The bridge, from necessary economy, was restricted to a width just suffi-
cient to allow carriages to pass, no footway being provided. In view of the throng
already referred to, this offers another source of danger, and it is contemplated build-
ing footways on projecting brackets along either side of the bridge should funds be
appropriated for the purpose, Either this or a bridge for foot passengers alone will
be absolutely essential, :

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1891.

Sir: I have the honor respectfully to submit my report on the work of the library
during the year from July 1, 1890, to June 30, 1891. _

The work of recording and caring for the accessions has been carried on as during
the preceding year, the entry numbers on the accession book running from 207,176
to 225,585.

The following condensed statement shows the character and number of these acces-
sions:

Publications received between July 1, 1890, and June 30, 1891.

Of these publications, 7,720 (namely, 424 volumes, 6,415 parts of volumes, and
883 pamphlets) were retained for use in the National Museum, and 754 medical dis-
sertations were deposited in the library of the Surgeon-General, U.S. Army. The
remainder were promptly sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday following
their receipt.

In carrying out the Secretary’s plan of increasing the library by exchanges, 1,327
letters asking for new exchanges, or calling attention to deficiencies in series already
in the library, were written; and im response 475 new exchanges were acquired
by the Institution, and 248 defective series were completed, either wholly or as far
as the publishers were able to supply the missing parts. The value of this under-
taking is well shown by the large increase of the actual accessions in comparison
with those of the last fiscal year. In 1889-’90 the total number of accessions was
20,187; in 1890-91 it was 27,294, showing a gain of 7,107 over 1889-’90.

APPENDIX V.

REPORT ON PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1891.
SMITHSONIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the publications of the
Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1891:

Although no addition has been made during the year to the series of ‘‘ Contribu-
tions to Knowledge,” one issue has been made in a similar quarto form, consisting of
a collection of botanical plates which had been prepared under the direction of the
late Dr. Asa Gray between the years 1849 and 1859, now some forty years ago. This
fragmentary series of 23 colored plates was designed as a portion of an extended illus-
trated work on “ The Forest Trees of North America.” In the Secretary’s report to
the Regents for 1849 it was stated:

“Tt is intended in this work to give figures from original drawings of the flowers,
leaves, fruit, etc., of each principal species in the United States proper, for the most
part of the size of nature, and so executed as to furnish colored or uncolored copies,
the first being intended to give an adequate idea of the species, and the second for
greater cheapness and more general diffusion. This work will be completed in three
parts, in octavo, with an atlas of quarto plates, the first part to be published next
spring. A portion of this will be occupied with an introductory dissertation giving
the present state of our knowledge (divested as much as possible of all unnecessary
technical terms), of the anatomy, morphology, and physiology of the tree, tracing
its growth from the embryo to its full development and reproduction in the forma-
tion of fruit and seed. This will be illustrated by drawings from original dissections,
under the microscope, and sketches made in every instance from nature.”

The illustrations, so far as furnished, were skillfully drawn by Sprague, and were
reproduced on stone by Sonrel, Prestele, and others; the impressions being care-
fully colored by hand. In consequence of various unforeseen hindrances and delays
this interesting work, unfortunately, was never completed by its eminent projector ;
and no descriptive text was ever received from him, even of the plates which had
been finished under his direction.

Notwithstanding the time which has elapsed since their original preparation and
the comparatively limited range of their represention, it was thought advisable that
they should be issued for the benefit of botanists, who will undoubtedly be inter-
ested in this unfinished work of their great leader and exponent, even without the
advantage of his descriptive comments.

‘ The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; occasional reports of the investigations
made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general charac-
ter or on special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the
purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly
to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers not published in
the Smithsonian Contributions or in the Miscellaneous Collections as
may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi-
nent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor-
ology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zodlogy, and anthropol-
ogy. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satisfac-
torily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889, a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1591.

CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.*

By WILLIAM HUGGINS, F. R. 8.

In 1866, I had the honor of bringing before this Association, at one of
the evening lectures, an account of the first fruits of the novel and un-
expected advances in our knowledge of the celestial bodies which fol-
lowed rapidly upon Kirchhoff’s original work on the solar spectrum
and the interpretation of its lines.

Since that time a great harvest has been gathered in the same field
by many reapers. Spectroscopic astronomy has become a distinct and
acknowledged branch of the science, possessing a large literature of
its own, and observatories specially devoted toit. The more recent dis-
covery of the gelatine dry plate has given a further greatimpetus to this
modern side of astronomy and has opened a pathway into the unknown
of which even an enthusiast thirty years ago would scarcely have dared
to dream.

In no science, perhaps, does the sober statement of the results which
have been achieved appeal so strongly to the imagination and make
so evident the almost boundless powers of the mind of man. By
means of its light alone to analyze the chemical nature of a far-distant
body; to be able to reason about its present state in relation to the
past and future; to measure within an English mile or less per second
the otherwise invisible motion which it may have towards or from us;
to do more, to make even that which is darkness to our eyes light, and
from vibrations which our organs of sight are powerless to perceive
to evolve a revelation in which we see mirrored some of the stages
through which the stars may pass in their slow evolutional progress—
surely the record of such achievements, however poor the form of
words in which they may be described, is worthy to be regarded as the
scientific epic of the present century.

Spectroscopic methods.—I do not purpose to attempt a survey of the
progress of spectroscopic astronomy from its birth at Heidelberg in 1859,
but to point out what we do know at present, as distinguished from what

we do not know, of a few only of its more important problems, giving a
prominent place, in accordance with the traditions of this chair, to the
work of the last year or two.

In the spectroscope itself advances have been made by Lord Ray-
leigh by his discussion of the theory of the instrument and by Prof.
Rowland in the construction of concave gratings.

Lord Rayleigh has shown that there is not the necessary connection,
sometimes supposed, between dispersion and resolving power, as be-
sides the prism or grating other details of construction and of adjust-
ment of a spectroscope must be taken into account.

The resolving power of the prismatic spectroscope is proportional to
the length of path in the dispersive medium. For the heavy flint glass
used in Lord Rayleigh’s experiments, the thickness necessary to resolve
the sodium lines came out 1-02 centimeters. If this be taken as a unit,
the resolving power of a prism of similar glass will be (in the neighbor-
hood of the sodium lines) equal to the number of centimeters of its
thickness. In other parts of the spectrum the resolving power will
vary inversely as the third power of the wave length, so that it will be
eight times as great in the violet as in the red. The resolving power
of a spectroscope is therefore proportional to the total thickness of the
dispersive material in use, irrespective of the number, the angles, or
the setting of the separate prisms into which, for the sake of conven-
ience, it may be distributed.

The resolving power of a grating depends upon the total number of
lines on its surface and the order of spectrum in use, about 1,000 lines
being necessary to resolve the sodium lines in the first spectrum.

As it is often of importance in the record of observations to state
the efficiency of the spectroscope with which they were made, Prof.
Schuster has proposed the use of a unit of purity as well as of resolv-
ing power, for the full resolving power of a spectroscope is realized
in practice only when a sufficiently narrow slit is used. The unit of
purity also is to stand for the separation of two lines differing by one-
thousandth of their own wave length, about the separation of the
sodium pair at D.

A further limitation may come in from the physiological fact that,
as Lord Rayleigh has pointed out, the eye, when its full aperture is
used, is not a perfect instrument. If we wish to realize the full resolv-
ing power of a spectroscope, therefore, the emergent beam must not be
larger than about one-third of the opening of the pupil.

Up to the present time the standard of reference for nearly all spec-
troscopic work continues to be Angstrém’s map of the solar spectrum
and his scale based upon his original determinations of absolute wave
length. It is well known, as was pointed out by Thalén in his work
on the spectrum of iron, in 1884, that Angstrém’s figures are slightly
too small, in consequence of an error existing in a standard meter used
by him. The corrections for this have been introduced into the tables
of the wave lengths of terrestrial spectra collected and revised by a
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. rail

committee of this Association from 1885 to 1887. Last year the com-
mittee added a table of corrections to Rowland’s scale.

The inconvenience caused by a change of standard scale is, for a
time at least, considerable; but there is little doubt that in the near
future Rowland’s photographie map of the solar spectrum and his
scale based on the determinations of absolute wave length by Pierce
and Bell, or the Potsdam scale, based on original determinations by
Miiller and Kempf, which differs very slightly from it, will come to be
excltisively adopted.

The great accuracy of Rowland’s photographic map is due chiefly to
the introduction by him of concave gratings and of a method for their
use by which the problem of the determination of relative wave lengths
is simplified to measures of coincidences of the lines in different spectra
by a micrometer.

The concave grating and its peculiar mounting, in which no lenses
or telescope are needed, and in which all the spectra are in focus
together, formed a new departure of great importance in the measure:
ment of spectral lines. The valuable method of photographie sensi-
tizers for different parts of the spectrum has enabled Prof. Rowland to
include in his map the whole visible solar spectrum, as well as the
ultra-violet portion as far as it can get through our atmosphere. Some
recent photographs of the solar spectrum, which include A, by Mr.
George Higgs, are of great technical beauty.

During the past year the results of three independent researches
have appeared, in which the special object of the observers has been
to distinguish the lines which are due to our atmosphere from those
which are truly solar—the maps of M. Thollon, which, owing to his
lamented death just before their final completion, have assumed the
character of a memorial of him; maps by Dr. Becker; and sets of pho-
tographs of a high and a low sun by Mr. McClean.

At the meeting of this association in Bath, M. Janssen gave an ac-
count of his own researches on the terrestrial lines of the solar spec:
trum which owe their origin to the oxygen of our atmosphere. He
discovered the remarkable fact that, while one class of bands varies as
the density of the gas, other diffuse bands vary as the square of the
density. These observations are in accordance with the work of Ego-
roft and of Olszewski, and of Liveing and Dewar on condensed oxy-
gen. In some recent experiments Olszewski, with a layer of liquid
oxygen 30 millimeters thick, saw, as well as four other bands, the band
coincident with Fraunhofer’s A; a remarkable instance of the persist-
ence of absorption through a great range of temperature. The light
which passed through the liquid oxygen had a light blue color resem-
bling that of the sky. :

Of not less interest are the experiments of Knut Angstrém, which
show that the carbonic acid and aqueous vapour of the atmosphere
reveal their presence by dark bands in the invisible infra-red region,
at the positions of bands of emission of these substances.
( CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

Spectroscopic conditions.—It is now some thirty years since the spec-
troscope gave us for the first time certain knowledge of the nature of
the heavenly bodies, and revealed the fundamental fact that terrestrial
matter is not peculiar to the solar system, but is common to all the
stars which are visible to us.

In the case of a star such as Capella, which has a spectrum almost
identical with that of the sun, we feel justified in concluding that the
matter of which it is built up is similar, and that its temperature is
also high, and not very different from the solar temperature. The task
of analyzing the stars and nebulie becomes however one of very great
difficulty when we have to do with spectra differing from the solar type.
We are thrown back upon the laboratory for the information necessary
to enable us to interpret the indications of the spectroscope as to the
chemical nature, the density and pressure, and the temperature of the
celestial masses.

What the spectroscope immediately reveals to us are the waves
which were set up in the ether filling all inter-stellar space, years or
hundreds of years ago, by the motions of the molecules of the celestial
substances. As a rule,it is only when a body is gaseous and sufficiently
hot that the motions within its molecules can produce bright lines and
a corresponding absorption. The spectra of the heavenly bodies are
indeed, to a great extent absorption spectra, but we have usually to
study them through the corresponding emission spectra of bodies
brought into the gaseous form and rendered luminous by means of
flames or of electric discharges. In both cases, unfortunately, as has
peen shown recently by Profs. Liveing and Dewar, Wiillner, E. Wiede-
mann and others, there appears to be no certain direct relation be-
tween the luminous radiation as shown in the spectroscope and the
temperature of the flame, or of the gaseous contents of the vacuum
tube—that is, in the usual sense of the term as applied to the mean
motion of all the molecules. In both cases, the vibratory motions with-
in the molecules to which their luminosity is due are almost always
much greater than would be produced by encounters of molecules hav-
ing motions of translation no greater than the average motions which
characterize the temperature of the gases as a whole. The tempera-
ture of a vacuum tube through which an electric discharge is taking
place may be low, as shown by a thermometer, quite apart from the
consideration of the extreme smallness of the mass of gas, but the
vibrations of the luminous molecules must be violent in whatever way
we suppose them to be set up by the discharge; if we take Schuster’s
view that comparatively few molecules are carrying the discharge, and
that it is to the fierce encounters of these alone that the luminosity is
due, then if all the molecules had similar motions, the temperature of
the gas would be very high.

Soin flames where chemical changes are in progress, the vibratory
motions of the molecules which are luminous may be, in connection with
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 73

the energy set free in these changes, very different from those corre-
sponding to the mean temperature of the tlame.

Under the ordinary conditions of terrestrial experiments, therefore,
the temperature or the mean vis viva of the molecules may have no di-
rect relation to the total radiation, which, on the other hand, is the
sum of the radiation due to each Iuminous molecule.

These phenomena have recently been discussed by Ebert from the
standpoint of the electro-magnetic theory of light.

Very great caution is therefore called for when we attempt to reason
by the aid of laboratory experiments tothe temperature of the heavenly
bodies from their radiation, especially on the reasonable assumption
that in them the luminosity isnot ordinarily associated with chemical
changes or with electrical discharges; but is due to a simple glowing
from the ultimate conversion of the gravitational energy of shrinkage
into molecular motion.

In a recent paper Stas maintains that electric spectra are to be re-
garded as distinct from flame spectra; and from researches of his own,
that the pairs of lines of the sodium spectrum other than D are pro-
duced only by disruptive electric discharges. As these pairs of lines
are found reversed in the solar spectrum, he concludes that the sun’s
radiation is due mainly to electric discharges. But Wolf and Diacon,
and later, Watts, observed the other pairs of lines of the sodium spec-
trum when the vapor was raised above the ordinary temperature of
the Bunsen flame. Recently, Liveing and Dewar saw easily, besides
D, the citron and green pairs, and sometimes the blue pair and the
orange pair, when hydrogen charged with sodium vapor was burning
at different pressures inoxygen. In the case of sodium vapor, there-
fore, and presumably in all other vapors and gases, it is a matter of
indifference whether the necessary vibratory motion of the molecules is
produced by electric discharges or by flames. The presence of lines in
the solar spectrum which we can only produce electrically, is an indica-
tion, however, as Stas points out, of the high temperature of the sun.

We must not forget that the light from the heavenly bodies may con-
sist of the combined radiations of differentlayers of gas at different tem-
peratures, and possibly be further complicated to an unknown extent
by the absorption of cooler portions of gas outside.

Not less caution is needed if we endeavor to argue from the broaden-
ing of lines and the coming in of a continuous spectrum as to the rela-
tive pressure of the gas ia the celestial atmospheres. On the one hand,
it can not be gainsaid that in the laboratory the widening of the lines
in a Pliicker’s tube follows upon increasing the density of the residue
of hydrogen in the tube, when the vibrations are more frequently dis-
turbed by fresh encounters, and that a broadening of the sodium lines
in a flame at ordinary pressure is produced by an increase of the quan-
tity of sodium in the flame; but it is doubtful if pressure, as distin-
guished from quantity, does produce an increase of the breadth of the
74. CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

lines. An individual molecule of sodium will be sensibly in the same
condition, considering the relatively enormous number of the molecules
of the other gases, whether the flame is scantily or copiously fed with
the sodium salt. With a small quantity of sodium vapor the intensity
will be feeble except near the maximum of the lines; when, however,
the quantity is increased, the comparative transparency on the sides of
the maximum will allow the light from the additional molecules met
with in the path of the visual ray to strengthen the radiation of the
molecules farther back, and so increase the breadth of the lines.

In a gaseous mixture it is found, as a rule, that at the same presstire
or temperature, as the encounters with similar molecules become fewer,
the spectral lines will be affected as if the body were observed under
conditions of reduced quantity or temperature.

In their recent investigation of the spectroscopic behavior of flames
under various pressures up to forty atmospheres, Profs. Living and
Dewar have come to the conclusion that though the prominent feature
of the light emitted by flames at high pressure appears to be a strong
continuous spectrum, there is not the slightest indication that this con-
tinuous spectrum is produced by the broadening of the lines of the same
gases at low pressure. On the contrary, photometric observations of
the brightness of the continuous spectrum, as the pressure is varied,
show that it is mainly produced by the mutual action of the molecules
of a gas. Experiments on the sodium spectrum were carried up to a
pressure of forty atmospheres without producing any definite effect on
the width of the lines which could be ascribed to the pressure. In a
similar way the lines of the spectrum of water showed no signs of ex-
pansion up to twelve atmospheres; though more intense than at ordi-
nary pressure, they remained narrow and clearly defined.

It follows therefore that a continuous spectrum can not be considered,
when taken alone, as a sure indication of matter in the liquid or the
solid state. Not only, as in the experiments already mentioned, such
a spectrum may be due to gas when under pressure, but, as Maxwell
pointed out, if the thickness of a medium, such as sodium yapor, which
radiates and absorbs different kinds of light, be very great, and the
temperature high, the light emitted will be of exactly the same composi-
tion as that emitted by lamp-black at the same temperature, for the
radiations which are feebly emitted will be also feebly absorbed and
can reach the surface from immense depths. Schuster has shown that
oxygen, even in a partially exhausted tube, can give a continuous spec-
trum when excited by a feeble electric discharge.

Compound bodies are usually distinguished by a banded spectrum;
but, on the other hand, such a spectrum does not necessarily show the’
presence of compounds—thatis, of molecules containing different kinds
of atoms—but simply of a more complex molecule, which may be made |
up of similar atoms, and be, therefore, an allotropic condition of the
same body. In some cases—for example, in the diffuse bands of the,
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 5

absorption spectrum of oxygen—the bands may have an intensity pro-
portional to the square of the density of the gas, and may be due either
to the formation of more complex molecules of the gas with increase of
pressure or, it may be, to the constraint to which the molecules are sub-
ject during their encounter with one another.

It may be thought that atleast in the coincidences of bright lines we
are on the selid ground of certainty, since the length of the waves set
up in the «ther by a molecule, say of hydrogen, is the most fixed and
absolutely permanent quantity in nature, and is so of physical necessity,
for with any alteration the molecule would cease to be hydrogen.

Such would be the case if the coincidence were certain; but an abso-
lute coincidence can be only a matter of greater or less probability,
depending on the resolving power employed, on the number of the lines
which correspond, and on their characters. When the coincidences are
very numerous, as in the case of iron and the solar spectrum, or the
lines are characteristically grouped, as in the case of hydrogen and the
solar spectrum, we may regard the coincidence as certain; but the
progress of science has been greatly retarded by resting important con-
clusions upon the apparent coincidence of single lines in spectroscopes
of very small resolving power. In such cases, unless other reasons
supporting the coincidence are present, the probability of areal coinci-
dence is almost too small to be of any importance, especially in the case
of a heavenly body which may havea motion of approach or of recession
of unknown amount.

But even here we are met by the confusion introduced by multiple
spectra, corresponding to different molecular groupings of the same
substance and, further, to the influence of substances in vapor upon
each other; for when several gases are present together the phenomena
of radiation and reversal by absorption are by no means the same as
if the gases were free from each other’s influence, and especially is this
the case when they are illuminated by an electric discharge.

I have said as much as time will permit and I think indeed suffi-
cient to show that it is only by the laborious and slow process of most
cautious observation that the foundations of the science of celestial
physics can be surely laid. We are at present in a time of transition,
when the earlier and, in the nature of things, less precise observations
are giving place to work of an order of accuracy much greater than

yas formerly considered attainable with objects of such small bright-
ness as the stars.

The aceuracy of the earlier determinations of the spectra of the ter-
restrial elements is in most cases insufficient for modern work on the
stars as well as on the sun. It falls much below the scale adopted in
Rowland’s map of the sun, as wellas below the degree of accuracy at-
tained at Potsdam by photography in a part of the spectrum for the
brighter stars. Increase of resolving power very frequently breaks up
into groups, in the spectra of the sun and stars, the lines which had
76 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

been regarded as single, and their supposed coincidence with terrestrial
lines falls to the ground. For this reason many of the early conclusions
based on observation as good as it was possible to make at the time
with the less powerful spectroscopes then in use, may not be found to be
maintained under the much greater resolving power of modern instru-
ments.

Spectroscopic Problems.—The spectroscope has failed as yet to inter-
pret for us the remarkable spectrum of the aurora borealis. Undoubt-
edly in this phenomenon portions of our atmosphere are lighted up by
electric discharges; we should expect, therefore, to recognize the spectra
of the gases known to be present in it. As yet we have not been able
to obtain similar spectra from these gases artificially, and especially we
do not know the origin of the principal line in the green, which often
appears alone, and may have, therefore, an origin independent of that of
the other lines. Recently the suggestion has been made that the aurora
is a phenomenon produced by the dust of meteors and falling stars, and
that near positions of certain auroral lines or flutings of manganese,
lead, barium, thallium, iron, etc., are sufficient to justify us in regarding
meteoric dust in the atmosphere as the origin of the auroral spectrum.
Liveing and Dewar have made a conclusive research on this point, by
availing themselves of the dust of excessive minuteness thrown off
from the surface of the electrodes of various metals and meteorites by
a disruptive discharge, and carried forward into the tube of observa-
tion by a more or less rapid current of air or other gas. These experi-
ments prove that metallic dust, however fine, suspended in a gas will
not act like gaseous matter in becoming luminous with its character-
istic spectrum in an electric discharge similar to that of the aurora.
Prof. Schuster has suggested that the principal line may be due to some
very light gas which is present in too small a proportion to be detected
by chemical analysis or even by the spectroscope in the presence of
the other gases near the earth, but which, at the height of the auroral
discharges is in a sufficiently greater relative proportion to give a
spectrum. Lemstrém, indeed, states that he saw this line in the silent
discharge of a Holtz machine on a mountain in Lapland. The lines
may not have been obtained in our laboratories from the atmospheric
gases on account of the difficulty of re-producing in tubes with sufficient
nearness the conditions under which the auroral discharges take place.

Tn the spectra of comets the spectroscope has shown the presence of
earbon presumably in combination with hydrogen, and also sometimes
with nitrogen; and in the case of comets approaching very near the sun,
the lines of sodium, and other lines which have been supposed to belong
to iron. Though the researches of Prof. H. A. Newton and of Prof.
Schiaparelli leave no doubt of the close connection of comets with
corresponding periodic meteor swarms, and therefore of the probable
identity of cometary matter with that of meteorites, with which the spec-
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. U7

troscopic evidence agrees, it would be perhaps unwise at present to at-
tempt to define too precisely the exact condition of the matter which
forms the nucleus of the comet. In any ease the part of the light of
the comet which is not reflected solar light can scarcely be attributed
toa high temperature produced by the clashing of separate meteoric
stones set up within the nucleus by the sun’s disturbing force. We
must look rather to disruptive electric discharges, produced probably
by processes of evaporation due to increased solar heat, which would
be amply sufficient to set free portions of the occluded gases into the
vacuum of space. May it be that these discharges are assisted, and
indeed possibly increased, by the recently-discovered action of the
ultra-violet part of the sun’s light? Lenard and Wolfe have shown
that ultra-violet light can produce a discharge from a negatively elec-
trified piece of metal, while Hallwachs and Righi have shown further
that ultra-violet light can even charge positively an unelectrified piece
of metal. Similar actions on cometary matter, unscreened as it is by an
absorptive atmosphere, at least of any noticeable extent, may well be
powerful when a comet approaches the sun, and help to explain an
electrified condition of the evaporated matter which would possibly
bring it under the sun’s repulsive action. We shall have to return to
this point in speaking of the solar corona.

A very great advance has been made in our knowledge of the con-
stitution of the sun by the recent work at the Johns Hopkins University
by means of photography and concave gratings, in comparing the solar
spectrum, under great resolving power, directly with the spectra of the
terrestrial elements. Prof. Rowland has shown that the lines of thirty-
six terrestrial elements at least are certainly present in the solar spec-
trum, while eight others are doubtful, Fifteen elements, including ni-
trogen, as it shows itself under an electric discharge in a vacuum tube,
have not been found in the solar spectrum. Some ten other elements,
inclusive of oxygen, have not yet been compared with the sun’s spec-
trum.

Rowland remarks that of the fifteen elements named as not found in
the sun, many are so classed because they have few strong lines, or
none at all, in the limit of the solar spectrum as compared by him with
the are. Boron has only two strong lines. The lines of bismuth are
compound and too diffuse. Therefore even in the case of these fifteen
elements there is little evidence that they are really absent from the
sun.

It follows that if the whole earth were heated to the temperature of
the sun, its spectrum would resemble very closely the solar spectrum.

Rowland has not found any lines common to several elements, and
in the case of some accidental coincidences, more accurate investiga-
tion reveals some slight difference of wave-length or a common im-
purity. Further, the relative strength of the lines in the solar spec-
trum is generally, with a few exceptions, the same as that in the elec-
18 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

tric arc, so that Rowland considers that his experiments show ‘“ very
little evidence” of the breaking up of the terrestrial elements in the
sun.

Stas in a recent paper gives the final results of eleven years of re-
search on the chemical elements in a state of purity, and on the possi-
bility of decomposing them by the physical and chemical forces at our
disposal. His experiments on calcium, strontium, lithium, magnesiun,
silver, sodium, and thallium, show that these substances retain their
individuality under all conditions, and are unalterable by any forces
that we can bring to bear upon them.

Prof. Rowland looks to the solar lines which are unaccounted for as
a means of enabling him to discover such new terrestrial elements as
Still lurk in rare minerals and earths, by confronting their spectra
directly with that of the sun. He has already resolved yttrium spee-
troscopically into three components, and actually into two. The com-
parison of the results of this independent analytical method with the
remarkable but different conclusions to which M. Lecog de Boisbaudran
and Mr. Crookes have been led respectively, from spectroscopic obser
vation of these bodies when glowing under molecular bombardment in
a vacuum tube, will be awaited with much interest. It is worthy of
remark that, as our knowledge of the spectrum of hydrogen in its com-
plete form came to us from the stars, it is now from the sun that chem-
istry is probably about to be enriched by the discovery of new elements.

In a discussion in the Bakerian Lecture for 1885, of what we knew
up to that time of the sun’s corona, [ was led to the conclusion that the
corona is essentially a phenomenon similar in the cause of its formation
to the tails of comets—namely, that it consists for the most part prob-
ably of matter going from the sun under the action of a force, possibly
electrical, which varies as the surface, and can therefore in the case of
highly attenuated matter easily master the force of gravity even near
the sun. Though many of the coronal particles may return to the sun,
those which form the long rays or streamers do not return; they sepa-
rate and soon become too diffused to be any longer visible, and may
well go to furnish the matter of the zodiacal light, which otherwise has
not received a satisfactory explanation. And further, if such a force
exist at the sun, the changes of terrestrial magnetism may be due to
direct electric action, as the earth moves ‘through lines of inductive
force.

These conclusions appear to be in accordance broadly with the lines
along which thought has been directed by the results of subsequent
eclipses. Prof. Schuster takes an essentially similar view, and suggests
that there may be a direct electric connection between the sun and the
planets. He asks further whether the sun may not act like a magnet
in consequence of its revolution about its axis. Prof. Bigelow has re-
cently treated the coronal forms by the theory of spherical harmonics,
on the supposition that we see phenomena similar to those of free elec-

CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY, 79

tricity, the rays being lines of force, and the coronal matter discharged
from the sun, or at least arranged or controlled by these forces. At
the extremities of the streams for some reasons the repulsive power may
be lost, and gravitation set in, bringing the matter back to the sun.
The matter which does leave the sun is persistently transported to the
equatorial plane of the corona; in fact, the zodiacal light may be the
accumulation at great distances from the sun along this equator of such
like material. Photographs on a larger scale will be desirable for the
full development of the conclusions which may follow from this study
of the curved forms of the coronal structure. Prof. Schaeberle, how-
ever, considers that the coronal phenomena may be satisfactorily ac-
counted for on the supposition that the corona is formed of streams of
matter ejected mainly from the spot zones with great initial velocities,
but smaller than 382 miles per second. Further, that the different types
of the corona are due to the effects of perspective on the streams, from
the earth’s place at the time relatively to the plane of the solar equator.

Of the physical and the chemical nature of the coronal matter we
know very little. Schuster concludes, from an examination of the
eclipses of 1582, 1883, and 1886, that the continuous spectrum of the
corona has the maximum of actinic intensity displaced considerably
towards the red when compared with the spectrum of the sun, which
shows that it can only be due in small part to solar light scattered by
small particles. The lines of calcium and of hydrogen do not appear to
form part of the normal spectrum of the corona. The green coronal
line has no known representative in terrestrial substances, nor has
Schuster been able to recognize any of our elements in the other lines
of the corona.

Stellar evolution.—The spectra of the stars are almost infinitely
(liversified, yet they can be arranged with some exceptions in a series
in which the adjacent spectra, especially in the photographic region,
are scarcely distinguishable, passing from the bluish-white stars like
Sirius, through stars more or less solar in character, to stars with
banded spectra, which divide themselves into two apparently inde-
pendent groups, according as the stronger edge of the bands is towards
the red or the blue. Insuch an arrangement the sun’s place is towards
the middle of the series.

At present a difference of opinion exists as to the direction in the
series in which evolution is proceeding, whether by further condensa-
tion white stars pass into the orange and red stages, or whether these
more colored stars are younger and will become white by increasing
age. The latter view was suggested by Johnstone Stoney in 1867.

About ten years ago Ritter in a series of papers discussed the behav-
lor of gaseous masses during condensation, and the probable resulting
constitution of the heavenly bodies. According to him, a star passes
through the orange and red stages twice, first during a comparatively
80 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

short period of increasing temperature, which culminates in the white
stage, and a second time during a more prolonged stage of gradual
cooling. He suggested that the two groups of banded stars may cor-
respond to these different periods, the young stars being those in which
the stronger edge of the dark band is towards the blue, the other banded
stars, which are relatively less luminous and few in number, being those
which are approaching extinction through age.

Recently a similar evolutional order has been suggested, which is
based upon the hypothesis that the nebule and stars consist of collid-
ing meteoric stones in different stages of condensation.

More recently the view has been put forward that the diversified
spectra of the stars do not represent the stages of an evolutional
progress, but are due for the most part to differences of original con-
stitution.

The few minutes which can be given to this part of the address are
insufficient for a discussion of these different views. I purpose, there-
fore, to state briefly, and with reserve, as the subject is obscure, some of
the considerations from the characters of their spectra which appeared
to me to be in favor of the evolutional order in which I arranged the
stars from their photographie spectra in 1879. This order is essentially
the same as Vogel had previously proposed in his classification of the
stars in 1874, in which the white stars, which are most numerous,
represent the early adult and most persistent stage of stellar life; the
solar condition that of full maturity and of commencing age; while in
the orange and red stars with banded spectra we see the setting in and
advance of old age. But this statement must be taken broadly, and
not as asserting that all stars, however different in mass and possibly
to some small extent in original constitution, exhibit one invariable suc-
cession of spectra.

In the spectra of the white stars the dark metallic lines are relatively
inconspicuous, and occasionally absent, at the same time that the dark
lines of hydrogen are usually strong, and more or less broad, upon a
continuous spectrum, which is remarkable for its brilliancy at the blue
end. In some of these stars the hydrogen and some other lines are
bright, and sometimes variable.

As the greater or less prominence of the hydrogen lines, dark or
bright, is characteristic of the white stars as a class, and diminishes
gradually with the incoming and increase in strength of the other
lines, we are probably justified in regarding it as due to some condi-
tions which occur naturally during the progress of stellar life, and not
to a peculiarity of original constitution.

To produce a strong absorption-spectrum a substance must be at the
particular temperature at which it is notably absorptive; and further,
this temperature must be sufficiently below that of the region behind
from which the light comes for the gas to appear, so far as its special
rays are concerned, as darkness upon it. Considering the high tem-
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 81

perature to which hydrogen must be raised before it can show its char-
acteristic emission and absorption, we shall probably be right inattribu-
ting the relative feebleness or absence of the other lines, not to the
paucity of the metallic vapors, but rather to their being so hot relatively
to the substances behind them as to show feebly, if at all, by reversion.
Such a state of things would more probably be found, it seems to me,
in conditions anterior to the solar stage. A considerable cooling of the
sun would probably give rise to banded spectra due to compounds, or
to more complex molecules, which might form near the condensing
points of the vapors.

The sun and stars are generally regarded as consisting of glowing
vapors surrounded by a photosphere where condensation is taking
place, the temperature of the photospheric layer from which the greater
part of the radiation comes being constantly renewed from the hotter
matter within.

At the surface the convection currents would be strong, producing a
considerable commotion, by which the different gases would be mixed
and tot allowed to retain the inequality of proportions at different
levels due to their vapor densities.

Now the conditions of the radiating photosphere and those of the
gases above it, on which the character of the spectrum of a star depends,
will be determined, not alone by temperature, but also by the force of
gravity in these regions; this force will be fixed by the star’s mass and
its stage of condensation, and will become greater as the star continues
to condense.

In the case of the sun the force of gravity has already become so
great at the surface that the decrease of the density of the gases must
be extremely rapid, passing in the space of a few miles from atmos-
pherie pressure to a density infinitesimally small; consequently the
temperature-gradient at the surface, if determined solely by expansion,
must be extremely rapid. The gases here however are exposed to the
fierce radiation of the sun, and unless wholly transparent would take
up heat, especially if any solid or liquid particles were present from
condensation or convection currents.

From these causes, within a very small extent of space at the surface
of the sun, all bodies with which we are acquainted should fall to a con-
dition in which the extremely tenuous gas could no longer give a vis-
ible spectrum. The insignificance of the angle subtended by this space
as seen from the earth should cause the boundary of the solar atmos-
phere to appear defined. If the boundary which we see be that of the
sun proper, the matter above it will have to be regarded as in an essen-
tially dynamical condition—an assemblage, so to speak, of gaseous pro-
jectiles, for the most part falling back upon the sun after a greater or
less range of flight. But in any case it is within a space of’ relatively
small extent in the sun, and probably in the other solar stars, that the

82 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

reversion which is manifested by dark lines is to beregarded as taking
place.

Passing backward in the stav’s life, we should find a gradual weak-
ening of gravity at the surface, a reduction of the temperature-gradi-
et so far as it was determined by expansion, and convection currents
of less violence producing less interference with the proportional quan-
tities of gases due to their vapor densities, while the effects of erup-
tions would be more extensive.

At last we might come to a state of things in which, if the star were
hot enough, only hydrogen might be sufficiently cool relatively to
the radiation behind to produce a strong absorption. The lower vapors
would be protected, and might continue to be relatively too hot for
their lines to appear very dark upon the continuous spectrum; besides,
their lines might be possibly to some extent effaced by the coming in
under such conditions in tho vapors themselves of a continuous spec-
trum.

In such a star the light radiated towards the upper part ef the atmos-
phere may have come from portions lower down of the atmosphere
itself, or at least from parts not greatly hotter. There may be no such
great difference of temperature of the low and less low portions of the
star’s atmosphere as to make the darkening effect of absorption of the
protected metallic vapors to prevail over the illuminating effect of
their emission.

It is only by a vibratory motion corresponding to a very high tem-
perature that the bright lines of the first spectrum of hydrogen can be
brought out, and by the equivalence of absorbing and emitting power
that the corresponding spectrum of absorption should be produced;
yet for a strong absorption to show itself, the hydrogen must be cool
relatively to the source of radiation behind it, whether this be con-
densed particles or gas. Such conditions, it seems to me, should oc-
cur in the earlier rather than in the more advanced stages of conden-
sation.

The subject is obscure, and we may go wrong in our mode of con-
ceiving of the probable progress of events, but there can be no doubt
that in one remarkable instance the white-star spectrum is associated
with an early stage of condensation.

Sirius is one of the most conspicuous examples of one type of this
class of stars. Photometric observations combined with its ascertained
parallax show that this star emits from forty to sixty times the light
of our sun, even to the eye, which is insensible to ultra-violet light, in
which Sirius is very rich, while we learn from the motion of its com-
panion that its mass is not much more than double that of our sun.
It follows that, unless we attribute to this star an improbably great
emissive power, if must be of immense size, and in a much more diffuse
and therefore an earlier condition than our sun; though probably at

a later stage than those white stars in which the hydrogen lines are
bright,
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 83

A direct determination of the relative temperature of the photo-
spheres of the stars might possibly be obtained in some cases from
the relative position of maximum radiation of their continuous spectra.
Langley has shown that through the whole range of temperature on
which we can experiment, and presumably at temperatures beyond, the
maximum of radiation power in solid bodies gradually shifts upwards
in the spectrum from the infra-red through the red and orange, and
that in the sun it has reached the blue.

The defined character, as a rule, of the stellar lines of absorption
suggests that the vapors producing them do not at the same time
exert any strong power of general absorption. Consequently, we
should probably not go far wrong, when the photosphere consists of
liquid or solid particles, if we could compare select parts of the con-
tinuous spectrum between the stronger lines, or where they are fewest.
It is obvious that, if extended portions of different stellar spectra
were compared, their true relation would be obscured by the line-
absorption.

The increase of temperature, as shown by the rise in the spectrum of
the maximum of radiation, may not always be accompanied by a cor-
responding greater brightness of a star as estimated by the eye, which
isan extremely imperfect photometric instrument. Not only is the eye
blind to large regions of radiation, but even for the small range of light
that we can see the visual effect varies enormously with its color. Ac-
cording to Prof. Langley, the same amount of energy which just enables
us to perceive light in the crimson at A would in the green produce a
visual effect 100,000 times greater. In the violet the proportional effect
would be 1,600, in the blue 62,000, in the yellow 28,000, in the orange
14,000, and in the red 1,200. Capt. Abney’s recent experiments make the
sensitiveness of the eye for the green near F to be 750 times greater than
for thered about C. Itis for this reason, at least in part, that I suggested
in 1864, and have since shown by direct observation, that the spectrum of
the nebula in Andromeda, and presumably of similar nebule, is in ap-
pearance only wanting in the red.

The stage at which the maximum radiation is in the green, correspond-
ing to the eye’s greatest sensitiveness, would be that in which it could
be most favorably measured by eye photometry. As the maximum rose
into the violet and beyond, the star would increase in visual brightness,
but not in proportion to the increase of energy radiated by it.

The brightness of a star would be affected by the nature of the sub-
Stance by which the light was chiefly emitted. In the laboratory solid
carbon exhibits the highest emissive power. A stellar stage in which
radiation comes, to a large extent, from a photosphere of the solid par-
ticles of this substance would be favorable for great brilliancy. Though
the stars are built up of matter essentially similar to that of the sun, it
does not follow that the proportion of the different elements is every-
where the same, It may be that the substances condensed in the pho-
84 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

tospheres of different stars may differ in their emissive powers, but prob-
ably not to a great extent.

All the heavenly bodies are seen by us through the tinted medium of
our atmosphere. According to Langley the solar stage of stars is not
really yellow, but, even as gauged by our imperfect eyes, would appear
bluish-white if we could free ourselves from the deceptive influences of
our surroundings.

From these considerations it follows that we can scarcely infer the
evolutional stages of the stars from a simple comparison of their eye
magnitudes. We should expect the white stars to be, as a class, less
dense than the stars in the solar stage. As great mass might bring in
the solar type of spectrum at a relatively earlier time, some of the
brightest of these stars may be very massive, and brighter than the
sun—for example, the brilliant star Arcturus. For these reasons the
solar stars should not only be denser than the white stars, but per-
haps, as a Class, Surpass them in mass and eye brightness.

It has been shown by Lane that, so long as a condensing gaseous
mass remains subject to the laws of a purely gaseous body its tempera-
ture will continue to rise.

The greater or less breadth of the lines of absorption of hydrogen in
the white stars may be due to variations of the depth of the hydrogen
in the line of sight, arising from the causes which have been discussed.
At the sides of the lines the absorption and emission are feebler than
in the middle, and would come out more strongly with a greater thick-
ness of gas.

The diversities among the white stars are nearly as numerous as the
individuals of the class. Time does not permit me to do more than
to record that, in addition to the three sub-classes into which they have
been divided by Vogel, Scheiner has recently investigated minor differ-
ences aS suggested by the character of the third line of hydrogen near
G. He has pointed out, too, that so far as his observations go the
white stars in the constellation of Orion stand alone, with the exception
of Algol, in possessing a dark line in the blue which has apparently
the same position as a bright line in the great nebula of the same con-
stellation; and Pickering finds in his photographs of the spectra of
these stars dark lines corresponding to the principal lines of the bright-
line stars, and the planetary nebule with the exception of the chief
nebular line. The association of white stars with nebular matter in
Orion, in the Pleiades, in the region of the Milky Way, and in other
parts of the heavens, may be regarded as falling in with the view that
I have taken.

In the stars possibly farther removed from the white class than our
sun, belonging to the first division of Vogel’s third class, which are
distinguished by absorption bands with their stronger edge toward
the blue, the hydrogen tines are narrower than in the solar spectrum,
In these stars the density gradient is probably still more rapid, the
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 85

depth of hydrogen may be less, and possibly the hydrogen molecules
may be affected by a larger number of encounters with dissimilar mole-
cules. In some red stars with dark hydro-carbon bands, the hydrogen
lines have not been certainly observed; if they are really absent it may
be because the temperature has fallen below the point at which hydrogen
can exert its characteristic absorption; besides, some hydrogen will
have united with the carbon. The coming in of the hydro-carbon bands
may indicate a later evolutional stage, but the temperature may still
be high, as acetylene can exist in the electric are.

A number of small stars more or less similar to those which are
known by the names of their discoverers, Wolf and Rayet, have been
found by Pickering in his photographs. These are remarkable for sev-
eral brilliant groups of bright lines, including frequently the hydrogen
lines and the line D;, upon a continuous spectrum strong in blue and
violet rays, in which are also dark lines of absorption. As some of the
bright groups appear in his photographs to agree in position with cor-
responding bright lines in the planetary nebule, Pickering suggests
that these stars should be placed in one class with them, but the bright-
est nebular line is absent from these stars. The simplest conception of
their nature would be that each star is surrounded by a nebula, the
bright groups being due to the gaseous matter outside the star. Mr.
Roberts however has not heen able to bring out any indication of
nebulosity by prolonged exposure. The remarkable star 7 Argiis may
belong to this class of the heavenly bodies.

Gaseous Nebule.—M the nebule the elder Herschel saw portions of
the fiery mist or “ shining fluid ” out of which the heavens and the earth
had been slowly fashioned. For a time this view of the nebule gave
place to that which regarded them as external galaxies, cosmical “ sand
heaps,” too remote to be resolved into separate stars; though indeed, in
1858, Mr. Herbert Spencer showed that the observations of nebulze up
to that time were really in favor of an evolutional progress.

In 1864, I brought the spectroscope to bear upon them; the bright
lines which flashed upon the eye showed the source of the light to be
glowing gas, and so restored these bodies to what is probably their
true place, as an early stage of sidereal life.

At that early time our knowledge of stellar spectra was small. For
this reason partly, and probably also under the undue influence of the-
ological opinions then widely prevalent, I unwisely wrote in my orig-
inal paper in 1864, ‘“‘ that in these objects we no longer have to do with
a special modification of our own type of sun, but find ourselves in
presence of objects possessing a distinct and peculiar plan of structure.”
Two years later, however, in a lecture before this Association, I took a
truer position. ‘Our views of the universe,” I said, ‘“ are undergoing
important changes; let us wait for more facts, with minds unfettered
by any dogmatic theory, and therefore free to receive the teaching,
whatever it may be, of new observations.”
86 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

Let us turn aside for a moment from the nebule in the sky to the
conclusions to which philosophers had been irresistibly led by a con-
sideration of the features of the solar system. We have before us in
the sun and planets obviously not a haphazard aggregation of bodies,
but a system resting upon a multitude of relations pointing to a com-
mon physical cause. From these considerations Kant and Laplace
formulated the nebular hypothesis, resting it on gravitation alone, for
at that time the science of the conservation of energy was practically
unknown. These philosophers showed how, on the supposition that
the space now occupied by the solar system was once filled by a vapor-
ous mass, the formation of the sun and planets could be reasonably ac-
counted tor.

By a totally different method of reasoning, modern science traces
the solar system backward step by step to a simlar state of things at
the beginning. According to Helmholtz, the sun’s heat is maintained
by the contraction of his mass, at the rate of about 220 feet a year.
Whether at the present time the sun is getting hotter or colder we do
not certainly know. We can reason back to the time the sun was suffi-
ciently expanded to fill the whole space occupied by the solar system,
and was reduced to a great glowing nebula. Though man’s life, the
life of the race perhaps, is too short to give us direct evidence of any
distinct stages of so august a process, still the probability is great that
the nebular hypothesis, especially in the more precise form given to it
by Roche, does represent broadly, notwithstanding some difficulties,
the succession of events through which thesun and planets have passed.

The nebular hypothesis of Laplace requires a rotating mass of fluid
which at successive epochs became unstable from excess of motion, and
left behind rings, or more probably perhaps lumps, of matter from the
equatorial regions.

The difficulties to which I have referred have suggested to some
thinkers a different view of things, according to which it is not neces-
sary to suppose that one part of the system gravitationally supports
another. The whole may consist of a congeries of discrete bodies even
if these bodies be the ultimate molecules of matter. The planets may
have been formed by the gradual accretion of such discrete bodies. On
the view that the material of the condensing solar system consisted of
Separate particles or masses, we have no longer the fluid pressure
which is an essential part of Laplace’s theory. Faye, in his theory of
evolution from meteorites, has to throw over this fundamental idea of
the nebular hypothesis, and he formulates instead a different succes-
sion of events, in which the outer planets were formed last ; a theory
which has difficulties of its own.

Prof. George Darwin has recently shown, from an investigation of
the mechanical conditions of a swarm of meteorites, that on certain
assumptions a meteoric swarm might behave as a coarse gas, and in
this way bring back the fluid pressure exercised by one part of the
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY, 87

system on thé other, which is required by Laplace’s theory. One chief
assumption consists in supposing that such inelastic bodies as meteoric
stones might attain the effective elasticity of a high order which is
necessary to the theory through the sudden volatilization of a part of
their mass at an encounter, by which what is virtually a violent explo-
sive is introduced between the two colliding stones. Prof. Darwin is
careful to point oat that it must necessarily be obscure as to how a
sinall mass of solid matter can take up a very largé amount of energy
i a small fraction of a second.

Any direct indications from the heavens themselves, however slight,
are of so great value that I should, perhaps, in this connection call at-
tention to a recent remarkable photograph, by Mr. Roberts, of the
great nebula in Andromeda. On this plate we seem to have presented
to us some stage of cosinical evolution on a gigantic scale. The photo-
graph shows a sort of whirlpool disturbance of the luminous matter
which is distributed in a plane inclined to the line of sight, in which a
series of rings of bright matter separated by dark spaces, greatly fore-
shortened by perspective, surround a large, undefined central mass.
We are ignorant of the parallax of this nebula, but there can be little
doubt that we are looking upona system very remote, and therefore of
a magnitude great beyond our power of adequate comprehension. The
matter of this nebula, in whatever state it may be, appears to be dis-
tributed, as in so many other nebulie, in rings or spiral streams, and to
suggest a stage in a succession of evolutional events not inconsistent
with that which the nebular hypothesis requires. To liken this object
more directly to any particular stage in the formation of the solar sys-
tem would be “to compare things great with small,” and might be in-
deed to introduce a false analogy; but, on the other hand, we should
err through an excess of caution if we did not accept the remarkable
features brought to light by this photograph as a presumptive indica-
tion of a progress of events in cosmical history following broadly upon
the lines of Laplace’s theory.

The old view of the original matter of the nebulw, that it consisted

fell at once with the rise of the science of thermodynamics. In 1854
Helmholtz showed that the supposition of an original fiery condition
of the nebulous stuff was unnecessary, since in the mutual gravitation
of widely separated matter we have a store of potential energy sufii-
cient to generate the high temperature of the sun and stars. We can
scarcely go wrong in attributing the light of the nebulz to the conver-
sion of the gravitational energy of shrinkage into molecular motion.
The idea that the light of comets and of nebula may be due to a suc-
cession of ignited flashes of gas from the encounters of meteoric stones
88 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

was suggested by Prof. Tait, and was brought to the notice of this As-
sociation in 1871 by Sir William Thomson in his presidential address,

The spectrum of the bright-line nebul is certainly not such a spee-
trum as we should expect from the flashing by collisions of meteorites
similar to those which have been analyzed in our laboratories. The
strongest lines of the substances which in the case of such meteorites
would first show themselves, iron, sodium, magnesium, nickel, ete., are
not those which distinguish the nebular spectrum. On the contrary,
this spectrum is chiefly remarkable for a few brilliant lines, very nar-
row and defined, upon a background of a faint continuous spectrum,
which contains numerous bright lines, and probably some lines of ab-
sorption.

The two most conspicuous lines have not been interpreted; for
though the second line falls near, it is not coincident with a strong
double line of iron. It is hardly necessary to say that though the near
position of the brightest line to the bright double line of nitrogen, as
seen in a small spectroscope in 1864, naturally suggested at that early
time the possibility of the presence of this element in the nebule, I
have been careful to point out, to prevent misapprehension, that in
more recent years the nitrogen line and subsequently a lead line have
been employed by me solely as fiducial points of reference in the spec-
trum.

The third line we know to be the second line of the first spectrum of
hydrogen. Mr. Keeler has seen the first hydrogen line in the red, and
photographs show that this hydrogen spectrum is probably present in
its complete form, or nearly so, as we first learnt to know it in the ab-
sorption spectrum of the white stars.

We are not surprised to find associated with it the line D,, near the
position of the absent sodium lines, probably due to the atom of some
unknown gas, which in the sun can only show itself in the outbursts
of highest temperature, and for this reason does not reveal itself by
absorption in the solar spectrum.

It is not unreasonable to assume that the two brightest lines, which
are of the same order, are produced by substances of a similar nature,
in which a vibratory motion corresponding to a very high temperature
is also necessary. These substances, as well as that represented by
the line D3, may be possibly some of the unknown elements which are
wanting in our terrestrial chemistry between hydrogen and lithium,
unless indeed D, be on the lighter side of hydrogen.

In the laboratory we must have recourse to the electric discharge to
bring out the spectrum of hydrogen; but in a vacuum tube, though
the radiation may be great, from the relative fewness of the luminous
atoms or molecules or from some other cause, the temperature of the
gas as a whole may be low.

On account of the large extent of the nebule, a comparatively smal
number of luminous molecules or atoms would probably be sufficient
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 89

to make the nebulae as bright as they appear to us. On such an
assumption the average temperature may be low, but the individual
particles, which by their encounters are luminous, must have motions
corresponding to a very high temperature, and in this sense be
extremely hot.

In such diffuse masses, from the great mean length of free path, the
encounters would be rare but correspondingly violent, and tend to bring
about vibrations of comparatively short period, as appears to be the
case if we may judge by the great relative brightness of the more refran-
gible lines of the nebular spectrum.

Such a view may, perhaps, reconcile the high temperature, which the
nebular spectrum undoubtedly suggests, with the much lower mean
temperature of the gaseous mass which we should expect at so early a
stage of condensation, unless we assume a very enormous mass, or that
the matter coming together had previously considerable motion or con-
siderable molecular agitation.

The inquisitiveness of the human mind does not allow us to remain
content with the interpretation of the present state of the cosmical
masses, but suggests the question—

What see’st thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?

What was the original state of things? how has it come about that by
the side of aging worlds we have nebule in a relatively younger stage?
Have any of them received their birth from dark suns, which have col-
lided into new life, and so belong to a second or later generation of the
heavenly bodies?

During the short historic period, indeed, there is no record of such an
event; still it would seem to be only through the collision of dark suns,
of which the number must be increasing, that a temporary rejuve-
nescence of the heavens is possible, and by such ebbings and flowings
of stellar life that the inevitable end to which evolution in its appar-
ently uncompensated progress is carrying us can, even for a little, be
delayed.

We can not refuse to admit as possible such an origin for nebule.

In considering, however, the formation of the existing nebulwe we
must bear in mind that, in the part of the heavens within our ken, the
stars still in the early and middle stages of evolution exceed greatly in
number those which appear to be in an advanced condition of condens-
ation. Indeed, we find some stars which may be regarded as not far
advanced beyond the nebular condition.

It may be that the cosmical bodies which are still nebulous owe their
later development to some conditions of the part of space where they
occur, such as, conceivably, a greater original homogeneity, in conse-
quence of which condensation began lessearly. In other parts of space
condensation may have been still further delayed, or even havenot yet
9() CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

begun. It is worthy of remark that these nebule group themselves
about the Milky Way, where we find a preponderance of the white-star
type of stars, and almost exclusively the bright-line stars which Pick-
ering associates with the planetary nebule. Further, Dr. Gill con-
cludes, from the rapidity with which they impress themselves upon the
plate, that the fainter stars of the Milky Way also, to a large extent,
belong to this early type of stars. At the same time other types of
stars occur also over this region, and the red hydrocarbon stars are
found in certain parts; but possibly these stars may be before or behind
the Milky Way, and not physically connected with it.

If light matter be suggested by the spectrum of these nebul, it
may be asked further, as a pure specwation, whether in them we are
witnessing possibly a later condensation of the light matter which had
been left behind, at least in a relatively greater proportion, after the
first growth of worlds into which the heavier matter condensed, though
not without some entanglement of the lighter substances. The wide
extent and great diffuseness of this bright-line nebulosity over a large
part of the constellation of Orion may be regarded perhaps as _ point-
ing in this direction. The diffuse nebulous matter streaming round the
Pleiades may possibly be another instance, though the character of its
spectrum has not yet been ascertained.

In the planetary nebulie, as a rule, there is a sensible increase of the
faint continuous spectrum, as well as a slight thickening of the bright
lines toward the center of the nebula, appearances which are in favor
of the view that these bodies are condensing gaseous masses.

Prof. G. Darwin, in his investigation of the equilibrium of a rotating
mass of fluid, found, in accordance with the independent researches of
Poincaré, that when a portion of the central body becomes detached
through increasing angular velocity, the portion should bear a far larger
ratio to the remainder than is observed in the planets and satellites of
the solar system, even taking into account heterogeneity from the con-
densation of the parent mass.

Now this state of things, in which the masses though not equal are
of the same order, does seem to prevail in many nebule, and to have
given birth to a large class of binary stars. Mr. See has recently in-
vestigated the evolution of bodies of this class, and points out their
radical differences from the solar system in the relatively large mass-
ratios of the component bodies, as well as in the high eccentricities of
their orbits, brought about by tidal friction, which would play a more
important part in the evolution of such systems.

Considering the large number of these bodies, he suggests that the
solar system should perhaps no longer be regarded as representing
celestial evolution in its normal form—

A goodly Paterne to whose perfect mould
He fashioned them - - - —

but rather as modified by conditions which are exceptional.
j CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 91

It may well be that in the very early stages condensing masses are
subject to very different conditions, and that condensation may not al-

- ways begin at one or two centers, but sometimes set in at a large num-

ber of points, and proceed in the different cases along very different
lines of evolution.

Invisible Motions revealed by the Spectroscope.—Besides its more direct
use in the chemical analysis of the heavenly bodies, the spectroscope
has given to us a great and unexpected power of advance along the
lines of the older astronomy. In the future a higher value may indeed
be placed upon this indirect use of the spectroscope than upon its
chemical revelations.

By no direct astronomical methods could motions of approach or of
recession of the stars be even detected, much less could they be meas-
ured. A body coming directly toward us or going directly from us ap-
pears to stand still. In the case of the stars we can receive no assist-
ance from change of size or of brightness. The stars show no true
disks in our instruments, and the nearest of them is so far off that if it
were approaching us at the rate of a hundred miles in a second of time,
a whole century of such rapid approach would not do more than increase
its brightness by the one-fortieth part.

Still it was only too clear that so long as we were unable to ascer-
tain directly those components of the stars’ motions which lie in the
line of sight, the speed and direction of the solar motion in space, and
many of the great problems of the constitution of the heavens, must
remain more or less imperfectly known. Now the spectroscope has
placed in our hands this power, which, though so essential, appeared
almost in the nature of things to lie forever beyond our grasp; it
enables us to measure directly, and under favorable circumstances to
within a mile per second, or even less, the speed of approach or of re-
cession of a heavenly body. This method of observation has the great
advantage for the astronomer of being independent of the distance of
the moving body, and is therefore as applicable and as certain in the
case of a body on the extreme confines of the visible universe (so long
as it is bright enough), as in the case of a neighboring planet.

Doppler had suggested as far back as 1841, that the same principle
on which he had shown that a sound should become sharper or flatter
if there were an approach or a recession between the ear and the source
of the sound, would apply equally to light; and he went on to say that
the difference of color of some of the binary stars might be produced
in this way by their motions. Doppler was right in that the principle
is true in the case of light, but he was wrong in the particular con-
clusion which he drew from it. Even if we suppose a star to be mov-
ing with a sufficiently enormous velocity to alter sensibly its color to
the eye, no such change would actually be seen, for the reason that
the store of invisible light beyond both limits of the visible spectruim,
92 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

the blue and the red, would be drawn upon, and light-waves invisible
to us would be exalted or degraded so as to take the place of those
raised or lowered in the visible region, and the color of the star would
remain unchanged. About eight years later, Fizeau pointed out the
importance of considering the individual wave-lengths of which white
light is composed. As soon however as we had learned to recognize
the lines of known substances in the spectra of the heavenly bodies,
Doppler’s principle became applicable as the basis of a new and most
fruitful method of investigation. The measurement of the small shift
of the celestial lines from their true positions, as shown by the same
lines in the spectrum of a terrestrial substance, gives to us the means
of ascertaining directly in miles per second the speed of approach or
of recession of the heavenly body from which the light has come.

An account of the first application of this method of research to the
stars, which was made in my observatory in 1868, was given by Sir
Gabriel Stokes from this chair at the meeting at Exeter in 1869. The
stellar motions determined by me were shortly after-confirmed by Prof.
Vogel in the case of Sirius, and in the case of other stars by Mr.
Christie, now astronomer-royal, at Greenwich; but, necessarily, in
consequence of the inadequacy of the instruments then in use for so
delicate an inquiry, the amounts of these motions were but approximate.

The method was shortly afterwards taken up systematically at Green-
wich and at the Rugby Observatory. It 1s to be greatly regretted that,
for some reasons, the results have not been sufficiently accordant and
accurate for a research of such exceptional delicacy. On this account
probably, as well as that the spectroscope at that early time had
scarcely become a familiar instrument in the observatory, astronomers
were slow in availing themselves of this new and remarkable power of
investigation. That this comparative neglect of so truly wonderful a
method of ascertaining what was otherwise outside our powers of ob-
servation has greatly retarded the progress of astronomy during the
last fifteen years, is but too clearly shown by the brilliant results which
within the last couple of years have followed fast upon the recent mas-
terly application of this method by photography at Potsdam, and by
eye with the needful accuracy at the Lick Observatory. At last this
use of the spectroscope has taken its true place as one of the most
potent methods of astronomical research. It gives us the motions of
approach and of recession, not in angular measures, which depend for
their translation into actual velocities upon separate determinations of
parallactic displacements, but at once in terrestrial units of distance.

This method of work will doubtless be very prominent in the astron-
omy of the near future, and to it probably we shall have to look for the
more important discoveries in sideral astronomy which will be made
during the coming century.

In his recent application of photography to this method of determin-
ing celestial motions, Prof. Vogel, assisted by Dr. Scheiner, consider-
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 93

ing the importance of obtaining the spectrum of as many stars as pos-
sible on an extended scale without an exposure inconveniently long,
wisely determined to limit the part of the spectrum on the plate to the
region for which the ordinary silver-bromide gelatine plates are most
sensitive,—namely, to a small distance on each side of G,—and to em-
ploy as the line of comparison the hydrogen line near G, and recently
also certain lines of iron. The most minute and complete mechanical
arrangements were provided for the purpose of securing the absolute
rigidity of the comparison spectrum relatively to that of the star, and
for permitting temperature adjustments and other necessary ones to be
made.

The perfection of these spectra is shown by the large number of lines,
no fewer that two hundred and fifty in the case of Capella, within the
small region of the spectrum on the plate. Already the motions of
about fifty stars have been measured with an accuracy, in the case of
the larger number of them, of about an English mile per second.

At the Lick Observatory it has been shown that observations can be
made directly by eye with an accuracy equally great. Mr. Keeler’s
brilliant success has followed in great measure from the use of the third
and fourth spectra of a grating 14,438 lines to the inch. The marvel-
lous accuracy attainable in his hands on a suitable star is shown by
observations on three nights of the star Arcturus, the largest diverg-
ence of his measures being not greater than six-tenths of a mile per
second, while the mean of the three nights’ work agreed with the mean
of five photographic determinations of the same star at Potsdam to
within one-tenth of an English mile. These are determinations of the
motions of a sun so stupendously remote that even the method of
parallax practically fails to fathom the depth of intervening space, and
by means of light-waves which have been, according to Elkin’s nominal
parallax, nearly two hundred years upon their journey.

Mr. Keeler, with his magnificent means, has accomplished a task
which J attempted in vain in 1874, with the comparatively poor appli-
ances at my disposal, of measuring the motions in the line of sight of some
of the planetary nebule. As the stars have considerable motions in
space, it was to be expected that nebulie should possess similar motions,
for the stellar motions must have belonged to the nebul out of which
they have been evolved. My instrumental means, limiting my power
of detection to motions greater than 25 miles per second, were insufti-
cient. Mr. Keeler has found in the examination of ten nebule motions
varying from 2 miles to 27 miles, with one exceptional motion of nearly
40 miles.

For the nebula of Orion, Mr. Keeler finds a motion of recession of
about 10 miles a second. Now, this motion agrees closely with what it
should appear to have from the drift of the solar system itself, so far
as it has been possible at present to ascertain the probable velocity of
the sun in space, This grand nebula, of vast extent and of extreme

94 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

tenuity, is pobably more nearly at rest relatively to the stars of our
system than any other celestial object we know; still it would seem
more likely that even here we have some motion, small though it may
he, than that the motions of the matter of which it is formed were so
absolutely balanced as to leave this nebula in the unique position of
absolute immobility in the midst of whirling and drifting suns and sys-
tems of suns.

The spectroscopic method of determining celestial motions in the line
of sight has recently become fruitful in a new but not altogether unfore-
seen direction, for it has, so to speak, given us a separating power far
beyond that of any telescope the glassmaker and the optician could
construct, and so enabled us to penetrate into mysteries hidden in stars
apparently single, and altogether unsuspected of being binary systems.
The spectroscope has not simply added to the list of the known binary
stars, but has given to us for the first time a knowledge of a new class
of stellar systems, in which the components are in some cases of nearly
equal magnitude, and in close proximity, and are revolving with veloci-
ties greatly exceeding the planetary velocities of our system.

The K line in the photographs of Mizar, taken at the Harvard Col-
lege Observatory, was found to be double at intervals of fifty-two days.
The spectrum was therefore not due to a single source of light, but to
the combined effect of two stars moving periodically in opposite diree-
tions in the lineof sight. It is obvious that if two stars revolve round
their common centre of gravity in a plane not perpendicular to the line
of sight, all the lines in a spectrum common to the two stars will appear
alternately single or double.

In the case of Mizar and the other stars to be mentioned, the spec-
troscopic observations are not as yet extended enough to furnish more
than an approximate determination of the elements of their orbits.

Mizar especially, on account of its relatively long period—about
ove hundred and five days—needs further observations. The two stars
are moving each with a velocity of about 50 miles a second, probably in
elliptical orbits, and are about 143,000,000 miles apart. The stars, of
about equal brightness, have together a mass about forty times as great
as that of our sun.

A similar doubling of the lines showed itself in the Harvard photo-
graphs of 6 Aurige at the remarkably close interval of almost exactly
two days, indicating a period of revolution of about four days. Accord-
ing to Vogel’s later observations, each star has a velocity of nearly 70
miles a second, the distance between the stars being little more than
7,900,000 miles, and the mass of the system 4.7 times that of the sun.
The system is approaching us at the speed of about 16 miles a second.

The telescope could never have revealed to us double stars of this
order. In the case of 6 Aurige, combining Vogel’s distance with
Pritchard’s recent determination of the star’s parallax, the greatest
angular separation of the stars as seen from the earth would be one
Ss

CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 95

two-hundredth part of a second of arc, and therefore very far too small
for the highest powers of the largest telescopes. If we take the rela-
tion of aperture to separating power usually accepted, an object glass
of about 80 feet in diameter would be needed to resolve this binary star.
The spectroscope, which takes no note of distance, magnifies, so to
speak, this minute angular separation 4,000 times; in other words, the
doubling of the lines, which is the phenomenon that we have to observe,
amounts to the easily measurable quantity of 20 seconds of are.

There were known, indeed, variable stars of short period, which it
had been suggested might be explained on the hypothesis of a dark
body revolving about a bright sun in a few days, but this theory was
met by the objection that no such systems of closely revolving suns
were known to exist.

The Harvard photographs of which we have been speaking were
taken with a slitless form of spectroscope, the prisms being placed, as
originally by Fraunhofer, before the object glass of the telescope. This
method, though it possesses some advantages, has the serious draw-
back of not permitting a direct comparison of the star’s spectrum with
terrestrial spectra. It is obviously unsuited to a variable star like
Algol, where one star only is bright, for in such a case there would be
no doubling of the lines, but-only a small shift to and fro of the lines
of the bright star as it moved in its orbit alternately toward and from
our system, which would need for its detection the fiducial positions of
terrestrial lines compared directly with them.

For such observations the Potsdam spectograph was well adapted.
Prof. Vogel found that the bright star of Algol did pulsate backwards
and forwards in the visual direction in a period corresponding to the
known variation of its light. The explanation which had been sug-
gested for the star’s variability, that it was partially eclipsed at regu-
lar intervals of 68.8 hours by a dark companion large enough to cut off
nearly five-sixths of its light, was therefore the true one. The dark
companion, no longer able to hide itself by its obscureness, was brought
out into the light of direct observations by means of its gravitational
effects.

Seventeen hours before minimum, Algol is receding at the rate of
about 244 miles a second, while seventeen hours after minimum it is
found to be approaching with a speed of about 284 miles. From these
data, together with those of the variation of its light, Vogel found, on
the assumption that both stars have the same density, that the com-
panion, nearly as large as the sun, but with about one-fourth his mass,
revolves with a velocity of about 55 miles a second. The bright star,
of about twice the size and mass, moves about the common center of
gravity with the speed of about 26 miles a second. The system of the
two stars, which are about 5,250,000 of miles apart, considered as a
whole, is approaching us with a velocity of 2.4 miles a second. The
great difference in luminosity of the two stars, not less than fifty times,
96 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

suggests rather that they are in different stages of condensation, and
dissimilar in density.

It is obvious that if the orbit of a star with an obscure companion is
inclined to the line of sight, the companion will pass above or below
the bright star, and produce no variation of its light. Such systems
may be numerous in the heavens. In Vogel’s photographs, Spica, which
is not variable, by a small shifting of its lines reveals a backward and
forward periodical pulsation due to orbital motion. As the pair whirl
round their common center of gravity, the bright star is sometimes ad-
vancing, at others receding. They revolve in about four days, each
star moving with a velocity of about 56 miles a second in an orbit prob-
ably nearly circular, and possess a combined mass of rather more than
two and a half times that of the sun. Taking the most probable value
for the star’s parallax, the greatest angular separation of the stars
would be far too small to be detected with the most powerful telescopes.

If in a close double star the fainter companion is of the white-star
type, while the bright star is solar in character, the composite spectrum
would be solar with the hydrogen lines unusually strong. Such aspec-
trum would in itself afford some probability of a double origin, and
suggest the existence of a companion star.

In the case of a true binary star the orbital motions of the pair would
reveal themselves in a small periodical swaying of the hydrogen lines
relatively to the solar ones.

Prof. Pickering considers that his photographs show ten stars with
composite spectra; of these, five are known to be double. The others
are: 7 Persei, € Aurigw, dO Sagittarii, 31 Ceti, and @Capricorni. Per-
haps (6 Lyre should be added to this list.

In his recent classical work on the rotation of the sun, Dunér has not
only determined the solar rotation for the equator but for different par-
allels of latitude up to 75°. The close accordance of his results shows
that these observations are sufficiently accurate to be discussed with
the variation of the solar rotation for different latitudes which had
been determined by the older astronomical methods from the observa-
tions of the solar spots.

Spectroscopic Photography.—Though I have already spoken. inci-
dentally of the invaluable aid which is furnished by photography in
some of the applications of the spectroscope to the heavenly bodies,
the new power which modern photography has put into the hands of
the astronomer is so great, and has led already, within the last few
years, to new acquisitions of knowledge of such vast importance, that
it is fitting that a few sentences should be specially devoted to this
subject.

Photography is no new discovery, being about half a century old; it
may excite surprise, and indeed possibly suggest some apathy on the
part of astronomers, though the suggestion of the application of pho-
tography to the heavenly bodies dates from the memorable occasion
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. if

when, in 1839, Arago, announcing to the Académiede Sciences the great
discovery of Niepce and Daguerre, spoke of the possibility of taking
pictures of the sun and moon by the new process, yet that it is only
within a few years that notable advances in astronomical methods and
discovery have been made by its aid.

The explanation is to be found in the comparative unsuitability of
the earlier photographic methods for use in the observatory. In jus-
tice to the earlier workers in astronomical photography, among whom

3ond, De la Rue, J. W. Draper, Rutherfurd, Gould, hold a foremost
place, it is needful to state clearly that the recent great successes in
astronomical photography are not due to greater skill, nor, to any great
extent, to superior instruments, but to the very great advantages which
the modern gelatin dry plate possesses for use in the observatory over
the methods of Daguerre, and even over the wet collodion film on glass,
which, though a great advance on the silver plate, went but a little
way towards putting into the hands of the astronomer a photograhie
surtace adapted fully to his wants.

The modern silver-bromide gelatine plate, except for its grained tex-
ture, meets theneeds of theastronomer atall points. Itpossessesextreme
sensitiveness; it is always ready for use; it can be placed in any posi-
tion; it can be exposed for hours; lastly, it does not need immediate
development, and for this reason can be exposed again to the same
object on succeeding nights, so as to make up by several installments,
as the weather may permit, the total time of exposure which is deemed
necessary.

Without the assistance of photography, however greatly the resources
of genius might overcome the optical and mechanical difficulties of
constructing large telescopes, the astronomer would have to depend in
the last resource upon his eye. Now we can not by the force of con-
tinued looking bring into view an object too feebly luminous to be seen
at the first and keenest moment of vision. But the feeblest light
which falls wpon the plate is not lost, but is taken in and stored up
continuously. Each hour the plate gathers up 3,600 times the light-
energy which it received during the first second. “It is by this power
of accumulation that the photographic plate may be said to increase,
almost without limit, though not in separating power, the optical
means at the disposal of the astronomer for the discovery or the obser-
vation of faint objects.

Two principal directions may be pointed out in which photography
is of great service to the astronomer. It enables him within the com-
paratively short time of a single exposure to secure permanently with
great exactness the relative positions of hundreds or even of thousands
of stars, or the minute features of nebulie or other objects, or the phe-
nomena of a passing eclipse, a task which by means of the eye and
hand could only be accomplished, if done at all, after a very great ex-
penditure of time and labor. Photography puts it in the power of the

f

98 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

astronomer to accomplish in the short span of his own life, and so
enter into their fruition, great works which otherwise must have been
passed on by him as a heritage of labor to succeeding generations.

The second great service which photography renders is not simply
an aid to the powers the astronomer already possesses. On the con-
trary, the plate, by recording light-waves which are both too small
and too large to excite vision in the eye, brings him into a new region
of knowledge, such as the infra-red and the ultra-violet parts of the
spectrum, which must have remained forever unknown but for artificial
help.

The present year will be memorable in astronomical history for the
practical beginning of the Photographie Chart and Catalogue of the
Heavens, which took their origin in an international conference which
met in Paris in 1887, by the invitation of M. ?Amiral Mouchez, director
of the Paris Observatory.

The richness in stars down to the ninth magnitude of the photo-
graphs of the comet of 1882 taken at the Cape Observatory under the
superintendence of Dr. Gill, and the remarkable star charts of the
Brothers Henry which followed two years later, astonished the astro-
nomical world. The great excellence of these photographs, which was
due mainly to the superiority of the gelatine plate, suggested to these
astronomers a complete map of the sky, and a little later gave birth
in the minds of the Paris astronomers to the grand enterprise of an
International Chart of the Heavens. The actual beginning of the
work this year is in no small degree due to the great energy and tact
with which the director of the Paris Observatory has conducted the
initial steps, through the many delicate and difficult questions which
have unavoidably presented themselves in an undertaking which de-
pends upon the harmonious working in common of many nationalities,
and of no fewer than eighteen observatories in all parts of the world.
The three years since 1887 have not been too long for the detailed or-
ganization of this work, which has called for several elaborate prelim-
inary investigations on special points in which our knowledge was in-
sufficient, and which have been ably carried out by Profs. Vogel and
Bakhuyzen, Dr. Trépied, Dr. Scheiner, Dr. Gill, the astronomer-royal,
and others. Time also was required for the construction of the new
and special instruments.

The decisions of the conference in their final form provide for the
construction of a great photographie chart of the heavens with expo-
sures corresponding to forty minutes’ exposure at Paris, which it is
exp. cted will reach down to stars of about the fourteenth magnitude.
As each plate is to be limited to 4 square degrees, and as each star, to
avoid possible errors, is to appear on two plates, over 22,000 photo-
graphs will be required. For the more accurate determination of the
positions of the stars, a réseau with lines at distances of 5 millimeters
apart is to be previously impressed by a faint light upon the plate, so
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 99

that the image of the réseau will appear together with the images of
the stars when the plate is developed. This great work will be divided
according to their latitudes among eighteen observatories provided
with similar instruments, though not necessarily constructed by the
same maker. Those in the British dominions and at Tacubaya have
been constructed by Sir Howard Grubb.

Besides the plates to form the great chart, a second set of plates for
a catalogue is to be taken with a shorter exposure, which will give
stars to the eleventh magnitude only. These plates, by a recent de-
cision of the permanent committee, are to be pushed on as accurately
as possible, though as far as may be practicable plates for the chart
are to be taken concurrently. Photographing the plates for the cata-
logue is but the first step in this work, and only supplies the data for
the elaborate measurements which have to be made, which are how-
ever less laborious than would be required for a similar catalogue with-
out the aid of photography.

Already Dr. Gill has nearly brought to conclusion, with the assist-
ance of Prof. Kapteyn, a preliminary photograhic survey of the south-
ern heavens.

With an exposure sufficiently long for the faintest stars to impress
themselves upon the plate, the accumulating action still goes on for
the brighter stars, producing a great enlargement of their images from
optical and photographic causes. The question has occupied the atten-
tion of many astronomers, whether it is possible to find a law connect-
ing the diameters of these more or less over-exposed images with the
relative brightness of the stars themselves. The answer will come out
undoubted in the affirmative, though at present the empirical formule
which have been suggested for this purpose differ from each other.
Capt. Abney proposes to measure the total photographic action, in-
cluding density as well as size, by the obstruction which the stellar
image offers to light.

A further question follows as to the relation which the photographic
magnitudes of stars bear to those determined by eye. Visual magni-
tudes are the physiological expression of the eye’s integration of that
part of the star’s light which extends from the red to the blue. Photo-
graphic magnitudes represent the plate’s integration of another part of
the star’s light, namely, from a little below where the power of the eye
leaves off in the blue to where the light is cut off by the glass, or is
greatly reduced by want of proper corrections when a refracting tele-
scope is used. It is obvious that the two records are taken by different
methods in dissimilar units of different parts of the star’s light. In the
case of certain colored stars the photographic brightness is very differ-
ent from the visual brightness; but in all stars, changes, especially of
a temporary character, may occur in the photographic or the visual
region, unaccompanied by a similar change in the other part of the
spectrum, For these reasons it would seem desirable that the two sets
100 CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY.

of magnitudes should be tabulated independently, and be regarded as
supplementary of each other.

The determination of the distances of the fixed stars from the small
apparent shift of their positions, when viewed from widely separated
positions of the earth in its orbit, is one of the most refined operations
of the observatory. The great precision with which this minute angu-
lar quantity—a fraction of a second only—has to be measured, is so
delicate an operation with the ordinary micrometer, though, indeed, it
was with this instrument that the classical observations of Sir Robert
Ball were made, that a special instrument, in which the measures are
made by moving the two halves of a divided object glass, known as a
heliometer, has been pressed into this service, and quite recently, in
the skillful hands of Dr. Gill and Dr. Elkin, has largely increased our
knowledge in this direction.

It is obvious that photography might be here of great service, if we
could rely upon measurements of photographs of the same stars taken
at suitable intervals of time. Prof. Pritchard, to whom is due the
honor of having opened this new path, aided by his assistants, has
proved by elaborate investigations that measures for parallax may be
safely made upon photographie plates, with, of course, the advantages
of leisure and repetition; and he has already by this method determined
the parallax for twenty-one stars with an accuracy not inferior to that
of values previously obtained by purely astronomical methods.

The remarkable successes of astronomical photography, which de-
pend upon the plate’s power of accumulation of a very feeble light act-
ing continuously through an exposure of several hours, are worthy to be
regarded as a new revelation. The first chapter opened when, in 1880,
Dr. Henry Draper obtained a picture of the nebula of Orion; but a
more important advance was made in 1883, when Dr. Common, by his
photographs, brought to our knowledge details and extensions of this
nebula, hitherto unknown. <A further disclosure took place in 1885,
when the brothers Henry showed for the first time in great detail the
spiral nebulosity issuing from the bright star Maia of the Pleiades, and
Shortly atterwards nebulous streams about the other stars of this group.
In 1886 Mr. Roberts, by means of a photograph to which three hours’
exposure had been given, showed the whole background of this group
to be nebulous. In the following year Mr. Roberts more than doubled
for us the great extension of the nebular region which surrounds the
trapezium in the constellation of Orion. By his photographs of the
great nebula in Andromeda he has shown the true significance of the
dark canals which had been seen by the eye. They are in reality
spaces between successive rings of bright matter, which appeared
nearly straight owing to the inclination in which they lie relatively to
us. These bright rings surround an undefined central luminous mass.
I have already spoken of this photograph.

Some recent photographs by Mr. Russell show that the great rift in
CELESTIAL SPECTROSCOPY. 101

the Milky Way in Argus, which to the eye is void of stars, is in reality
uniformily covered with them. Also, quite recently, Mr. George Hale
has photographed the prominences by means of a grating, making use
of the lines H and K.

Stellar distributions —The heavens are richly but very irregularly
inwrought with stars, the brighter stars cluster into well-known groups
upon a background formed of an enlacement of streams and convoluted
windings and intertwined spirals of fainter stars, which becomes richer
and more intricate in the irregular rifted zone of the Milky Way.

We, who form part of the emblazonry, can only see the design dis-

_torted and confused; here crowded, there scattered, at another place
superposed. The groupings due to our position are mixed up with
those which are real.

Can we suppose that each luminous point has no relation to the others
near it than the accidental neighborship of grains of sand upon the
shore, or of particles of the wind-blown dust of the desert? Surely
every star, from Sirius and Vega down to each grain of the light dust
of the Milky Way, has its present place in the heavenly pattern from
the slow evolving of its past. We see a system of systems, for the
broad features of clusters and streams and spiral windings which mark
the general design are re-produced in every part. The whole is in motion,
each point shifting its position by miles every second, though from the
august magnitude of their distances from us and from each other, it is
only by the accumulated movements of years or of generations that
some small changes of relative position reveal themselves.

The deciphering of this wonderfully intricate constitution of the
heavens will be undoubtedly one of the chief astronomical works of
the coming century. The primary task of the sun’s motion in space,
together with the motions of the brighter stars, has been already put
well within our reach by the spectroscopic method of the measurement
of star motions in the line of sight.

From other directions information is accumulating; from photo-
graphs of clusters and parts of the Milky Way, by Roberts, in this
country, Barnard, at the Lick Observatory, and Russell, at Sydney;
from the counting of stars, and the detection of their configurations
by Holden and by Backhouse; from the mapping of the Milky Way by
eye, at Parsonstown; from photographs of the spectra of stars, by Pick-
ering at Harvard and in Peru, and from the exact portraiture of the
heavens in the great international star chart which begins this year.

I have but touched some only of the problems of the newer side of
astronomy. There are many others which would claim our attention if
time permitted. The researches of the Earl of Rosse on lunar radia-
tion, and the work on the same subject and on the sun, by Langley.

by Mr. Boys; and observations of the variation of the moon’s heat
with its phase by Mr. Frank Very. The discovery of the ultra-violet
part of the hydrogen spectrum, not in the laboratory, but from the
stars. The confirmation of this spectrum by terrestrial hydrogen in
part by H. W. Vogel, and in its all but complete form by Cornu, who
found similar series in the ultra-violet spectra of aluminium and thal-
lium. The discovery of a simple formula for the hydrogen series by
Balmer. The important question as to the numerical spectral relation-
ship of different substances, especially in connection with their chem-
ical properties; and the further question as to the origin of the har-
monie and other relations between the lines and the groupings of lines
of spectra; on these points contributions during the past year have
been made by Rudolf vy. Kovesligethy, Ames, Hartley, Deslandres,
Rydberg, Griinwald, Kayser and Runge, Johnstone Stoney, and others.
The remarkable employment of interference phenomena by Prof. Mich-
elson for the determination of the size, and distribution of light within
them, of the images of objects which when viewed in a telescope sub-
tend an angle less than that subtended by the light wave at a distance
equal to the diameter of the objective. A method applicable not alone
to celestial objects, but also to spectral lines, and other questions of
molecular physics.

Along the older lines there has not been less activity; by newer
methods, by the aid of larger or more accurately constructed instru-
ments, by greater refinement of analysis, knowledge has been increased,
especially in precision and minute exactness.

Astronomy, the oldest of the sciences, has more than renewed her
youth. At no time in the past has she been so bright with unbounded
aspirations and hopes. Never were her temples so numerous nor the
crowd of her votaries so great. The British Astronomical Association
formed within the year numbers already about 600 members. Happy
is the lot of those who are still on the eastern side of life’s meridian.

Already, alas! the original founders of the newer nethods are falling
out—Kirchhoff, Angstrém, D’Arrest, Secchi, Draper, Becquerel; but
their places are more than filled; the pace of the race is gaining, but
the goal is not and never will be in sight.

Since the time of Newton our knowledge of the phenomena of nature
has wonderfully increased, but man asks, perhaps more earnestly now
than in his days, What is the ultimate reality behind the reality of the
perceptions? Are they only the pebbles of the beach with which we
have been playing? Does not the ocean of ultimate reality and truth
hie beyond?

STELLAR NUMBERS AND DISTANCES:

BY MEANS OF PHOTOGRAPHIC STAR GAUGING. *

The mere equal-surface counting of the stars visible with the same
instrument in different sections of the sky gives results open to mis-in-
terpretation. Admirable in itself, the method fails because it encoun-
ters what we may call “‘ systematic errors” in the distribution of the
stars. With incidental anomalies it is fully competent to deal; they
should, on a large average, be mutually compensatory; but it breaks
down before the clustering tendency which pervades, more or less mark-
edly, the entire sidereal system. Not only are certain parts of space
more crowded than others, but the crowded parts are related according
to an obvious plan. They do not occur casually. Their effect is then
heightened, instead of being eliminated, by multiplied observations.

The present resources of science, however, seem to offer the means of
discriminating, to some extent, between real crowding and the simple
extent of star-strewn space. Although the total number of the stars vis-
ible in each case with the same telescope might be precisely the same,
their relative numbers, counted by magnitudes, would in all probability
be very different. In a stratum, supposing the distribution of the stars
equable and their size uniform, their numbers should be nearly quad-
rupled at each descent of a magnitude. This, of course, is an ideal
law of progression which we can not expect to find anywhere strictly
obeyed; but even approximate conformity to it must be held to indicate
with tolerable certainty that the lessening ranks of the stars are, on
the whole, at distances from us corresponding with their light. Now it
is approximately conformed to by the stellar multitude down to the 8.9
magnitude over the general expanse of the sky, as well as over the zone
of the Milky Way. Butin that zone stars of the ninth and higher mag-
nitudes very much exceed their due numerical proportions; in other
words, they are physically, no less than optically, condensed.

From these circumstances two very important inferences may be de-
rived: First, that the lower margin of the galactic aggregations lies at
a distance from us corresponding roughly to the mean distance of a
ninth magnitude star, costing light some fourteen hundred years of
travel; next, that the aggregated objects are average stars, neither

larger nor smaller than those in our nearer neighborhood. Both con-
clusions seem inevitable should the facts turn out, on closer investiga-
tion, to be as above stated. A regular increase in the numbers of the
successive photometric orders of stars, tallying with the increased cub-
ical contents of the successive spheres of which the radii are the theo-
retical mean distances of those same orders, affords strong, if not de-
monstrative, evidence of a corresponding real penetration of space.*
And since the sequence continues unbroken down just to the ninth
magnitude, we see that the galactic condensations of ninth magnitude
stars can not be situated nearer to us than their brightness would lead
us to suppose—can not, in other words, be stars on a lower than the
ordinary level of luster.

It is tolerably certain however that the denser star clouds of the
Milky Way lie far beyond ninth magnitude distance. The ground for
this assertion is not the apparent minuteness of their components, but
the singular fact, adverted to by Argelander, that, in the divided Milky
Way, running from Cygnus to the Centaur, the shining branches are
nearly on a par with the dark rift separating them as regards the dis-
tribution of stars even fainter than the ninth magnitude. The nebu-
lous effect to the eye distinguishing the branches is then presumably
due to more remote collections. As to the further limits of these we
know as yet nothing, except that Herschel’s gauge numbers left it to
be inferred that ‘‘ thinning-out” had become marked before the attain-
ment of fourteenth magnitude distance. On these and similar subjects
enlightenment may be hoped for through the judicious use of means
already at hand.

For simple star-counts, we have only to substitute star-counts by
magnitudes over selected areas of the sky.t The relative numbers of
the photometric ranks can hardly fail to give highly valuable indica-
tions as to real distribution; provided only that the assumption of a
general uniformity in the brightness of the stars be valid. Not (it need
scarcely be said) of a uniformity such as to preelude any extent of in-
dividual variety; all that need be supposed is that the average size of
a Star remains constant throughout sidereal space. This hypothesis
has far more probability in its favor than any other which could be set
up instead of it; though it may receive corrections as our inquiries ad-
vance.

The photometric classification of small stars is one of the many
branches of sidereal science which will henceforth be prosecuted only
with the assistance of the camera. Visual methods are inadequate and
insecure. Those by photography, it is true, have also their difficulties,

~The idea of determining distance by distribution seems to have presented itself
to Dr. Gould in 1874. See American Journal of Science, vol. V1.

‘not yet completely vanquished; they will, however, evidently prove

manageable. Prof. Pickering is tentatively establishing methods in
photographic photometry which will doubtless before long be brought
to perfection. They depend mainly upon comparisons of stellar im-
pressions upon any given plate, exposed under known conditions, with
standard impressions of standard stars obtained with varied exposures
or apertures. For the purpose we have in view, accidental errors of
estimation, even if very large in amount, are of no importance. What
is essential is that the integrity of the series should be preserved—that
the proportionate change of light from one magnitude to the next should
remain invariable from the first term to the last. The realization of
this aim, now virtually attained, is one of the most weighty services
rendered to astronomy by the sensitive plate.

We may now describe the process of photographic star-gauging. It
consists in the enumeration, by magnitudes or half magnitudes, of the
stars down, say, to the fifteenth magnitude, self-pictured from distinet-
ively situated patches of the sky. Each such area should be wide
enough to insure the elimination of minor irregularities in distribution;
but a single large field would often suffice to show the characteristic
grouping of the smaller telescopic stars.

The Milky Way would naturally be the first subject of inquiry; and
the comparison of several plates taken in different sections of its course
might be expected to yield data of great significance as regards its
constitution. From simply calling over the muster-ro]l by orders of
brightness of the stars contained in them, answers may be derived to
the following questions:

(1) How far does the regular sequence of increasing numbers extend?
That is, down to what grade of brightness do the stars continue nearly
to quadruple with each additional magnitude?

(2) Is the progression interrupted by defect or excess, or by each alter-
nately? In other words, does the stellar system embrace systematic
vacancies as well as systematic groupings?

(3) Supposing an accumulation of stars to set in at a definite stage of
space-penetration, where does it stop? Down to what magnitude is
the augmented ratio of increase maintained?

(4) Are there symptoms of approaching total exhaustion of the stel-
lar supplies beyond?

These should be found in a concurrent decrease of density with
brightness, “‘ density ” being understood as the proportion of the num-
bers present to the space theoretically available for stars of a given
magnitude. For one of two things seems certain: either the thinning
fringe of stars is composed of really small objects interspersed among
larger ones, or of average stars at average distances from us, but fur-
ther and further apart from cach other. In the first case the system
ends abruptly; in the second, it is,as it were, shielded by outliers from
the absolute void.
106 STELLAR NUMBERS AND DISTANCES.

Particular attention should be paid to the differences of stellar dis-
tribution upon plates of the Milky Way proper, and of the dark aper-
ture between its cloven portions. That this really forms an integral
part of the galaxy is shown by the far greater profusion of small stars
there than in the general sky at the outer margins of the galactic
branches—a fact in itself fatal to the “spiral theory,” by which the
rift was interpreted as a chink of ordinary sky-background left by the
interlacing, to the eye, of two great streams of stars, one indefinitely
more remote than the other. From photographs we may now hope to
learn what is the nature of the distinction between rift and branches—
what are the magnitudes, relative numbers, and presumable mean dis-
tances, of the clustering stars present in the latter, but absent from
former.

Gauges taken in the neighborhood of the southern “coal-sack” ought
to prove instructive as to the nature of the nebulous stratum out of
which it seems as if scooped. If the Milky Way be there shallower
than elsewhere, a greater uniformity of lustre may be looked for among
the stars composing it. No background profusely stored with lessen-
ing ranks will come into view, and stars below the average of those
grouped in bright masses, representing their genuine companions, will
be but scantily present.

Outside the milky way, two points suggest themselves as likely to be
settled by photographic gauges. Argelander tound that the faintest
stars in the Durchmusterung were everywhere in excess of their due
proportion.* Even at the galactic pole, their increase, as compared
with the class next below, was sextuple instead of quadruple; in the
undivided galactic stream it was nine and a half, in the rift eight and
a half times. If this semblance of crowding in all directions at about
the mean distance of a ninth magnitude star be no accident of enumera-
tion, then the milky way is only the enhancement of a phenomenon
universally present, and the fundamental plan of the sidereal system
must be regarded as that of a sphere with superficial condensation in-
tensified in an equatorial ring. The counts, to settle this question, will
have to extend over a considerable area.

The second point for photographie investigation refers to the limits
of the system towards the galactic poles. There is reason to believe
them comparatively restricted. M. Celoria, of the Milan observatory,
using a refractor capable at the utmost of showing stars of eleventh mag-
nitude, obtained for a “‘mean sounding,” at the north pole of the milky
way, almost identically the same number given by Herschel’s great re-
flector.t That is to say, no additional stars were revealed by the larger
instrument. Should this evidence be confirmed, the boundary of the

stellar scheme should here be placed at a maximum remoteness of 3,500
years of light travel.

As a specimen of a photographic gauge-field on a small scale, we may
take Prof. Pickering’s catalogue, from the Harvard plates, of 947 stars
within 1° of the north celestial pole.* The region examined lies about
27° from the zone of the Milky Way, but is nearly reached by a faint
extension from it. Since only one eighth magnitude star, and none
brighter, are included in it, the study of distribution, for which it offers
some materials, may be said to begin with the ninth magnitude. <A
single glance at the synoptical table suftices to show that the numerical
representation of the higher magnitudes is inadequate. The small
stars are overwhelmingly too few for the space they must occupy if of
average brightness; and they are too few inaconstantly increasing ratio.

sition of the equal average luster of each class of stars. Those of the
ninth are the most closely seattered. The intervals between star and
star widen rapidly and continuously (for the sudden dip at 9-5 magni-
tude is evidently accidental) down to 11.5 agnitude, when a slight re-
covery, lasting to the thirteenth magnitude, sets in. How far these
changes are of a systematic character can only be decided from far
wider surveys.
THE.SUN’S MOTION IN SPACKE.*

By AGNES M. CLERKE.

Science needed two thousand years to disentangle the earth’s orbital
movement from the revolutions of the other planets, and the incompar-
ably more arduous problem of distinguishing the solar share in the
confused multitude of stellar displacements first presented itself as
possibly tractable, little more than a century ago. In the lack as yet of
a definite solution for it, there is then no ground for surprise, but much
for satisfaction in the large measure of success attending the strenuous
attacks of which it has so often been made the object.

Approximately correct knowledge as to the direction and velocity of
the sun’s translation is indispensable to a profitable study of sidereal
construction; but apart from some acquaintance with the nature of
sidereal construction, it is difficult, if not impossible, of attainment.
One in fact pre-supposes the other. To separate a common element of
motion from the heterogeneous shiftings upon the sphere of 3,000 or
4,000 stars is a task practicable only under certain conditions. To be-
gin with, the proper motions investigated must be established with
general exactitude. The errors inevitably affecting them must be sueh
as pretty nearly, in the total upshot, to neutralize one another. For
should they run mainly in one direction, the result will be falsified in
a degree enormously disproportionate to their magnitude. The adop-
tion, for instance, of a system of declinations as much as 1” of are
astray, might displace to the extent of 10° north or south the point
fixed upon as the apex of the sun’s way (see L. Boss, Astr. Jour., No.
213). Risks on this score, however, will become less formidable with
the further advance of practical astronomy along a track definable as
an asymptote to the curve of ideal perfection.

Besides this obstacle to be overcome, there is another which it will
soon be possible to evade. Hitherto, inquiries into the solar movement
have been hampered by the necessity for preliminary assumptions of
some kind as to the relative distances of classes of stars. But all such
assumptions, especially when applied to selected lists, are highly inse-
cure; and any fabric reared upon them must be considered to stand
upon treacherous ground. The spectrographic method, however, here
fortunately comes into play. ‘ Proper motions” are only angular veloci-

ties. They tell nothing as to the value of the perspective element they
may be supposed to include, or as the real rate of going of the bodies they
are attributed to, until the size of the sphere upon which they are meas-
ured has been otherwise ascertained. But the displacements of lines
in stellar spectra give directly the actual velocities relative to the earth
of the observed stars. The question of their distances is therefore at
once eliminated. Now, the radial component of stellar motion is mixed
up precisely in the same way as the tangential component with the
solar movement; and since complete knowledge of it in a sufficient
number of cases is rapidly becoming accessible, while knowledge of
tangential velocity must for a long time remain partial or uncertain, the
advantage of replacing the discussion of proper motions by that of
motions in line of sight is obvious and immediate. And the admirable
work carried on at Potsdam during the last three years will soon afford
the means of doing so in the first, if only a preliminary, investigation
of the solar translation based upon measurements of photographed
stellar spectra.

The difficulties, then, caused either by inaccuracies in star catalogues
or by ignorance of star distances, may be overcome; but there is a
third, impossible at present to be surmounted, and not without misgiv-
ing to be passed by. All inquiries upon the subject of the advance of
our system through space start with a hypothesis most unlikely to be
true. The method uniformly adopted in them—and no other is avail-
able—is to treat the inherent motions of the stars (their so-called motus
peculiares) as pursued indifferently in all directions. The steady drift
extricable from them by rules founded upon the seience of probabili-
ties is presumed to be solar motion visually transferred to them in pro-
portions varying with their remoteness in space and their situations on
the sphere. If this presumption be in any degree baseless, the result
of the inquiry is pro tanto falsified. Unless the deviations from the
parallactic line of the stellar motions balance one another on the whole,
their discussion may easily be as fruitless as that of observations
tainted with systematic errors. It is scarcely however doubtful that
law, and not chance, governs the sidereal revolutions. The point open
to question is whether the workings of law may not be so exceedingly
intricate as to produce a grand sum total of results which, from the geo-
metrical side, may justifiably be regarded as casual.

The search for evidence of a general plan in the wanderings of the
stars over the face of the sky has so far proved fruitless. Local con-
cert can be traced, but no widely-diffused preference for one direction
over any other makes itself definitely felt. Some regard, nevertheless,
must be paid by them to the plane of the Milky Way; since it is alto-
gether incredible that the actual construction of the heavens is with-
out dependence upon the method of their revolutions.

The apparent anomaly vanishes upon the consideration of the pro-
fundities of space and time in which the fundamental design of the
Sidereal universe lies buried, Its composition out of an indefinite

number of partial systems is more than probable; but the inconceiva-
ble leisureliness with which their mutual relations develop renders the
harmony of those relations inappreciable by short-lived terrestrial
denizens. ‘ Proper motions,” if this be so, are of a subordinate kind;
they are indexes simply to the mechanism of particular aggregations,
and have no definable connection with the mechanism of the whole.
No considerable error may then be involved in treating them, for pur-
poses of calculation, as indifferently directed; and the elicited solar
movement may genuinely represent the displacement of our system rela-
tive to its more immediate stellar environment. This is perhaps the ut-
most to be hoped for until sidereal astronomy has reached another sta-
dium of progress, unless, indeed, effect should be given to Clerk Max-
well’s suggestion for deriving the absolute longitude of the solar apex
from observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites (Proc. Roy. Soc.,
vol. Xxx, p. 109). But this is far from likely. In the first place, the
revolutions of the Jovian system can not be predicted with anything
like the required accuracy. In the second place, there is no certainty
that the postulated phenomena have any real existence. If however
it be safe to assume that the solar systein, cutting its way through
space, virtually raises an :etherial counter-current, and if it be further
granted that light travels faster with than against such a current, then
indeed it becomes speculatively possible, through slight alternate accel-
erations and retardations of eclipses taking place, respectively, ahead
of and in the wake of the sun, to determine his absolute path in space
as projected upon the ecliptic. That is to say, the longitude of the
apex could be deduced together with the resolved part of the solar
velocity; the latitude of the apex, as well as the component of velocity
perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, remaining however unknown.

The beaten track, meanwhile, has conducted two recent inquirers to
results of some interest. The chief aim of each was the detection of
systematic peculiarities in the motions of stellar assemblages after the
subtraction from them of their common perspective element. By vary-
ing the materials and method of analysis, Prof. Lewis Boss, director of
the Albany Observatory, hopes that corresponding variations in the
upshot may betray a significant character. Thus, if stars selected on
different principles give notably and consistently different results, the
cause of the difference may, with some show of reason, be supposed to
reside in specialties of movement appertaining to the several groups.
Prof. Boss broke ground in this direction by investigating 284 proper
motions, few of which had been similarly employed before (Astr. Jowr.,
No. 213). They were all taken from an equatorial zone 4° 20’ in breadth,
with a mean declination of +3°, observed at Albany for the catalogue
of the Astronomische Gesellschaft, and furnished data accordingly for
a virtually independent research of ‘a somewhat distinctive kind. It

ras carried out to three separate conclusions. Setting aside five stars
with secular movements ranging above 100°, Prof, Boss divided the
142 THE SUN’S MOTION IN SPACE.

279 left available into two sets,—one of 135 stars brighter, the other of —
144 stars fainter, than the eighth magnitude. The first collection gave
for the goal of solar translation a point about 4° north of a Lyre, in R.
A. 280°, Decl. + 43°; the second, one some thirty-seven minutes of
time to the west of 5 Cygni, in R. A. 286°, Decl. + 45°. For a third
and final solution, twenty-six stars moving 40/’-100” were rejected, and
the remaining 253 classed in a single series. The upshot of their dis-
cussion was to shift the apex of movement to R. A. 289°, Decl. + 51°.
So far as the difference from the previous pair of results is capable of
interpretation, it would seem to imply a predominant set towards the
northeast of the twenty-six swifter motions subsequently dismissed as
prejudicial, but in truth the data employed were not accurate enough
to warrant so definite an inference. The Albany proper motions, as
Prof. Boss was careful to explain, depend for the most part upon the
right ascensions of Bessel’s and Lalande’s zones, and are hence subject
to large errors. Their study must be regarded as suggestive rather
than decisive.

A better quality and a larger quantity of material was disposed of
by the latest and perhaps the most laborious investigator of this intri-
cate problem. M. Oscar Stumpe, of Bonn (Astr Nach., Nos. 2999, 3000),
took his stars, to the number of 1,054, from various quarters, if chiefly
from Auwers’s and Argelander’s lists, critically testing, however, the
movement attributed to each of not less than 16” a century. This he
fixed as the limit of secure determination, unless for stars observed with
exceptional constancy and care. His discussion of them is instructive
in more ways than one. Adopting Schoénfeld’s modification of Airy’s
formule, (the additional computative burden imposed by it notwith-
standing,) he introduced into his equations a fifth unknown quantity
expressive of a possible stellar drift in galactic longitude. A negative
result was obtained. No symptom came to light of “rotation” in the
plane of the Milky Way.

M. Stumpe’s intrepid industry was further shown in his disregard
of customary “‘scamping” subterfuges. Expedients for abbreviation
vainly spread their allurements; everyone of his 2,108 equations was
separately and resolutely solved. A more important innovation was
his substitution of proper motion for magnitude as a criterion of re-
moteness. Dividing his stars on this principle into feur groups, he
obtained an apex for the sun’s translation corresponding to each as
follows:

Here again we find a marked and progressive descent of the apex
toward the equator with the increasing swiftness of the objects serv-
ing for its determination, jeading to the suspicion that the most north-
erly may be the most genuine position, because the one least affected
by stellar individualities of movement. By nearly all recent investi-
gations, moreover, the solar point de mire has been placed considerably
farther to the east and nearer to the Milky Way than seemed admis-
sible to their predecessors; so that the constellation Lyra may now be
said to have a stronger claim than Hercules to include it; and the ne-
cessity has almost disappeared for attributing to the solar orbit a high
inclination to the medial galactic plane.

From both the Albany and the Bonn discussions there emerged with
singular clearness a highly significant relation. The mean magnitudes
of the two groups into which Prof. Boss divided his 279 stars were re-
spectively 6.6 and 8.6, the corresponding mean proper motions 21.9” and
20.9’. In other words, a set of stars on the whole six times brighter than
another set owned a scarcely larger sum total of apparent displacement.
And that this approximate equality of movement really denoted approx-
imate equality of mean distance was made manifest by the further cir-
cumstance that the secular journey of the sun proved to subtend nearly
the same angle whichever of the groups was made the standpoint for
its survey. Indeed, the fainter collection actually gave the larger angle
(13.73 as against 12.39’), and so far an indication that the stars compos-
ing it were, on an average, nearer to the earth than the much brighter
ones considered apart.

A result similar in character was reached by M. Stumpe. © Between
the mobility of his star groups, and the values derived from them for
the angular movement of the sun, the conformity proved so close as
materially to strengthen the inference that apparent movement meas-
ures real distance. The mean brilliancy of his classified stars seemed,
on the contrary, quite independent of their mobility. Indeed, its
changes tended in an opposite direction. The mean magnitude of the
slowest group was 6, of the swiftest 6.5, of the intermediate pair 6.7
and 6.1. And these are not isolated facts. Comparisons of the same
kind, and leading to identical conclusions, were made by Prof. East-
man at Washington in 1889. (Phil. Soc. Wash. Bulletin, vol. xt, p. 143;
Proceedings Amer. Association, 1889, p. 71.)

What meaning can we attribute to them? Uncritically considered,
they seem to assert two things, one reasonable, the other palpably ab-
surd. The first—that the average angular velocity of the stars varies
inversely with their distance from ourselves—few will be disposed to
doubt; the second—that their average apparent luster has nothing to
do with greater or less remoteness—few will be disposed to admit.

and that the proportion of stationary to traveling stars rises rapidly
with descent down the scale of magnitude. Hence a mean struck in
disregard of the zeros is totally misleading, while the account is no
sooner made exhaustive than its anomalous character becomes largely
modified. Yet it does not wholly disappear. There is some warrant
for it in nature. And its warrant may perhaps consist in a preponder-
ance, among suns endowed with high physical speed, of small, or
slightly luminous, over powerfully radiative bodies. Why this should
be so it would be futile, even by conjecture, to attempt to explain.
A SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY.*

By AGNES M. CLERKE.

On Tuesday, August 21, 1888, the Union steamship Mexican crossed
the line outward-bound for the cape, and a certain proportion of her
passengers, amongst whom was the present writer, found themselves
for the first time in the southern hemisphere. A few nights later, halt
an hour’s darkness before moonrise gave time for a splendid display of
unfamiliar stars. The Southern Cross lay prone toward the west;
Alpha and Beta Centauri shone triumphantly above it; Achernar was
climbing the sky on the other side of a pole singularly denuded of
bright companionship; the lucid streams and knots of the Milky Way
were reflected in a pearly shimmer from gently heaving waves, the
brilliant effect of the entire sidereal landscape being enhanced by the
presence of Jupiter and Mars close together in Scorpio, while the dim
cone of the Zodiacal Light, tapering upward from the sun’s place, faded
out above them on the black background of the sky.

The “four stars,”

appealed to mediwval imagination as a symbol and a prophecy of the
uplifting of the Cross in the waste places of the earth. Modern trav-
ellers regard them from a more prosaic point of view, and are apt to be
‘** disappointed” at their unequal luster and slightly unsymmetrical
arrangement. The firmament they help to adorn, however, is of a
splendor at first sight absolutely startling, and at all times peculiarly
suggestive. The dullest mind can hardly fail to be roused to wonder
by the appearance of the galaxy as it extends past Sirius amidst the
grand procession of the stars in Argo, or where the great rift in its
structure spans the heavens from the Centaur tothe Swan. The intri-
cacy of its branches, the curdled texture of its surface, the stupendous
collection of distant suns, almost palpably rounded out from the void
of space in Sagittarius; the abrupt vacuity of the “ Coalsack,” recall-
ing the dark “lanes” tunneling certain nebule and star clusters, invite,
only to baffle, speculations, which the tempting analogues presented by
the never-setting Magellanic Clouds, with their mixed contents of stars
and nebule, help further to stimulate.

116 A SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY.

“ What is the Milky Way?” may be called the question of questions
for future astronomers; but it has only of late been brought to some
extent within the range of available methods. More feasible aims
prompted the foundation of southern observatories. English official
astronomy in particular took its rise directly from the requirements of
English seamen. Flamsteed was commissioned to determine the places
of the stars, not because any speculative interest attached to them,
but simply in order that they might serve for divisions (as it were) of -
the great dial plate of the heavens, upon which the moon marked
Greenwich time, and might hence be got to tell the longitude in every
part of the world.

But English astronomy was incomplete, even from a strictly utilita-
rian point of view, so long as it failed to embrace the whole of the
celestial sphere; and in proportion as England’s colonial empire be-
came consolidated, the need of a supplementary establishment to that
at Greenwich was rendered more and more imperative.

~In the choice of its situation, there was scarcely room for a doubt.

The Cape of Good Hope was already distinguished as the scene of
Lacaille’s labors in 185152; and these furnished the virtual starting-
point of austral astronomy. As their result, 10,000 southern stars and
forty-two nebulie were known at the beginning of this century; and an
indication of a somewhat anomalous character (yet the only one of any
kind at hand) had been procured regarding the figure of our globe
south of the equator. It seemed to show that the earth bulged the
wrong way,—in other words, was prolate instead of oblate. Its cor-
rection or verification was hence of extreme interest, and the re-meas-
urement of Lacaille’s are of the meridian came to be recognized as a
prime necessity of geodetic science. By an order in council, dated
October 20, 1820, the establishment of a permanent observatory at the
Cape was accordingly decreed, and the first royal astronomer was im-
mediately afterwards appointed, in the person of the Rey. Fearon
Fallows, of St. Johns College, Cambridge.

A Cumbrian weaver’s son, he had contrived, while still a boy work-
ing at the loom, to attain a notable proficiency in mathematics; and,
his talents attracting attention, some gentlemen of the neighborhood
subscribed to procure him a suitable education. He graduated in
1813, as third wrangler to Herschel’s and Peacock’s first and second,
and was elected on the earliest opportunity a fellow of his college. The
prosperity and happiness of his life culminated when he found himself
aS His Majesty’s astronomer at the Cape, in a position to marry the
eldest daughter of his first patron, the Rev. Mr. Hervey, of Bridekirk.

This however was the last fortunate event of his life. Disappoint-
ment and chagrin presided over the entire series of poor Fallows’ ex-
periences in South Africa. Suspense through circumlocutory proceed-
ings at home, anxiety due to the misconduct or lawlessness of those
employed by him in the colony, vexation indescribable at the defects

of the instrument he had chiefly relied wpon, personal illness, the
deaths of all the children successively born to him, at last exhausted
his vital energies, and he died of dropsy supervening upon sunstroke
and scarlet fever, July 25, 1831, at the age of 42. His grave is inaspot
of ground consecrated by himself within a stone’s throw of the broken
pier of his transit instrument; and the syringa trees he planted now
lean their blossom-laden branches towards the upper windows of the
dwelling house where he might have hoped to spend many useful and
happy years.

But his work at the Cape,was not thrown away. The buildings of
the new observatory were well planned and solidly executed; its site
was judiciously chosen on a slightly rising ground 3 miles southeast of
Cape Town, almost islanded by the converging sinuosities of the Lies-
beck and the Salt River. A desolate spot enough it must indeed have
been when Fallows took his first survey of it. Wolves were then still
common in the neighborhood; the cries of jackals mingled at night
with the metallic chirping of the Cape frogs; the last Salt River hip-
popotamus had, not long before, met an untimely death by drowning
in its marshes; the mole-burrowed hillside was bare of almost every
form of vegetation save a luxuriant crop of thistles.

Now the smiling culture everywhere apparent indicates the neigh-
borhood of a refined English home. Theslopes are in spring all abloom
with lilies, asters, and gladioli, delicately striped and shaded with pink
and mauve, or flaunting gaudily in purple and orange; Australian wil-
lows—the Cape substitute for laburnums—inake golden patches against
the dark foliage of thick-growing pines planted half a century ago by
Lady Maclear on the simple plan of inserting a cone into every mole
hill; clumps of aloes and eucalyptus recall the vicinity of the tropics;
a grove of oaks and cypresses, due to Prof. Piazzi Smyth’s skill in
forestry, brings memories of England; white arums, irrepressible and
all-diffusive, nestle round tree roots, strain upwards to the light through
the midst of tall shrubs and hedges, fling themselves in lavish profu-
sion amidst the lush grass, marching processionally (so to speak) or
halting in dense clusters, and making milky ways of blossom along
every marsh and meadow. Here indeed are lilies, enough and to spare,
to strew, ‘‘ with full hands,” the graves of a hundred young Marcelluses.

In succession to the weaver’s lad from Cockermouth, there was ap-
pointed to direct the new South African observatory a solicitor’s clerk
from Dundee. Thomas Henderson began, at the age of 15, to de-
vote his leisure hours to astronomy. His instinct however was for
the mathematical part of the science; and he had probably never seen
a transit instrument, or handled a telescope, until after he came to re-
side at Edinburgh in 1819. His twofold life prospered. In his legal
capacity he became secretary to Lord Advocate Jeffrey; his astro-
nomical calculations brought him to the notice of Dr. Thomas Young,
Sir John Herschel, Capt. Basil Hall, and other eminent men. In the
118 A SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY.

summer of 1829, Dr. Young gave in charge to Prof. Rigaud a memo-
randum urging Henderson’s superior qualifications for the post of
superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, vacated by his own death a
fortnight later; and the recommendation was doubtless influential in
procuring for him after three years the offer of the Cape observatory.

Assuming the chief command there in April, 1852, he acciunulated
in thirteen months, a surprising number of valuable observations, still
in part unpublished. One of the results derived from them was how-
ever of so striking a character as to attract instant and universal at-
tention. It was nothing less than the first authentic determination of
the distance of a fixed star.

After Sirius and Canopus, the brightest star in the heavens is Alpha
Centauri. This beautiful object is easily resolved into two,—one fully
three times brighter than the other. And these two circulate round
each other, or rather round their common center of gravity, in a period
of about eighty-eight years. The system thus formed was discovered
by Henderson to have an‘ annual parallax ” of just one second of are.
That is to say, the apparent places of the component stars as viewed
from opposite sides of the earth’s orbit, differed, through a familiar
effect of perspective, by z¢z's00 Of the distance from the horizon to the
yenith. The more refined determinations of Drs. Gill and Elkin, while
establishing its reality, have since shown that Henderson’s parallax
was somewhat too large. The actual distance of Alpha Centauri from
the earth is, in round numbers, 25,500,000,000 of miles. Even the
setherial vibrations of light occupy four years and four months in span-
ning this huge interval; yet Alpha Centauri (so far as is at present
known) is the nearest neighbor of our sun in space.

The attractive power of each of these coupled stars appears to be
about equal; but while one is nearly twice, the other is only half as
luminous, in proportion to the amount of matter it contains, as our
own sun. Hence, according to our present notions, the darker, more
condensed body must be considerably more advanced on the road
towards extinction than its brilliant companion, and an attentive study
of its spectrum ought to give interesting results.

Henderson returned to Europe in 1833, unable, in the uncertain state
of his health, to support the discomforts—long siice banished with the
wolves and jackals—of a residence at Observatory Hill. He became
astronomer royal for Scotland in 1834, and died suddenly of heart dis-
ease ten years later.

The third astronomer at the Cape, and the first whose term of activity
there was prolonged to a fitting conclusion, was an Irishman. Sir
Thomas Maclear was bornat Newtown Stewart, in County Tyrone, March
17,1794. His career, like those of his predecessors, swerved insensibly
towards the stars. He was a physician, practicing at Biggleswade,
in Bedfordshire, whose astronomical proclivities had been fostered by
the genial influence of Admiral Smyth, when summoned, as one may
say, to the celestial charge of the southern hemisphere.
A SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY. 119

The royal observatories at Greenwich and the Cape of Good Hope
form together an astronomical establishment such as no other nation
besides our own can boast of possessing. It fitly represents the world:
wide dominion of which it is the corollary. British empire on the seas
led directly to British empire over the skies, the one gaining complete-
ness as the inevitable consequence of the expansion of the other. South-
ern astronomy seems the proper appanage of the Anglo-Saxon race.
Originating with Halley’s expedition to St. Helena in 1677, Lacaille’s
work at the Cape formed the only exception worth mentioning to the
rule of its prosecution by our fellow-countrymen on either side of the
Atlantic. So far, indeed, as geometrical astronomy is concerned, it
would survive, without vital injury, the destruction of all results except
those obtained at Greenwich and the Cape. Geometrical astronomy is
now however only one, though the most important, branch of the
science.

Sir Thomas Maclear proved an indefatigable and skillful observer.
He co-operated energetically with Sir John Herschel, whose memorable
stay at Feldhausen, 3 miles from the Royal Oeservatory, coincided with
the first four years of his tenure of office. He re-measured and ex-
tended Laeaille’s are, thereby not only removing all doubt as to the
conformity to scientific prediction of the earth’s figure, but providing
an invaluable groundwork for the survey of the entire colony, now in
active course of prosecution by Maj. Morris, R. E. The long list of
comets observed by Maclear includes Halley’s, Donati’s, Biela’s, Encke’s
at four returns, and the great “ southern” one of 1843. He accumu-
lated matvrials for three star catalogues, prepared for the press and
published by his suecessors, Mr. Stone, the present Radcliffe observer,
and Dr. Gill. And so completely had his interests become identified
with those of his adopted home that he continued, after retiring from
the observatory in 1870, to reside in its vicinity; and on his death,
July 14, 1879, was laid to rest within its grounds. His son, Mr. George
Maclear, retains charge of the transit circle procured by his father in
1855. Itis anexact copy of that erected by Sir George Airy at Green-
wich.

Mr. Stone was chief assistant at Greenwich when induced to accept
the appointment to the Cape by the opportunity it offered for the prep-
aration of an extensive star catalogue, by the comparison of which
with the earlier Madras and Brisbane catalogues something might be
learned about the movements of southern stars. This object was most
satisfactorily attained by the publication of the ‘‘ Cape Catalogue for
1880,” containing nearly 12,500 accurately determined star-places. By
a pure coincidence, Dr. Gould’s simultaneous work at Cordoba had the
same scope. Its brilliant results are familiar to all astronomers.

Mr. Stone surrendered the direction of the observatory, in June, 1879,
to the present royal astronomer. Dr. Gill is one of a long line of dis-
tinguished Aberdonians. An astronomer by “ irresistible impulse,” he,

like Bessel, exchanged lucrative mercantile pursuits for the compara-
tively scanty emoluments awaiting the votaries of the stars. The
“patines of bright gold,” with which Urania’s treasure chests overflow,
are not of terrestial coinage.

The distance of the sun was the first problem upon which Dr, Gill
delivered a substantial attack; and his solution of it still remains the
best obtained by celestial trigonometry, corresponding so closely with
Newcomb’s value of the same great unit, derived from direct measure-
ment of the velocity of light, as to reduce within reassuringly narrow
limits the uncomfortable margin of uncertainty left by the transits of
Venus. In the observations of Mars made for this purpose at Ascen-
sion in 1877,* Dr. Gill employed the instrument of his predilection,
called—on the lucus & non lucendo principle—a ‘“ heliometer.”

A heliometer is a telescope of which the object glass has been sawn
in two. This does not sound like, nor would it be, an improvement for
purposes of simple star-gazing; but the end in view is different. It is
that of precisely determining the angular distances between adjacent
stars, or between a planeteand stars near it, though in many cases be-
yond the range of the ordinary micrometer. The following is the way
in which this end is compassed.

The half lenses of the object glass are separable by a very fine screw
motion, and they form independent and separable images of any object
upon which the telescope is pointed. These images unite into one when
the two segments unite to complete one circle; as they are made to
slide apart, the images to slip sideways asunder, to an extent which can
be measured with the minutest accuracy by exquisitely divided scales
read with a powerful microscope. In the actual process of observation,
the telescope is fixed upon a point midway between the stars under
scrutiny, so that the field of view is, to begin with, empty. Neither star
can-be seen. Then the segments of the object glass are moved oppo-
sitely along a line brought beforehand to agree with the line of direc-
tion between the stars, until the more westerly (say) of the pair as
imaged by one segment, and the more easterly as imaged by the other,
begin simultaneously to appear, and are at last carefully made to coin-
cide in the middle of the field. After the scales have been read, the
motion is reversed, and a similar coincidence is brought about between
the oppositely corresponding stars—that is, between the easterly mem-
ber of the pair shown by segment No. 1, and the westerly member of
the pair shown by segment No. 2. The total distance traversed is, of
course, equal to twice the distance between the stars.

The refinements, however (which can not here be explained), attend-
ant upon these operations are what make their results valuable, and
the process of educing them laborious. With the Copernican “tri-
quetrum ” the measured apparent intervals between any two of the

heavenly bodies could be depended upon to within ten minutes; with
the new Repsold heliometer the error of a single observation is less
than one-tenth of a second of arc. So that accuracy has been increased,
‘in the course of three and a half centuries, some six thousand times.
At what cost of patience and expenditure of the counted moments of
individual human lives, as the fruit of what illuminations of genius,
throes of invention, failures, and disappointments in some quarters,
compensatory triumphs in others, can never rightly be told. The prog-
ress achieved was by “leaps and bounds;” it must henceforth be by
slow and painful foot lengths, as the limit of possible accuracy is brought
imperceptibly nearer. It is not likely that the astronomical data of
three and a half centuries hence will be six thousand times more ac-
curate than those at our disposal.

The heliometer is, of all others, the instrument best adapted for the
work (exceedingly simple in principle, yet delicate to an almost incon-
ceivable degree in the details of its execution) of determining stellar
parallaxes. The diameter of the earth’s orbit affords a base line
186,000 miles in length, from opposite extremities ofwvhich—that is,
at opposite seasons of the year—the distances between the object to
be examined and two ‘‘comparison stars” are measured. The infinites-
imal alternate shift of the star nearest the earth to and from those with
which it is compared (assumed with little risk of error, to be indefi-
nitely remote) is called its “‘ parallax.” From its angular amount the
distance in miles of the star from the earth can be at once derived.

The minuteness of this little parallactic see-saw is difficult to be real-
ized by those unpracticed in such matters, A displacement of one sec-
ond on the sphere is equivalent to a shifting across the width of a
human hair placed 70 feet from the eye. But no known star has so
large a parallax as one second, which is as much as to say that no
known star is so near to us as 200,000 times the distance of the sun.
Positive results might, under these circumstances, well have been de-
spaired of; yet they have, in a number of cases, been attained, and
form the surest groundwork so far provided for investigations into the
mechanism of the skies.

Dr. Gill’s observations for stellar parallax were begun at the Cape
July 5, 1881, with the Dunecht heliometer, of which he had become the
possessor by private purchase from the Earl of Crawford. He had asa
coadjutor Dr. W. L. Elkin, who is now in very effective charge, at Yale
College, of the only heliometer yet erected on any part of the American
continent. Nine stars in all were measured, of which two gave no in-
dications of possessing any sensible parallax. Both, remarkably enough,
are brilliant stars of the first magnitude—Canopus and Beta Centauri—
which, to shine as they do, from unfathomable depths of space, must be
objects of astounding splendor. Canopus, especially, can not emit less,
and may emit a great deal more, than fifteen hundred times the light
of our sun, unless, indeed, Dr. Elkin’s “comparison stars” shofild turn

out to be physically connected, consequently, at nearly the same dis-
tance from ourselves with the giant luminary they attend. This doubt
will shortly be set at rest by Dr. Gill’s measures, now being carried out
with a different pair of stars.

Sirius was shown by the observations of 1881-83 to be at a distance
such that its light occupies nearly nine years in reaching us. Its real
brightness is that of sixty-three suns, while it attracts the semi-obscure
body circulating round it in forty-nine years, with no more than thrice
the solar power. This extraordinary luster relative to mass seems to
belong to all stars of the Sirian pattern as to spectrum, and is due most
likely in part to their elevated temperatures, in part to the scantiness
of their vaporous surroundings.

The success of the Cape investigations in this difficult branch of as-
tronomy invited their continuation on a larger scale, and with more
powerful instrumental means. The Government was accordingly in-
duced to sanction the construction, by Messrs. Repsold of Hamburg,
of a new heliometer of above 7 inches aperture, mounted last year in a
building erected,for its reception on the summit of the sunny slopes of
Observatory Hill. The first view of this great star-measuring machine
has, it must be admitted, a somewhat bewildering effect upon the un-
initiated onlooker. The eye end literally bristles with steel rods, han-
dles, and screw-heads, almost as numerous as the stops of an organ,
and requiring no less skill and knowledge for their proper use. The
revolving ‘ head” is armed with a strange-looking, radiated head-gear,
like the sails of a windmill, or a nimbus of tin sectors surviving from a
barbarous age.

Everything here has however a definite purpose. These surprising
“flappers” are, in fact, screens of wire gauze of graduated closeness,
used for equalizing the brightness of the stars in the field of view, and
so enabling the eye to hold the balance, as it were,even between them.
The complex apparatus close to the observer’s hand furnishes him with
the means of easy control over the whole of the sky-gauging mechanism
provided for him. None more perfect has been devised, yet the study
of its “errors” is the indispensable preliminary to its use.

Only the sublime end in view could render tolerable the process of
arriving at a complete “theory” of such an instrument. The patient
laboriousness so readily commended in the heroes of science costs more
than the readers of their biographies are apt toimagine. Interminable
readings of scale divisions, interminable castings-up of the columns of
decimals expressing the differences of the successive readings, are not
in themselves exciting occupations. But they must be pursued during
some hours a day for a whole year before the “division errors” of the
new heliometer can be regarded as completely abolished because per-
fectly known. Nor is this all. Elaborate corrections and interpreta-
tions of other kinds have to be added, to say nothing of endless and
anxious “precautions in the observations themselves—precautions
against personal and physiological, as well as against atmospheric and

instrumental, causes of error. Accuracy is indeed arduous; and the
astronomer who is not what the old Romans used, in their grand way,
to look down upon as a cumini sector, had better learn another profes-
sion.

Twenty-seven stars in the southern hemisphere are now being, or are
about to be, measured for parallax with the Cape heliometer. Their
selection was governed by the ultimate object of gathering information
as to the scale and plan of the marvellous aggregation of suns to which
our sun belongs, and amidst which it is moving, in an unknown orbit,
to meet unknown destinies. For this purpose, facts of two kinds are
urgently needed—facts relative to the real distribution, and facts relative
to the real movements of the stars in space. Dr. Gill’s operations, when
completed, can not fail to bring important reinforcements to our present
small store of each.

Ten stars of the first magnitude lie to the south of the celestial equa-
tor, of which nine (Alpha Centauri being already safely disposed of)
are in course of measurement at intervals of six months. The upshot
will be to give the average distance corresponding to the first order of
stellar brightness in the southern hemisphere. An analogous result
has lately been published by Dr. Elkin for the ten chief northern lumi-
naries. Their distance, “all round,” proves to be thirty-six “light-
years.” That is to say, light from their photospheres affects our senses
only after our planet has revolved, on an average, thirty-six times in
its orbit round the sun. So that all our knowledge, even of the stars
presumably nearest to the earth, refers, in thisyear 1889, to the “mean
epoch” 1853. We shall learn presently whether the ‘‘ mean epoch” for
the southern bright stars corresponds approximately to this date, or
whether a marked disparity may countenance the surmise of our eccen-
tric situation in the group of luminaries to which our sun more espe-
cially belongs.

Dr. Gill’s list includes five second magnitude stars, the annual per-
spective displacements of which (if large enough to be measurable) will
give something like a definite scale of increasing distance with de-
creasing luster. A conclusion will then be feasible as to the rate of
movement of the sun in space. The elder Struve made it about 5 miles
a second, but on the supposition of the brightest stars being between
two and three times nearer to us than they seem really to be. We can
now see that the actualspeed of the solar system can scarcely fall short
of 12, or exceed 20 miles, a second. By a moderate estimate, then, our
position in space is changing to the extent of 500,000,000 of miles annu-
ally, and a collision between our sun and the nearest fixed star would
be inevitable (were our course directed in a straight line toward it) after
the lapse of fifty thousand years!

The old problem of ‘ how the heavens move,” successfully attacked
in the solar system, has retreated to a stronghold among the stars, from
which it will be difficult to dislodge it. In the stupendous mechanism
of the sidereal universe, the acting forces can only betray themselves to
124 A SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY.

us by the varying time configurations of its parts. But as yet our
knowledge of stellar movements is miserably scanty. They are appar-
ently so minute as to become perceptible, in general, only through ob-
servations of great precision extending over a number of years. Even
the quickest-moving star would spend two hundred and fifty-seven years
in crossing an are of the heavens equal to the dise of the full moon.
Yet all the time (owing to the inconceivable distances of the objects in
motion) these almost evanescent displacements represent velocities in
many cases so enormous as to baffle every attempt to account for them.
“Runaway stars” are no longer of extreme rarity. One in the Great
Bear, known as “ Groombridge, 1830,” invisible to the naked eye, but
sweeping over at least 200 miles each second, long led the van of stellar
speed. Prof. Pritchard’s photograpic determination of the parallax of
p Cassiopeiz shows, however, that inconspicuous object not only to be
a sun about forty times as luminous as our own, but to be traveling at
the prodigious rate of 300 miles (while Dr. Elkin’s result for Arcturus
gives it a velocity of little less than 400 miles) a second!

The “express” star of the southern hemisphere, so far, is one of the
fourth magnitude situated in Toucan. Its speed of about 200 miles a
second may however soon turn out to be surpassed by some of the
rapidly-moving stars picked out for measurement at the Cape. Among
them are some pairs “drifting” together, and presumed therefore to be
connected by a special physical bond, and to lie at nearly the same dis-
tance from ourselves. This presumption will now be brought to the
test.

A remarkable and typical change has affected the aims pursued at
our southern national observatory since Dr. Gill assumed its direction.
There has been a widening of purpose matching the widened scope of
astronomical science due to the development of new methods. The
practical usefulness of the establishment was never more conspicuous
than at present. The shipping interests, railway service, and survey-
ing operations of South Africa are in immediate dependence upon it.
The whole fabric of the “old astronomy ”—so far as one hemisphere is
concerned—is held together by the re-determinations of “ fundamental”
and “ standard ” stars continually in progress at it. But while noth-
ing of what was previously held in view has been relinquished, much
of incalculable value has been added. Above all, the ideal, or purely
intellectual, side of astronomy has obtained recognition, and in a form
likely to be memorable in the history of the science.

The celestial-photographic Paris Congress of April, 1887, might be
called ‘‘ epoch making,” for this reason alone—that it marked, officially
and forever, investigations into the structure of the sidereal universe
as part of the proper duty of astronomers. These inquiries, the most
sublime of the physical kind with which the mind of man can be occu-
pied, will not henceforth be abandoned to individual caprice, to be
prosecuted by necessarily inadequate means, and neglected when those
means (as they could not fail to do) should collapse under the strain

put upon them. They will be pursued gravely, systematically, by the
concerted efforts of successive generations, through the toil of innu-
merable unpretending workers guided to effectiveness by the highest
jntelligence of the times. A measure of success is, under these circum-
stances, certain, and even a small measure of success in this direction
will suffice to broaden and deepen the channels of all future human
thought.

Hence the profound significance of the decisions of the Paris Congress,
by which an international scheme for photographically charting the
heavens and cataloguing a large proportion of their contents was set
on foot. Fortunately for its own reputation our Government, after
long delay, has adopted what might have seemed the foregone conclu-
sion that a share in this work is England’s right and duty, and has au-
thorized the construction of the requisite instruments for Greenwich and
the Cape. Before another year has elapsed they will be mounted in
their respective places and the recording process, to be carried on simul-
taneously at fourteen or fifteen observatories in every part of the world,
will have begun.

Meanwhile Dr. Gill, to whose initiatory energy the approaching reali-
zation of this great plan is due, has almost completed a preliminary task
of vital importance to its due accomplishment, as well as to sidereal
science in general. One of the most famous achievements of recent as-
tronomy is the “Bonn Durchmusterung,” a list of 324,000 stars from the
North Pole to 2 degrees south of the equator, observed by Argelander
at Bonn. Until it was compiled the smaller stars were a nameless
crowd with no recognized identity. For the purposes of science they
could scarcely be said to exist. But once

Set in note-book, learned and conned by rote,
their changes could no longer elude notice; and detected change leads
commonly to increased knowledge. A solid foundation was moreover
laid for the study of sidereal statistics, destined, perhaps, to lead to
momentous results at no distant future.

An extension of the “ Durchmusterung” to the southern hemisphere
was contemplated from the first, but was more easy to contemplate
than to execute. No southern observatory was in a condition to un-
dertake a task so colossal. Dr. Schonfeld, Argelander’s successor at
Bonn, carried, however, the enumeration as far as the southern tropic,
where it seemed likely to stop, when some surprising photographs of the
great comet of 1882, projected on wide fields of stars, taken at the
Royal Observatory with the help of Mr. Allis, of Mowbray, opened to
Dr. Gill the possibility of completing Argelander’s stellar review by
this relatively unlaborious method. And the possibility is rapidly
being converted into an accomplished fact. Two assistants, Mr. C. Ray
Woods and Mr. Sawerthal, are employed every fine night in expos-
ing plates with instruments, each consisting virtually of two telescopes,
one for concentrating upon the plates the rays of the multitudinous
stars within a field of 36 square degrees, the other for enabling the

operator to keep them steadily there until their self-portraiture is
finished. The whole heavens, south of the tropic of Capricorn, will have
been covered in duplicate by next April, after which only some supple-
mentary exposures will remain to be made.

Prof. Kapteyn, of Leyden, is meanwhile busy measuring the plates
successively transmitted to him from the Cape, and the resulting cata-
logue—the first derived from photographs—will probably be in the
hands of astronomers by the year 1892. All stars down to the ninth
magnitude, and many fainter, will be included in it to the number of
fully two hundred thousand. This important enterprise is a private
and personal one. The entire responsibility for it, financial and other,
is borne by Dr. Gill.

There is a prospect that before another year has elapsed, the vexed
question of the sun’s distance will have been definitely set at rest.
The immediate objects of measurement for the purpose with the
Cape heliometer, in combination with some other instruments of the
saine class in Germany and America, are three of the minor planets—
Iris, in October and November, 1888; Sappho and Victoria during the
summer of 1889. The position of the planet between successive pairs
of stars distributed along its path during the favorable period when it
culminates near midnight will be determined simultaneously from op-
posite sides of the equator according to a method devised by Dr. Gill,
so stringent and insistent for accuracy that the errors admitted by it
must be minute indeed. While celestial surveyors have 270 asteroids
at their disposal to mark the apexes of their triangles, the long gaps
of time between the transits of Venus need be of little concern to them.

To describe the whole of the tasks in progress at the Royal Obser-
vatory—the cometary work chiefly in the hands of Mr. Finlay, the first
assistant, the lunar, and planetary observations, the laborious correc-
tions of star places and star motions—would demand more space than
is at our command. What has here been aimed at is merely to indi-
cate the directions in which the activity of the establishment tends to
expand, and to show that these directions are representative of the
present, and must be decisive as to the future of astronomy. There is
room indeed, were the material means at hand, for further expansion.
In the spectroscopic department the Cape record is still a blank. Yet
the wise outlay of a few hundred pounds would suffice to set on foot,
under exceptionally favorable circumstances as to climate and _ situa-
tion, inquiries into the physical condition of southern stars of extreme
interest and inevitable necessity.

There is much to be learned, as well as enjoyed, from a visit to the
Cape Observatory. Not only the work done there, but the manner in
which it is done, is impressive. Lessons of earnestness of purpose,
stability of aim, and cheerful self-devotion can scarcely be missed by
the itinerant lover of astronomy, in whose mind they will be tempered
and illuminated by reminiscences of the beauty of flowers by day and
of the glory of stars at night.
SOME APPLICATIONS OF PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS
TO GEOLOGY.*

By C. CHREE, M. A.

I.—SOME PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATICAL DATA.

Many of the terms employed in treating of the properties and condi-
tions of matter have in common use a somewhat vague meaning. The
meaning, so far as clearly outlined, is also only too often different from
that which the physicist intends to convey. As regards terms such as
rigid, solid, plastic, viscous, etc., it seems to me that even eminent
geologists are apt to be misled by the popular usage, so that they fall
into error respecting the data which mathematical and physical science
places at their disposal. It thus seems advisable on the present occa-
sion to clear the ground by briefly considering the sense attached to
these terms by the more exact school of physicists. To render the fol-
lowing statements intelligible it is necessary to explain the meaning
scientifically attached to the terms stress and strain. By stress is
meant a force referred to unit of area of the surface across which it
acts; by strain the increase in the distance between two material points
divided by the original distance. For instance, if a vertical bar n
square inches in cross section fixed at the upper end, sustain a load of
t tons, and the load be uniformly distributed over the cross section, the
longitudinal stress is tn, taking the square inch as unit of area and the
weight of 1 ton as unit of force. Ifa portion of the bar increase in
length from 100 to 100.01 inches, and the increase be uniformly distrib-

uted over the portion lengthened, the longitudinal strain is (100,01—
100) x 10—, or .0001.

The writers who have had most influence on the present scientific
usage of English terms dealing with physical properties are unquestion-
ably Prof. Clerk Maxwell and Sir William Thomson. The former
gives the following definitions in his Theory of Heatt: ‘‘A body which
when subjected to a stress experiences no strain would, if it existed, be
called a perfectly rigid body. There are no such bodies. =

128 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

“A body which when subjected to a given stress at a given tempera-
ture experiences a strain of definite amount, which does not increase
when the stress is prolonged, and which disappears completely when
the stress is removed, is called a perfectly elastic body.”

“Ifthe form of the body is found to be permanently altered when
the stress exceeds a certain value, the body is said to be soft or plastic,
and the state of the body when alteration is just going to take place
is called the limit of perfect elasticity.”

“Tf the stress, when it is maintained constant,causesastrain - -— -
which increases continually with the time, the substance is said to be
viscous.”

A viscous material may be either solid or fluid. It is regarded by
Maxwell as fluid when any stress, however small, produces a constantly
increasing strain. Maxwell draws a distinction between elasticity of
bulk and elasticity of shape—the latter being peculiar to solids—which
is more fully treated of by Sir William Thomson. A body possesses
perfect elasticity of bulk when on the removal of the stress it returns
to its original volume, even though the form of its surface be perma-
nently altered. Both writers regard it as certain that solid bodies will
retain perfect elasticity of bulk under compressive stresses which far
exceed the limit of elasticity of shape. The following statement em-
bodies the views of Sir W. Thomson*: “If we reckon by the amount
of pressure, there is probably no limit to the elasticity of bulk in the
direction of the increase of pressure for any solid or fluid; but whether
continued augmentation produces continued diminution of bulk toward
zero without limit, or whether for any or every solid or fluid there is a
limit toward which it may be reduced in bulk, but smaller than which
no degree of pressure, however great, can condense it, is a question
which can not be answered in the present state of science.”

Maxwell, by denying the existence of a perfectly rigid body, main-
tains that every solid can sustain stress or transmit force only by suf-
fering strain. Thus, on depositing a feather on the most solid block of
iron we produce in the iron a system of strains, infinitesimally small it
is true, but whose existence can no more be questioned than the exist-
ence across the surface separating the iron and the feather of forces
balancing the portion of the feather’s weight left uncompensated by
the air pressure. The hypothesis quoted above from Sir W. Thomson,
that there may be a limit beyond which no body can be compressed, is
not inconsistent with Maxwell’s statement. The hypothesis regards
the ratio of the increment of strain to the increment of pressure as ulti-
mately becoming infinitesimally small, but it in no way implies that
this ratio ever becomes absolutely zero.

In a solid bar, supposed perfectly elastic, exposed to longitudinal
stress, the ratio of the stress to the strain is styled Young’s modulus. In
many materials Young’s modulus varies in magnitude according to the

s

* Mathematical and Physical Papers, vol, 1, pp. 7-8,
PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 129

direction in which the axis of the bar is taken. Thus, in ordinary
woods there is a marked difference between the value of Young’s mod-
ulus in the direction of the pith of the tree and in any perpendicular
direction. Materials in which Young’s modulus is independent of the
direction in which the axis of the experimental bar is taken are termed
isotropic; all others are termed veolotropiec.

In an isotropic elastic solid it is supposed, on the ordinary British or
biconstant theory, that the value of Young’s modulus, E, alone is insuf-
ficient to define the elastic structure, and that some other elastic con-
stant must be known. For many purposes the most convenient addi-
tional constant is the ratio of the lateral contraction to the longitudinal
extension—each measured per unit of length—in a bar exposed to sim-
ple longitudinal traction. For instance, if the diameter of a bar under
uniform longitudinal stress change from 10 to 9-9997 inches the lateral
contraction is 0:00003, and if the longitudinal strain be 0-0001, the ratio
of lateral contraction to longitudinal extension is 0:3. This ratio is
termed Poisson’s ratio, and is represented here by 7.

On the uniconstant theory of isotropy 7 must have the value 0-25,
which certainly accords well with experiments on glass and some of
the more common metals, especially iron and steel under certain con-
ditions.

On the biconstant theory 7 may have any value within certain limits.
The existence of these limits, it must be admitted, is seldom recog-
nized, and experimental results are not infrequently referred to which
are inconsistent with the view taken here, viz, that 7) must lie between
0 and 0.5. If, however, 7 were negative in any material a circular bar
of this material, when subjected to uniform longitudinal tension, would
increase in diameter; while if 7 were greater than 0.5, the bar, when
fixed at one end and subjected to a torsional couple at the other, would
twist in the opposite direction to the applied force. Until these phe-
nomena are Shown to present themselves in isotropic materials—and the
experimental verification ought to be easy—it seems legitimate to sup-
pose that when experimentalists deduce values for 7 which lie outside
of these limits, their experiments refer to bodies whose constitution is
different from what is assumed in their mathematical calculations.

The properties attributed to an isotropic elastic solid by the ordinary
mathematical theory are as follows:

(A) The strain must be elastic, 7. ¢., it must disappear on the removal
of the stress.

(B) The ratio of stress to strain must be independent of the magni-
tude of the stress, or, in Prof. Pearson’s words, the stress-strain rela-
tion must be linear.

(C) The strains must be small.

(D) The values of Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio in a bar of
the material must be independent of the direction in which the axis of
the bar is taken.

H. Mis. 334, pt. 1——9
130 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

The last property alone distinguishes isotropic from wolotropic elastic
solids.

(A) answers to Maxwell’s definition, but (B) and (C) are not assumed
by Maxwell. In other words, a solid may be perfectly elastic without
showing a linear stress-strain relation, or possibly even after the strains
have become large. Thus, for the sake of clearness, I shall call Max-
well’s limit of perfect elasticity the physical limit, and the limits sup-
plied by (B) and (C) the first and second mathematical limits respec-
tively.

It is not infrequently taken for granted that the physical and the
first mathematical limit are necessarily identical, ¢. ¢., that the elasticity
is certainly not perfect when the stress-strain relation ceases to be
linear. According however to some experimentalists cast iron is as
perfectly elastic as any other metal in the sense of Maxwell’s definition,
but the stress-strain relation for even small strains is sensibly not
linear.* This is, of course, a question for experimentalists to decide,
but in any case where their final verdict is, that the stress-strain rela-
tion is sensibly not linear, the employment of the ordinary mathemati-
cal theory is unjustifiable. It must be admitted that the principle (C)
is a very vague one, leading to no exact limit, and that it seldom re-
ceives any very formal acknowledgment. It is, however, clearly ree-
ognized, and a reason for it assigned in the following statement, due to
Thomson and Tait:+ “The mathematical theory of elastic solids imposes
no restrictions on the magnitudes of the stresses except in so far as that
mathematical necessity requires the strains to be small enough to admit of
the principle of super-position.” The italics are mine. ‘The meaning is
that the strains must be small fractions whose squares are negligible
compared to themselves. If this principle be neglected and the mathe-
matical equations be supposed to apply when the strains are large, the
difficulty of giving them a consistent physical interpretation is very
great if not wholly unsurmountable.

In most materials having any claim to be regarded as elastic solids
the stress-strain relation for most ordinary stress systems certainly
ceases to be linear while the strains are still small. We shall thus in
the meantime leave the condition (C) out of account, though we shall
have to return to it in treating of the so-called “theories of rupture.”

The existence of the properties (A), (B), (D), presupposed by the
mathematical theory, is determined not solely by the chemical constitu-
tion of the body, but also by the treatment to which it has been sub-
jected. Thus a freshly annealed copper wire may, when loaded for the
first time, be far from satisfying conditions (A) or (B), and yet by the
process of loading and unloading itmay be brought into a state of ease,
wherein these two conditions are very approximately, if not exactly

fulfilled, so long as the stress does no exceed a certain limit. Again,
the fact that a large mass of metal is sensibly isotropic is no sufficient
reason for attributing isotrophy to the same metal when rolled into
thin plates or drawn into thin wires.

It is quite possible that the three conditions (A), )B), and (D) repre-
sent an ideal state which is never actually reached, and that a diver-
gence may always be shown by the use of very delicate apparatus. If
this be true, then the results obtained by the mathematical theory can
not claim absolute correctness. It seems however to be satisfactorily
established that many materials in the state of ease satisfy these con-
ditions with at least a very close approach to exactness, so that the
results of the mathematical theory when properly restricted are then
sufficiently exact for practical purposes.

From the preceding statements it will be seen that it is of the utmost
importance to know what are the limits within which the conditions
assumed by the mathematical theory are satisfied with sufficient
exactness to justify its application. This question must of course be
settled by experiment, but it is beset by various difficulties which ought
to be clearly recognized. These arise in part from the serious obstacles
in the way of a complete experimental knowledge, and in part from
the want of a proper understanding between those interested in the
practical and theoretical sides of the subject, and a consequent confu-
sion in the terms used. .

To avoid complication let us begin by supposing the mathematical
limit of perfect elasticity to coincide with the physical. Let us con-
sider the simple case of a bar under uniform longitudinal traction. We
may suppose the bar isotropic, and in consequence of suitable treat-
ment perfectly elastic for loads not exceeding L; No mechanical
treatment, we Shall suppose, can render it perfectly elastic for loads
ereater than Ly. It does not follow that a load L, will necessarily rup-
ture the bar either immediately or in course of time, but simply that
for any load greater than L, the strain is not perfectly elastic. Increas-
ing the load from zero we should reach a load L;, probably greater
than L,, that would in process of time rupture the bar, or a load Ly
greater than L; that produces immediate rupture. All these loads are
supposed to refer to unit of area.

Now in the initial state of the bar we should be entitled to apply the
mathematical theory only until the load L; was reached. When we
aim at finding the utmost capability of the material under longitudinal
load, we may perhaps apply the theory until the load L, is reached, but
here we must stop. ‘To apply it until the loads L; or L, are reached—
assuming these greater than L,—is clearly inadmissible.

Results of a similar kind hold for all the comparatively simple forms
of stress—such as pure compression, torsion, or bending—in which
practical men are interested. There are limits to the state of perfect
elasticity lower than the limits at which rupture takes place, at least
immediately.
Foz SOME APPLICATIONS OF

The usual aim of the engineer is that no part of the structure he is
designing should ever be strained beyond the elastic limit, and this
end he of course desires to obtain with the least possible expenditure
of material. Thus ideally he might be expected to calculate the dimen-
sions of each piece, so that for the maximum load it is to be subjected
to it shall just not pass beyond the limit of perfect elasticity. There
are however in general agencies, such as wind pressure, dynamical
action of a moving load, ete., whose effects are not very fully under-
stood and whose magnitude can not always be foreseen. Thus it is
the custom to allow a wide margin for contingencies. Now the limit
of perfect elasticity seems the natural quantity to employ in allowing
for this margin, but the uncertainties attending its determination are
such that it is customary to employ the breaking load instead. The
breaking load for the particular kind of stress the member in question is
to be exposed to is divided by some number, e. g., 4 or 5, called a factor
of safety, and the dimensions of the member are calculated so that its
estimated load shall not exceed the quotient of the breaking load by
the factor of safety. The engineer varies the factor of safety accord-
ing to the nature of the load, and according to the confidence he pos-
sesses in the uniformity of the material and in the completeness of his
knowledge as to the vicissitudes the structure is exposed to. It has
thus come to pass that attention has been largely directed to the
breaking loads, and theories have been constructed which aim profess-
edly at supplying a law for the tendency to rupture, under the most
general stress systems possible, of materials whose rupture points have
been found under the ordinary simple stress systems employed in
experiment.

There are only two such theories of rupture for isotropic materials
that at present possess any general repute. To understand them the
reader requires to know that for any stress system there are at every
point in an isotropic elastic material three principal stresses along three
mutually orthogonal directions, and likewise three principal strains
whose directions coincide with those of the principal stresses. If an
imaginary small cube of the material be taken at the point considered
with its faces perpendicular respectively to the three principal stresses,
then no tangential stresses act over these faces. In a bar under a uni-
formly distributed longitudinal stress L per unit ot cross section, two
of the principal stresses are everywhere zero, and the third is parallel
to the axis and equals L. If E be Young’s modulus, and 7 Poisson’s
ratio for the material, supposed isotropic and elastic, the greatest prin-
cipal strain is everywhere L/E and its direction is parallel to the axis.
The two remaining principal strains are each —7L/E and they may be
supposed to have for their directions any two mutually perpendicular
linesin the cross section of the bar.

One of the theories referred to above is, that when the algebraic dif-
ference between the greatest and least of the principal stresses at any
PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 133

point—a pressure being reckoned negative—attains a certain value,
rupture will ensue at this point. Thus, if in descending order of mag-
nitude, the principal stresses at a point be T,, T., T;, then T;—T; is the
stress difference* at this point, and the theory asserts that rupture will
ultimately ensueif the stress difference anywhere equals L;, the load for
ultimate rupture of a bar of the material by longitudinal traction; while
if the stress difference anywhere equals L,, the load for immediate rup-
ture by longitudinal traction, then immediate rupture will ensue.

The second theory, which is supported by the great authority of de
Saint-Venant,t replaces the stress difference of the first theory by the
ereatest strain. It thus asserts that the condition for rupture is found
by equating the largest value found anywhere for the greatest strain
to the longitudinal strain answering to longitudinal traction L;, or to
that answering to the traction L,, according as the rupture is ultimate
or immediate. This theory maintains that extension in some direction
is necessary for rupture.

The two theories may, as in the case of pure longitudinal traction,
lead to the same result; but in general they do not, so one at least of
them must be wrong. When we examine the theories, still supposing
the mathematical and physical limits of perfect elasticity the same, a
very obvious difficulty presents itself. It is assumed that the stress-
difference and greatest strain are derived by the mathematical theory;
but that theory applies only so long as the material is everywhere per-
fectly elastic, whereas rupture, at least when immediate, presents itself
after the elastic limit has been passed. Thus if the application of the
mathematical theory leads to values for the maximum stress difference
and greatest strain equal to the values of these quantities answering
to rupture, at all events when immediate, the true conclusion would
seem to be that the fundamental hypothesis on which the treatment
proceeds, viz, that the material follows the laws assumed by the mathe-
matical theory, has been shown to be incorrect. Nothing has been
proved except that the elastic limit must be passed and that the mathe-
matical theory does not apply.

The only logical way of interpreting the theories is to suppose that the
maximum stress difference and greatest strain are to be compared not
with the values that answer to rupture, but either with those that
answer to the limit of perfect elasticity or with those derived by dividing
the values answering to rupture by some factor of safety. This factor
must then be large enough to preventthe limit of perfect elasticity being
passed. Thus from either point of view we encounter a formidable diffi-
culty, viz, the uncertainty of what is the limit of perfect elasticity.

134 “SOME APPLICATIONS OF

We have supposed that a bar may be brought into a state in which ~
it is perfectly elastic for longitudinal tractions not exceeding L,. An-
swering to this we have L, for the stress difference, and L,/E for the
greatest strain. Now if the two theories described above really apply
to the limit of perfect elasticity, the one would seem to maintain that
L, is the limiting value of the stress difference, the other that L./K is
the limiting value of the greatest strain for all possible stress systems
in material of the same kind as that in the bar. The complete experi-
mental proof or disproof of such theories is not likely to be easy. Thus
taking for instance the case of longitudinal traction, suppose it were.
shown that a certain method of treatment which raises the elastic limit
for load parallel to the axis of a bar does not raise the elastic limit for
longitudinal load in a bar whose length lay in the cross section of the
original bar. This would only suffice to prove that the treatment
adopted did not give a fixed elastic limit the same for all kinds of
strain, it would leave the possibility of such a limit being obtained in
some other way an open question.

In the preceding remarks the mathematical and physical limits of
perfect elasticity have been supposed identical. When they differ, the
mathematical limit is of course that which must be employed in deter-
mining therange of the mathematical theory. It will certainly not ex-
ceed the physical limit. I may add that while for certain structures
such as isolated boilers the physical limit may most nearly concern the
practical engineer, in other structures, such as girder bridges, the
stress-strain relation is assumed to be linear in designing the several
parts, so that the first mathematical limit is then of the utmost practi-
eal importance,

In the previous discussion of the stress-difference and greatest-strain
theories, as settling the limits of application of the mathematical
theory, it has been taken for granted that the condition (C) was safe-
guarded by them. Now in most ordinary systems of loading this is
probably the case, but it is not always so. For instance, if we assume
the mathematical theory to hold, a solid isotropic sphere under a
uniform surface-pressure shows none but negative strains, and the
three principal stresses are everywhere equal. Thus the greatest
Strain is everywhere negative, and the stress difference everywhere
zero. This is true irrespective of the magnitude of the surface pressure,
and so, according to both theories, the stress-strain relation would be
linear and the mathematical theory would apply, however large the
pressure was. According to the theories, one might continue to employ
mathematical formule which indicated a reduction of the sphere to one-
millionth of its original volume. It is obvious, however, that a re-
duction of the volume by even a tenth would produce strains which aie
probably far in excess of those admitted by the principle (C). In
formulating an objection to the universal application of the theories, I
have preferred to attack them on the side of the principle (C) so as to

show clearly that the high authority of Thomson and Tait is on my
side. The example considered raises however what seems to me at
least an equally strong argument against the theories from the side of
the principle (B). For we must remember that the stresses inside the
material are determined by the intermolecular forces. Now whatever
molecules may be, and however they may act on one another, it seems
incredible that the molecular forces should lead to one and the same
stress-strain relation, however much the mean molecular distance may
be reduced. The fact that Sir W. Thomson regards the existence of
an irreducible minimum volume as possible may, I think, be taken as
proof that he is opposed to the view that it is possible for the stress-
strain relation to remain linear under such circumstances. It thus
seems to me, on various grounds, that the inevitable conclusion is that
while one or other of the two theories may, under ordinary circum-
stances, be sufficient to define the limits of the mathematical theory,
the result must always be checked by reference to the condition (C),
or, what comes to the same thing, we must give up the mathematical
theory when the strains it indicates are such as would markedly alter
the mean molecular distance.

I next proceed to discuss the possibility of the earth’s possessing an
elastic solid structure, deriving the necessary data from three papers
published in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
For brevity these will be referred to as (a),* ( b),t and (c).f

The strains due to the action of the sun and moon being compara-
tively insignificant, we need consider only the “centrifugal” forces due
to the earth’s diurnal rotation, and the gravitational forces due to the
mutual attraction of its parts.

The data supplied by geology do not enable us to formulate any likely
theory as to a probable distribution of density and elasticity through-
out the earth regarded as an elastic solid. All we know with certainty
is that the surface strata are on an average considerably below the
mean density, that they differ widely in character, many being markedly
weolotropic, and that frequently they are far from horizontal. Thus,
as our object is merely to consider what are the possibilities on the
hypothesis of solidity, it will be best to make the hypothesis as simple
as possible. Now, if the deviations from the earth’s mean density and
from an isotropic elastic structure were limited to the surface strata,
where alone we are certain of their existence, the effect of the “ centrif-
ugal” forces would be nearly the same as if these deviations did not
exist; but the effect of the eravitational forces on the eccentricity of
the surface may depend largely on the nature of the deviations. I thus
propose to treat the problem in stages.

The first stage neglects entirely the gravitational forees and regards
the earth as a slightly spheroidal body—which has departed from the
spherical form in consequence of its rotation—of uniform density and

form angular velocity » about its polar axis.

Let a denote the mean radius, d the difference between the equatorial
and polar semiaxes of the surface, EH Young’s modulus, and 77 Poisson’s

In the case of an originally spherical solid assuming the shape of the
earth under rotation, it is of no practical importance whether we re-
gard «as the radius of the original spherical surface, or as the mean
radius under rotation, nor does it matter practically whether the density
be supposed uniform previous to or during the rotation. There is, it
is true, for all values of 7 except 0.5, a slight increase in the volume,t
and consequent diminution in the mean density accompanying the ro-
tation, but for our present purpose this may be neglected.

The mathematical solution on which Table I is based treats the
spherical surface of radius a as that over which the conditions for a
free surface are satisfied. Now,some uncertainty may exist, depending
on the physical interpretation put upon the mathematical equations,
whether these surface conditions should be applied over what is the
surface before the displacement—in this case the surface of the true
sphere which it is assumed the earth would form if the rotation dis-
appeared—or over what is the surface during the rotation. This un-
certainty might constitute a very serious difficulty if the deformations
were supposed to be large, a contingency which may arise when the
limitation (C) in the magnitude of the strains is neglected; but in sueh
problems as the present where the strains are, as we shall see presently,
of the same order of magnitude as occur in ordinary engineering strue-
tures, it is of no material consequence. In the present case complete
assurance on this point may be derived from Figs. 1 and 2, Pl. 1m of
(¢c), which show the changes induced by rotation in the equatorial and
polar semi-axes of spheroids of various shapes.

This table will give a general idea of the limits within which EK may
reasonably be expected to lie, though some of the data refer to mate-
rial which is hardly likely to have been isotropic. It shows thatif the
influence of the gravitational forces on the eccentricity were negligi-
ble,—which however is not the case,—the earth, though perfectly solid
and elastic, might reasonably be expected to display not a smaller, but
aconsiderably greater eccentricity than 1t actually does.

The question next arises whether the strains and stresses produced
by the rotation are such as are consistent with the principles on which
the application of the mathematical theory rests. In the actual case
of the earth this question is of importance only in exceptional cireum-
stances, owing to the preponderating influence of the gravitational
forces; still it possesses sufficient interest to claim separate considera-
tion. The following table gives a sufficiently close approximation to
the numerical results obtained for the rotating body treated above,
when for E are substituted the values which answer to the production
by rotation alone of an eccentricity equal to that of the earth.

188 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

The maximum stress-difference and the greatest strain, aS given in
the table, are both found at the center.

The result on the stress-difference theory is nearly independent of 7,
and is more unfavorable in every case than that given by the greatest
strain theory to the view that the material remains perfectly elastic.
A stress of 16 tons per square inch is not one that an engineer would
view with complacency in any structure intended to be permanent, but
it is a low value for the tenacity of good wrought iron. A stress of
even 33 tons per square inch can easily be borne without rupture by
good steel, and is perhaps not in excess of the stress under which the
best steel remains perfectly elastic. The greatest strains are not of
such a magnitude as to raise any presumption against the linearity of
the stress-strain relation. Thus, according to all the tests, it is quite
possible that an originally spherical solid of the earth’s mass but
devoid of gravitation should remain solid and elastic while assuming
the form of the earth under rotation. Its material, however, at least
if homogeneous and isotropic, would require to possess an unusually
high limit of perfect elasticity.

The next subject for consideration is how the question is affected by
the existence of gravitational forces such as are found in the case of the
earth. The strains and stresses in a slightly oblate spheroid, treated
as an isotropic elastic solid, all consist of two parts, the first part being
the same as if the surface were truly spherical, the second depending
on the eccentricity. It is the second parts that represent the action of
the gravitational forces in modifying the eccentricity, but these parts
are in general insignificant so far as the question of the applicability
of the mathematical theory is concerned. I shall therefore postpone
consideration of them until an account has been given of the strains
and stresses which are independent of the eccentricity.

The mathematical difficulties in applying the ordinary theory to the
case of a homogeneous solid gravitating sphere are trifling, but the
difficulty of putting a physical interpretation upon the mathematical
expressions answering to most values of 7 is such as very forcibly to
call attention to the necessity of the limitation (C). Since the gravita-
tional force at an element of a solid sphere depends not only on the to-
tal mass which lies nearer the center than does the element, but also on
its absolute distance from the center, we must assume that the equations
supplied by the ordinary mathematical theory, if they apply at all, hold
for the position of final equilibrium after the deformations have taken
place. This seemingly requires that strain should be defined as the
ratio of the increase of length to the final length, which is not in ae-
cordance with the usual interpretation of Hooke’s law unless the square
of the strain be negligible. Supposing the internal equations to refer
to the final deformed condition, the surface equations will undoubtedly —
also refer to this condition. Thus, so far as the terms independent of
the eccentricity are concerned, we may suppose the mathematical theory
+e

applied to a sphere whose density p is uniform throughout, and whose

radius @ equals the earth’s mean radius.

In this case the maximum stress-difference and the algebraically
greatest strain are both found at the surface. Let us denote these by
S and § respectively; and let s) denote the greatest compression, which
occurs at the center, and w, the radial displacement at the surface,

Assuming for a moment these results to hold for a sphere in which
g=gravityt at the earth’s surface, op =5:5 times the density of water,
and @ =3950 miles, the following are the approximate numerical values
answering to the values 0, -25, and 0°5 of 7:

Fora given value of 7 the value of S is independent ef E. It dimin-
ishes continually as 7 increases from zero. Since the value of s depends
on KE, I have given the value of Es, or the longitudinal stress which
would produce in a bar of the material a strain equal s. The value of
Es has a maximum of about 1,520 tons weight per square inch, for 7=
1— v1/2 or 0.293 nearly.

For 7=0-5 the values s) and uw, are zero supposing E finite, but for
other values of 7 one can obtain numerical measures of these quantities
only by assigning numerical values to EK. Now, if the earth were an
elastic solid truly spherical but for its rotation, the value of E answer-
ing to a given value of 7 would be determined from the eccentricity of
the surface. But the action of the gravitational forces, as will be seen

face as equal to the weight of 1 gram. In reality of course ‘‘ gravity” includes the

140 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

more clearly presently, largely reduces the eccentricity which rotation
would produce in a sphere of given material. Thus the eccentricity
varying inversely as EH, the value of E answering to a given eccentric-
ity is necessarily considerably smaller when gravitational forces act
along with the “ centrifugal” than when the latter act alone. Since the
surface strata are very variable and of much smaller mean density than
the earth as a whole, any calculation of the reduction of our estimates
of E, when gravitational forces are allowed for, which treats the earth
as of uniform density can not lay claim to great accuracy. For this
reason, and also because I am specially desirous not to overstate the
case against the applicationof the mathematical theory, I have, in cal-
culating the values of s) and wu, in Table rv, ascribed to E the values it
would possess in the total absence of gravitational forces, viz., the
values 1020 x 10° for 77 =0 and 1220 x 10° for 77=0°25 in the same units as
before. The numerical values ascribed to s) and uw, in the table are thus
essentially minima, which would in reality have to be increased proba-
bly to a considerable extent.

It will be seen from the formule and from Table Iv that when 7 is
zero or is small, the application of the mathematical theory would be
fully justified on the greatest strain theory, while utterly condemned
on the stress-difference theory. The principle (C) is in this case en-
tirely in agreement with the stress-difference theory, and the applica-
tion of the mathematical theory can in fact be supported only by those
who reject this principle, and consider it possible for the stress-strain
relation to remain linear though a solid sphere is reduced to one-fourth
or less of its original volume.

Noticing from (1) and (2) that Es/S=2y7, we see that for all values of
7 less than 0-5 the stress-difference theory is less favorable to the view
that the mathematical theory is applicable than the greatest-strain
theory. Ifthere is any truth in either theory, the earth’s material
can not possibly possess a linear stress-strain relation for values of 7
such as 0°25 (7. e. with a structure such as that of the metals) unless it
be of a strength compared to which that of steel is insignificant. For
such values of 7 the strains are also enormously in excess of those
which can be admitted according to the principle (C).

When, however, 77 approaches the limiting value 0:5 a complete
change comes over the features of the case. The maximum stress
difference and all the strains diminish, eventually vanishing when
y='d. Thus none of the objections hitherto encountered can be urged
against the application of the mathematical theory when 7 equals or
nearly equals 0-5, To the exact value 0-5 of 7 there is, I admit, a physi-
cal objection, which would doubtless have been urged by Maxwell, viz,
that, supposing Young’s modulus to be finite, this implies the mate-
rial to be absolutely incompressible. There is however no obvious

data from which they conclude that india-rubber is such a material.
,

PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 141

physical objection to the hypothesis that the material is very nearly
incompressible, 7. ¢. that 0°5—7 is very small;* and an isotropic sphere
with such a structure would, according to all our tests, remain per-
fectly elastic when possessed of the earth’s mass and exposed to its
gravitational forces.

In our previous estimate of the value of E the action of the gravita-
tional forces in reducing the eccentricity was not taken into account.
If the principles we have laid down as regulating the applicability of
the mathematical theory be conceded, we need only consider the case
when 0°5—y is very small; and since the formule show that in this
case a small variation in the value of 7 is of little consequence, we may
for simplicity suppose 7,=0-5 exactly.

Jn order to show the nature of the uncertainty that must in reality
be attached to the result, it seems desirable to give a general idea of
the way in which the existence of gravitational forces affects the eccen-
tricity. Let us imagine, then, that over the surface of a perfect sphere
weightless matter is piled up, which transforms the surface into that
of a slightly oblate spheroid whose polar and equatorial semiaxes are
respectively a—2d/3 and a+d/3. Now suppose the heaped-up mate-
rial to become heavy. Thepressure it exerts on the surface below it
is greatest in the equator and is zero at the poles. Thus the originally
spherical surface will tend to sink at the equator and to rise at the
poles; consequently the difference d between the equatorial and polar
semiaxes of the sphroidal surface will diminish, but the diminution is
clearly less the smaller the density of the heaped-up material.

It must be understood that this does not profess to be a complete
account of what actually happens; but it may suffice to show that the
gravitational forces tend to reduce the eccentricity which the centrifu-
gal forces tend to develop, and also that this reduction may depend
largely on the density of the surface layers. Ifthe departure of the
surface layers from the earth’s mean density occurs mainly near the
equator, then the action of the gravitational forces in reducing the
eccentricity may be much less than it would seem to be on the hypoth-
esis of an earth of uniform density.

Treating the density as uniform and 7 as equai; 0:5, [ find that, for
a given value of I, the existence of the gravitational forces would in
such a case as that of the earth reduce the difference between the
equatorial and polar diameters called for by the rotation in the ratio of
9 : 40 approximately*. Thus, for a given eccentricity, the value of E
when the gravitational forces act is to its value when the centrifugal
forces alone exist as 9:40. Soin the supposed case of the earth, we
should have to reduce E from 141 x 10’ to 32 x 107 grams weight per square
centim. The maximum stress-difference reduces to 7-2 tons weight per
square inch. The greatest strain remains 0.0018, as before, but it would
answer to a purely longitudinal stress of only 3:6 tons per square inch.

*Cf. (a) formula (21), p. 283, and (5), p. 287.
142 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

Owing to the less density of the surface strata these reductions may be
considerably too great, so that itis advisable to regard 32 x 10" as essen-
tially a lower limit to the value of E. As stated above, the numerical
result for the value of E would be but little altered if we supposed 7
slightly less than 0-5; but unless 0-57 be very small, the terms inde-
pendent of the eccentricity become of importance in estimating the
maximum stress difference and greatest strain.

The conclusion to which the previous investigations leads is that none
of the principles at present recognized in the biconstant theory of
isotropy are opposed to the hypothesis that the earth possesses in its
interior an isotropic elastic solid structure with a linear stress strain
relation, provided its material be very nearly incompressible. But the
hypothesis that the material in the interior shows an isotropic, elastic
structure, such as that of the ordinary metals under the ordinary con-
ditions, to which they are exposed on the earth’s surface, can be main-
tained only by those who are prepared to reject the usual theories of
the rupture, the limitation (C) in the size of the strains, and the argu-
ment introduced here from the theory of intermolecular forces. This
raises no presumption against the hypothesis that the interior 1s in a
perfectly solid state, and possessed of such a chemical constitution,
Say, as iron, if it be admitted thatit is of a material in which the lin-
earity of the stress-strain relation ceases when the compression becomes
large.

The results obtained raise no presumption for or against the theory
that the earth isin a liquid or plastic state. They merely show that
any argument against the possibility of an elastic solid structure in a
body of the earth’s form is without foundation; and that any argument
based on the destructive tendency of the enormous gravitational forces
in a solid of its mass is inconclusive, even as directed against such
structures as are compassed by the ordinary mathematical theory. It
has not been shown that an exolotropic solid structure of some kind, or
of a variety of kinds, may not satisfy all the conditions as well as or
even better than a nearly incompressible isotropic material. The pre-
sumption is, in fact, that the conditions may be satisfied in an infinite
number of ways.

It must be borne in mind that there may be fatal objections to an
elastic solid structure which do not arise immediately from the theory
of elasticity. Such an objection may arise from the rapid increase with
the depth shown by the temperature near the earth’s surface. My
principal reason for referring to this is to point out that the common
argument against the production of fluidity by the high internal tem-
perature (viz, an assumed raising of the melting point by pressure) has
just as much weight for a nearly incompressible solid earth as for any
other, because while the stress difference in such an earth is small the
internal pressures are very large.

Before passing to the second part of the paper, I have to confess that
PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 143

there is no reason to believe that some of the limitations assigned here
to the application of the mathematical theory will be accepted by all
or even by a majority of the elasticians. In fact, the mathematical
theory has actually been applied by several recent writers under cir-
cumstances when most or all of the limitations proposed here are vio-
lated. For instance, this is to a certain extent the case in Prof. Dar-
win’s paper* “On the stresses caused in the interior of the earth by
the weight of continents and mountains.” In the principal part of the
paper he supposes 7=0.5, when, as we have seen, none of the objections
apply; but in his § 10, in order “to know how far the results - - -
may differ, if the elastic solid be compressible,” he supposes that while
the rigidity constant is finite the bulk modulus is very small. In other
words, he applies mathematical formula which assume 7 as nearly equal
to —1. Such avalue has been here regarded as impossible. It should
also be noticed that if 7) were equal —1 then E would vanish, and if
7 be nearly —1 the value of EK must be very small. Thus the strains and
displacements given by equations 2 to 4 would, in the case supposed
by Prof. Darwin, be enormously greater than even those given in Table
Iv. I do not observe, however, that either in the paper itself or in
one supplementary? to it Prof. Darwin makes any explicit reference to
the terms in the strain independent of the angular co-ordinates, from
which the equations 1 to 4 are derived. I am thus unable to say
whether his neglect of the limitations that these terms are here regarded
as setting to the application of the mathematical theory is intentional
or not. Again, in a recent papert ‘On Sir William Thomson’s esti-
mate of the rigidity of the earth,” Mr. Love has also considered the prob-
lem of the earth treated as an isotropic elastic sphere, more especially for
the value of 0.25 of » In his equations 14 and 18 Mr. Love determines
the values of two arbitrary constants which occur in the terms inde-
pendent of the angular co-ordinates, and it is easily seen that the ex-
pression he would thence obtain for these terms is identical with mine.§
After determining the second constant he however dismisses the sub-
ject with the remark, “This - - - gives the mean radial displace-
ment, a matter which need not detain us here.” So far as I can see,
Mr. Love makes no reference to any principle such as C, nor to the
possibility of the stress-strain relation ceasing to be linear.

I ought also to explain that in my paper (a), directing my attention
solely to the theories of rupture, I left out of sight any such limitation
as (B) or (C), and treated the case of an earth in which 7=0 as one in
which, according to the greatest-strain theory of rupture, the mathe-
matical theory was applicable. I also failed to notice that the case
n=0.5 was sanctioned by the greatest-strain theory as well as by the
' stress-difference theory.

IlL.—-SOME GEOLOGICAL THEORIES.

The belief that the present spheroidal form of the earth necessar-
ily betokens a previous liquid, or at least, plastic, condition seems
among geologists almost as universal as the belief that the earth but
for the development of rotation must have been a spherical body.
Whether this latter conclusion has any satisfactory basis apart from
philosophical speculations it is not my present object to inquire. But
supposing, for the sake of argument, that the natural form of the earth
as undisturbed by rotation is spherical, the conclusion that it ever was
in a liquid or even in a plastic state throughout is, according to the
preceding results, not established by its present spheroidal form. Yet
even in such a standard work as Geikie’s Text-book of Geology, after
reading the discussion on p. 12 and the foot-note attached, I fail to de-
tect a trace of the idea that the polar flattening might be called forth
by rotation in a truly solid body.

Various geological writers, it is true, speak of a solid earth as capa-
ble of changing its form, but they seem in reality to regard the change
as due to rupture or to the development of a plastic condition. This
appears, for instance, to be the view actually held by Mr. Herbert
Spencer in a short paper * entitled ‘‘The Form of the Earth no proof of
Original Fluidity.” This paper has been referred to with a somewhat
inaccurate conception of its value and results by two recent geological
writers, so it claims some notice at our hands. The first of the two
writers referred to, Mr. W. B. Taylor,t says: “It is now nearly forty
years since Herbert Spencer, with a juster physical insight [than Sir
W. Thomson and Prof. Tait], contended and satisfactorily showed that
a solid earth (of any shape) would assume the oblate spheroidal form
due to its rate of rotation, as certainly and promptly as if it were
liquid.” The other writer, Mr. A. Blytt,f amongst other references to
the paper says, “I believe that Spencer is the first who expressed the
opinion that even a solid earth can change its form.”

Mr. Spencer, after some statements as to the relative strength and
agility of large and small animals, such as elephants and fleas, formu-
lates the general result that the strength—called also “resistance to
fracture ”—of a solid structure varies as the square of its linear dimen-
sions, while the “agencies antagonistic to cohesive attraction,” 7. e.,
gravitational and “ centrifugal” forces, ete., vary as the cube. Except-
ing a statement that this is obviously true of simple longitudinal and
torsional stress, the following is the sole proof of his very general law
supplied by Mr. Spencer: “The strength of a bar of iron, timber, or
other material subjected to the transverse strain varies as BD?/L; B

being the breadth, D the depth, and L the length. Suppose the size
of this bar to be changed, whilst the ratios of its dimensions continue
thesame; then - - - thestrengthwillvaryasD? - - - ”(p.195).
The following is the conclusion drawn by Mr. Spencer: ‘ Viewed by
the light of this principle, the fact that the earth is an oblate spheroid
does not seem to afford any support to the hypothesis of original fluid-
ity as commonly understood. We must consider that in respect of
its obedience to the geo-dynamic laws, the earth is fluid now and must
always remain so; for the most tenacious substance with which we are
acquainted, when subjected to the same forces that are acting upon the
earth’s crust, would exceed the limit of self-support determined by the
above law, before it attained ;z50+ 50-000 Of the earth’s bulk” (p.196).

Perhaps if one knew what Mr. Spencer means by ‘the limit of self
support,” and what is the exact distinction he draws between “ fluidity
as commonly understood ” and * fluidity in respect of obedience to geo-
dynamic laws,” one might be in a position to form some estimate of his
degree of physical insight; but so far as I can see all he satisfactorily
shows is an extraordinary agility in jumping to conclusions. If his
meaning is that deformation must accompany the action of gravita-
tional and centrifugal forces, he might, if Maxwell’s view be correct,
have added to the denominator of his estimate as many 0’s as the
printer could spare; but if it is the rupture of an elastic solid or its
transformation into a plastic state to which he refers, as seems almost
certain from the context, he must have formed an extremely low esti-
mate of what strains a solid can stand.

In the same passage Mr. Blytt refers to Mr. Peirce,* Sir J. W. Daw-
son,t and Prof. J. EK. Todd { as holding that a solid earth will alter its
shape if the rate of rotation vary. The views of Mr. Peirce I have not
seen, but the other two writers mentione * regard the solid earth itself
as changing shape only by means of a succession of what we may term
catastrophies. Their views seem identical with those which Mr. Blytt’s
translator ascribes to him in the following words: ‘‘The sea adjusts
itself in accordance with the smallest change in the length of the day
- -  - But the solid earth offers resistance to change of form, and
begins to give way only when the tension reaches a certain amount ” (p.
418). Mr. Blytt makes several distinet references to the subject, and
his remarks are not perhaps always strictly consistent. This, however,
is hardly to be wondered at, since he gives as the result of his investiga-
tions: “As has been stated, there prevails - - - a disagreement as
to how far the earth will change its form, in case the centrifugal force
varies. Thomson is most inclined to believe that it will not. Darwin
is of opinion that it will. And among other physicists whom I have
consulted a similar divergence prevails upon this point. One thinks

146 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

that a lengthening of the day even by several hours will be incapable
of altering the form of the solid earth; another believes that the solid
earth will probably change its form just as easily as the sea” (p. 421).

If Mr. Blytt should ever have further occasion to consult physicists
on this or any allied point, he would find an exact definition of such
terms as solid acertain amount of protection from é priori speculations.
Mr. Blytt’s own principal view seems due in part to an erroneous inter-
pretation of Tresca’s experiments on the flow of metals under pressure.
They do not in reality justify his statement ‘“ By reason of the enor-
mous pressure which prevails in the interior of the earth, it must be
supposed that masses from a certain depth are more or less in a plastic
state” (p. 417). It was in fact pointed out some years ago by the Rey.
Osmond Fisher * that the existence of an orifice from which the metal
can flow constitutes a complete difference between the conditions of
Tresca’s experiments and the state of a body subjected to nearly uni-
form pressure all round.

Mr. Blytt apparently does not stand alone in believing Sir W. Thom-
son to hold that the solid earth is incapable of altering its form as the
rotation alters, and that if possesses the same eccentricity as when it
solidified. Prof. Darwin in Nature, 1886, vol. XXxXtIv, pp. 420-423, seems
also to put this interpretation upon a passage he quotes from § 830 of
Thomson and Tait’s “ Natural Philosophy.” Supposing this interpre-
tation correct, Prof. Darwin’s opinion that Sir W. Thomson does not
allow “a sufficient margin for uncertainties” expresses only a part of
the objections I should entertain. I find it difficult however to believe
that Sir W. Thompson, who elsewhere gives data for the eccentricity
produced by rotation in solid spheres of steel, can actually suppose no
change at all in the eccentricity to follow an alteration in the angular
velocity. Still it must be confessed that though the passage contains
the statement, “ It must necessarily remain uncertain whether the earth
would from time to time adjust itself completely to a figure of equi-
librium adapted to the rotation,” its most natural interpretation is that
given by Prof. Darwin. I need hardly say that the conclusion that
the earth, however solid, would retain a constant eccentricity while the
rate of rotation varied, seems to me directly opposed to the conclusions
to which the elastic solid theory leads.

Prof. Darwin hinself, in his paper in Nature refers to Tresca’s ex-
periments and thinks it probable there would be from time to time a flow
of material as the anguiar velocity altered. One of the “ uncertain-
ties” he refers to is the possibility that, in accordance with Dr. Croll’st
views, a greater rapidity of denudation in equatorial than in polar
regions may have reduced the eccentricity markedly below the value it
possessed when the earth solidified. He does not seem however to

refer to the considerable change of eccentricity that might occur in a
solid through mere variation of elastic strain.

As regards the present state of the earth’s interior there are, accord-
ing to Geikie’s Text-book, p. 49, only three theories which merit serious
consideration, viz:

(1) That there is a solid crust and a molten interior.

(2) That with the exception of local vesicular spaces the earth is per-
fectly solid.

(3) That the earth consists of a solid crust and nucleus with an in-
tervening liquid layer.

According to the Text-book, the theory of a thin crust containing
liquid or viscous matter is exposed to *‘ weighty and indeed insuper-
able objections,” p. 18, and ‘is now abandoned by most geologists,” p.
43.

According to Dr. Croll * the * general opinion among geologists ” is
that the earth ‘‘ consists of a fluid interior surrounded by a thick and
rigid [really solid] crust.”

Prof. Prestwich? believes that ‘the crust rests on a yielding sub-
stratum, and that of no great thickness.” In fact he advocates the
third of the above-mentioned theories, and believes 380 miles to be
probably in excess of the crust’s thickness. Most writers on the sub-
ject appear to have subsidiary theories of their own.

Whether the assurance that the question is beyond the reach of ex-
periment accounts for the multitude of theories and the confidence
with which they are proposed, is a question for philosophers not mathe-
maticians to consider, but it seems @ prior? a possible explanation of
such a declaration of faith as that of Mr. W. B. Taylor: { “ The liquid-
ity of our globe, and the relative thinness of its encrusted envelope—
as attested by all legitimate geological induction—will be assumed
without misgiving or hesitancy, and the supposed matematical argu-
ments for its solidity ignored as essentially fallacious and wholly in-
conclusive.”

Of course if the geological evidence were conclusive, it would be
mere waste of time further to consider the matter, but the evidence
that satisfies Mr, Taylor does not seem to carry conviction to all geolo-
gists even in America. Mr. G. Becker,§ for instance, who appears to
have same practical experience, says: ‘* For a considerable number of
years | have constantly had the theory of the earth’s solidity in mind
while making field observations on upheaval and subsidence, with the
result that to my thinking, the phenomena are capable of much more
satisfactory explanation on a solid globe than on an encrusted fluid
one.”

148 SOME APPLICATIONS OF :

It may thus be not wholly unprofitable to glance briefly at some of
the arguments which some of the advocates of the several theories
base on their ideas of the properties of solid bodies.

Mr. Taylor’s object is to get an equatorial circumference some 10 per
cent in excess of its present value, so as to account for the lateral com-
pression at the surface observed in mountain chains. Thus, following
Prof. Darwin,* he supposes the earth to have once possessed a much
greater angular velocity than at present, and speaks of a“ consistent
crust (of some few miles thickness) ” as having formed ‘ when the rota-
tion of our planet was at four times its present rate” (l.¢., p. 257). The
equatorial radius would then have been, he says, some 4,359 miles, and
the polar some 3,291. The change of shape, as the rotation fell off,
would account, he thinks, for observed phenomena. He considers his
conclusions opposed by Sir W. Thomson’s theory that the earth solidi-
fied throughout and retains at least approximately its original eccen-
tricity. Itis on this point that he refers to the data supplied by Mr.
Herbert Spencer’s “juster physical insight;” and he adds, apparently
as his own contribution to the argument, ‘“ the supposition that a granite
mountain or equatorial protuberance 400 miles high or 100 miles high
could for a moment support itself, would hardly be entertained by a
practical engineer ;” and in a foot-note, “the limiting modulus of height
of a granite pyramid (equalling one side of its square base) is somewhat
less than 11 miles” (I. ¢., p. 258). I am quite ready to agree with Mr.
Taylor that if solidification occurred under the conditions he supposes
the eccentricity must have altered enormously and that in a non-elastic
way, and I hardly suppose that Sir W. Thompson would oppose this
view. No one however so far as I know, has propounded the theory
of an elastic solid spheroidal earth of eccentricity 0.65 rotating com-
pletely in six hours, so that the investigation of the strains and stresses
required by such a theory is unnecessary. I can quite imagine that on
any probable theory of density the magnitude of the strains is hardly
likely to be consistent with the application of the mathematical theory
of elasticity. The force of Mr. Taylor’s remarks as to the pyramid I,
however, fail to see. Such an isolated mass exists under totally differ-
ent conditions from any portion of a solid sphere or spheroid, and one
might as well argue as to the impossibility of a liquid interior from the
fact that an isolated liquid column 100 miles high has not yet been
observed on the earth’s surface. If Mr. Taylor were however to cal-
culate the strains and stresses in such a thin shell as he supposes, of
material showing anything resembling the structure of ordinary rock,
with arate of rotation such as he mentions, I very much doubt whether
he would find it in an essentially better position than his imaginary
pyramid,

After this criticism Mr. Taylor considers the question of the probable
degree of rigidity of our planet quite irrelevant, but the “temptation is

* Phil. Trans. (1879), p. 532.
PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 149

strong to waste upon it a collateral glance” (l. ¢, p. 259). Accordingly
he crushes Sir W. Thomson’s arguinent* from the tides by the remark,
“that a siliceous crust of 20 miles average thickness and an overlying
aqueous ocean of 5 miles average depth, should have (as required by
the argument) so equal a coefficient of mobility that sea and land could
thus together ‘rise and fall,’ might well be pronounced incredible”
(7. ¢., p. 260).

He regards Sir W. Thomson as very seriously damaging his own ar-
gument by the admission that tides comparable in magnitude with those
observed would occur even in a solid earth of steel. It does not seem
to have occurred to him that the existence of a difference between the
motions of the land and water may constitute an argument for solidity.t

Mr. Taylor admits one difficulty in his theory, viz, the nature and
local characteristics of the plications actually observed, and remarks:
“While the force at the command of the rotating planet is abundantly
Sufficient - - - evidently some supplementary considerations are
requisite to give the observed direction to this force,” - - - “The
mere mechanical difficulty however of transmitting stresses through
comparatively undisturbed areas of hundreds of miles of a flexible, fri-
able, and practically plastic crust—with a large coefficient of viscous
friction beneath—is not so formidable as might at first appear. It
must be borne in mind that the pressures derived from an action so
slow as from century to century to be scarcely sensible, are of an or-
der of very great intensity, but of very small quantity” (l. ¢., p. 265).
Mr. Taylor also infers from “ various considerations ” that “in all ages
mountain building has been at amaximum; thatis, the uplifted heights
have been the greatest which the average thickness of the crust at the
time was capable of supporting; so that the former has been a constant
function of the latter, the ratio being probably not far from one-fifth”
(l. ¢., p. 265). Mr. Taylor does not state that this law of the uplifted
heights is true of all lands as wellas of all time, but the possibility that
such may be the case is rather alarming. He enters in fact into no un-
necessary details as to how he reached his conclusions, so that all one
can say is that, measured by his own standard, he is certainly not in-
ferior in physical insight even to Mr. Herbert Spencer. Perhaps when
he comes to deal with the ** supplementary considerations” he may sup-
ply sufficient data for the mathematician to follow him.

Prof. Prestwich, in his Geology, vol. U, regards the “ present very
great rigidity of the earth” as being proved by mathematical and
physical investigations; but complains of a “want of elasticity” in
the methods of the mathematicians (p. 538). According to him, “ the
hypothesis most compatible with the geological phenomena is that of a
central solid nucleus with a molten yielding envelope—not fluid, but
escit or a astic; nor is if necessary that this magma should be of any

150 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

great thickness; but a thin crust is, it seems to me, an essential condi-
tion” (p. 543). Prof. Prestwich adduces in support of his views various
arguments from geological phenomena which seem of much weight. He
has also various arguments of a more or less physical character, but
they seem to take a good deal for granted. Thus, on p. 540, refer-
ring to plications in the surface rocks, he says, “if the earth were solid
throughout, the tangential pressure would result not in distorting or
crumpling, but in crushing and breaking. As a rule, no such results
are to be seen, and the strata have - - - yielded, as only a free surface
plate could, to the deformation caused by lateral pressure - - - a yield-
ing bed, on which the crust could move as a separate body, was neces-
sary.” It seems to me that as the phenomena of rupture are as yet
very imperfectly ascertained, except perhaps for a few simple standard
conditions, Prof. Prestwich has very little to go on but @ priori ideas.
I fail to see, for instance, why pressures at or near the surface of a solid
sphere should necessarily produce fracture and not flow. Also it seems
improbable that there would be a sharp line of demarcation so as to
enable a crust—which seems clearly to mean a solid superficial layer—
to move as a separate body on a “yielding bed.” Would not this im-
ply a liquid substratum with no appreciable viscosity? And supposing
there were a substratum of this kind, is there any sufficient experi-
mental evidence that a solid crust of even a few miles thickness would,
on the falling away of the liquid underneath, go into folds instead of
being crushed and broken? Further, can plications to the extent
shown, say by the Alps, be reconciled with the retention of contempo-
raneous solidity? Supposing the earth to be essentially solid through-
out, is there any reason why the strain at some miles below the surface
should not locally at intervals exceed the elastic limit, with the result
for a time of a state of flow or plasticity throughout a volume of greater
or less extent? During such an epoch there would exist locally condi-
tions somewhat resembling those which Prof. Prestwich believes exist-
ent everywhere. It is true that one argument adduced by Prof. Prest-
wich and others against the existence of separate reservoirs of molten
material, viz, the similarity in the character of voleanie products all
over the earth, applies equally against such an hypothesis. If how-
ever volcanic products be supposed to come from several miles below
the surface, I see no obvious reason why they should not present sim-
ilar characteristics everywhere. No conclusive argument can well be
based on the differences observed in the sedimentary strata, because
the conditions under which such strata are deposited are obviously of
a varied character.

In various passages of Prof. Prestwich’s discussion of the state of the
earth one is apt to be puzzled by his falling into the practice, by no
means uncommon in geological writings, of employing physical terms
with a view to oratory rather than to exposition. For instance, he
speaks of contraction ‘‘due to the yielding of the weaker lines in the
PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 151

crust, when the tension caused by the excessive strain (and of which
the first order of movement is an index) overcomes the resistance, and
fractures and doubles up the strata;” and he adds: ‘‘ Mountain ranges
are in fact the concluding term of the stress which caused the deforma-
tion of the crust, and the movements which at those times took place
must have been influenced by the greater energy of the strains then at
work” (p. 546). It is difficult to see here what is intended to be cause
and what effect. In fact, while a number of terms are employed which
in mathematics and physics have a fairly definite meaning, I must con-
fess my inability to form an adequate conception of what is meant by
the passage as a whole.

Prof. Prestwich refers (pp. 545, 544) to the hypothesis of the late
Prof. KE. Roche (in the reference to which a misprint gives the year 1861
for 1881) as supplying something of the kind of earth he wants. Thus
an examination of Prof. Roche’s work* may be of some service.

He supposes the earth to consist of a central nucleus or “ bloe,”
homogeneous but for a possible accumulation of matter of greater
density at the center, and of a superficial layer of lighter material. Of
the nucleus, with the possible exception of a small core of heavier mat-
ter, he says, ‘Sa densité caleulée, de 7 a 7:5, indique qwelle est mé-
tallique, sans doute formée de fer - - -” The specific gravity of the
heavier matter which may possibly exist at the center is, he says, ‘ cer-
tainement bien inférieur {to 15], probablement 10 ou 12 (argent, plomb),”
p. 235. The outer layer or crust he supposes to have a specific gravity
about 3, and a thickness of about one-sixth the earth’s radius. Be-
tween the crust and the nucleus there exists, it may be everywhere or
only locally, molten matter such as appears at the surface in voleanie
outbursts, but the total volume occupied by this must be small. Prof.
Roche takes three results as given, viz, the earth’s total mass, the eecen-
tricity of its surface, and the ratio of the principal moments of inertia,
the last quantity being deduced from astronomical data. He satisfies
all the conditions he recognizes by the aid of the following hypothesis
regarding his nucleus: ‘“‘Ce bloe a pris sa forme définitive sous Vinflu-
ence dune rotation moins rapide quelle West aujourd’hui, et il a con-
servé laplatissement correspondant, malgré les accroissements sue-
cessifs de vitesse du systeme résultants de sa contraction progressive ”
(p. 232). In other words, he assumes the nucleus to have solidified
before the crust and that it retains its shape unaltered. Thus as he
regards the angular velocity as increasing in consequence of the dimi-
nution in the moment of inertia through contraction in cooling, the nu-
cleus possesses a smaller eccentricity than the erust. He supposes
only a small difference in the length of the day at the dates of the two
solidifications, so that the difference between the eccentricities of the
nucleus and crust is also small. This however in no way justifies his

“Académie - - - de Montpellier Mémoires de la Section des Sciences, 1880-1884, tome
dixiéme, pp. 221-264.
152 SOME APPLICATIONS OF

hypothesis that the nucleus retains its form unaltered. If its material
possessed the properties of an elastic solid the eccentricity would cer-
tainly alter, and to an extent probably quite comparable with the alter-
ation that would have occurred if it had remained fluid. Prof. Roche
seems in fact to treat his nucleus as possessed of the properties of the
wholly imaginary perfectly rigid body. He certainly introduces no
equations such as ought to hold over the surface of an elastic solid
spheroid. The exact view he adopted as to the properties of solids it is,
however, difficult to decide. On his page 241 a brief statement would
imply that he did not regard each elementary layer of a solid sphere
as of necessity totally self-supporting; but on pages 223, 224, where
the discussion is fuller, he says, ‘‘Si l’on rejette la complete fluidité de
la terre,il west plus possible Wattribuer 4 la compressibilité de ses
couches la méme influence.” - - - ‘Dans un solide, les tensions
latérales sont variables et acquierent parfois une valeur énorme. C’est
ainsi qwune couche pourrait se soutenir d’elle méme comme une espece
de voiite, sans peser sur celle qui est au-dessous.” <A solid layer sup-
porting itself like an arch under the conditions of matter near the
earth’s surface treated as an elastic solid, presents strains far in excess
of those which are regarded here as coming within the range of the
mathematical theory.

On various grounds it seems to me that the criticism of a want of
elasticity, though hardly in the sense intended by Prof. Prestwich, may
be strongly urged against Roche’s investigations.

Some remarks of M. Roche’s, on his pages 240, 241, throw considera-
ble light on his standpoint and that of many other theorists: ‘Les as-
tronomes qui persistent a admettre la fluidité - - - cherchent a
éluder Jes objections de Hopkins et de Thomson, en attribuant - - -
au liquide central une viscosité assez grande pourque - - - Vensem-
ble en arrive atourner tout d’une piece - - - La masse tournante
offre une telle rigidité quelle est assimilable sous ce rapport a un bloc
solidifié, mais admettre cette assimilation revient a dépouiller le milieu
interne des propriétés ordinaires des liquides, et a lui en conserver le
nom tout en V’identifiant 4 un corps solide.” He proceeds to point out
that the mere question of a name is of no account, considering our
ignorance of what would be the properties of matter under such pres-
sures and at such a temperature as the theory of fluidity would lead
to. His line of argument is not very clear, but there is no hesitation
apparent in his conclusion: ‘En effet, la pression supportée par les
couches centrales, dans la supposition dune complete fluidité, dépas-
serait deux millions et demi d’atmospheres. La grandeur méme de ce
nombre est a elle seule une objection péremptoire a Vhypothese qui y
conduit.

Such a position as this may be all very well for a philosopher who
supposes the external world a mere idea, the private proverty of his
own mind and so necessarily obedient to laws which his understanding
PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TO GEOLOGY. 153

ean fully grasp, or for a scientist who believes the earth created for the
special purpose of supplying problems of precisely that amount of diffi-
culty which he personally is able to solve, but from a common-sense
point of view it seems utterly irrational. No physicist or geologist has
any reason to suppose that there are not numerous problems whose full
comprehension requires more extensive knowledge than is possessed by
himself or any of his contemporaries.

The necessity for theories has been eloquently urged by Prof. Dar-
win,* who says: *‘ A theory is, then, a necessity for the advance of sci-
ence, and we may regard it as the branch of a living tree, of which
facts are the nourishment.” Employing this simile, | must confess that
the subject treated in this paper resembles, in my opinion, a tree which
combines a sad deficiency of sap with a great superfluity of branches.
It will I dare say be generally admitted that the premature craving
after a finality of knowledge has been responsible for numerous fruit-
less speculations in the past, and it seems only too probable that the
impatience of the mind with its own ignorance is the principal founda-
tion of much of the theory of to-day. The satisfaction derived from the
contemplation of simple and comprehensive laws may suffice perhaps
to prove that the powers of the mind are limited, but hardly that the
processes of nature are simple.

ORIGIN OF THE ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS IN
THE TRENTON LIMESTONE OF OHIO AND INDIANA.*

By EDWARD ORTON.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRODUCT.

Natural gas derived from the Trenton limestone has supplied during
the last year and is now supplying all the fuel and a considerable part
of the artificial h¢ght that is used by at least four hundred thousand
people in northwestern Ohio and in central Indiana. Within the same
limits it is the basis of a varied line of manufactures, the annual prod-
uct of which will make an aggregate of many millions of dollars. More
than forty glass furnaces, not one of them three years old, are now in
very successful operation within the territory named, while iron and
steel mills, potteries, and brick works, and a long list of factories in
which cheap power is a desideratum, have been built up on all sides
with wonderful rapidity.

The largest gas production of the Trenton limestone that has yet
been reached is to be credited to the present year. A well, drilled early
last summer at Stuartsville, 6 miles north of Findlay, produced through
the casing, a pipe 53 inches in diameter, 28,000,000 cubic feet of gas
every twenty-four hours. There are but few wells in any field that ex-
ceed these figures. Most of the wells so reported have been estimated,
not measured.

An equally astonishing advance has been made in the oil production
of this rock within four counties of northwestern Ohio. Single wells
drilled during the last year have begun their production at a rate of
10,000 barrels per day, and more than 200,000 barrels of total produe-
tion are already to be credited to single wells of the new field, while
a considerable number have passed the 100,000-barrel mark.

THE ROCK PRESSURE.

The rock pressure of the gas is a vital factor in all this production.
To its energy is due the propulsion of the volatile fuel from the wells
where it is released, through 20, 30,50 miles of buried pipes, to the

156 ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS.

cities which it supplies with the unspeakable advantages of gaseous
fuel. Itis the same cause that lifts the oil from the rock in all flowing
wells.

By rock pressure is meant the pressure which a gauge shows in a
well that is locked in after the drill has reached the gas reservoir. The
iron tubing of the well becomes by this means a part of the reservoir,
and the same conditions as to pressure are supposed to pertain to it
that are found in the porous rock below.

The rock pressure of gas varies greatly in different fields and to a
less, but still an important, extent in different portions of the same
field. The highest rock pressure recorded in the Trenton limestone is
about 650 pounds to the square inch, while there are considerable por-
tions of the gas territory that never reach 3800 pounds pressure per
squareinch. The original pressure in the Findlay field was 450 pounds,
varying somewhat in wells of different depths. In the Wood County
field, from which the largest amount of gas is now being conveyed to
Ohio cities, the original pressure ranged from 420 to 480 pounds, the
general pressure being counted 460 pounds to the square inch. There
were occasional records made of still higher pressure in single wells,
but of such cases the number is very small, and the existence of these
anomalous pressures was short lived.

Passing to the westward, the gas wells of Auglaize and Mercer coun-
ties show a decided reduction in original rock pressure aS compared
with Findlay, though the depths of the wells remain the same as in that
field. The highest pressure recorded in Mercer County is 390 pounds
to the square inch, but no gauge was applied to the wells until they,
had been allowed to discharge without restraint for several months,
while 375 and 350 pounds mark the extreme limit of other portions of
this district.

In the Indiana field a still further reduction of rock pressure is to be
noted. The range of the principal Indiana wells is between 250 and 325
pounds to the square inch. The Indiana gas wells, as compared with
Ohio gas wells, are marked by a reduction in total depth, as well as in
rock pressure, the figures for depth in the productive territory seldom
or never passing 1,000 feet.

How can these variations be accounted for? Back of this question
is a larger one, viz: What is the origin of the rock pressure of natural
gas?

THEORIES OF ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE.

Considering its importance, the main question has received less con-
sideration than would naturally be expected. The known literature of
the subject is very meager. Prof. J. P. Lesley, in the Annual Report
of the Pennsylvania Survey for 1885, discussed the question at greater
length than any other geologist, so far as I know. In a paper pub-
> "i >

ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS. 157

lished in the American Manufacturer, May 27, 1887, | threw out a few
suggestions as to the cause of rock pressure, and these suggestions I
afterwards expanded into a more extended statement, in the sixth vol-
ume of the Geology of Ohio, p. 96. Prot. I. C. White reminds me that
he suggested an explanation in the journal named above at an earlier
date than either of those given.

The men who are engaged in the practical development of gas and
oil fields make great account of rock pressure. It is the first fact that
they inquire after in a new gas field. They appreciate its importance
in whatever utilization of the gas they may propose, knowing that the
distance of the markets that they can reach and the size of the pipes
that they can employ are entirely dependent upon this element. These
practical men, so called, are as is well known, among the most ven-
turesome of theorists, and a question like this would not be likely to
be left unanswered by them. A certain rough correspondence that
exists between the depth and the rock pressure of wells is made of great
account in explanations that they offer. In other words, the pressure
is supposed to be due to the weight of the overlying rocks; and next
to this we find among them the expansive force of gas the favorite ex-
planation of the phenomenon.

In the paper of Prof. Lesley, already referred to, the learned author
suggests the two possible explanations of rock pressure already named,
and to this he adds a third, viz, hydraulic pressure; but he adds this
explanation only to reject it as a true cause of the phenomenon under
discussion. The absurdity of the more commonly received explanation
of rock pressure, as due to the depth of the well—in other words to the
weight of the overlying country—he sets in such clear light in his dis-
cussion that no further consideration of this is required on the part of
those who are open to reason. Until we can prove, or at least render it
probable, that the gas rocks have lost their cohesion and that they exist
at the depths of storage in a crushed or comminuted state, no explana-
tion can be based upon the weight of the overlying rock in aceount-
ing for the force with which the gas escapes from its reservoirs when
they are penetrated by the drill. Prof. Lesley throws the whole weight
of his authority in favor of the view that the gas “ produces its own
pressure like gas generated by chemical reaction in a closed vessel.”
This explanation certainly leaves something to be desired, for it fails to
account for the most significant and important facts in this connection,
viz, the difference of rock pressure in different localities and at differ-
ent depths. To accept it, brings us no advantage whatever beyond the
satisfaction that we may feel in having an answer at hand that can be
promptly given to a troublesome inquiry.

For my own part, I have felt certain for more than two years that the
rock pressure of gas in the Trenton limestone of Ohio and Indiana is
hydrostatic in origin, and I have published a number of facts that
seem to me to give support to this view. I find that some sagacious
158 ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS.

operators in the new gas and oil fields are coming to the same ground.
They have become thoroughly satisfied by their own experiences that
the root of rock pressure is to be found in the water column that stands
connected with the porous rock in which the gas and oil are contained.
In the present paper I desire to present to the Geological Society
a few facts and conclusions bearing upon the subject.

THE DATA FOR THE HYDROSTATIC THEORY.

The first question is, What are the facts as to the rock pressures of
the gas rock in question and what relations do they bear to the depth
of wells and other conditions in the Trenton limestone? The answer
is not as full and definite as may be expected, certainly not as may be
desired. There is but one datum in the development of a gas field in
which the normal gas pressure can be ascertained, and that is when
the first well reaches the reservoir and releases the long-imprisoned
and greatly compressed gas. But often this favorable opportunity is
lost, and gauges are not applied to wells until the energy of the first
flow is somewhat abated. Again, different wells in the same field, as
Findlay, for example, give different results. The wells vary with the
depth at which the gas rock is found. This factor is found to be an
essential one, as will presently be shown, in connection with rock pres-
sure. Moreover, gauges are sometimes inaccurate and their errors
come in to confuse the study of the subject. Furthermore, the exact
depth of the wells and the exact altitude of the surface where they are
located can not be ascertained in all cases. Small errors of this sort
must be provided for, and there also enters into the discussion a ques-
tion as to the specific gravity of the water which is to be made the moy-
ing force of gas and oil. The water found in association with these
substances is never fresh. It is always saline and often highly miner-
alized. The weight of fresh water to the square ineh is 0.43285 pound
for 1 foot in height (I use Professor Lesley’s tables). The average
weight of sea water is 0.445 pound to the square inch for 1 foot; but
the mineral waters with which we find the Trenton limestone saturated
often reach a much higher figure. An examination of several speci-
mens Shows that a column 1 foot high would weigh to the square inch
0.476 pound. In fact, some of these waters are more like bitterns, and
their columns would equal or exceed 0.5 pound per foot.

Bearing these several sources of ambiguity or uncertainty in mind, we
can consider the records of pressure, depth, and the other factors that
are accessible. The figures as to pressure have already been summa-
rized in a preceding paragraph, but they will be repeated in an accom-
panying tabular statement. Before coming to this, however, let me in
the briefest terms review the conditions under which gas, oil, and salt
water exist in the Trenton limestone. The uppermost beds of the great
Trenton formation in northwestern Ohio, central and northern Indiana,
Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin consist of a porous dolomite 5, 50, 100,
ORIGIN OF ROCK PRESSURE OF NATURAL GAS. 159

or even 150 feet in thickness. Sometimes the dolomite is found in a
continuous body, but oftener in interrupted beds. This part of the for-
mation has outcrops in the Manitoulin islands of Lake Superior and in
the Galena limestone of Hlinois and Wisconsin. In the gas and oil fields,
it is found lying in terraces and monoclines, or flat arches, 800 to 1,500
feet below the surface; and these several features effect the separation
of the varied contents of the porous rock. The boundaries of gas, oil,
and salt water are easily determinable and are scrupulously maintained
in the rock, except that as soon as development begins the salt water
is always the aggressive and advancing element. When the drill de-
scends into the gas rock proper dry gas escapes; when into the contig-
uous and lower-lying terrace, oil accompanied with gas appears, as al-
ready described; but at a little lower level salt water is struck, and this
rises promptly in the well, sometimes to the point of overflow. Far out
from the narrow ridges or restricted terraces where gas and oil are found
the salt water reigns undisturbed, and wherever reached by the drill it
rises in the wells as in those already described. It would be in the high-
est degree absurd to count the little pockets of gas that are found in
the arches the cause of the ascent of this ocean of salt water a score
or a hundred miles away. The rise of the salt water is unmistakably
artesian. It depends on hydrostatic pressure, as does the flow of all
artesian wells, and its head must be sought, as in other like flows, in
the higher portions of the stratum that are contiguous.

The nearest outcrops of this porous Trenton have been already
named, They are found in the shores of Lake Superior at an altitude
of about 600 feet above tide. It is certainly significant that when an
abundant flow of salt water is struck in a boring in northern Ohio or
in Indiana, no matter at what depth, it rises generally about to the level
of Lake Superior; or, in other words, about 600 mee above tide. If the
