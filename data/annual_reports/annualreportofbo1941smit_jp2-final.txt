REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1941

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1941. The first 18 pages contain a sum-
mary account of the affairs of the Institution, and appendixes 1 to 11
give more detailed reports of the operations of the National Museum,
the National Gallery of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts,
the Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the
International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astro-
physical Observatory, the Division of Radiation and Organisms, the
Smithsonian library, and of the publications issued under the direc-
tion of the Institution. On page 180 is the financial report of the
executive committee of the Board of Regents.

OUTSTANDING EVENTS

Among the numerous bureaus and agencies in Washington, certain
ones are listed as defense agencies, and the Smithsonian Institution
was included during the year in this list. Its vast collections are
of great usefulness in the identification and study of strategic ma-
terials relating to national defense, such as rubber, tin, aluminum,
mica, optical glass, abrasives, and many others. Its staff includes
scientific experts and technicians with outstanding experience in
connection with such materials, as well as laboratories and equipment
for all sorts of delicate experimental work. The Smithsonian has
already been assigned a number of defense problems and stands
ready to devote all its resources to such work when called upon.

The National Gallery of Art was completed and opened to the
public in March 1941, bringing to fruition the late Andrew W.
Mellon’s gift to the Nation of his priceless art collection and a mag-
nificient building to house it.

The great hall of the Smithsonian Building was completely re-
decorated, and in it was installed a unique exhibit designed to

B
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

illustrate concisely for visitors all the activities of the Institution
and its branches. Opened in January 1941, after a preview by the
Board of Regents, the new exhibit aroused widespread favorable
comment.

The Smithsonian radio program, “The World is Yours,” on June
14, 1941, put on the air an anniversary broadcast marking the com-
pletion of 5 full years of the series. A tabulation of station-manager
ratings of the program showed that its popularity throughout the
country continued unabated.

Among several bequests to the Institution announced during the
year, the largest was that from Mrs. Mary Vaux Walcott, widow of
the late Secretary Charles D. Walcott. Her bequest amounted to
more than $400,000.

New members on the Board of Regents were Vice President Henry
A. Wallace, and Representative Foster Stearns, of New Hampshire.

The revision of all solar-constant values collected by the Astro-
physical Observatory from all Smithsonian observing stations from
1923 to the present proved to be an even more tremendous task than
had been anticipated. It was nearing completion, however, at the
close of the year, and publication is expected to begin by the first
part of 1942.

M. W. Stirling made further archeological discoveries in southern
Mexico, working in cooperation with the National Geographic
Society. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., conducted his sixth and
final archeological expedition to the Lindenmeier site in northern
Colorado, his work having added greatly to our knowledge of
Folsom man and the whole subject of the early occupation of
America.

The work of the International Exchange Service was seriously
hampered by world conditions, but the scientific and other publica-
tions intended for foreign exchange that cannot now be sent are
being stored at the Institution until the end of hostilities.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF
THE INSTITUTION

National Museum.—aAppropriations for the maintenance and
operation of the Museum during the fiscal year amounted to $818,305.
Additional funds are needed annually for guards, curators, and im-
provements, but in the press of defense needs the Congress has not
found it expedient to grant them. Accessions for the year totaled
326,686 individual specimens, bringing the number of catalog entries
in all departments of the Museum to nearly 17,500,000. Among the
outstanding things received were the following: In anthropology,
a collection of Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age implements
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

and ornaments from Java, nearly 1,000 potsherds and shell imple-
ments from Indian burial mounds near Belle Glade, Fla., skeletal
remains from Peru, and a reconstruction of the newly found remains
of the fourth Pithecanthropus; in biology, 74 mammals, 472 reptiles
and amphibians, and nearly 2,000 fishes from Liberia, all resulting
from the Smithsonian-Firestone Expedition to that country, the
Nevermann collection of about 33,000 Costa Rican Coleoptera includ-
ing much type material, and a large collection of marine inverte-
brates resulting from the participation of Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt
in the Fish and Wildlife Service’s investigations of the Alaska king
erab; in geology, an 1,800-carat aquamarine crystal from Agua
Preta, Brazil, the Sardis, Ga., meteorite, weighing 1,760 pounds.
the fifth largest ever found in the United States, many thousands of
Cambrian, post-Cambrian, and Devonian fossils collected in various
parts of the United States by members of the Museum staff, and the
greater part of a fossil skeleton of the primitive mammal U%ntather-
dum; in engineering and industries, an operating exhibit of the West-
inghouse air brake, a fighter plane known as the Curtiss Sparrow-
hawk, and a 93-dial display clock made by Louis Zimmer, of Lier,
Belgium, which tells the time at many places around the world,
the tides at various points, and many calendar and astronomical
events; in history, busts, costumes, or mementos of famous Americans
including Abraham Lincoln, William Jennings Bryan, and Brig.
Gen. Caleb Cushing. As usual, many members of the scientific
staff took part in field expeditions, financed for the most part by
Smithsonian private funds or through cooperative arrangements
with other organizations or individuals. Twenty-five publications
were issued by the Museum, and 52,170 copies of its publications
were distributed. Visitors for the year totaled 2,505,871. Fourteen
special exhibits were held under the auspices of various educational,
scientific, and other groups. Changes in staff included the retire-
ment of Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., as curator of the division of mammals
and the advancement of the assistant curator, Dr. Remington Kellogg,
to succeed him, and the appointment of two new assistant curators,
Dr. Joseph E. Weckler, Jr., in the division of ethnology, and Dr.

National Gallery of Art—The completed building of the National
Gallery of Art was formally accepted by the trustees of the Gallery
on December 10, 1940, and on the evening of March 17, 1941, the
opening ceremonies were held. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes
briefly described the purposes of the Gallery, Mr. Paul Mellon, son
of the donor of the Gallery, presented the building and the Mellon
Collection to the Nation, and Mr. Samuel H. Kress presented the
Kress Collection to the Gallery. The President of the United States

4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

then accepted the Gallery on behalf of the people of the Nation.
The following day the building was opened to the public, and the
attendance from that day to June 30 was 798,156, an average of
7,529 per day. Practically all the initial staff of the Gallery had
been employed by March 1, 1941, the number of employees on June
30 being 229. The first catalog of the Gallery and a booklet of
general information were ready for distribution at the time of the
public opening, as were also a book of illustrations of all the art
works in the collection, color reproductions, and postcards. A num-
ber of important prints and four paintings were accepted as gifts
during the year. Under the educational program of the Gallery,
the docent staff has been organized so that there are at least two
public gallery tours every day and two auditorium lectures every
week. A memorial tablet to the late Andrew W. Mellon, donor of
the Gallery, was installed in the lobby, and four marble panels were
set aside for the names of important donors to the Gallery. The
names at present carved on the panels are those of Mr. Mellon and
Samuel H. Kress, and the names of future donors will be added as
authorized by the Board of Trustees.

National Collection of Fine Arts.—The National Collection re-
ceived two additions to its endowment funds during the year:
$5,000 from the Cornelia Livingston Pell Estate of New York,
and $10,000 from the Miss Julia D. Strong Estate, of Washington,
D. C. Three paintings were accepted for the National Collection
by the Smithsonian Art Commission in December 1940, and several
other gifts of etchings, miniatures, and paintings were deposited
during the year to be passed upon by the Commission at its next
annual meeting. Three miniatures were purchased through the
Catherine Walden Myer Fund. The following eight special exhibi-
tions were held: 48 pastels, drawings, and lithographs by Lily E.
Smulders; the Sixth Annual Metropolitan State Art Contest, 1940,
comprising 289 art works by 158 artists; the work of William Baxter
Closson (1848-1926), comprising 94 oils, 40 pastels, 21 water colors,
112 wood engravings, and other material; 111 pastels by 17 artists,
exhibited by the National Society of Pastelists; 22 water colors and
21 pastels by Ethel H. Hagen; 42 paintings by Alejandro Pardinas
under the patronage of the Cuban Ambassador; 39 caricatures by
Antonio Sotomayor under the patronage of the Bolivian Minister ;
and a memorial exhibition of 17 color prints and 50 black and white
prints by Bertha E. Jaques (1863-1941). A new edition of the
Catalog of American and European Paintings in the Gellatly Collec-
tion was published.

Freer Gallery of Art—Additions to the collections included
Chinese bronze, Chinese jade, Arabic manuscripts, Indian and Per-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

sian painting, Chinese porcelain, and Chinese and Persian pottery.
The work of the curatorial staff was devoted to the study and record-
ing of these new acquisitions and other art objects and manuscripts
already in the collection. In addition 693 objects and 180 photo-
graphs were brought or sent to the Director for information con-
cerning them, and reports upon all these were made to the owners.
Changes in exhibition involved 84 individual objects. Visitors to
the Gallery totaled 111,784 for the year. Six illustrated lectures
were given in the auditorium, six study groups were held in a study
room and ten groups were given docent service in exhibition galler-
ies. A. G. Wenley of the Gallery staff gave a 6 weeks’ lecture course
in Chinese and Japanese art in the Far Eastern Institute at the
1940 Harvard University Summer School. William R. B. Acker, also
of the staff, returned from Holland, having taken his Ph.D. cum
laude in Chinese at the University of Leyden.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—The Chief of the Bureau, M. W.
Stirling, continued his archeological excavations in southern Mexico
in cooperation with the National Geographic Society. At Cerro de
las Mesas 20 carved stone monuments were unearthed, and 2 initial
series dates were deciphered. At Izapa, a link between the west
coast of Guatemala and the isthmian region of southern Mexico, a
large number of stelae were excavated. The collections made were
brought to Mexico City, where they were studied by Dr. Philip
Drucker, assistant archeologist of the expedition. Dr. J. R. Swan-
ton brought to completion his extensive report on the Indians of
the Southeast, comprising 1,500 typewritten pages, which the Bureau
plans to publish shortly. Three other ethnological papers by Dr.
Swanton were in process of publication. Dr. J. P. Harrington con-
tinued his comparative study of the Navaho and Tlingit languages.
His work on the Navaho was completed during the year, forming a
manuscript of more than 1,200 pages. Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
brought to completion the sixth and final season of archeological in-
vestigations at the Lindenmeier site in northern Colorado, wherein
much new and valuable information on the subject of Folsom man
and the early occupation of North America has been obtained. To-
ward the close of the year he went to San Jon, N. Mex., to start
excavations at a promising site suggestive of another phase of early
man in North America, the so-called Yuma. Dr. J. H. Steward
completed his researches on the Carrier Indians of British Columbia
and investigated a burial site on an island off the coast of Alaska.
He devoted the rest of the year to editorial and organizational work
on the proposed Handbook of South American Indians. Dr. H. B.
Collins, Jr., continued his study of collections from Eskimo sites in
the vicinity of Bering Strait. Dr. W. N. Fenton conducted field
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

work among the Senecas of Allegany Reservation, N. Y., and carried
forward a number of other investigations dealing with Iroquois
problems. Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the Bureau,
continued her study of Indian music, collecting additional songs,
transcribing these and songs previously recorded, and preparing ma-
terial for publication. The Bureau published its annual report and
three bulletins. The library accessioned 378 items and relabeled and
reshelved over 5,000 books.

International Exchange Service-—The Exchange Service acts as
the official United States agency for the interchange of parliamentary,
governmental, and scientific publications between this country and
the rest of the world. During the past year the Service handled
576,282 packages of such publications, with a total weight of 388,649
pounds. Naturally, the last 2 years have shown a marked falling off
in the number of packages passing through the Exchange Service
because of war conditions in large parts of the world. The material
that cannot now be shipped abroad will be stored at the Institution
until the end of hostilities. Transmission of shipments to and from
Great Britain and to Latin America has been practicaly uninter-
rupted, and some material has been forwarded to Spain and Portugal,
although irregularly. Five consignments of exchanges have been lost
through war activities.

National Zoological Park.—The W. P. A. project which has been
of such great assistance to the Park in the past few years was termi-
nated on August 6, 1940, so that few improvements could be under-
taken during the year. The four new waterfowl ponds were com-
pleted and birds transferred to them at the beginning of the year.
The new restaurant constructed by the P. W. A. was completed in
the fall of 1940 and was opened to the public in March 1941. Visi-
tors for the year totaled 2,430,300, including 48,050 representing school
or other groups from 20 States and the District of Columbia. The
Smithsonian-Firestone Expedition to Liberia for the purpose of
collecting live animals for the Zoo returned to this country in August
1940. The animals brought back numbered nearly 200, representing
61 species of mammals, birds, and other forms, several of them being
new to the history of the collection. The usual large number of
gifts was received during the year, and 70 mammals, 49 birds, and
14 reptiles were born or hatched in the Park. The total number
of animals in the collection at the close of the year was 2,380, repre-
senting 730 different species. The chief need of the Zoo is for
three new buildings: one for antelope, deer, wild hogs, and kan-
garoos; one for monkeys; and the third for carnivores.

Astrophysical Observatory.—At Washington the work of the staff
was devoted largely to completing for publication the immense table
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY r/

of daily solar-constant observations at the three field stations at
Montezuma, Table Mountain, and Mount St. Katherine from 1923
to 1989. The rest of the text for volume 6 of the Annals of the
Observatory was also nearly completed, and the whole is expected
to be ready for the printer before January 1942. During preparation
of a paper on “An Important Weather Element Hitherto Generally
Disregarded,” Dr. Abbot noted that the solar variation is several
times greater in percentage for blue-violet rays than for total radia-
tion. This led him to consider whether the sun’s variation might
not be more effectively followed by observations limited to the blue-
violet region of the spectrum. He finally devised a method of thus
restricting the observations, which was introduced near the close
of the year at the three field observing stations. There is great
hope that the new method will yield more reliable daily indications
of the solar variations. Dr. H. Arctowski continued his meteoro-
logical investigations relating to the effects of solar variation on
atmospheric barometric pressure and temperature and completed a
manuscript incorporating the results of this study which will be
published during the coming year. Daily determinations of the solar
constant of radiation were made at the three field stations whenever
conditions permitted. A new concrete dwelling house for the
observers was erected at the Montezuma station.

Division of Radiation and Organisms.—The Division continued its
program of research on the relation of radiation to various phases of
plant growth. In continuing the project dealing with the genesis of
chlorophyll and the beginning of photosynthesis, a large amount of
information was obtained on the respiration of etiolated barley seed-
lings. This material is important because of its bearing upon photo-
synthesis as measured by the gaseous exchange method. It appears
that conditions of carbon dioxide storage or depletion develop in
the plant tissue depending upon the concentration of this gas sur-
rounding the plants. In subsequent periods, when the respiration is
measured there is an increase or decrease in the rate of CO, excre-
tion (i. e., in the apparent rate of respiration) until a state of
equilibrium with the new environment is attained. Considerable
time was spent in improving the performance of the spectrograph
used in measuring carbon dioxide for very short periods, and the
new features developed have greatly improved the speed-sensitivity
and stability of the apparatus. Further study was made of the
spectral effectiveness of radiation for the growth inhibition of the
oats mesocotyl, and a comparative study was undertaken of some
other species of grasses. A paper resulting from experiments in the
ultraviolet irradiation of algae showed that algae exposed four times
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

to stimulative amounts of certain wave lengths of the ultraviolet
exhibited 4 to 4.8 times the growth rate (expressed as number of
cells) of the control cultures. The influence of culture conditions
on the photosynthetic behavior of the alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa
was investigated. The growth cycle of this organism was studied
in relation to light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and the
composition of the nutrient solution. A number of papers were pre-
sented by members of the staff before meetings of scientific bodies,
and six publications resulting from the work of the Division were
issued during the year.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of
England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States
of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore,
constituted an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of
the executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

Changes in the personnel of the Board of Regents during the
fiscal year included the succession of Vice President Henry A. Wal-
lace to the membership held by former Vice President John N.
Garner, effective January 20, 1941, the Vice President being by law
a regent ex officio, and the appointment by the Speaker of the House
of Representatives on January 22, 1941, of Representative Foster
Stearns, of New Hampshire, to succeed Representative Charles L.
Gifford, who had resigned his membership as a regent.

The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, Chancel-
lor; Henry A. Wallace, Vice President of the United States; mem-
bers from the Senate—Charles L. McNary, Alben W. Barkley,
Bennett Champ Clark; members from the House of Representatives—
Clarence Cannon, William P. Cole, Jr., Foster Stearns; citizen mem-
bers—Frederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C.; Roland S. Morris,
Pennsylvania; Harvey N. Davis, New Jersey; Arthur H. Compton,
Illinois; and Vannevar Bush, Washington, D. C.

Proceedings.—The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was
held on January 17, 1941. The regents present were Chief Justice
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

Charles Evans Hughes, Chancellor; Senator Bennett Champ Clark;
Representatives Charles L. Gifford and Clarence Cannon; citizen
regents Frederic A. Delano, Roland S. Morris, Harvey N. Davis,
and Vannevar Bush; and the Secretary, Dr. Charles G. Abbot.

The meeting was held in the Smithsonian main hall, which had
recently been newly decorated and equipped with illustrative exhibits
giving a comprehensive view of all Smithsonian activities. The new
exhibits were viewed with approval by the regents.

The Board received and accepted the Secretary’s annual report
covering the year’s activities of the parent institution and the several
Government branches. The Board also received and accepted the
report by Mr. Delano, of the executive committee, covering financial
statistics of the Institution; and the annual report of the Smith-
sonian Art Commission.

The Secretary informed the regents of the death of Mrs. Mary
Vaux Walcott on August 22, 1940, and of her designation of the
Smithsonian Institution as residuary legatee, the bequest, when re-
ceived, to be made a part of the Charles D. and Mary Vaux Walcott
Research Fund set up by the former Secretary. Appropriate resolu-
tions were adopted by the Board.

In his usual special report the Secretary mentioned briefly the
more important activities carried on by the Institution and its
branches during the year.

FINANCES

A statement on finances will be found in the report of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Board of Regents, page 130.

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST
SMITHSONIAN RADIO PROGRAM

The Smithsonian educational radio program, “The World is
Yours,” celebrated its fifth anniversary on the air on June 14, 1941.
On that date a specia] program was prepared wherein extracts from
specially successful previous broadcasts were woven together into
a composite story to illustrate the way in which the various sciences
are handled in this series. “The World is Yours,” a series of weekly
half-hour broadcasts in dramatized form on science, invention, his-
tory, exploration, and art, is put on the air over a Nation-wide
network through the cooperation of the United States Office of
Education and the National Broadcasting Co. The program subjects
are selected by the Smithsonian editorial division and the scripts are
written by a professional script writer, employed by the Institution,
from material furnished by Smithsonian experts in the various fields.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

The programs are produced in Radio City, New York, as an N. B. C.
public service feature and go out over the N. B. C. red network.

That the popularity of the program has continued undiminished
is shown by the fact that an official rating service has twice within
the past 2 years placed “The World is Yours” at the top of all non-
commercial programs on all networks. A recent rating of N. B. C.
public service programs by percentage of station program directors
selecting them placed “The World is Yours” sixth on the list, but
most of the five rated above it were programs devoted to discussion
of current events, which are naturally of greatest interest in these
disturbed times.

The list of subjects covered by “The World is Yours” during the
past fiscal year is as follows:?

The Institution was unable, because of lack of funds to employ
additional personnel, to resume publication of the supplementary
articles, or “listener-aids,” which up to June 30, 1940, contributed
greatly to the educational value of “The World is Yours” programs.
It is hoped that a way will be found to reestablish this part of the
project during the coming year.

WALTER RATHBONE BACON SCHOLARSHIP

A bequest made to the Institution in 1919 in the will of Mrs. Vir-
ginia Purdy Bacon, of New York, provided for the establishment
of a traveling scholarship, to be known as the Walter Rathbone
Bacon scholarship for the study of the fauna of countries other
than the United States of America.

For the past 2 years the Bacon scholarship has been held by Dr.
Hobart M. Smith, whose purpose was the accumulation of specimens
of reptiles and amphibians from Mexico, on the basis of which a
herpetology of Mexico might be compiled and the biotic provinces
of the country more accurately defined.

During the year 1940-41, the some 20,500 specimens of reptiles
and amphibians obtained during the 2 preceding years were sorted
and a portion studied and entered in the permanent collections of
the National Museum. The collection requires study that could not
be completed within the year, and as a result certain groups must
be reserved for study at a later date.

A total of 1,421 specimens of snakes was obtained, representing 170
species and subspecies, of which 23 appear unnamed. These com-
prise about half the species known from Mexico. Nineteen specimens
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

of three species of crocodilians, all that are known from Mexico,
were obtained. ‘The study of these groups has been completed.

Not all the lizards have been studied yet. Completed genera num-
ber 22, comprising 4,547 specimens of 116 species and subspecies.
Eleven are unnamed. Six lizard genera remain to be studied.

The amphibians are not completed. A preliminary sorting, how-
ever, reveals some 5,173 frogs and toads, of about 110 species; 5,064
specimens of approximately 40 species of salamanders; and 6 speci-
mens of one species of caecilian. Most of these are being studied by
Dr. E. H. Taylor.

The turtles have been turned over to Dr. Leonhard Stejneger for
study.

While most of the data pertaining to this collection are reserved
for a future paper, descriptions of new species and surveys of certain
genera have been prepared for preliminary publication. Seven such
papers have been issued during the present year.

SMITHSONIAN MAIN HALL EXHIBIT

In my last two annual reports I have spoken of the project of
installing in the main hall of the Smithsonian Building a new type of
exhibit intended to serve as a visual index to all Smithsonian activ-
ities. During the 95 years since the founding of the Institution,
its activities have so expanded in scope and the buildings it occupies
have so increased in number that it has been impossible for visitors
to get an adequate idea of what the Smithsonian is and what it does.
The project was brought to completion during the year, and the
new exhibit was formally opened to the public on Monday, January
20, 1941. The Board of Regents of the Institution had a preview
of the exhibit on January 17, when their annual meeting was held
in the main hall.

As stated previously, the entire project has been handled by a
committee consisting of Messrs. C. W. Mitman, chairman, W. F.
Foshag, Herbert Friedmann, F. M. Setzler, and W. P. True, all of
the Institution’s staff. The great hall of the Smithsonian building,
some 150 feet long by 50 feet wide, was first completely redecorated
according to the committee’s recommendation. Then special back-
grounds for the exhibits were designed and constructed to form eight
separate alcoves and four quadrants, the central aisle being left clear
for free circulation of visitors. The eight alcoves present graphi-
cally the work of the Institution in astronomy, geology, biology,
radiation and organisms, physical anthropology, cultural anthropol-
ogy, engineering and industries, and art. The four quadrants, facing
the central area of the hall, contain exhibits on the scope of the
Institution’s work, the National Zoological Park, history, and the
organization and branches of the Institution.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

The plan of each of the eight alcoves is the same (see pls. 1 and
2. The name of the subject treated is stated at the top, followed
by a brief definition. Below this, a central theme consisting of a
diorama, working model, or other device illustrates strikingly the
significance of the particular subject. Flanking this on either side
of the alcove are exhibits to show as simply as possible what the
Smithsonian Institution does in each field. The number of objects
shown is kept small, labels are made as short and simple as possible,
and the whole attempt is to make the exhibits interesting and popular
and at the same time instructive.

A valuable adjunct of the new exhibit is a separate room opening
off the main hall in which are exemplified the Institution’s methods
of diffusing knowledge. One feature is a complete bound set of all
Smithsonian publications from 1846 to the present. The books
occupy 138 running feet of shelf space. Placards describe these
publications, as well as the Institution’s educational radio programs,
press releases, International Exchange Service, exhibits, lectures,
correspondence, and library. An important feature of this room is
an information desk where visitors may obtain accurate information
on special phases of the Institution’s work or exhibits.

Visitors to this new exhibit for the last 5 months of the fiscal
year—from February 1 through June 30, 1941—totaled 191,699.
Comparable figures for the preceding year are not available because
the building was closed at that time in preparation for the new
exhibit, but the total number of visitors for the corresponding months
of 1939 was 144,372. The present year therefore shows an increase
of 47,327 visitors, or 32 percent, over 1939.

The committee in charge of the project has been kept in existence
to supervise maintenance of the exhibits and to incorporate changes
from time to time, for the intention is to keep the whole exhibit alive
and up to date. Wide and favorable notice has been given the ex-
hibit by journals and newspapers.

TENTH ARTHUR LECTURE

The late James Arthur, of New York, in 1931 bequeathed to the
Smithsonian Institution a sum of money, part of the income from
which should be used for an annual lecture on the sun.

The tenth annual Arthur lecture was given by Brian O’Brien,
professor of physiological optics at the University of Rochester, under
the title “Biological Effects of Solar Radiation on Higher Animals
and Man,” in the auditorium of the National Museum on the evening
of February 25,1941. The lecture will be published in a forthcoming
Smithsonian Report.

BEQUESTS

Mary Vaux Walcott bequest—Mary Vaux Walcott, widow of the
late Charles D. Walcott, former Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, died August 22, 1940. Mrs. Walcott had for many years been
deeply interested in the Institution and its work, and during the years
1925 to 1930 her beautiful water-color sketches of North American
wild flowers were published in five sumptuous volumes under the
auspices of the Institution. During her lifetime Mrs. Walcott mani-
fested her interest by numerous valuable gifts, both in the form of
specimens and of money for specific purposes connected with Smith-
sonian researches. In her will she named the Institution residuary
legatee, the relevant portions of that document reading in part as
follows:

I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my
estate * * * to the Smithsonian Institution * * * in memory of my
beloved husband, Charles D. Walcott, to be added to and form a part of the
Charles D. and Mary Vaux Walcott Reasearch Fund, established by my husband
in his lifetime, with the express stipulation, however, that the restriction as to
the use of the income of said fund shall not apply to the income from this devise
and bequest.

At the annual meeting of the Board of Regents on January 17,
1941, the following resolutions were adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution learns

with profound sorrow of the death on August 22, 1940, of Mrs. Mary Vaux
Walcott, widow of its late Secretary.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

The noble character of Mrs. Walcott, her great skill and zeal in depicting
wild flowers, ker personal researches in glacial geology, her deep interest in the
paleontologic researches of Dr. Walcott, and her many gifts, over a long period,
to the Smithsonian Institution are highly appreciated.

Resolved, That this Board learns with profound gratitude of Mrs. Walcott’s
large bequest to the endowment of the Smithsonian Institution in memory of
her late husband.

Further resolved, That these resolutions be spread on the minutes of this
meeting and that a copy of them be sent to Mrs. Walcott’s executors.

The amount of Mrs. Walcott’s bequest was slightly over $400,000.
At the close of the fiscal year, the estate had not been settled.

Julia D. Strong bequest.—In the final accounting of the will of
Julia D. Strong, of Washington, D. C., who died April 12, 1936, the
National Collection of Fine Arts of the Smithsonian Institution, as
alternate beneficiary, received the sum of $10,000. No stipulations
as to the use of the fund were stated in the will.

Florence Brevoort Eickemeyer bequest—The will of the late
Florence Brevoort Eickemeyer, of Yonkers, N. Y., contained the
following provision :

I give and bequeath to the Smithsonian Institution * * * the sum of
$10,000 * * * to use or apply the income thereof, or as much thereof as
may be necessary, in or about the exhibition, preservation and care of my late
husband Rudolf Eickemeyer Jr.’s photographic works and collection, the residue
or surplus of such income, if any, to be applied to the uses and purposes of the
Section of Photography established or maintained by said Institution. My late
husband, Rudolf Hickemeyer, Jr., in and by his last will and testament and
codicil thereto, intended to provide a fund for the exhibition and care of his
photographie works and collection, bequeathed thereby to said Smithsonian
Institution, and his estate being sufficient to provide such fund, I do hereby
make the above bequest to carry out my late husband’s purpose in that regard.

The money thus bequeathed had not been received at the close of
the year.

Alfred Mussinan bequest—The Smithsonian Institution is named
as a residuary legatee of the estate of the late Alfred Mussinan, of
Sumter County, Fla. His will divides his estate into two equal parts,
and upon the death of certain legatees named in the will, the Insti-
tution is to receive five-eighths of the principal sum of one-half of
the estate, “the income therefrom to be used by said institution for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” The amount
of Mr. Mussinan’s estate was estimated by the executor in May 1941
to be approximately $30,000, in addition to real estate, stocks, and
bonds in Germany which it was impossible to evaluate.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

In the furtherance of its investigations in many branches of science,
the Smithsonian sent out or cooperated in 19 expeditions, which
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

worked not only in many States in the United States, but also in a
number of foreign lands as well.

Paleontological work was carried on by Dr. Charles E. Resser in
investigations of ancient Cambrian rocks; by Dr. C. Lewis Gazin
in Utah and Woming, resulting in the discovery of an almost com-
plete fossil skeleton of the primitive mammal known as an uintathere;
and by Dr. G. Arthur Cooper in Texas and Tennessee where an
abundance of fossil material, much needed in the Museum’s study
collection, was obtained.

Dr. Willian M. Mann, Director of the National Zoological Park,
and Mrs. Mann went to Liberia on an expedition financed by the
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., and brought back an assortment of live
animals for the Zoo, including a 400-pound hippopotamus, and some
3,000 preserved specimens for the Museum. Dr. Alexander Wetmore
spent a month in Costa Rica studying the birds of that region.
W. L. Brown collected material in the Canadian Rockies for back-
grounds for the Rocky Mountain goat and sheep groups exhibited in
the Museum. Dr. Hobart M. Smith, holder of the Walter Rathbone
Bacon scholarship, assisted by Mrs. Smith, continued his study of
the reptiles and amphibians of Mexico. Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt par-
ticipated in the biological investigations of the king crab of Alaska,
initiated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Capt.
Robert A. Bartlett conducted another expedition to Greenland, and
Mr. and Mrs. Russell Hawkins, Jr., visited the Gulf of California,
both to collect marine material. Austin H. Clark carried on his
observations of the butterflies of Virginia. Mrs. Agnes Chase made
an extensive study of the grasses of Venezuela, bringing back large
collections including 11 species previously unknown.

Dr. T. D. Stewart spent several weeks at the historic Indian village
site on Potomac Creek in Virginia known as Patawomeke, exam-
ining an ossuary that was discovered during the previous field sea-
son. Dr. Waldo R. Wedel conducted archeological investigations in
central Kansas in an effort to locate Coronado’s “Province of Qui-
vira.” David I. Bushnell, Jr., made several trips to the vicinity of
the Peaks of Otter in search of tangible evidence of early man in
Virginia. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., obtained further informa-
tion on Folsom man, one of the earliest known inhabitants of Amer-
ica, from excavations at the Lindenmeier site in Colorado. Dr.
Julian H. Steward visited British Columbia to record culture changes
among the Carrier Indians; Dr. John P. Harrington made a com-
parative study of the northwestern Indians in Alaska and the south-
western Indians in New Mexico; and Dr. William N. Fenton col-
lected data among the Seneca in New York State on Iroquois masks
and ritualism.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Li

PUBLICATIONS

The publications of the Smithsonian Institution constitute its
chief means of carrying out one of its primary functions, the “diffu-
sion of knowledge.” From its private funds, the Institution issues
the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, a series containing all
the scientific papers published by the Institution proper; from Gov-
ernment funds are issued the Smithsonian Annual Report (with
general appendix reviewing progress in science), the Bulletins and
Proceedings of the National Museum, the Contributions from the
National Herbarium, the Bulletins of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, and Catalogs
of the National Collection of Fine Arts. The Freer Gallery of Art
pamphlets and the series, Oriental Studies, are supported by Freer
Gallery funds.

All publications of the Institution are issued through the editorial
division, which comprises the central office where publications of
the Institution proper are handled, the office of the editor of the
National Museum, and that of the editor of the Bureau of American
Ethnology. The editorial division also directs the Institution’s
informational activities and its radio work.

The year’s publications totaled 78, of which 48 were issued by the
Institution proper, 25 by the National Museum, 3 by the Bureau of
American Ethnology, 1 by the National Collection of Fine Arts,
and 1 by the Freer Gallery of Art. Information as to titles, authors,
and other details concerning these publications will be found in the
report of the chief of the editorial division, appendix 11. The total
number of publications distributed was 125,837.

Among the outstanding publications of the year may be mentioned
a paper by the Secretary entitled “An Important Weather Element
Hitherto Generally Disregarded,’ wherein are summarized evi-
dences of the dependence of our weather on the variations of solar
radiation; a revised edition of Assistant Secretary Alexander Wet-
more’s “A Systematic Classification for the Birds of the World”;
another volume in the series of life histories of North American
birds by Arthur Cleveland Bent entitled “Life Histories of North
American Cuckoos, Goatsuckers, Hummingbirds, and Their Allies”;
a paper dealing with the very interesting Chicora (Butler County,
Pa.) meteorite, by F. W. Preston, E. P. Henderson, and James R.
Randolph; and part 2 of the monograph entitled “Archeological
Remains in the Whitewater District, Eastern Arizona,” by Frank H.
H. Roberts, Jr.

LIBRARY

The year’s accessions to the Smithsonian library totaled 6,839
volumes, pamphlets, and charts, bringing the holdings at the end of
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

the year to 894,655 items. As usual, many gifts were received, among
the largest of which were a collection of 942 scientific books and
journals belonging to the late Frederick E. Fowle of the Smith-
sonian staff and presented by his widow; 622 publications from the
Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington;
and 612 publications from the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science. Again during the past year the library’s
exchange work was carried on with great difficulty because of war
conditions abroad. Most of the publications that failed to come
were European and Asiatic. Some of these are being held by the
issuing agencies for transmission after the wars are over, others have
delayed publication, but a few have been discontinued. The library
staff cataloged 6,693 volumes, pamphlets, and charts; prepared and
filed 40,238 catalog and shelf-list cards; made 22,311 periodical
entries; loaned 10,990 publication to members of the Smithsonian
staff; and conducted an interlibrary loan service with 45 libraries
outside the Smithsonian system. Other activities included work on
the union catalog; a large amount of bibliographic assistance to
members of the Smithsonian staff and others; and checking of the
serial holdings in connection with the forthcoming second edition
of the Union List of Serials. The funds allotted to the library per-
mitted it to bind 958 volumes—only one-half of those completed for
binding during the year. The most urgent need, therefore, is for
more adequate funds for binding in order to prevent loss of parts
of volumes that may be very difficult, if not impossible, to replace.
Respectfully submitted.
C. G. Assor, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1941.

Funds provided for the maintenance and operation of the National
Museum for the year totaled $818,305, which was $6,580 more than
for the previous year. The amount was reduced $6,500, however,
by reason of a compulsory administrative reserve.

COLLECTIONS

Building up of the great collections of the Museum continued,
and a total of 1,518 separate accessions, aggregating 326,686 indi-
vidual specimens, was received during the year. Although this was
about 400 fewer separate accessions than last year, the individual
specimens increased by 114,000. Distribution of these additions
among the five departments was as follows: Anthropology, 4,064;
biology, 262,521; geology, 55,818; engineering and industries, 2,688;
and history, 1,595. For the most part these acquisitions were gifts
from individuals or represented expeditions sponsored by the Smith-
sonian Institution. All are listed in detail in the full report on the
Museum, published as a separate document, but the more important
are summarized below. The total number of catalog entries in all
departments is now nearly 1714 million.

Anthropology—titmportant archeological material included a col-
lection of Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age implements and
ornaments from Java; over 700 stone artifacts from western New
York; about 450 specimens from an Indian village site in Page
County, Va.; and nearly 1,000 potsherds and shell implements from
burial mounds near Belle Glade, Fla. In ethnology, many objects
were received representing the cultures of the Navaho; Alaskan
Indians and Eskimos; Plains, Pueblo, and Southwestern tribes; the
Iroquois; and others. Collections from peoples outside the Americas
included specimens from Malayan tribes of the Philippines, from the
Grebo of Liberia, and from the natives of Bali. Twenty-nine ce-
ramic specimens, 30 musical instruments, and 47 pieces of period art
and textiles were added. In the division of physical anthropology,
skeletal remains from Peru and from southeastern Alaska and a

19
430577—42——_3
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

reconstruction of the newly found remains of the fourth Pithecan-
thropus were the principal acquisitions.

Biology.—Biological specimens, many of great scientific value,
totaled 262,521, a considerable increase over last year, although these
came in fewer individual accessions. The most important mam-
malian accession was a complete skull and both sets of baleen of an
adult humpback whale (Megaptera novae-angliae) and a fetal whale-
bone whale skull from the North Pacific. Other mammals received
included 74 specimens from Liberia; 102 from South Carolina; 85
cavernicolous bats; other bats from Mexico, the Virgin Islands, and
Puerto Rico; 2 fetuses of humpback whales; a baby walrus skeleton;
and other specimens from Indo-China, Ecuador, Korea, Costa Rica,
Bolivia, and Brazil. Of nearly 100 mammals received from the
National Zoological Park, the most important was a gayal (Bos
frontalis) .

Large representations of birds came from Indo-China, Costa Rica,
Brazil, Antarctica, Mexico, and Manchukuo. Field work of the Mu-
seum in South Carolina yielded 1,205 bird skins for the study collec-
tions.

Incorporated in the collections during the year were 4,201 Mexican
reptiles received from the Smithsonian Institution as the major part
of the collections made by Dr. Hobart M. Smith, under the Walter
Rathbone Bacon scholarship, among them being types of many new
forms and representatives of species hitherto not contained in the
Museum. The second installment of Dr. W. M. Mann’s reptilian and
amphibian collections in Liberia consisted of 472 specimens, represent-
ing several new forms and much valuable comparative material from
territory hitherto little known.

Nearly 2,000 Liberian fishes also resulted from the Smithsonian-
Firestone Expedition headed by Dr. Mann, in addition to those acces-
sioned last year. Among other ichthyological specimens received
were 900 fishes from Texas and the Gulf of Mexico, 420 from Alaska,
and 60 sharks from Florida and Texas.

The most important accession in insects was the Nevermann collec-
tion of Costa Rican Coleoptera, comprising about 33,000 specimens
and including much type material. Other important entomological
material came in many miscellaneous lots, the largest being 64,000
insect specimens transferred from the Bureau of Entomology and
Plant Quarantine. A collection of nearly 3,000 beetles from Panama
was donated by Assistant Curator Richard E. Blackwelder, who col-
lected them several years ago.

About 500 marine invertebrates from the west coast of Greenland
came as a result of the Bartlett Greenland Expedition of 1940.
Through Curator Waldo L. Schmitt there was accessioned a large
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

collection of marine invertebrates taken in the course of the Alaska
king crab investigations of the Fish and Wildlife Service. From this
same Service there was transferred a lot of nemertean worms collected
by the Albatross and Fish Hawk. Outstanding also was a large col-
lection of mollusks, echinoderms, crustaceans, miscellaneous inverte-
brates, and 182 bottom samples obtained by Russell Hawkins, Jr., on
1939 and 1940 cruises along the west coast of Baja California and in
the Gulf of California. Over 3,000 selected molluscan specimens were
obtained by purchase through the Frances Lea Chamberlain Fund. A
remarkably fine collection of over 3,000 Samoan shells was contributed,
as well as 1,000 land and fresh-water shells from Texas. Séveral inter-
esting lots of echinoderms were added, chiefly from the Antarctic
region, from Greenland, and from the Abrolhos Islands, Western
Australia.

About 25,000 plants from many sources were added to the collections
of the National Herbarium.

Geology—Many choice minerals and gems were acquired through
the Canfield, Roebling, and Chamberlain funds of the Smithsonian
Institution. The finest mineral specimen is an 1,800-carat aqua-
marine crystal from Agua Preta, Brazil, showing the rare berylloid
form. The extensive Diaz collection of Mexican cassiterites and
valuable sets of minerals from Bolivia also are noteworthy. Gems
added included a brilliant cut purple enclase of 46 carats from Cey-
lon, and a greenish-yellow 9-carat enclase from Brazil. Another
important acquisition consisted of 620 Brazilian gem stones trans-
ferred from the United States Treasury Department. The out-
standing addition to the meteorite series was the Sardis, Ga., speci-
men, an altered iron, weighing 1,760 pounds, the fifth largest single
meteorite ever found in the United States. Four meteoritic falls,
all American, were represented in specimens presented by Dr. Stuart
H. Perry, associate in mineralogy. A valuable series of tin ores
resulted from Curator W. F. Foshag’s studies for defense purposes
of the tin resources of Mexico.

Field work by members of the staff yielded the bulk of the in-
vertebrate fossils accessioned: About 8,000 Cambrian brachiopods
and trilobites from the Rocky Mountain region, Missouri, and the
Appalachian Valley; 20,000 post-Cambrian specimens from west
Tennessee and Texas; and 15,000 Devonian fossils from the various
counties in the geologically classic Lower Peninsula of Michigan.
Much valuable type material was contained in other miscellaneous
accessions, mostly gifts, including Upper Cambrian invertebrates
from Texas and southeastern Missouri, Ordovician Bryozoa from
Oklahoma, Upper Triassic ammonites from Nevada, and type fos-
sils from the Kaibab formation of the Grand Canyon. Important
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

lots of Foraminifera came from such widely separated regions as
Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, and Arabia. Casts of 256 type specimens
of the fossil shell Zurritella, from the Tertiary rocks of the Pacific
coast, comprised an outstanding addition to the Cenozoic collections.

As a result of paleontological field work in central Utah several
articulated Upper Cretaceous lizard skeletons (Polyglyphanodon)
and fragmentary mammalian jaws and teeth from the Paleocene
were received, in addition to 149 lots of vertebrate fossils collected
from the Bridger Eocene of southwestern Wyoming. Also worthy
of special mention among the new vertebrate material are the greater
part of theskeleton of the primitive mammal Uintatherium, a partial
skeleton of a Palaeosyops, and a perfect skull and jaws of the dog-
like Thinocyon velox. Parts of several fossil whales and porpoises,
from the Miocene Calvert formation of the Chesapeake Bay
country, were acquired.

Engineering and industries—To the section of transportation and
civil engineering came an operating exhibit of the Westinghouse
air brake, and three fine scale models, the Polish motorship Pélsudski,
the Rolls Royce automobile Silver Ghost, and the diesel-engined
trawler Storm.

A unique accession in the section of aeronautics, received as a
transfer from the Navy Department, was a fighter airplane known
as the Curtiss Sparrowhawk, a type developed in 1931-35 as an
auxiliary fighter to the dirigibles Akvon and Macon. Several inter-
esting airplane models were received: The original model of a steam-
engined bombing helicopter designed in Civil War times and scale
models of the Columbia monoplane (1910), the triplane bomber
(1918), the U. S. Army pursuit type P-35, the U. S. Army trainer
type BT-8, and the amphibian SEV-8N.

In mechanical engineering the outstanding accession was an excep-
tional operating model made by Howell M. Winslow of a Reynolds-
Corliss steam engine of about 1900. The section of electrical
engineering and communication received three original Plante stor-
age battery plates and two replicas of the posted plate batteries
made by T. A. Willard in 1881; also the tone arm of a modern
photoelectric phonograph.

One of the most spectacular acquisitions in recent years is the
93-dial display clock made by Louis Zimmer, of Lier, Belgium, for
the Brussels World’s Fair in 1935. It is 14 feet high, tells the stand-
ard time of many places around the world, the tides in various
parts, and a great variety of calendar and astronomical events. The
section of woods and wood technology received the first letter file
made to handle correspondence unfolded and vertical. An important
and generous gift to the division of graphic arts was a collection
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23

of 200 Currier and Ives prints from a donor, who in addition lent
183 others. There came also as a loan the original camera believed
to have been used around 1836 by Dr. John W. Draper, the eminent
American chemist and physiologist, while a member of the faculty
of Hampden-Sydney College, Richmond, Va.

History—Nearly 1,600 objects of historic and antiquarian interest
were accessioned, including busts, costumes, or mementos of such
outstanding Americans as Abraham Lincoln, Mrs. Andrew Jackson
Donelson, Col. Samuel Simpson, William Jennings Bryan, Henry
B. F. Macfarland, and Brig. Gen. Caleb Cushing. The numismatic
collection was increased by 176 coins and medals, including a series
of United States bronze, nickel, and silver coins struck at the Denver,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco mints in 1914; and the philatelic
collection by 1,310 stamps and other items.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Field exploration by the Museum’s experienced staff and its col-
laborators continues as one of the most important sources for addi-
tions of new materials in the broad fields of anthropology, biology,
and geology. As in previous years this work was financed in the
main through funds provided by the Smithsonian Institution or
through interested friends of the Institution. The specimens
obtained have filled many gaps in the Museum’s series.

Anthropology—During August and September, 1940, Dr. T.
Dale Stewart, associate curator of physical anthropology, continued
excavations at the historic Indian village site known as Patawomeke
on Potomac Creek, in Stafford County, Va., completely exploring
the ossuary discovered last year. The work this season yielded a
number of facts that verify or supplement the meager historical
records pertaining to the burial ceremonies of the Virginia tide-
water Indians. Of the approximately 100 skeletons encountered in
the ossuary, the majority had become disarticulated, or were dis-
articulated before burial. A few, however—approximately a dozen
adults—were observed to be fully articulated. These were found on
the bottom or along the sides of the pit and hence may have been
the first bodies received into the grave. Moreover, all these artic-
ulated skeletons are possibly males and had their arms extended
along their sides as do the bodies shown in John White’s picture of
a death house, which was drawn during his visit to Roanoke Island
in 1585. Also, all these skeletons had their lower legs flexed un-
naturally forward, which would have been a practicable way for
shortening an extended body resting on its back. There is evidence,
on the other hand, that the disarticulated skeletons were exposed

24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

for a considerable period before burial; in several cases mud dauber
nests were found in the skull or among the bundled bones. This
finding indicates that the period in which these bodies were exposed
in an open death house included at least one warm season.

On February 27, 1941, Dr. Stewart went to Peru in connection
with the program sponsored by the State Department for cultural
cooperation with other American republics. In Lima, through the
kindness of Dr. Julio C. Tello, director of the Museum of Anthro-
pology, Magdalena Vieja, he had the privilege of studying two docu-
mented series of human skeletal remains, one from Paracas and the
other from Malena. These two series are interesting for comparison
because that from Paracas is very early, whereas that from Malena
is late coastal Inca. The Paracas people, although relatively ancient,
were far from being primitive in the cultural sense. Their textiles
are famous and among the finest produced anywhere. While in
Lima Dr. Stewart visited many of the nearby ruins and ancient
Indian sites. From these trips Dr. Stewart brought back a small
collection of the more interesting skeletal remains to supplement
earlier collections.

During the week of March 30 Dr. Stewart represented the Insti-
tution and the National Geographic Society at the Third Assembly
of the Pan American Institute of Geography and History meeting
in Lima. Following the Assembly he visited the Museo Arqueolégico
“Rafael Larco Herrera” at Chiclin, where, through the kindness of
Sr. Rafael Larco Hoyle, he was able to study a documented series
of Mochica and Cupianique skeletons. These remains are from the
oldest cultural periods of the northern coast. From Chiclin Dr.
Stewart went south to Mollendo, and thence by way of Arequipa
to Cuzco. Here, besides visiting some of the famous ruins, he saw
the fine collection of mummies and trephined skulls at the University
of Cuzco and the Instituto Arqueoldgico.

Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, assistant curator in archeology. was in the
field from June 1 to September 16, 1940, continuing the Institution’s
archeological survey of Kansas, begun in 1937. The 1940 explora-
tions were carried on at several locations in Rice and Cowley
Counties. Preliminary excavations show that the sites investigated
mark villages inhabited by semisedentary, partly horticultural In-
dians who did not live in earth lodges. These people made pottery,
wove basketry, had a wide variety of artifacts in stone, bone, horn,
and shell, traded with the Pueblos on the Rio Grande for turquoise,
pottery, and obsidian, and were in contact with white men. Frag-
ments of glaze-paint pottery represent types made on the Rio
Grande between 1525 and 1650, and bits of chain mail suggest a
visit from some of the early Spanish explorers. It is tentatively
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

suggested that these remains, widespread in central and southern
Kansas, may be of Wichita origin, and possibly represent some of
the Quivira villages seen by Coronado, Humafia, Bonilla, and Ofate.

During the period from December 5 to 12, 1940, and again in
May 1941, Dr. Wedel made a brief reconnaissance in the Holston
River drainage near Saltville, Va. A number of extremely promis-
‘ng prehistoric village sites and two apparently affiliated burial caves
were visited, and a local collection was studied. No excavations were
undertaken. The cultural materials indicate some relationships with
Middle Mississippi remains in Tennessee and adjacent States, but
pending more extended studies their exact position culturally remains
uncertain,

Walter W. Taylor, Jr., collaborator in anthropology, inaugurated
archeological excavations in the state of Coahuila, Mexico. From
January 1941 to the close of the fiscal year, Mr. Taylor surveyed a
wide area in the various mountain valleys around Cuatro Ciénegas
and excavated several small caves and one large cave. The principal
purpose of this program was to determine the relationship between
the prehistoric cave inhabitants in this northern section of Mexico
and the inhabitants of similar sites in the Pecos River and Big
Bend area of southwestern Texas. A superficial relationship seems
evident from Mr. Taylor’s field reports, but final conclusions must
await a careful comparison of material in the Museum.

Biology.—During October and November Dr. Alexander Wetmore,
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, visited Costa
Rica as part of the program sponsored by the State Department
for cultural cooperation with the other American republics. He was
received with every courtesy as the guest of the Costa Rican Gov-
ernment, and in San José, the capital city, he worked at the National
Museum and visited and conferred with officials in various branches
as well as with scientists in other services. Following this, accom-
panied by Dr. Juvenal Valerio Rodriguez, director of the National
Museum, and Carlos Aguilar in charge of the zoological collections
in the Museum, he crossed by air to Liberia, the principal city of
Guanacaste, the northwestern province of Costa Rica. From this
base collections of birds were made in the surrounding country. Dr.
Valerio returned to San José, while Mr. Aguilar remained for train-
ing in zoological field work. Guanacaste is devoted mainly to cattle
raising, with small cultivation. Liberia lies on a slightly elevated
plain east of the swampy lowlands bordering the Rio Tempisque.
For more than 2 weeks Dr. Wetmore and Mr. Aguilar were located
at a great hacienda on the southern slopes of the Volcan Rincén de
la Vieja where there was access to heavy rain forest on the mountain.
Collections were obtained for the National Museum in San José as
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

well as for our Institution. The several hundred birds that have
come to Washington as a result of this work add measurably to our
series, as our earlier investigations of the birds of Costa Rica did
not cover Guanacaste. On his return north at the end of Novem-
ber Dr. Wetmore had opportunity to spend a day in Habana, Cuba,
where he was received by representatives of the Cuban Government
and conferred with prominent scientists of the country.

From March to May, 1941, Dr. Wetmore visited Colombia in con-
tinuation of the program mentioned for closer personal contact and
cooperation with scientists in our neighbor republics. In Bogota
he was received at the National University, where he worked par-
ticularly in the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales. He also conferred
with scientists who had been in attendance at the Eighth American
Scientific Congress in Washington the year previous, and visited
scientific workers with whom the Smithsonian Institution has been
in contact through correspondence for years. Following this, with
M. A. Carriker, Jr., as assistant, and accompanied by Dr. F. Carlos
Lehmann and his assistant from the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales
and by Lt. Alejandro Rubiano as a representative of the Colombian
Government, Dr. Wetmore set out from Santa Marta on a pro-
longed expedition through the Guajira Peninsula. The party
traveled by truck to Riohacha stopping en route for work in ex-
tensive forest areas near the Rio Ariguani and its tributaries. Here
in 8 days’ time specimens of 100 distinct species of birds were ob-
tained, an indication of the richness of the fauna. In Riohacha the
party obtained another truck and here entered the Guajira proper.
The peninsula in the main is an arid, desert country with extensive
open savannas and broad stony plains, grown in places with heavy
stands of mesquite and cacti that form veritable forests. In the
eastern section there are low mountains with trails along their bases
passable for heavy trucks except during the period of rains. On
the highest range where the trade winds build a cloud cap with con-
sequent more or less regular precipitation in contrast to the desert
below, there is an island of tropical rain forest with the species
usual to such an environment, here isolated by long distances from
other similar areas. Dr. Lehmann and Lieutenant Rubiano com-
pleted their work with the party in April while the others continued
to the forested region mentioned. On the return the middle of May
it was necessary because of disrupted steamer schedules for Dr.
Wetmore to cross by schooner from Puerto Estrella, in the Guajira, to
the Island of Aruba. Here after a 2-day wait he obtained plane
passage to Curacao, and from there sailed for New York. <A stop
en route at La Guaira, Venezuela, gave opportunity to visit Caracas,
where he was guest of honor at a luncheon given by W. H. Phelps
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY aT

to a group of Venezuelan scientists, and had opportunity to visit
the new Museo Nacional and the Sociedad Venezolana de Ciencias
Naturales.

Mr. Carriker, whose expenses for this work in Colombia were
carried by the W. L. Abbott fund of the Smithsonian Institution,
continued in the field in the Guajira until late in June to finish the
investigations. At the end of the fiscal year he was located in the
Sierra Negra in the northern section of the Perijé Mountains, a
region previously unknown to naturalists.

The collecting expeditions by W. M. Perrygo, scientific aid, to
obtain much-needed material for the study of the vertebrate fauna
of the Appalachian region, were continued with good results. Accom-
panied by John S. Webb, of the division of birds, he left for South
Carolina on September 14, 1940, working first along the Catawba
River and in the wooded regions of the Piedmont region and later
collecting in the swamps along the Pee Dee River. The middle of
October he continued southward to Allendale to complete work begun
in the spring months along the Savannah River. Two weeks were
spent in collecting along the Lynches River, a tributary of the Pee
Dee, and the final stay centered around McClellanville for work in
the salt marshes near the Cape Romaine Wildlife Sanctuary. The
expedition returned December 3. This work also was financed
through the W. L. Abbott fund of the Smithsonian.

Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt, curator of marine invertebrates, during
the latter part of 1940 served as biologist and leader of the field party:
organized by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for the
purpose of investigating the biology of the king crab in Alaska.
He left Seattle on August 28 and on September 12 established head-
quarters at Canoe Bay, off the northwest corner of Pavlof Bay, where
investigations were carried on successfully for 5 weeks. Later on
operations were transferred to Alitak at the western end of Kodiak.
Work at a final base on the north side of Shelikof Strait, east of
Kukak Bay, from November 15 to 20 ended the investigations for
the season, which in addition to observations on the distribution and
biology of the king crab yielded an extensive collection of marine
animals of interest to the Museum.

Clarence R. Shoemaker, assistant curator of marine invertebrates,
in company with T. Kenneth Ellis, undertook a 2-weeks’ collecting
trip for fresh-water amphipods through Virginia and the Carolinas.
The expedition returned with much interesting material to the
Museum, the particular object being to extend the study series of
certain rare species from this region.

The Smithsonian-Firestone Expedition to Liberia under the leader-
ship of Dr. W. M. Mann, Director of the National Zoological Park,
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

obtained for the Museum a large amount of zoological and botanical
material, including many novelties, from a region of the world
hitherto poorly represented in our collections. Although started
early in 1940, the expedition did not return until August 7, and is
therefore properly referred to here, as the specimens brought back
were accessioned during the present year. The story of the expedi-
tion has been widely published, and a condensed account with illustra-
tions will be found in the volume Explorations and Field Work of
the Smithsonian Institution in 1940, pp. 13-20.

As in past years, Capt. Robert A. Bartlett in his annual expedi-
tion to Greenland in the schooner Morrissey brought back valuable
additions particularly to the invertebrate collections, made with
equipment supplied by the Museum.

Dr. Hobart M. Smith, under the Walter Rathbone Bacon scholar-
ship, finished his field work in Mexico in August 1940, bringing
back to the Smithsonian Institution splendid collections that in all
comprise more than 20,000 specimens of reptiles and amphibians now
deposited in the Museum. During July and August, 1940, he was able
to study the collection of the late Dr. Alfredo Dugés, which contains
many type specimens of Mexican reptiles and amphibians.

Dr. E. A. Chapin, curator of insects, spent 5 weeks on the island
of Jamaica during April and May, 1941. Arriving there on April
22, he was met at customs by C. B. Lewis, curator of natural history
of the Jamaica Institute, who during the entire period of work
‘assisted In various ways. Special trips arranged by Mr. Lewis in-
cluded a day on Goat Island, 1 on Portland Ridge, 2 at Cuna Cuna
Pass, and a 4-day stay at Cinchona in the Blue Mountains. Except
for 8 days spent in and around Savanna-la-Mar, headquarters was
maintained near Kingston and short trips were made out from that
point. Because of the poor showing made in certain groups in 1987,
it was decided to concentrate on the termite and ant faunas. In
addition to various rare beetles, at least 13 species of termites, mostly
of the type living in hardwood, were found, and at least 3 of them
are additions to the Jamaica list. Other results of the work include
the establishment of very pleasant relations with the Jamaica Insti-
tute and the Government Entomologist’s Office.

The United States Antarctic Service expedition returned from a
year’s stay in the Antarctic with very valuable material consisting
of mammals, birds, and a considerable collection of lower crypto-
gamic plants. The Museum was represented in this work by Herwil
M. Bryant. J. E. Perkins and M. J. Lobell were detailed to the
expedition by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of
the Interior.

Local field work in nearby Maryland and Virginia by various
members of the staff has included investigations of Dr. L. P. Schultz

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

on fresh-water fishes. Botanists of the staff gathered material for
a proposed new Flora of the District of Columbia, the object sought
being a thorough knowledge of the Washington-Baltimore region.

Geology—Under a cooperative arrangement with the United
States Geological Survey, Dr. W. F. Foshag, curator of mineralogy
and petrology, accompanied by Carl Fries, of the Geological Survey
staff, made a 3-month survey of the tin resources of Mexico. All
the important mining districts of Mexico included within the states
of Michoacin, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, Queretaro, Aguascalientes,
Jalisco, Zacatecas, and Durango were visited and the deposits studied
as to their geology, mineralogy, and commercial potentialities. The
largest potential deposits are the placer sands derived from granite
intrusions in San Luis Potosi. The deposits in the rhyolitic rocks
are, in most cases, small and of little importance.

Dr. C. E. Resser, curator of stratigraphic paleontology, spent 3
months in field work, chiefly in the Rocky Mountains, assisted by
Charles H. Frey, 3d, of Lancaster, Pa. Dr. Resser left Washing-
ton on June 25, making first a brief stop in southwestern Virginia.
His next objective was the Cambrian section in the Ozark Mountains,
where several days’ work enabled him to familiarize himself with
these strata. Only indifferent fossils were found, as most of the
Cambrian rock does not carry fossils. He continued then to examine
Cambrian deposits in Colorado in the Front, Mosquito, and Sawatch
Ranges and the Glenwood Springs Canyon. Ten days in the State
permitted examination of several sections. Dr. T. S. Lovering, of
Ohio State University, who was mapping the region about Gilman,
assisted materially in showing the sections there. At the Grand
Canyon National Park in Arizona Dr. Resser examined new localities
under the guidance of Park Naturalist Edwin McKee during a 3-
day trip to Peach Springs and Meriwitica Canyons, 150 miles west
of Grand Canyon Village. Some fossils were found and physical
measurements made. In the Wasatch Mountains the party checked
on the position of certain faunas and on the stratigraphy, which had
been questioned. Fine collections were made at critical points. At
the Green River Lakes, one of the most beautiful spots in America,
Dr. Resser’s party found a section 850 to 1,000 feet thick, representing
both Middle and Upper Cambrian, carrying a few fossils. Several
sections were studied in Montana, notably on Squaw Creek in the
Gallatin Range, Newland Creek, Little Birch Creek, and Deep Creek
in the Belt Mountains, and several localities near Three Forks, Mont.
Particularly fine material was secured at several of these localities.
Advantage was taken of the new road constituting the northeastern
entrance to the Yellowstone to study the excellent section at Bear-
tooth Butte. Here some good collections were made. On the return
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

journey a new section across the Big Horn Mountains was seen
along Shell Creek, and about a week was spent in the Black Hills.
During an earlier trip from May 5 to 15 to southwestern Virginia
and eastern Tennessee Dr. Resser examined outcrops of the belt
west of Clinch Mountain to ascertain the faunal content of the Mary-
ville formation. Fossils were scarce and very difficult to free from
the matrix. A visit to Austinville, Va., furnished some excellent
fossils, and observations confirmed earlier interpretation of the stra-
tigraphy. The exact stratigraphic position of a new brachiopod
related to Nisusia—as yet undescribed—was discovered.

In August 1940 Dr. G. Arthur Cooper, assistant curator of strati-
graphic paleontology, joined Mrs. J. H. Renfro and daughter in
Fort Worth and with the guidance of these expert collectors collected
Pennsylvanian fossils in the region around Jacksboro and Graham
in north-central Texas. An abundance of fine material for the
biological series was obtained. Following 2 weeks in north-central
Texas, Dr. Cooper went to the Glass Mountains in west Texas, where
he spent another 2 weeks collecting limestone containing silicified
specimens. About a ton of blocks was sent back to Washington,
where almost half the material has since been etched with acid,
yielding very beautiful rare fossils that preserve the delicate spines,
and peculiar features of the interior of the animals concerned in a
truly remarkable way. Proceeding to west Tennessee he collected
Silurian and Lower Devonian fossils along the Tennessee River in
localities that soon will be lost through the impounding of water
behind the Gilbertsville, Ky., dam. At places the Silurian in this
part of Tennessee teems with fossils of many kinds and fine col-
lections were obtained, including new forms as well as many others
not previously present in the collections. From there he went east
to Murfreesboro, Tenn., where he joined Dr. Josiah Bridge, of the
United States Geological Survey. They spent 10 days in the Central
Basin of Tennessee collecting the fossils and studying the rocks of
the Stones River (Ordovician) group, as problems of correlation
never satisfactorily solved exist in this area.

As the vertebrate paleontological field exploration under Dr. C.
L. Gazin, assistant curator of vertebrate paleontology, extended into
the present year, but brief mention was made of it in last year’s
report. The expedition, into central Utah and southwestern Wy-
oming, was a continuation of previous investigations. In the Upper
Cretaceous several additional lizard skeletons were collected; and
in the Paleocene a considerable number of fragmentary mammal
specimens. Interesting new forms contribute information to the
known fauna of the Dragon formation. The bulk of the season
was spent in the Bridger formation of the Eocene in southwestern
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

Wyoming, where 149 lots of fossil specimens were obtained. A
skeleton of Uintatheriwm complete enough to articulate for exhi-
bition, probably the most complete skeleton of this animal yet dis-
covered, was the outstanding specimen collected. Partial skeletons
of Palaeosyops are also of high importance.

Short trips to the Miocene along Chesapeake Bay for cetacean
remains were made by Dr. Remington Kellogg and other members
of the staff. Many specimens from this unique fauna have been
added to the collections.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit, on behalf of the Board of Trustees
of the National Gallery of Art, the fourth annual report of the Board
covering its operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1941.

Such report is being made pursuant to the provisions of the act of
March 24, 1937 (50 Stat. 51), as amended by the public resolution of
April 13, 1939 (Pub. Res. No. 9, 76th Cong.). Under this act Con-
gress created, in the Smithsonian Institution, a bureau to be directed
by a board to be known as the “Trustees of the National Gallery of
Art,” charged with the maintenance and administration of the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, appropriated to the Smithsonian Institution
the area bounded by Seventh Street, Constitution Avenue, Fourth
Street, and North Mall Drive (now Madison Drive) Northwest, in the
District of Columbia, as a site for a National Gallery of Art, and
authorized the Smithsonian Institution to permit The A. W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable Trust, a public charitable trust estab-
lished by the late Hon. Andrew W. Mellon, of Pittsburgh, Pa., to
construct thereon a building to be designated the “National Gallery of
Art.” Further, the act authorizes the Board to accept, for the Smith-
sonian Institution, and to hold and administer gifts, bequests, and
devises of money, securities, or other property for the benefit of the
National Gallery of Art; also, under the creating act, the United States
is pledged to provide such funds as may be necessary for the upkeep
of the National Gallery of Art and the administrative expenses and
costs of operation thereof, including the protection and care of the
works of art so that the Gallery shall at all times be properly main-
tained and the works of art exhibited regularly to the genera! public,
free of charge.

COMPLETION AND OCCUPATION OF THE GALLERY BUILDING ~

Formal notice of the completion of the National Gallery of Art
project, calling for the construction of the Gallery building and the
landscaping of the area appropriated for the site of the National
Gallery of Art, in accordance*with plans and specifications approved
by the Commission of Fine Arts, was given by the Trustees of The
A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust under date of No-
vember 30, 1940, to the Trustees of the National Gallery of Art and
the Smithsonian Institution, and as provided in the trust indenture

34
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

dated June 24, 1937, the legal title to the building was deemed forth-
with to be vested in the Smithsonian Institution, of which the National
Gallery of Art is a bureau, and the maintenance and administration
of the building and site became the exclusive and sole obligation of
the Trustees of the National Gallery of Art. A copy of the notice of
completion is attached to this report, as exhibit A (not printed).

The Gallery building was turned over to the Trustees of the Gallery
on December 1, 1940, and following inspection and upon certification
by Eggers and Higgins, successors of John Russell Pope, architect
for the Gallery, as to the final completion of the project, the Trustees
of the Gallery, at a meeting held December 10, 1940, formally accepted
the Gallery project. Copy of the architect’s certifieate is attached
to this report, as exhibit B (not printed). At this meeting the mem-
bers of the Board expressed great satisfaction with the coustruction
of the Gallery building, as finally completed, and their appreciation
of the efforts of the Trustees of The A. W. Mellon Educational and
Charitable Trust, the surviving Trustees being Paul Mellon, Donald
D. Shepard, and David K. E. Bruce, in the erection of a Gallery build-
ing of such monumental character and such outstanding architectural
merit.

The Trustees have been apprised that the total cost of the Gallery,
including approaches and the landscaping of the site, amounted to
$15,035,597.50.

The small nucleus of the Gallery staff, which was housed in offices
furnished by The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust,
moved into the building on November 27, 1940, and proceeded with
the work of installation of furnishings and equipment. By Decem-
ber 1, 1940, the nuclear staff, consisting of curatorial and clerical
employees, mechanical, guard, and cleaning force, had been organ-
ized sufficiently to take over the administration and maintenance
of the Gallery building by the Trustees.

During the first days of January 1941, the works of art in the
Mellon Collection were moved into the building, and during January,
February, and March the works of art in the Kress Collection were
received from New York.

Installation of the works of art in the two collections in the gal-
leries prepared for them was undertaken immediately upon their
receipt in the new building, and was completed the first week of
March.

DEDICATION CEREMONIES AND OPENING OF
THE GALLERY TO THE PUBLIC

On the evening of March 17, 1941, 8,822 invited guests attended
the opening ceremonies. Included among the invited guests were
the members of the Cabinet, Senate, and House of Representatives,

430577—42—4
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

Government officials, the diplomatic corps, artists, art critics, heads
of educational institutions, persons generally interested in art, and
other distinguished guests.

The ceremonies, a half-hour program, with Chief Justice Charles
Evans Hughes as the presiding officer, began at 10 o’clock, with an
invocation by the Reverend ZeBarney Thorne Phillips, Chaplain of
the Senate. Following a brief talk by the Chief Justice on the
object and purposes of the Gallery project, Paul Mellon, son of the
late Andrew W. Mellon, the donor of the Gallery, on behalf of his
father and the Trustees of the Mellon Trust, presented the Gallery
and the Melion Collection to the Nation. Samuel H. Kress then
presented the Kress Collection of Italian paintings to the Gallery.
The President of the United States accepted the Gallery and the
Mellon and Kress Collections on behalf of the people of the United
States. A copy of the President’s address, and that of Chief Justice
Hughes, are attached to this report, as exhibit C (not printed). The
ceremonies closed with the National Anthem, led by the United
States Marine Band. During the early part of the evening, there
was a preview of the Gallery collections. Orchestras played in the
garden courts, decorated with the famous Widener collection of
acacias, which had been given to the Nation for the joint use of the
Gallery and the United States Botanic Garden, and tropical plants.

On the following day, March 18, 1941, the Gallery was opened to
the public and was viewed by large crowds. In accordance with
the decision of the Board of Trustees, the Gallery building is open
every day in the year, except Christmas and New Year’s day. The
hours are 10 a. m. to 5 p. m. on week days and 2 p. m. to 5 p. m. on
Sundays.

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

The statutory members of the Board are the Chief Justice of the
United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury,
and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, ex officio, and five
general trustees. The general trustees, serving during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1941, were David K. E. Bruce, Duncan Phillips,
Ferdinand Lammot Belin, Joseph E. Widener, and Samuel H. Kress.
In May 1941 the general trustees elected Ferdinand Lammot Belin,
whose term of office would expire on July 1, 1941, to succeed himself
as a general trustee, to serve as such until July 1, 1951. At the
meeting of the Board held on June 20, 1941, the resignation of Chief
Justice Charles Evans Hughes was accepted by the Trustees with
great regret, to take effect July 1, 1941, and in doing so the Board
adopted the following resolutions:

Whereas the Honorable Charles Evans Hughes has resigned as Chief Justice
of the United States and has consequently tendered his resignation as Chairman
of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Art, effective July 1, 1941;

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37

And whereas the Board of Trustees has learned of his resignation with
profound regret;

Therefore, be it resolved, That the members of the Board of Trustees record
their sense of the loss which the Gallery has sustained in being deprived of the
services of Chief Justice Hughes;

And be it also resolved, That the Board hereby expresses its grateful apprecia-
tion for the devotion with which he has carried out his duties as Chairman,
and for the wisdom and unfailing courtesy with which he has guided the affairs
of the National Gallery during the critical years of its formative period;

And be it further resolved, That the Board wishes to express to him its high
regard and best wishes that he may enjoy many years of health and happiness
after his long career of distinguished public service to his country.

Pursuant to the provision of the act of March 24, 1937, the newly
appointed Chief Justice of the United States, the Honorable Harlan
F. Stone, who succeeds Chief Justice Hughes, will serve as an ex
officio trustee of the Gallery.

The Board at its annual meeting held February 10, 1941, reelected
David K. E. Bruce, President, and Ferdinand Lammot Belin was
reelected Vice President of the Board to serve for the ensuing year.
The executive officers who continued in office were Donald D. Shepard,
Secretary-Treasurer and General Counsel; David E. Finley, Director ;
Harry A. McBride, Administrator; John Walker, Chief Curator ; and
Macgill James, Assistant Director. Other officers of the Gallery con-
tinuing in office were Charles Seymour, Jr., curator of sculpture;
George T. Heckert, assistant to the administrator; and Sterling P.
Eagleton, chief engineer and building superintendent. During the
year Charles Zinsner was appointed assistant treasurer and the fol-
lowing honorary officers were appointed by the Board: Alexander
R. Reed, building consultant; Alfred Geiffert, Jr., consultant land-
scape architect; and William A. Frederick, consultant horticulturist.

The three standing committees of the Board, provided for in the
bylaws, as constituted at the annual meeting of the Board, held
February 10, 1941, were:

Other standing committees appointed by the Board during the
year: A committee to make recommendations as to the acceptance
or rejection of gifts of property other than works of art, monies,
and securities; a committee on public relations; and a committee on
the building.

During the first half of the year all of the civil service positions
for the Gallery staff had been classified and by March 1, 1941, prac-
tically all of the initial staff of the Gallery, including the curatorial,
clerical, custodial, and maintenance personnel had been employed.
On June 30, 1941, 229 civil service employees were on the Gallery
staff. Among such employees were the chief docent, the librarian,
and the registrar.

The cataloging of the works of art was completed so that it was
possible to issue the first catalog of the National Gallery by March
17, 1941, the date of the opening.

The guard force was organized to assure not only efficiency in
the protection of the works of art and of the building and grounds,
but also to assure a high quality of service to the public.

APPROPRIATIONS

For salaries and expenses, for the upkeep and operation of the
National Gallery of Art, the protection and care of the works of art
therein, and all administrative expenses incident thereto, as author-

been conducted through the Gallery by members of the docent staff
in special gallery tours, available to the general public. Two thou-

MEMORIAL TABLET

At the annual meeting of the Board, on February 10, 1941, the
Board authorized the erection of a memorial tablet to the late
Andrew W. Mellon, with an inscription in the wording appearing
immediately below, under a bas-relief portrait of Mr. Mellon to be
done in marble:

ANDREW WILLIAM MELLON

1855-1937

He gave the Building, with
his Collection, for the founding
of this National Gallery of Art.

For the whole earth is the sepulchre of
famous men; and their story is not graven
only on stone over their native earth, but
lives on far away, without visible symbol,
woven into the stuff of other men’s lives.

This tablet was installed, prior to the opening of the Gallery, be-
tween the then two free standing pillars in the lobby, facing the
Constitution Avenue entrance of the Gallery. The bas-relief portrait
was executed by Jo Davidson. The cost of the work was contributed
by The A. W. Mellion Educational and Charitable Trust.

and there was installed in the building, a bronze tablet recording
the history of the erection of the building, with the names of the
donor and others who rendered valuable aid toward the completion
of the Gallery project.

Board set aside the four marble panels on the east and west walls
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

of the Constitution Avenue entrance lobby for the names of impor-
tant donors to the Gallery, and arranged for the carving at the top
of one of the panels the words, “Principal Benefactors of the
National Gallery of Art,” and beneath, the names “Andrew William
Mellon” and “Samuel Henry Kress.” The Board further authorized

of the Gallery.

records maintained for such funds has been submitted to the Gal-
lery. The financial statement referred to above is attached to this
report, as exhibit E (not printed).

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47

SUGGESTED RULES FOR THE ADMISSION OF PORTRAITS TO THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT
GALLERY PREDICATED ON THOSE OF THE BRITISH NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY

1. Admission of a portrait to the Gallery shall be based primarily on the
celebrity of its subject rather than on its artistic merit. Such celebrity shall
have been acquired from the subject’s contribution to the history or development
of the United States regardless of his or her opinions, words, or deeds.

2. No portrait of any living person shall be admitted to the Gallery unless
such portrait is that of one of a group of persons at least a majority of whom
are dead.

3. No portrait of any person dead less than 20 years shall be admitted to
the Gallery except by unanimous vote by individual ballot of those present at
a meeting of the Commission.

4. No gift or bequest shall be accepted or portrait purchased except by a
three-fourths vote of the members present at the meeting of the Commission.

The Commission recommended to the Board of Regents the re-
election of John E. Lodge, David E. Finley, Edward W. Redfield,
and Paul Manship.

The following officers were reelected for the ensuing year: Charles
L. Borie, Jr., chairman; Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., vice chairman,
and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, secretary.

The following were elected members of the executive committee
for the ensuing year: Herbert Adams, Gilmore D. Clarke, John E.
Lodge. Charles L. Borie, Jr., as chairman of the Commission, and
Dr. Charles G. Abbot, as secretary of the Commission, are ex-officic
members of the executive committee.

The chairman stated that as the competition for the plans for
the Smithsonian Gallery of Art had come to an end and no funds
had been obtained for further work on the project, there was nothing
to report.

Mr. Clarke and the Secretary also addressed the Commission in
regard to the activities connected with the recent competition for
the plans for the Gallery, but no action was taken, although the
members expressed the feeling that the Commission was ready to take
active steps whenever funds were available to advance the project.

REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1941, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of April 18, 1940, which
provides “* * * for continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii and the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains. * * *”

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau, left Washington on Decem-
ber 29 to continue his archeological excavations in southern Mexico.
Intensive excavations were begun at the site of Cerro de las Mesas
on the Rio Blanco in the state of Veracruz, this site having been
visited the preceding season. In addition, another expedition was
made to the site of Izapa in the southwestern part of the state of
Chiapas. As in the 2 preceding years, the work was undertaken in
cooperation with the National Geographic Society. Dr. Philip
Drucker again accompanied Mr. Stirling as assistant archeologist.

At Cerro de las Mesas 20 carved stone monuments were unearthed
and photographed, several mounds were cross-sectioned, and a num-
ber of stratigraphic trenches dug on various sections of the site.
The stratigraphic work proved unusually successful and extends the
cultural column for this part of Veracruz to a much later date than
did the excavations at Tres Zapotes. Two initial series dates were
deciphered at Cerro de las Mesas, one being in the 1st katun, the other
in the 4th katun, of baktun 9. Another stone monument at this site
was of considerable interest because of its similarity to the famous
Tuxtla statuette. Large quantities of jade were found including one
cache containing 782 specimens.

At Izapa a large number of stelae, most of them with altars, were
excavated and photographed. This site is important because of its
location, which makes it an interesting link between the west coast
of Guatemala and the isthmian region of southern Mexico.

At the conclusion of the work at Cerro de las Mesas at the end
of April, the collections were brought to Mexico City where Dr.
Drucker remained to work with them.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 57

During the year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, employed most
of his time in completing an extensive report on the Indians of the
Southeast, upon which work had been done during several past
years, and which covers about 1,500 typewritten pages. This is now
ready for final copy and editing.

The bulletin entitled “Source Material on the Ethnology and His-
tory of the Caddo Indians,” upon which he was at work last year
is now in galley proof. It will cover about 350 printed pages. A
brief contribution by Dr. Swanton entitled “The Quipu and Peruvian
Civilization” has been accepted for publication in a forthcoming
bulletin of anthropological papers and is now in the hands of the
printer.

Early in the year the bulletin prepared by Dr. Swanton entitled
“Linguistic Material from the Tribes of Southern Texas and North-
eastern Mexico,” was completed and distributed. It contains all of
the fragments of the Coahuiltecan, Karankawan, and Tamaulipecan
tongues known to be in existence, and covers 145 pages.

Considerable time has also been devoted by Dr. Swanton to answer-
ing letters, including particularly extension of advice regarding the
placing of markers along the route pursued by Hernando de Soto
and work for the United States Board on Geographical Names.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. John P. Harrington, eth-
nologist, was engaged in working over Navaho materials and those
of the closely related Tlingit language of Alaska. Recent field
studies had proved that something like 200 words of Navaho and
Tlingit are almost the same despite the 2,000-mile separation of the
two languages. Sometimes the same word was found to be applied
to two very different organisms; for instance, what is crab apple in
the north is cactus in the south (spininess being the trait which these
two plants evidently have in common), and jack pine in the north
was found to be juniper in the south.

Tlingit was copiously recorded in southeastern Alaska, and the
Ugalenz language, related to the Tlingit and to the Navaho, was
discovered and studied. The Ugalenz formerly occupied 350 miles
of southeastern Alaska coast, from Prince William Sound in the
west to Latuya Bay in the east.

The origin of the name Sitka, the old Russian capital of Alaska,
was discovered. The name means “On the oceanward side of Bara-
nov Island.” Shee is the name of Baranov Island, and Sitka is
situated on its oceanward side.

Leaving in August for Gallup, N. Mex., Dr. Harrington worked
on many parts of the Navaho Reservation, finding a surprising uni-
formity in dialect. This uniformity must have arisen from a jumb-
ling together of earlier Navaho dialects when the Navahos were in
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

captivity in eastern New Mexico in 1867 and 1868. During this
captivity, dialects were evidently jostled together, and resettlement
by the United States Government further dislocated them.

Field work during the latter part of the summer was done with
more than 10 of the leading Navaho interpreters. In a tribe of more
than 45,000 population, there are many educated speakers, including
university graduates, and with them were explored special features
of the language which could not have been obtained from the tongues
of poor and uneducated tribes without much greater expenditure of
time.

The Navaho language was found to have only 4 vowels and 34
consonants, making it a true consonantal language. The sounds of
Navaho were found to be almost identical with those of the other
languages of the Southwest, for instance, with those of the neighbor-
ing Tewa language. Also many words were found to be the same as
in Tewa. Navaho was found to have, for practical purposes, a
high and a low tone, and a falling and rising tone only on long
vowels and diphthongs. One of the most peculiar developments
to be found in any language is the hardening in Navaho of almost
any consonant by placing a sound of German ch after it if it is
voiceless, and of open g (gh) after it if it is voiced. There are also
traces of a hardening of | to n, and the lke.

Returning to Washington late in the fall, Dr. Harrington continued
his study of the Navaho, until it now constitutes a finished manuscript
of more than 1,200 pages. Throughout the work there has been a
constant revelation that Navaho and related languages are not as
unlike other American Indian languages as has been thought by early
vocabulary makers and classifiers.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1940, Dr. Frank H. H.
Roberts, Jr., was engaged in a continuation of excavations at the Lin-
denmeier site, a former Folsom camping ground, in northern Color-
ado. From August 1 to 31 he was on leave and during that period, in
accord with the Smithsonian Institution’s policy of cooperation with
other scientific organizations, directed the excavation program of the
advanced students at the University of New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon
Research Station.

From Chaco Canyon, N. Mex., Dr. Roberts went to Boulder City,
Nev., to inspect a large cave located in the lower end of the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado River at the upper reaches of Lake Mead.
The trip to the cave was made by motorboat from Pierce’s Ferry in
company with officials of the National Park Service’s Boulder Dam
Recreational Area. Rampart Cave is situated in the south wall of
the canyon at the top of a steep talus 600 feet above the present water
level. It is of unusual interest because of its extensive deposits of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59

sloth remains and of the bones from large creatures that preyed on
the sloth, and the possibility that it may provide evidence of human
contemporaneity with such extinct animal forms in that area. Plans
and methods for a program of excavation were discussed and various
suggestions were made concerning the advisability of providing an
exhibit in situ for visitors to the Boulder Dam Recreational Area.

From Boulder Dam, Dr. Roberts returned to the Lindenmeier site
where he continued his investigations until the end of September when
the project was brought to a close. During the six seasons of inten-
sive exploration of this Folsom site and the adjacent area much new
and valuable information on the subject of early occupation of North
America was obtained. From the large series of specimens collected
it will be possible to draw comprehensive conclusions relative to the
material culture and economic status of the aboriginal peoples inhabit-
ing that portion of the country during the closing days of the last Ice
Age, and in general to broaden the knowledge on early stages in New
World history.

Dr. Roberts returned to Washington in October. He spent the
autumn and winter months working on the material from the Linden-
meier site, preparing the manuscript for his report on the investiga-
tions there, in writing short articles for publication in various scien-
tific journals, in identifying numerous archeological specimens sent in
from all parts of the country by interested amateurs, and in furnishing
information on many phases of New World archeology. Plans and
preparations were made for an expedition to the Coclé region in the
province of Penonome, Panama, but, because of the last-minute devel-
opment of an insuperable combination of adverse circumstances, the
proposed investigations had to be abandoned.

On May 15, 1941, Dr. Roberts went to Bedford, Va., to initiate exca-
vations at the Mons site near the Peaks of Otter where the late D. I.
Bushnell, Jr., had found artifacts suggestive of a much earlier aborig-
inal occupation of the area than previously had been supposed. Con-
struction work on the Blue Ridge Parkway had destroyed much of the
site, but a series of test trenches dug in various undisturbed remnants
established the fact that it had once been an Indian camping place,
possibly a village site of late protohistoric times. However, there was
no evidence of its having been used by older groups comparable to the
early hunting peoples of the western plains.

On the completion of the work at the Mons site, Dr. Roberts returned
to Washington and on June 11 left for San Jon, N. Mex. Camp was
established on the rim of the Staked Plains 1014 miles south of that
town and excavations were started at a site where material suggestive
of another phase of early man in North America, the so-called Yuma,
has been found. The location is in a shallow Hake that appears to
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

have been an old, filled-in lake bed. Heavy erosion in recent years
started a series of ravines and gullies and exposed extensive deposits
of bones. Stone implements found near some of these outcroppings
indicate the possibility that many of the creatures were killed by
aboriginal hunters and that an association of man-made objects and
bones from extinct species of animals can be established. Bison,
camel, and mammoth bones, as well as those from smaller and as yet
unidentified mammals, occur in the site. Material in the fill in the
old lake bed probably can be correlated with other geologic phenomena
of established age. Hence, the determination of contemporaneity be-
tween the artifacts, animal remains, and lake deposits would constitute
an important addition to the evidence on early occupation in the New
World. There is also a possibility that the site may contribute infor-
mation on the subject of relationships between some of the different
older cultural remains. At the close of the fiscal year Dr. Roberts and
his party were well started on the problem of the San Jon site.

The beginning of the fiscal year found Dr. Julian H. Steward,
anthropoligist, in British Columbia completing researches on abo-
riginal Carrier Indian ethnography and on ecological aspects of
recent changes in Carrier socio-economic culture at Fort St. James and
neighboring villages. While here a collection was made of more than
100 Carrier specimens of material culture, and of more than 50 ethno-
botanical specimens. At this time several pit-lodge sites were ex-
amined. From here Dr. Steward proceeded to Alaska, and then by
plane from Ketchikan to an island off the coast where he investigated
a burial site reported by Commander F. A. Zeusler, of the Coast Guard,
and Ranger Lloyd Bransford, of the United States Forest Service.
Accompanied by the latter, he procured specimens of several skeletons,
fragments of carved burial boxes and other materials, and a mummified
body in excellent preservation. The body was dressed in buckskin,
wrapped in a cedar mat, and deposited ina cedar box. All specimens
were brought back by plane to Ketchikan and shipped to the Smith-
sonian Institution. From Alaska Dr. Steward went to Berkeley,
Calif., to hold consultations on the Handbook of South American In-
dians, which is being prepared for the Smithsonian Institution.
From there he proceeded to Albuquerque and Chaco Canyon, N. Mex.,
for further consultations and to attend the Coronado Quatrocenten-
nial and the Chaco conference, finally arriving in Washington late in
August.

The remainder of the year was devoted mainly to editorial and or-
ganizational work on the Handbook of South American Indians, and
work on the project was actually initiated, $6,000 having been made
available for this purpose by special appropriation for cooperation
with the American republics through the Department of State’s Inter-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

departmental Committee. The collaboration of 33 contributors, each
a specialist in some phase of South American anthropology, was ar-
ranged. Work accomplished during the year included completion of
manuscripts by Dr. Robert H. Lowie and Dr. Alfred Métraux totaling
more than 150,000 words; completion of a new base map drawn from
the American Geographical Society’s 1: 1,000,000 sheets, and of four
new maps showing respectively the vegetation, climates, physical fea-
tures, and topography of South America; compilation of a preliminary
bibliography of near!y 2,000 items; substantial progress on many other
manuscripts; and integration of the Handbook plan with research
activities of many other institutions in different countries. Arrange-
ment was made to engage the services of Dr. Métraux on full-time
basis as assistant editor in the fiscal year 1941-42. The services of a
secretary were had for the Handbook during three months of 1941.

During the fall Dr. Steward acted as chairman of the Program
Committee of the American Anthropological Association, arranging
the program for the Christmas meetings in Philadelphia. He also
served on the Committee on Latin American Anthropology of the
National Research Council and accepted membership on the Scientific
Advisory Committee of the Pan American Trade Committee.

The following scientific papers were published: Archeological Re-
connaissance of Southern Utah, Bur. Amer. Ethnol. Bull. 128, pp.
275-356; Nevada Shoshone, in Univ. California Culture Element Dis-
tributions; several short papers on the Carrier Indians; a description
of the Handbook of South American Indians for the Boletin Biblio-
grafico de Antropologia Americana. An article was prepared for
American Antiquity on The Direct Historic Approach to Archeology.

During the fiscal year Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., ethnologist, con-
tinued with the study and description of archeological collections from
prehistoric and protohistoric Eskimo village sites in the vicinity of
Bering Strait. Material was also assembled for a paper on the origin
and antiquity of the Eskimo race and culture in relation to the larger
question of the original entry of man into America.

At the request of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology
and Ethnology of Harvard University, Dr. Collins made two trips to
Cambridge to assist in the identification and selection of materials for
the new Eskimo exhibit being planned by Donald Scott, director of the
Museum, and his assistant, Frederick G. Pleasants.

Dr. Collins also served as collaborator and technical adviser for
Erpi Classroom Films, Inc., in connection with production of a motion-
picture record of Eskimo life on Nunivak Island, Alaska, to be made
by Amos Burg, explorer and photographer. The film, designed for
use in the elementary schools, will provide an authentic picture of the
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

daily life and activities of the Nunivagmiut, who have retained more
of their native culture than any other coastal-group Eskimo in Alaska.

During July 1940 Dr. William N. Fenton, associate anthropologist,
was engaged in field work among the Senecas of Allegany Reserva-
tion, N. Y. While here he delivered the St. Lawrence University
series of lectures at the Allegany School of Natural History. The
lectures on the Iroquoian Peoples of the Northeast covered prehis-
toric cultures of the area, the adjustment of the Iroquois to their
environment, their society and government, and their religious sys-
tem. At the Six Nations Reserve on Grand River, Ontario, Canada,
August 9 to September 1, the yearly cycle of ceremonies that are
currently celebrated at the Onondaga Longhouse were outlined by
Simeon Gibson and the principal speeches that constitute the bulk
of the annual Midwinter Festival were taken in Onondaga text and
translated. This study is an extension of previous investigations
of Seneca ceremonies which Dr. Fenton has published, and it adds
new material on the nature of village bands and their removals,
the function of moieties, the nature of residence after marriage, and
the sororate which was practiced, at least by the Lower Cayugas.
Further assistance was rendered by Deputy Chief Hardy Gibson
with Hewitt’s manuscript on the Requickening Address for installing
chiefs in the Iroquois League, which Dr. Fenton is editing for pub-
lication.

Returning from the field September 15 with 300 photographic
negatives, largely of masks studied at museums in New York and
Ontario together with a series of their manufacture and use in
Troquois fraternities, much time elapsed assembling pictures and
notes and arranging them for study.

A special paper on The Place of the Iroquois in the Prehistory of
America was presented before the Anthropological Society of Wash-
ington; and Dr. Fenton also served as technical adviser for An
Indian League of Nations, which was broadcast. October 27 on
“The World is Yours” radio program.

Work on two new research projects aimed at clearing up prob-
lems previously outlined was begun during the year. While serving
as consultant to the Pennsylvania Historical Commission on arche-
ological matters, Dr. Fenton contacted local historians who are col-
laborating in special phases of a study of Cornplanter’s Senecas on
the upper Allegheny River; and it is planned to publish their find-
ings together with Quaker Mission Journals from 1798 which describe
Indian life and events attending Handsome Lake’s revelations. In
quest of original sources, Dr. Fenton searched the Records of the
Yearly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia, and visited the libraries
of Haverford and Swarthmore Colleges. In this project he has
had the active help of M. E. Deardorff of Warren, Pa., and C. E.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

Congdon of Salamanca, N. Y., who have located and transcribed
other documentary sources.

Iroquois music has long deserved serious study, and with the devel-
opment of modern electric sound-recording apparatus, record making
in the field has become practicable. When the Division of Music
in the Library of Congress furnished the necessary blanks and
apparatus for Dr. Fenton’s trip to the Six Nations Midwinter Fes-
tival, January 10 to February 17, 1941, Dr. Fenton undertook the
task of making the recordings, first at Ohsweken, Ontario, and later
at Quaker Ridge, N. Y. Sixty-two double-face records were made
of samples of social and religious dance songs, and complete runs of
several shamanistic song cycles and the Adoption Rite of the Tutelo
were taken. Informants gave complete texts for all the recordings,
and these, as rewritten after returning to Washington, should prove
helpful to the transcriber. For this purpose the Recording Labora-
tory is furnishing a duplicate set. Because musicologists have ex-
pressed interest in the recordings, several were selected for a proposed
Album of Iroquois Music, which the Library contemplates publishing ;
and in return for the fine cooperation of the Recording Laboratory
and the Division of Music, Dr. Fenton delivered a lecture, Music in
Iroquois Religion and Society, illustrated with slides and records,
as the first of a series by the Archive of American Folk-song. It
was repeated for the Society of Pennsylvania Archaeology at its
annual meeting.

In addition a series of brief informal excursions were made to
Allegany regarding place names and to explore the area that may
be flooded by the proposed Allegheny Reservoir, and to Tonawanda
to collect song texts of the Medicine Society.

Besides a number of book reviews in scientific and historical jour-
nals, Dr. Fenton published two papers in Bureau of American Eth-
nology Bulletin 128—Iroquois Suicide: A Study in the Stability of
a Culture Pattern, and Tonawanda Longhouse Ceremonies: Ninety
Years After Lewis Henry Morgan—and an article, Museum and
Field Studies of Iroquois Masks and Ritualism, which appeared in
the Explorations and Field-work of the Smithsonian Institution in
1940. Dr. Fenton prepared for publication in the Annual Report
of the Smithsonian Institution for 1940, a paper entitled “Masked
Medicine Societies of the Iroquois.”

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the Bureau, continued
her study of Indian music by collecting additional songs, transcribing
these and songs previously recorded, and preparing material for pub-
lication. In August 1940 a trip was made to Wisconsin Dells, Wis.,
64. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

to interview a group of visiting Zui Indians. Songs were obtained
from Falling Star, an Indian born in Zufi, who had lived in the
pueblo most of his life and taken part in the dances. His father
also was a singer and dancer. Falling Star recorded 17 songs, 15
of which were transcribed and submitted to the Bureau. These are
chiefly songs of lay-participants in the Rain Dance and the songs
connected with grinding corn for household use.

Additional data on the peyote cult among the Winnebago were
obtained from a former informant and incorporated in the manuscript
on that tribe.

In October Miss Densmore went to Washington for consultation
on manuscripts awaiting publication. During the winter she tran-
scribed records of 71 Seminole songs, completing the transcriptions
of recordings made in that tribe during the seasons of 1931, 1932, and
1933. It is expected that the book on Seminole music, containing
245 songs, will be completed in the near future.

A paper on A Search for Songs Among the Chitimacha Indians
in Louisiana, submitted in 1933, was rewritten, amplified, and pre-
pared for publication. The Chitimacha is the only tribe visited by
Miss Densmore in which all the songs have been forgotten. Musical
customs were remembered, and several legends were related in which
songs were formerly sung.

In May 1941 Miss Densmore read a paper on The Native Art of
the Chippewa before the Central States Branch of the American
Anthropological Association at the Annual meeting held in
Minneapolis.

At the close of the fiscal year Miss Densmore was in Nebraska, her
special interest being a search for songs that were recorded phono-
graphically by Miss Alice C. Fletcher in the decade prior to 1893
and published in that year by the Peabody Museum of American
Archaeology and Ethnology. If Indians can be found who remem-
ber these songs, they will be recorded again. A comparison of the
two recordings will show the degree of accuracy with which the
songs have been transmitted, and will be important to the subject
of Indian music.

The entire collection of recordings of Indian songs submitted to
the Bureau by Miss Densmore has been transferred to the National
Archives for permanent preservation. These recordings were made
and submitted during the period from 1907 to 1940, all having been
cataloged and transcribed in musical notation. Many hundreds of
other recordings have been made, studied, and retained by Miss
Densmore but not transcribed. Recordings submitted after 1940
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

have been cataloged in sequence with the former collection. Thirty-
five tribes are represented in the collection of 2,237 recordings, in addi-
tion to a group of songs recorded in British Columbia in which the
tribes are not designated.

LIBRARY

There has been no change in the library staff during the fiscal year.
Accessions during the fiscal year totaled 378.

The library staff has relabeled and reshelved 5,137 books. The sec-
tions of general ethnology and non-American material, and linguis-
tics have now been entirely reclassified and reshelved. Library of
Congress printed cards, so far as they are available, have been
ordered for practically all of this material, when not already in the
catalog. Part of the work of typing these cards and filing in the
catalog has been completed and will be finished in a month or two.

The sorting of foreign periodicals and society transactions has
been completed and all material not in the library field has been
put aside for appropriate disposal. A temporary shelf list has been
made for this material and it is hoped that this section will be
reclassified and reshelved by the first of the year. The checking lists
for the second edition of the Union List of Serials were marked with
our holdings and returned.

The sorting of the pamphlet collection has been completed and
more than half have been classified and shelved. Library of Con-
gress cards where available have been ordered. In the future the
library will have no separate pamphlet collection. All pamphlets
that are kept will be classified and shelved with the books. Work
has also been done on Congressional documents and some of this
material is now! classified and reshelved. Government documents
from the War and Interior Departments, publications of the Chero-
kee and Choctaw nations, and of various special boards and com-
missions have been sorted and classified and all Library of Congress
cards available ordered.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the ac-
tivities of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1941:

The appropriation allowed by Congress was $44,880, the same
amount as for the previous year. There was also received by trans-
fer from the Department of State $500 from an appropriation made
by Congress to that Department for cooperation with the American
republics. This amount was allotted to the Exchange Service for
mailing packages of publications to the Argentine Republic and
Brazil, so that they would reach their destinations without the delay
which occurs when shipments are made through exchange bureaus.
To all other South and Central American countries, with one excep-
tion, exchanges are transmitted by mail under governmental frank.
From repayments there was collected $3,036.53, making the total
available resources $48,416.53.

The number of packages received for transmission during the year
was 576,282, a decrease of 63,062. The weight was 388,649 pounds, a
decrease of 138,896 pounds.

The following table gives the number and weight of packages sent
and received through the service:

The packages referred to in the above table as sent abroad were
forwarded partly in boxes by freight to exchange bureaus for dis-

69
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

tribution and partly by mail directly to their destinations. The
number of boxes shipped was 965, a decrease from the preceding
year of 929. Of these boxes, 419 were for depositories of full sets of
United States governmental documents and the contents of the re-
mainder were for depositories of partial sets and for distribution to
various establishments and individuals. The number of mail
packages was 117,700.

As stated last year, when a decrease in the work of the office was
reported, the falling off in the amount of material handled is due
to the interruption of the interchange of publications between the
United States and many countries owing to the foreign wars. Ship-
ments to nearly all the European countries, as well as to China and
places bordering on the Mediterranean, have been suspended tem-
porarily. Through special efforts, however, it has been possible dur-
ing the latter part of the year to forward large consignments to
Sweden and Switzerland. Transmissions were made to Finland
and the Soviet Republic almost to the end of the fiscal year, but
when those countries became involved in the European war, further
shipments to them were suspended. One large consignment was for-
warded to Spain during the year and several others were sent to
Portugal. Owing to the conditions abroad, however, the Institution
cannot follow any regular schedule in the sending of boxes to those
two countries. With the exception of one or two short suspensions,
there has been no interruption to the transmission of shipments to
and from Great Britain, although, owing to the shortage of cargo
space, it has not been possible to dispatch consignments as promptly
as before the war.

The British Museum and the London School of Economics and
Political Science, both depositories of United States governmental
documents, have requested that no further consignments be for-
warded to them until the close of the war, because of the possibility
of destruction of the material through the bombings of London.
The Edinburgh Public Library and the St. Andrews University also
have asked that publications for them be stored until the cessation
of hostilities. No other requests for the withholding of transmissions
have been made by British establishments.

The very large number of packages for shipment abroad that are
being held here awaiting the cessation of the war has over-
taxed the space in the Exchange rooms to such an extent that it has
been necessary to construct a storage shed in the grounds in the
rear of the Smithsonian Building for storing the books. The struc-
ture is made of corrugated iron and is substantially built. When
the emergency is over, the shed will be used for the storage of empty
packing boxes.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 71

Since the outbreak of the European war in September 1939, so
far as reported to the Institution, five consignments of exchanges
have been lost, the details of which are given below:

Five boxes forwarded to Denmark in December 1939 were destroyed on the
dock in Bergen by fire caused by airplane bombardment.

Five boxes sent to France in April 1940 were destroyed by fire at the Havre
railroad station.

Eleven boxes forwarded to England in November 1940 were lost at sea.

Thirteen boxes sent to Germany in August 1939 were lost at Havre after
the consignment was disembarked.

One box, while in the warehouse of the Smithsonian agents in London await-
ing shipment to the Institution, was destroyed in January 1941 by fire caused by
airplane bombardment.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

On account of conditions in Europe due to the war, several deposi-
tories have been removed from the list of those receiving full and par-
tial sets of United States governmental documents. This has resulted
in reducing the number of those publications now received from a
total of 104 to 92—55 full and 37 partial sets.

The depository of the partial set in Haiti has been changed from
the Department of Foreign Affairs to the National Library. The Hon-
duran Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been added to the partial-set
list.

After the expiration of the year’s extension granted Frank E.
Gass, he was retired from the Government service February 28, 1941.
However, having been appointed correspondence clerk on the Smith-
sonian private roll, effective March 1, he is continuing to carry on
his work in the Exchange office.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper-
ations of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1941:

The regular appropriation made by Congress was $239,910, all of
which was expended with the exception of $2,440 which represents
savings from lapses in the filling of vacant positions.

PERSONNEL

An important personnel change was the appointment on June
2, 1941, of Carter H. Anthony, D. V. M., as veterinarian. He came
to the Zoo from the University of Arkansas, where he was engaged
in animal disease research work. This is the first time in the
history of the Zoo that a full-time position of this character has
been filled. It is expected that this will result in a more careful
dietary supervision, as well as much better medical and surgical
attendance on the animals. Also closer cooperation can be given
the various Government departments, as well as outsiders, in any
experiments and studies in which the facilities of the Zoo are used.

A much larger turnover in the force than in prior years has been
occasioned by men accepting positions in work connected with the
National Defense program. Included in this was the recall to active
service of William J. Grant, senior operating engineer, a member
of the Naval Reserve.

IMPROVEMENTS

The closing of the W. P. A. project at the Zoo on August 6, 1940,
prevented improvements that had been contemplated for the year.
The regular force is hardly sufficient to maintain routine repairs, and
therefore few improvements were begun.

The series of four waterfowl ponds was completed, and birds
transferred there on July 29, 1940. This now makes one of the
most attractive outdoor exhibits in the Zoo. It is especially so
when viewed from the terrace of the new restaurant.

The reptile pit on the south side of the reptile house was com-
pleted by adding a small waterfall at one corner.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 79

The old waterfowl pond near the creek was filled in with earth
and crushed rock, though no grading was done. Some planting was
done in that area. It is planned to utilize this space for parking of
cars and also to make part of it available for picnicking.

Work was begun on remodeling the west side of the antelope build-
ing, and at the close of the year it was about two-thirds completed.
A cage is being constructed to house the pair of reticulated giraffe.
This will give them a cage with a higher ceiling as well as a larger
outdoor enclosure.

The restaurant constructed by the P. W. A. under an allotment
of $90,000 was completed in the fall of 1940. It is of the Virginia
tavern type of stone construction. The main dining room is beauti-
fully decorated with murals of carved lacquered linoleum, executed
and mounted by Domenico Mortellito. This, with the outside ter-
races overlooking the new waterfowl ponds, has proved to be a
popular luncheon and dining place for the public. The new con-
cessionaire, L. G. Leech, opened the restaurant for business on
March 29, 1941.

The area about the new restaurant was landscaped with evergreens
and other trees and shrubs. An azalea garden of about 300 plants was
laid out on the hillside west of the restaurant. This will greatly
add to the beauty of the surroundings, especially when the plants
are in bloom. In addition, about 200 wild azaleas, more than 100
dogwoods, and about 40 redbuds, as well as other trees and shrubs,
were planted about the grounds.

It is with pleasure that we take this opportunity to thank C. A.
Logan, of the Beltsville Agriculture Center, for the more than 350
trees and shrubs that were obtained from their C. C. C. nursery.
These included shade trees, flowering plants and shrubs, fruit- and
nut-bearing types, and others suitable for ornamental purposes.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

Proper buildings continue to be the chief need of the Zoo. Struc-
tures most urgently needed which would complete its development
are a new building to house antelope, deer, wild hogs, and kanga-
roos; one for monkeys; and one for carnivores to replace the present
building, which is no longer suitable for the exhibition of these
animals,

Since the closing of the W. P. A. project, and with the increase
of exhibition areas, the existing personnel is inadequate to maintain
the grounds in a presentable condition. It is therefore important
that the maintenance personnel be increased by at least 10 men.
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

VISITORS FOR THE YEAR

A record of the attendance for the year shows an increase of a
little more than 300,000 visitors over the figures for last year. This
is due in part to the increase in population in the city.

About 3 o’clock every afternoon, a census is made of the cars
parked on the Zoo grounds. During the year 56,185 were so listed,
representing every State in the Union, as well as Alaska, Canada,
Canal Zone, Cuba, Hawaii, Mexico, and the Philippine Islands.

Since the total number is merely a record of those actually parked
at one time, it is not of value as showing a total attendance, but is of
importance as indicating the percentage of attendance by States,
Territories, and countries. The record for the year on this basis
shows the District of Columbia automobiles comprised 38 percent;
Maryland, slightly more than 24 percent; Virginia, 16 percent; Penn-
sylvania, 4 percent; and the remaining cars were from other States,
Territories, and countries.

This is the first year that the cars were counted on Sundays and
holidays. In previous years, the record showed that a little more
than 50 percent of the cars were from outside the District. This
year it is 62 percent, which substantiates our estimate of previous
years that adding Sundays and: holidays to the count would show
at least 60 percent from outside the District.

ACCESSIONS
FIELD WORK

SMITHSONIAN-FIRESTONE EXPEDITION

A partial account of this expedition was given in the 1940 annual
report of the Director of the National Zoological Park.

Through funds donated to the Smithsonian Institution by the
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., of Akron, Ohio, a party was sent to
Liberia, West Africa, for the purpose of collecting specimens for
the National Zoological Park. The party consisted of the Director,
Mrs. Mann, Ralph Norris, and Roy J. Jennier. They sailed on the
American-West African Line on February 17, 1940, for Monrovia.

A preliminary shipment of animals collected was made from Li-
beria to Boston in the care of Roy J. Jennier, who arrived at that
port on May 17, 1940. A list of these animals can be found in the
1940 annual report. The remaining members of the expedition ar-
rived in Norfolk, Va., on August 6, 1940, with 100 specimens, several
of which were species new to the history of the collection. We
again wish to express our sincerest appreciation to the members of
the Firestone staff, both in Liberia and here, for the aid and
hospitality given the expedition.

A list of the live animals which arrived in Norfolk on August 6

GIFTS

Pleasant contacts made by two previous expeditions have resulted
in the receipt as gifts of a number of desirable specimens.

From the Firestone Plantation in Liberia, through George Sey-
bold, manager, and Dr. Fuszek, Director General of Public Health
of Liberia, the Zoo received a pigmy hippo, a western chimpanzee,
a leopard, 2 rhinoceros vipers, a green mamba, a crowned hawk-
eagle, and a porcupine. These resulted from associations made dur-
ing the Smithsonian-Firestone expedition of 1940.

Through contacts made by Malcolm Davis, Zoo staff member of
the Antarctic expedition of 1940, an interesting lot of birds was
received, including 3 emperor penguins, 4 Gentoo penguins, 2 kelp
gulls, and a giant fulmar. These birds were collected through the
cooperation of Richard Black, Dr. Paul Siple, Jack Perkins, Roger
Hawthorne, and others of the expedition, and brought to the States
by Herwil Bryant, Jr., whose painstaking care on the trip saved

all the specimens. Other outstanding gifts include a pair of black
bear cubs from Newbold Noyes, Washington, D. C., an ocelot each
from Maj. C. V. Haynes, Langley Field, Va., and N. M. Rhodes,
U. S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md., and a trio of tahr goats
from the New York Zoological Park. E. A. McIlhenny, of Avery
Island, La., has continued his generosity by sending a number of
waterfowl, greatly adding to the exhibition value of the new water-
fowl ponds. A complete list of donors and their gifts follows.

EXCHANGES

There were not a great number of specimens received during the
year through the medium of exchange. Ennio Arrigutti, Buenos
Aires, Argentina, continued his shipments of desirable South Ameri-
can animals. The New York Zoological Park sent a purple-crested
plantain eater. A pair of green Japanese pheasants was received
from the Miami Rare Bird Farm, Miami, Fla. Several shipments
of reptiles have again been received from C. W. Kern, Tujunga, Calif.

PURCHASES

The more important specimens acquired by purchase were a harpy
eagle and a pair of South American bush dogs, three naked-throated
88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

bell birds, a pair of raccoon dogs, a pair of Chinese badgers and a
pair of Peruvian viscachas. Also purchased during the year were
a pair each of vicunas and llamas. This completed our exhibit of
all the American representatives of the camel family.

REMOVALS
DEATHS

A most serious loss during the year was the number of birds,
mostly parrots, which died as the result of an epidemic of psittacosis
in the bird house. A number of birds suspected of having the dis-
ease were put to death. The entire building was closed, on advice
of the Department of Health, District of Columbia, for about 3
months. The parrot room is still closed to the public. It is believed
that the situation is now well on the way to being cleared. Other
losses included several chevrotain, and an East African leopard, the
jast of the lot received in 1926 from the Smithsonian-Chrysler expedi-
tion. A brown hyena which had been in the collection since 1928
died during the year. As in the past, all specimens of scientific value
that died during the year were sent to the National Museum.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1941:

WORK AT WASHINGTON

Messrs. Aldrich and Hoover, with assistance of computers Mrs. A. M.
Bond, Miss L. Simpson, and Miss N. M. McCandlish, prepared in
manuscript the immense table of daily solar-constant observations
from 1923 to 1939. The table contains all individual observations
in detail for the three stations, Montezuma, Table Mountain, and
Mount St. Katherine. A single day sometimes involves in itself alone
a subtable of 10 lines, 10 columns wide. Every solar-constant deter-
mination was scrutinized in detail from the original records before
entry into the great table, and in very many instances recomputed to
check discordant results. Mean values giving the most probable result
of each day at each station were computed, and all were plotted on an
extended scale. This plot made up a roll about 15 inches wide and
200 feet long.

In this form every day’s values were scrutinized by C. G. Abbot, and
discordances noted. As one result of his work in preparation of a
paper entitled “An Important Weather Element Hitherto Generally
Disregarded,”? Dr. Abbot had been strongly impressed by the fact
that the solar variation is several times greater in percentage for blue-
violet rays than for total radiation. This led him to investigate
whether on discordant days the shorter wave length parts of the
energy spectrum of the sun, as computed for outside our atmosphere,
were also discordant. It proved that in many cases they were not,
showing that errors had been made in other than the spectral parts of
the determinations. Hence, the entire great table was gone through, ,
and for all discordant days the blue-violet extra-atmospheric spectrum \
was reduced to comparable units by bringing all days to equality in)
the infrared region, where solar variation is nearly nil. Nearly ai
hundred pages of newly computed manuscript tables were required
to set forth this information. |

With this new information available, Dr. Abbot in many casess
marked “improved preferred” daily ines on the great chart for oner

1 Smithsonian Misc. Coll., vol. 101, No. 1, 1941. |

t
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 109

or more of the stations, as dictated by the blue-violet spectrum. He
then took the general mean for each day, not only of the untreated
results, taking into account only the grades assigned by Messrs. Ald-
rich and Hoover for the separate stations, but also an “improved pre-
ferred” mean for perhaps one-fourth of all the days. These new
means were the results preferred after considering the blue-violet spec-
trum. Both of these daily means were entered in the great table, so
that when it is published, readers may use either the preferred general
mean or the “improved preferred” general mean, as they please.

As the great table was thus being finished in manuscript, it was being
typewritten by Miss M. A. Neill in preparation for the printer. By
the end of the fiscal year it was almost finished for publication. In
the meantime the rest of the manuscript for volume 6 of the Annals
had been finished as far as possible by Dr. Abbot and typed by Miss
Neill. But some changes and additions will be made after the inspec-
tion of the great table is completed. There appears every reason to
hope that the entire manuscript of volume 6, including the great table
and its subsidiaries, tables of 10-day and monthly means, will be in
the printer’s hands before New Year’s Day.

The study of the great table led Dr. Abbot to reconsider whether
the sun’s variation might not be more effectively followed by observa-
tions limited to the blue-violet region of spectrum. He was at length
able to devise a method which appears promising, and which has been
introduced just at the end of the fiscal year at all three field stations.
In brief, the method contemplates inserting in front of the spectro-
bolometer slit a glass filter which restricts the radiation to the desired
blue-violet region. An exactly similar glass filter is inserted before
the aperture of the pyrheliometer. Knowing from the usual solar-
constant work of the day the atmospheric transmission coefficients for
blue-violet rays, it is possible to compute the extra-atmospheric energy
spectrum of the restricted blue-violet spectrum given by the screened
spectrobolometer. A comparison of the blue-violet energy spectra at
the station and as computed for outside the atmosphere gives a factor
to multiply the screened pyrheliometer reading to what it would be
outside the atmosphere.

In this way we restrict the observations to the most variable part
of the observed solar spectrum, and avoid those spectral regions where
ozone, water vapor, and extreme short and long wave lengths introduce
great errors. We greatly hope that this new method will yield more
reliable daily indications of the solar variation.

The necessary instrumental changes for introducing the new method
were done by A. Kramer. He has also prepared special apparatus
for solar distillation of sea water after Dr. Abbot’s design, and many
other required small jobs for the Observatory.
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

Dr. H. Arctowski continued his meteorological investigations re-
lating to the effects of solar variation on atmospheric barometric
pressure and temperature. His studies led to researches on the
upper air. By courtesy of the Chief of the United States Weather
Bureau a long series of daily nocturnal radio-meteorograph records
were procured. Dr. Arctowski did very extensive computations and
graphical representations with these data. At the end of about 18
months of strenuous investigation he prepared a paper illustrated by
many plots and much tabular matter which will be found of source
value hereafter. This paper will soon issue under a Roebling grant.
Dr. Arctowski finds the important influence of solar variation on
weather plainly obvious, but the manner of its operation extremely
complex. He regards this first paper as merely introductory, and
sees a great field for future investigation.

FIELD STATIONS

As far as possible daily determinations of the solar constant of
radiation were made at three field stations, Montezuma, Chile,
Table Mountain, Calif., and Tyrone, N. Mex. A commodious rein-
forced concrete dwelling house was erected at Montezuma under
H. B. Freeman’s direction.

PERSONNEL

L. A. Fillmen, for many years instrument maker in the Division
of Radiation and Organisms under private support at the Smith-
sonian Institution, was transferred to the Astrophysical Observatory
Government roll.

SUMMARY

The immense task of preparing the solar-constant work of the
past 20 years for final publication was practically finished. A new
method of following solar variation was devised and installed at
all field stations. An extensive research on the effects of solar vari-
ation by Dr. H. Arctowski approached publication. Dr. Abbot pub- |
lished a paper entitled “An Important Weather Element Hitherto —
Generally Disregarded,” in which many proofs of solar variation —
were assembled, and the effects of it on weather were shown, to- —
gether with preliminary attempts at 3- to 5-year weather forecasts |
and verifications. These ambitious forecasts, while not as success- |
ful as was hoped, are promising.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 9

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND
ORGANISMS

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during the
year ended June 30, 1941:

The operations of the Division have been financially supported by
funds of the Smithsonian Institution and in part by a grant from
the Research Corporation of New York.

For several months during the past year actual work in the
laboratories was suspended during the construction of a new sewer
system and the preparation and actual work of electrical rewiring
throughout the building. Also three of the laboratories and the
machine shop were repainted.

Considerable time has been given by members of the division in
the planning and construction of an exhibit now on display as part
of the “Index Exhibit” in the Main Hall of the Smithsonian Building.
A detailed description of this exhibit appears in the July 1941
number of the Scientific Monthly.

INFLUENCE OF RADIATION ON RESPIRATION

Following the preliminary experiments and improvement in tech-
nique as reported last year on the project dealing with the genesis
of chlorophyll and the beginning of photosynthesis, many data have
been obtained on the respiration of etiolated barley seedlings. This
information is highly desirable because of its bearing upon photo-
synthesis as measured by the gaseous exchange method. Further-
more, a comprehensive review of the literature on respiration as
affected by radiation is being completed and will soon be made
available.

The rate of respiration (carbon dioxide evolution) of etiolated
barley seedlings (i. e., seedlings grown in complete darkness and
devoid of chlorophyll) increases following illumination, whether
measured in dark or in light. Under favorable conditions this rise
amounts to as much as 20 percent of the previous dark rate and is
maintained for at least 7 hours after the light exposure.

192
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

The maximal effect of illumination for a 30-minute period occurs
at a fairly low intensity (60 foot-candles or less). The magnitude
of the effect produced by 60 foot-candles of light increases with
the time of illumination up to an exposure period of about 20 min-
utes and remains constant with longer light periods. These results
are graphically illustrated in figure 1.

In many of these studies it was observed that the rate of respira-
tion was not as constant as one would desire during the periods
prior to irradiation. It was thought that perhaps the metabolic
reactions of the seedling were affected in transferring them from
the germination conditions to those of the respiration chamber. A

number of changes were made in the germination conditions and
in the preliminary treatment of the experimental plants in the
respiration chamber. After many experiments of this nature it
appears that the rate of respiration either increases or decreases
continuously for a period of time following exposures of the seed-
lings to low or high carbon dioxide concentrations respectively. For
example, figure 2 shows the relative rates of respiration for succes-
sive half-hour periods following a conditioning period of 5 percent
carbon dioxide.

From data of this type it would appear that conditions of car-
bon dioxide storage or depletion develop in the plant tissue depend-
ing upon the concentration of this gas surrounding the plants. In
subsequent periods, when the respiration is measured there is an
increase or decrease in the rate of CO, excretion (i. e., in the apparent
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 113

rate of respiration) until a state of equilibrium with the new environ-
ment is attained. If this phenomenon is of widespread occurrence
in green plants as well, it must be of considerable importance also
in experiments in which rates of photosynthesis are measured.
Considerable time has been spent during the late winter and spring
in improving the performance of the spectrograph used in measuring
carbon dioxide, for very short periods. A 15-cc. volume absorp-

tion cell providing a 15-cm. optical path was made in the shop and
installed on the instrument. The spectrograph case was lagged
with 4 inches of rock wool and the whole room thermostated to
maintain a temperature of 830° C. These features have improved the
speed-sensitivity and stability of the set-up very materially. The
assembly has been used recently in measuring the solubility of CO,
in water at very low concentrations where a marked departure from
Henry’s Law was discovered. Further experiments on this are
in progress and will be published soon along with a detailed descrip-
tion of the spectrographic method of CO, measurement.
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941
INFLUENCE OF LIGHT IN EARLY GROWTH OF GRASS SEEDLINGS

Further study of the spectral effectiveness of radiation for the
growth inhibition of the oats mesocotyl has indicated that the maxi-
mum response occurs at 6600 A. It is highly suggestive that both
chlorophyll a and a pigment as yet unidentified which has been found
in dark-grown oats seedlings exhibit an absorption band at this
position.

A comparative study has been undertaken of some other species
of grasses that have been reported in the literature as having meso-
cotyls insensitive to light. All of those so far investigated have
been found to be suppressed by light although the intensities required
are much greater than in the case of Avena.

Since the growth of the oats mesocotyl is decreased, even in dark-
ness, by higher temperatures it is of interest to compare the effects
of temperature and of radiation. The high temperature inhibition
appears to differ fundamentally from the light inhibition inasmuch as
the growth of other organs of the seedling, notably the roots, is also
greatly suppressed in the former case. Some preliminary experi-
ments have indicated that in certain varieties of rice, on the other
hand, mesocotyl growth is greater at higher temperatures.

INFLUENCE OF CULTURAL CONDITIONS ON THE GROWTH OF ALGAE

The influence of culture conditions on the photosynthetic behavior
of the alga Chlorelia pyrenoidosa has been subjected to further
investigation. The growth cycle of this organism has been studied in
relation to light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and the
composition of the nutrient solution. This work is far from com-
plete but has suggested certain changes in the composition of the
nutrient solution and in the design of the apparatus. Equipment
is being constructed for the continuous culture of algae in order
to obtain completely reproducible quantities of biological material
for irradiation experiments.

Experiments were also conducted to ascertain suitable light condi-
tions and culture media for optimum growth of the alga Haema-
tococcus pluvialis in preparation for research on the comparative
effects of short wave lengths of the ultraviolet on the green pigment,
chlorophyll, and the red pigment, haematochrome, in algae.

As a result of inquiries regarding the use of algae in industry
and because of its importance to producers of kelp, Irish moss, agar,
and alginic acid in the defense program, a paper is being prepared
containing the latest statistics and information about the economic
uses of algae.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1941:

THE LIBRARY

The library, or library system, of the Smithsonian is made up
of 10 major and 35 minor units. The former consist of the main
library of the Institution, which since 1866 has been in the Library
of Congress and is known as the Smithsonian Deposit; the libraries
of the United States National Museum, Bureau of American Eth-
nology, Astrophysical Observatory, Freer Gallery of Art, National
Collection of Fine Arts, National Zoological Park, Division of Radi-
ation and Organisms; the Langley Aeronautical Library—deposited
in 1980 in the Division of Aeronautics at the Library of Congress—
and the Smithsonian office library. The minor units are the sec-
tional libraries of the National Museum. Although the collections
in these 45 libraries are on many subjects, they have to do chiefly
with the matters of special moment to the Institution and its branches,
namely, the natural and physical sciences and technology and the fine
arts. They are particularly strong in their files of standard mono-
graphs and serials and of the reports, proceedings, and transactions
of the learned institutions and societies of the world.

Cooperating with the Smithsonian library system, but independent
of it, is the library of the National Gallery of Art, which, during
the year just closed took its first steps, under a competent staff, to
meet the reference needs of the Gallery personnel and of others
outside. The libraries of the Institution welcome the opportunity to
further, in every way possible, the interests of this new friendly
neighbor.

PERSON NEL

The year brought an unusually large number of changes in the
staff. Among these were the following: The retirement, on account
of age, of Miss Gertrude L. Woodin, after long and valuable service
as assistant librarian; the promotion of Miss Elisabeth P. Hobbs,

116
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY LiF

junior librarian, to succeed her, and the transfer of Miss Anna
Moore Link from the editorial office in the Bureau of American
Ethnology to the vacancy thus created; the advancement of Miss
Nancy Alice Link to the position of editorial assistant in the Bureau;
the resignation of Mrs. Dorothy E. Goodrich, under library assistant,
and the selection of Miss Elizabeth Gordon Moseley as her successor.
The position of minor library assistant was reclassified to that of
junior clerk-typist and filled by the appointment of Miss Elizabeth
Harriet Link. Charles McDowell served part of the year as assist-
ant messenger. The temporary employees were Mrs. Georgeanna
H. Morrill, library assistant, Mrs. Elizabeth C. Bendure, assistant
clerk-stenographer, Miss Anna May Light, junior clerk-stenographer,
Mrs. Marie Boborykine, special library assistant, and Arthur W.
Gambrell, assistant messenger.

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

The exchange work of the library was again carried on with the
greatest difficulty, owing to abnormal world conditions. The pack-
ages received through the International Exchange Service were only
515—fewer by 814 even than those of the year before, when there had
been a similar decrease from the normal number; the packages that
came by mail were 17,038, or 3,283 fewer than came the previous
year. Most of the publications that failed to come were, of course,
European and Asiatic. Fortunately, some of these are being held
by the issuing agencies, to be sent to the library as soon as the wars
are over; others have merely delayed publication; but a few have
been discontinued. Altogether the influence of the disturbed condi-
tions that prevailed was far from favorable to the increase and
diffusion of knowledge by means of the exchange of learned
publications.

There were received, however, a number of rather large sendings,
notably from the Clube Zoologico do Brasil, Sao Paulo; Bataviaasch
Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschaffen, Batavia; Royal Swedish
Academy of Letters, Stockholm; Royal Society of Edinburgh, Edin-
burgh; Royal Society of Tasmania, Hobart; and Wellington Accli-
matisation Society, Wellington.

Dissertations came from only 4 universities, 2 of which are in
a neutral European country—Basel and Ziirich; and 2 in the United
States—Johns Hopkins and Pennsylvania. These totaled 452—quite
a contrast to the 5,190 received in 1939 from 34 foreign institutions
and 3 American. Of the 452 dissertations 261 were assigned to the
Smithsonian Deposit, and the rest, being on medical subjects, were
turned over, as usual, to the library of the Surgeon General.
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

Most of the 2,316 letters written by the staff pertained to the
exchange interests of the library. They naturally showed a de-
crease from 1940, as did the new exchanges arranged for. There
were 284 of the latter, however, nearly all of which were on behalf
of the Smithsonian Deposit and the libraries of the National Museum,
National Collection of Fine Arts, and Astrophysical Observatory.
Although the number of want cards handled—795—was smaller by
87 than the year before, the publications obtained, both by special
correspondence and by search among the recently organized and listed
duplicates in the west stacks of the Institution, were 8,824, or 1,278
more than in 1940. The result of this successful effort was that a
great many gaps—some of long standing—were filled in several of
the Smithsonian libraries. In addition to these publications, which
were assigned to the regular sets, others to the number of 6,112 were
selected from the duplicate material and put in reserve for use in
the future. Among these were many foreign items—not a few of
them rare—closely related to the work of the Institution and its
branches. Thus again did the surplus collection in the west stacks
prove of no little value to the library system. And it bids fair to
prove so for years to come, as this rich store of material is made
increasingly available through listing and through checking against
the needs of the various libraries.

From time to time, too, during the year files of serials, long and
short, not wanted by the libraries were exchanged for publications
that otherwise would have had to be purchased. This plan of ex-
changing duplicates for other publications essential to the Institu-
tion was adopted by the library some years ago and has met with
much success. It has added to the collections many valuable items
and has placed a considerable number in other research institutions
where, instead of standing useless on the Smithsonian shelves, they
have contributed their part toward the advancement of knowledge.
The year just closed brought to the library, under this special ex-
change plan, a goodly number of important monographs and serials
that could not be obtained by regular exchange. Among them were
such works as Drawings in the Fogg Museum of Art, vols. I-III, by
Agnes Mongan and Paul J. Sachs; The Material Basis of Evolution,
by Richard Goldschmidt; The Ferns and Fern Allies of Wisconsin,
by R. M. Tryon, Jr., N. C. Fassett, D. W. Dunlop, and M. E. Diemer;
and Nomenclator Zoologicus, in 4 volumes, edited by Sheffield A.
Neave.

In connection with both its regular and its special exchange
activities, the library continued its effort, in cooperation with
the offices of publications, to replenish the depleted stock of Smith-
sonian publications by encouraging the return of material from
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119

libraries throughout the country in which it was not needed. It
also continued to act as a clearing-house, thus sending out again
much of this material to institutions that were waiting for it. The
libraries of more than 25 museums, colleges, and universities eagerly
shared in this give and take effort, which was to the advantage of
all participants, but chiefly of the Smithsonian library, for by this
means it was able not only to make many of the publications of the
Institution more widely available to readers and investigators, but
to increase in no small measure the supply of such publications—some
of which had long been out of print—that could be used for future
exchanges.
GIFTS

Many gifts came to the library during the year. Among these
were 622 publications from the Geophysical Laboratory of the Car-
negie Institution of Washington; 612 from the American Association
for the Advancement of Science; 72 from the American Association of
Museums; 66 from the Public Library of the District of Columbia;
42 from the National Institute of Health; and 94 from the recently
discontinued Bureau of the International Catalogue of Scientific
Literature. Among them, too, were a large number of publications
from the Honorable Usher L. Burdick, Member of Congress from
North Dakota, from the late Mrs. Charles D. Walcott—always a
generous friend of the library—and from the Secretary and Assistant
Secretary and other members of the Smithsonian staff. The largest
gift, however, came from Mrs. Frederick E. Fowle—that of 942 sci-
entific books and journals which had belonged to her husband, the
late research assistant of the Astrophysical Observatory.

Other gifts were Hiroshige, by Yoné Noguchi, from the Japanese
Embassy; The Herbarist, Nos. 1-7 (1935-1941), from Mrs. Foster

1 From this total have been omitted a large collection of pamphlets hitherto included in the holdings
reported for the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and quite a number of other publications
recently removed from the library as not being closely related to the work of the Bureau.

The staff cataloged 6,693 volumes, pamphlets, and charts; prepared
and filed 40,238 catalog and shelf-list cards; made 22,311 periodical
entries; loaned 10,990 publications to the members of the Institu-
tion and its bureaus; and conducted an interlibrary loan service
with 45 libraries outside the Smithsonian system. They rendered
more reference and bibliographical assistance than ever before, in
response to requests in person, by telephone, and by mail, from the
staff of the Smithsonian, other Government employees, visitors,

and correspondents far and near—requests often involving hours
of search not only at the Institution but at the Library of Congress
and elsewhere. They kept the index of Smithsonian publications up
to date, and made considerable progress with the index of Smith-
sonian explorations begun the previous year, and some with that of
exchange relations. Their work on the union catalog may be sum-
marized as follows:

OTHER ACTIVITIES

As has already been suggested, one of the main activities of the
staff, apart from their routine duties, was that of making lists of
the longer runs of surplus items in the west stacks and checking
them against the needs of the Smithsonian libraries. Another task
was that of bringing nearly to completion the checking of the serial
holdings of several of the libraries, to be included in the forthcoming
second edition of the Union List of Serials. When this work is
finished, it will have involved the examination of the records of more
than 7,000 sets of serial publications, not including, of course, the
thousands in the Smithsonian Deposit and the Langley Aeronautical
Library, which, as they are housed in the Library of Congress, are
reported by that Library. Still another task was selecting consign-
ments of duplicates for exchange, especially with such universities
as Brown, Columbia, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Yale.
And another was preparing the exhibition set of Smithsonian pub-
lications—by completing it and having many of its volumes bound—
for transfer to the shelves provided for it as an outstanding part
of the exhibit of Smithsonian interests in the “Diffusion of Knowl-
edge” room at the Institution. And, finally, among other tasks were
the following: Sending a large number of foreign documents, which
had come to light in course of checking the surplus material, to the
Library of Congress; sorting 2,500 or more reprints by subject and
assigning them to the appropriate sectional libraries of the National
Museum; carrying forward the inventorying of the technological
library, with revision of its catalog and shelf list, and the rearranging
of the office library; and continuing, with excellent results, the work
of reorganizing the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology.

BINDING

Again, lack of funds seriously limited the libraries in meeting their
binding needs. This was true in respect both to the thousands of
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

older serial volumes still standing unbound on the shelves and to
hundreds of new ones added the last fiscal year. As it was, the
library of the National Museum sent to the bindery 800 volumes; that
of the Astrophysical Observatory, 50; of the National Collection of
Fine Arts, 59; of the Freer Gallery of Art, 38; and of the National
Zoological Park, 11—a total of 958, only about one-half the number
of volumes completed during the year by these libraries.

NEEDS

First among the needs, then, is adequate funds for binding, to the end
that the publications—some of them almost priceless now, in the light
of the destruction that is taking place abroad—may be safeguarded
for the permanent use of the Institution.

Another need, which has become acute, is that of more shelf room
for the collections, especially those of the National Museum library.
Unless this can soon be provided, it may be necessary to resort to the
unfortunate measure of placing some of the less-used files in dead
storage.

And, finally, five new positions should be established, for the follow-
ing: An assistant librarian, to take charge of the acquisition depart-
ment; a junior librarian and a library assistant to strengthen the
under-staffed preparation department, especially the catalog division;
a junior typist, to relieve the catalogers of much clerical routine; a
messenger, to serve primarily the libraries of the Institution proper.

Government bureaus in the administrative charge of the Institution.

SMITHSONIAN ENDOWMENT FUND

The original bequest of James Smithson was £104,960 8s. 6d.—
$508,318.46. Refunds of money expended in prosecution of the
claim, freights, insurance, etc., together with payment into the

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave
to the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects
of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by
Whistler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave
funds for the construction of a building to house the collection, and
finally in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock
and securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endow-
ment fund for the operation of the gallery. From the above date
to the present time these funds have been increased by stock divi-
dends, savings of income, etc., to a total of $6,030,586.91. In view
of the importance and special nature of the gift and the requirements
of the testator in respect to it, all Freer funds are kept separate
from the other funds of the Institution, and the accounting in
respect to them is stated separately.

The invested funds of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Generat AppeNnprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1941.

WHAT LIES BETWEEN THE STARS?

By WALTER S. ADAMS

Carnegie Institution of Washington, Mount Wilson Observatory, Pasadena, Calif.

[With 4 plates]

We are accustomed to think of the material upon which the astron-
omer works as consisting mainly of the sun and its planetary system,
occasional comets, and the vast array of stars and nebulae which dot
our skies at night. In other words the astronomer is largely con-
cerned with matter in a sufficiently condensed form either to radiate
light like the hot sun and stars or to reflect light like the cool planets
and satellites. In recent years, however, new information has obliged
us to consider more seriously what lies between the stars, and it is
this subject which I should like to discuss briefly with you this
evening.

In the first place it is interesting to realize how much space there
really is in our stellar universe and how little of it is actually occu-
pied by the stars. If this room represented an average portion of
space and we let a floating speck of dust represent a star, we could
not allow another speck within the room to represent another star
because no matter where we put it the two would be too near each
other. The star nearest to the sun is about 25 million million miles
away. Another way of realizing how much of space is compar-
atively empty is through its average density. If we put together
everything we can observe directly, such as the stars and nebulae,
in the general neighborhood of our sun, and divide the total by the
volume of the space in which it lies, we find for each cubic inch 1
grain of matter divided by 1 followed by 22 ciphers. At the center
of our galaxy the density is probably 10 times greater. These values
may perhaps be in error by a factor of 10 but we need not feel the
deep concern of the individual who thought the lecturer gave 1
billion instead of 10 billion years for the possible life of our sun
and was enormously relieved when he discovered his error.

If, at the turn of the century, a layman or even an astronomer
had been asked what lies in the vast spaces between the stars he
would probably have answered, “Little or nothing.” There might
be an occasional wandering mass of cold rock like an asteroid or a
meteorite or specks of dust such as produce our “shooting stars”
when they strike the earth’s atmosphere; but in general, space was
considered as essentially empty, with practically all the material in
our galaxy condensed into the stars.

About 1900 several observations raised serious questions regarding
the supposed emptiness of space. The most important of these were
Barnard’s photographs of the Milky Way which showed great lanes
and holelike structures in the huge clouds of stars which compose
this shining ring of light. To interpret these as real vacancies where
no stars exist was the natural impulse, but gradually observations
accumulated which made it impossible to retain this view. The
“holes” were too sharply bounded and in many cases were associated
with visible cloudlike luminosity which veiled the region. Moreover
the presence of numerous long “tunnels” among the stars pointing
toward the earth seemed altogether improbable. The final evidence
was afforded by the photographs made at the Lick Observatory of
the outer universes of stars, the extragalactic nebulae, many of which
showed definite streaks of absorbing material crossing the main body
of the nebula. The apparent vacancies were due to the presence of
dark clouds of cosmic dust which absorb and scatter the light from
the stars behind, either obliterating them completely or leaving
them comparatively faint and inconspicuous.

These cosmic clouds are composed of very finely divided particles
of dust and are often of enormous extent, especially in the region
of the Milky Way. When their thickness is great they blot out the
stars behind them, and when thin they redden the starlight passing
through them just as dust or smoke in the earth’s atmosphere red-
dens sunlight, especially near sunrise or sunset when the path through
the dust is long. The importance of these cosmic clouds in astron-
omy is very great: they affect the brightness and color of every star
whose light passes through them, and calculations of the distances
of remote stars, the size of our universe, and the quantity of matter
within it are all profoundly influenced by the absorption and scatter-
ing of light in interstellar space.

I shall not dwell longer on this most interesting question of dust
clouds in space since many of you heard Dr. Seares give a lecture on
this subject a few months ago on the occasion of the award to him
of the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. To
those of you who may not have heard him I can recommend a
reading of his admirable presentation of the whole subject in the
WHAT LIES BETWEEN THE STARS—ADAMS 143

Publications of the Society.2, Modern observations with blue and
red color filters show the remarkable degree to which the presence
of such obscuring clouds modifies the appearance of great areas of
the sky, especially in the region of the southern Milky Way, and
illustrate the use made by astronomers of the power of red light to
penetrate cosmic dust.

We now know at least three forms of solid matter in interstellar
space. There are probably dark stars, that is, stars with temperatures
so low that they give out little or no visible light. If we knew
where to look we might be able to detect some of them with sensitive
heat-measuring devices—which will measure the heat given out by a
candle at a distance of many miles—but as it is we can only infer
their existence. We know that in the descending scale of stellar
temperature we find cooler and cooler stars until finally we observe
objects which give out only a faint red light. It seems reasonable
to assume that there may be many others with still lower temperatures
which have become invisible and are gradually approaching the con-
dition of cold bodies like our planets or asteroids. They are probably
small stars which have gone through the successive temperature stages
of stellar development at a rather rapid rate.

In addition to these occasional dark stars there are in the spaces
between the visible stars great numbers of smaller masses of matter,
“chunks” as Dr. Hubble has called them, such as now and then fall
upon the earth in the form of meteorites. They are cold bodies with
the chill of the depths of space upon them, commonly ranging in
mass from a few pounds to a few tons.

Finally and most important, we have the dust of space, often
gathered into huge cosmic clouds which weaken or even blot out the
stars behind them and give us much of the variegated pattern of the
Milky Way.

There is, however, another form in which we find matter existing
in space, matter not in the solid state but in the form of gas, consist-
ing of molecules, atoms, and even portions of atoms, the tiny elec-
trons of the physicist. Much of our knowledge of this subject is
of very recent date, and because it is new and because it is certain
to affect our views of the conditions in interstellar space I should
like to discuss it in a simple way this evening.

This brings us at once to a consideration of a few elementary facts
about the spectrum, for it is from the spectrum that we gain essen-
tially all our knowledge of matter in the gaseous state. As you all
know, white light is a mixture of several primary colors and the
eye combines them into an impression which we call white. The

? Publ. Astron. Soc. Pacific, vol. 52, p. 80, 1940.
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

spectrum is simply a map of the colors spread out into a band begin-
ning with violet at one end and passing through blue, green, and
yellow into red at the other. It can be produced in several dif-
ferent ways, the simplest of which is by a triangular piece of glass
called a prism. When white light passes through a prism the violet
part of the light is bent a certain amount when it comes out, the
green a little less, and the red still less. The final result is a con-
tinuous band of color extending from violet to red. You have all
seen flashes of such a spectrum when sunlight falls upon a cut-glass
bow] or the edge of a beveled mirror.

Now the important fact is that any chemical element, when heated
to the point where it vaporizes and gives out light, gives it in a
pattern of colored bright lines which is unique for each element
and defines it absolutely. Some patterns are comparatively simple,
while others are exceedingly complex. For example, sodium has
relatively few lines in its spectrum and nearly all the light which
sodium vapor emits is concentrated in two strong lines of orange
color. These are so dominant that they define the color of a sodium
lamp completely, as you all know who have ridden through the
yellow glare of the street lights now in such common use. Similarly
neon gas has its strongest lines in the red portion of the spectrum
and hence neon signs are red to the eye, while mercury light with
an exceedingly strong green line in its spectrum is predominantly
green in color. On the other hand the vapor of iron produced in an
electric arc has an extraordinarily rich spectrum consisting of some
2,000 lines distributed throughout all the colors of the spectrum. In
the absence of predominant lines of one color, luminous iron gas
appears nearly white to the eye.

One other fact should be remembered before we pass to our
immediate astronomical applications of the spectrum. A hot, solid
body or one consisting of dense gases gives out a spectrum which is a
continuous band of color, not one of bright lines. When the light from
such a body, a star for example, passes through a gas of somewhat
lower temperature the gas will absorb light of just the color of its
characteristic lines, and we shall have a pattern of absorption or
dark lines. For example, when the light from the filament of an
ordinary incandescent lamp is passed through a slightly cooler tube
of sodium vapor we see the two strong yellow lines of sodium as dark
lines on the yellow background of light given by the filament.

In astronomy we have almost a precise analogy to the filament and
tube of sodium vapor. The body of the sun or of a star corresponds
to the filament and gives out a continuous band of color, while the
gaseous atmosphere corresponds to the sodium tube and produces the
absorption lines. The principal difference is that the atmosphere of

—

WHAT LIES BETWEEN THE STARS—ADAMS 145

a star like our sun contains not only sodium but a great variety of
other elements and so we get not only sodium lines but an immense
number of other lines as well—such as those of hydrogen, calcium,
iron, and some 60 other elements.

It is hardly necessary to say that the spectra of the elements, these
characteristic patterns of bright lines which define them uniquely
and individually, have been studied with extraordinary care by physi-
cists and astronomers alike for many years. Maps have been made,
the intensities of the lines measured, and their positions determined
with an almost uncanny degree of precision. Asa result astronomers
know almost every element which enters into the composition of the
sun and even the most distant stars, merely through comparison of
the positions and intensities of the dark lines produced in their at-
mospheres with the well-recognized bright lines of terrestrial
elements.

One other point should be considered. When we observe a star, its
light comes to us through the earth’s atmosphere which is itself com-
posed of various gases. These gases are cold and because they are
cold remain in the form of molecules. Intense heat will break up
molecules into atoms, and in the atmospheres of the hotter stars we
find only the lines due to atoms. Molecules, however, can also emit
and absorb light and give spectrum lines arranged in characteristic
patterns, the principal difference from those produced by atoms being
that molecules usually give an enormous number of closely packed
lines arranged in the form of bands. Asa result when we observe the
spectrum of a star we find superposed upon it the bands of gases
such as oxygen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
of the earth. These bands lie mainly in the red and infared portion
of the spectrum.

About 40 years ago two very narrow sharp lines were observed in
the violet part of the spectrum of a star in the constellation of Orion.
They were at once identified with well-known lines of calcium, but
their positions did not vary periodically as did those of the lines from
the star, and it was clear that they were not of stellar origin. They
were called provisionally “stationary” lines, and Sir Arthur Edding-
ton suggested the bold hypothesis that they originated in the absorp-
tion of the atoms of calcium gas in interstellar space. Some 20 years
later two more such lines were discovered at the Lick Observatory in
the yellow portion of the spectrum. These are due to sodium and
are the characteristic lines to which we have already referred. In
1936, observations with a spectroscope on the 100-inch telescope at
Mount Wilson led to the discovery of several additional lines, a few
of which were identified as due to titanium and potassium. By this
time the interstellar origin of all such lines had been fully established,
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

and through the work of Struve, of the Yerkes Observatory, the in-
tensities of the calcium lines were being used as a measure of the
distances of the stars in which they were observed. The greater the
distance of the star, the greater the amount of interstellar gas through
which its light passes, and the stronger the lines. Several broad hazy
lines, apparently originating from interstellar gases but differing
greatly in appearance from the normal sharp lines, had also been
discovered by Merrill at Mount Wilson.

Until recent months, accordingly, the situation was that the gases
of calcium, sodium, titanium, and potassium had been identified in
interstellar space but that the origin of several fairly conspicuous
lines still remained unknown. The identified lines all arise from the
atoms of the elements, and naturally astronomers searched for identi-
fications of the remaining lines in the atomic spectra of other ele-
ments. ‘This led to no success, however. The possibility was then
considered whether the unidentified lines could arise from molecules
instead of atoms. As I have already said, under ordinary conditions,
molecules of compounds produce bands consisting of hundreds or
even thousands of closely packed lines as contrasted with the simpler
spectrum of relatively few lines arising from the atom. Under the
conditions of interstellar space, however, with extraordinarily low
densities and temperatures, the molecular spectrum might well be
simplified and even reduced to a few observable lines. The suggestion
that the broad diffuse lines observed by Merrill might have a molecu-
lar origin was put forward by several investigators, and in the
specific case of one of the sharp lines discovered at Mount Wilson a
tentative identification with a line of the common hydrocarbon gas
CH was offered by Swings and Rosenfeld. An identification resting
upon a single line, however, necessarily remained somewhat doubtful.

The next step was taken by McKellar at the Dominion Astro-
physical Observatory. Applying to molecular spectra the principles
derived from a study of some of the identified atomic lines, he was
able to predict the positions of several additional lines for each
molecular spectrum. Thus if the single relatively prominent line
tentatively assigned to CH were correctly identified, there should be
at least three other fainter lines present in another region of the
spectrum. Similarly McKellar could predict the positions of certain
lines of the familiar cyanogen gas CN.

Hence the final solution of the question came back to the observer.
Since the predicted lines were faint and narrow, it was clear that
photographic plates of high contrast and fine grain must be used and
that exposure times would be long. Fortunately a bright star was
available, Zeta Ophiuchi, lying near the southern Milky Way. The
100-inch telescope and a spectroscope 114 inches long were used with

WHAT LIES BETWEEN THE STARS—ADAMS 147

exposure times of about 4 hours. The results were conslusive. The
predicted lines of hydrocarbon gas CH all appeared in their correct
positions with their calculated intensities. In the case of cyanogen
gas CN, the evidence is based upon fewer lines but is equally strong.
Hence the existence of the gases CH and CN in interstellar space
may be regarded as practically certain.

After this brief description of how these discoveries were made, a
few comments upon the meaning of the results may be of interest.
In the first place, we have learned that several of the common ele-
ments exist in space in the form of atoms; sodium, calcium, potas-
sium, and titanium have been identified, and it is very probable that
many if not all of the others could be recognized if only conditions
were favorable for the appearance of their spectra. Then we have
very recently found that two common gases, or at least two slightly
modified common gases, are present, cyanogen and hydrocarbon gas.
This is the first discovery of molecules in interstellar space. That
hydrogen, the most abundant element of all in the universe, has not
been discovered directly is due to the fact that the lines which it
could show under the conditions present in space are in an inaccessi-
ble part of the spectrum, and, like the lines of many other important
elements, are cut off by the ozone in the earth’s atmosphere, which in
the words of Russell “lies like a black pall upon the dreams of the
astrophysicist.” However, we do find hydrogen combined with
carbon in hydrocarbon gas and thus have ample evidence for its
presence.

Although the lines of hydrocarbon gas are well marked and at
least one of them is fairly conspicuous, it is the enormous length of
the path of light from the stars rather than the density of the gas
which provides enough absorbing molecules. The actual density is
extraordinarily low. In a cubic mile of space there are probably
only a very few thousand molecules; and when we remember that the
diameter of a molecule is less than one ten-millionth of an inch it is
easy to see that very little of the space is occupied. But if the path
is long enough, a good many molecules will be encountered by the
light from a distant star, and observable absorption lines will result.
The same reasoning holds true for lines originating from atoms such
as sodium and calcium. Dunham estimates that there is one sodium
atom in about 25 cubic yards of space, and yet in the spectra of very
distant stars the interstellar sodium lines are conspicuous.

A calculation by Russell of the average density of interstellar gas
in general gives a value of about 2 preceded by 24 ciphers of the
density of water. So great are the distances, however, that in the
volume of space whose radius is equal to that of the nearest fixed
star, the mass of the interstellar gas amounts to about one-fourth
4305774211
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

the mass of the sun. So if we consider the huge dimensions of our
galaxy, the amount of matter contributed by interstellar gases is by
no means negligible.

An interesting and somewhat amusing subject is that of the tem-
perature of these gases in space. We are accustomed to dwell upon
the intense cold of outer space far removed from the heat of any
nearby star and we are quite right in doing so. A thermometer placed
in interstellar space would show a temperature of about 3° above
absolute zero on the Centigrade scale or about 455° below zero on the
usual Fahrenheit scale. But this is by no means the temperature of
the atoms or molecules of a highly diffuse gas. In such a gas the |
effect of the radiation of a star which falls upon an atom is to drive
out electrons, or, to use a technical word, to ionize it. It is the same —
process which happens when light falls upon a photoelectric cell:
electrons are driven out and the energy of these electrons when ampli-
fied rings a burglar alarm or opens a garage door. The electrons in
space have a temperature depending upon the mean energy with |
which they are driven out of the atom, and when they collide with the |
atom they raise its temperature. Thus the atoms and molecules of
gas are lifted to a high temperature estimated at some 10,000° to
20,000° on the Fahrenheit scale. The interesting feature about the
process, as Eddington has shown, is that it depends upon the quality
and not the quantity of the radiation, so that the temperature of a
gas far in space will be just as high as if it were near a star. The
rate of production of electrons will be slower but the temperature will |
not be affected. So we may say that we have two kinds of tempera- _
ture in space, one of space itself as registered by a thermometer, and
a very different one for the gases, which through their remarkable |
structure are able to build up and maintain a temperature of thou-
sands of degrees in spite of the bitter cold of the medium which |
surrounds ee /

There is one other interesting characteristic of the molecules and _
atoms in our interstellar gases. Under ordinary conditions such as
in a physical laboratory they are in a wild state of excitement, flying i
about rapidly, colliding with one another and knocking off and
picking up electrons in a fraction of a millionth of a second. In the '
extremely rarefied conditions of gas in space, however, the situation |
is quite different. Collisions are extremely rare and the atoms and|
molecules can remain for weeks and perhaps even months in the least”
excited state which the state of their being will allow them to have..
To use a homely comparison, if we touch a sleeping cat the cat!
responds with a a twitch of an ear or a leg which represents the least |
possible disturbance to its equilibrium. So the lazy molecules of!
space when disturbed by a ray of light or heat from a star seek to

WHAT LIES BETWEEN THE STARS—ADAMS 149

move as little as possible from their condition of rest and the spec-
trum lines which we observe are those due to transitions of this sort.
This is the reason why the complicated spectrum of a gas like cyano-
gen, consisting of hundreds of closely packed lines, is reduced to a
meager three or four lines when observed in interstellar space.
These are the only lines which the molecule in its lowest state of
energy can absorb.

In this brief outline we have discussed the gaseous material of
space, how it is studied, and what we know about its composition,
temperature, and density. We have seen that three of the most im-
portant elements which enter into the composition of the universe,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon, are present in the form of compounds,
and that others as yet unidentified are represented by spectral lines in
the interstellar gases. If in most of our considerations we have had
our ciphers on the left-hand side of the significant figures instead of
the right, it is because we have been dealing with atoms and molecules
instead of stars and universes. Even so, such is the volume of space
that the mass of the dust and gas which lies between the stars may
well exceed by several fold all the matter actually visible with our
greatest telescopes.

ARTIFICIAL CONVERTERS OF SOLAR ENERGY ?

By H. C. Horre.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

A study of the literature on solar energy utilization has convinced
me of the existence of an unalterable tradition among speakers and
writers on the subject. One must always begin such a discussion by
expressing the earth’s reception of solar energy in units no one has
thought before to use, the more startling the better. In keeping
with this tradition, I shall mention a few old figures and add my
own. The earth and its atmosphere intercept the equivalent in
energy of 21 billion tons of coal per hour; 6 million tons per second;
the equivalent in 3 minutes of the annual American energy consump-
tion of about 1 billion tons; energy at a rate sufficient each year to
melt a layer of ice 114 feet thick; on an acre at noon the equivalent
of the discharge of a healthy stream from a garden hose spouting
fuel oil instead of water.

Having made the conventional beginning, let me add what many
of you know: that figures such as these are almost irrelevant to the
problem of practical utilization of solar energy. They have attracted
uncounted crank inventors who have approached the problem with
little more mental equipment than a rosy optimism. Now, an in-
formed pessimism is sometimes the healthiest mood in which to
approach an engineering problem; and I want to use a little space in
an endeavor to put you in that mood. Consider a solar power plant
utilizing 1 acre of land, and operating on the principle of conversion
of solar energy to heat in steam used to run an engine. There is
incident at noon, normal to the sun’s rays and outside the earth’s
atmosphere, 7,400 horsepower of solar energy. On a clear day, of
this quantity about 5,000 horsepower arrives at the earth. Allowing
for the efficiency of collection of the sunlight as heat in the working
fluid to be used in the engine, the quantity drops to about 3,300 horse-
power. Utilizing the highest achieved efficiency of conversion of
solar heat to useful power (results of Dr. Abbot’s experiments), the

printed by permission from Sigma Xi Quarterly, vol. 29, No. 1, April 1941.

151
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

horsepower output drops to 490. ‘These calculations have so far all
been on the assumption of normal incidence of the sun on the collector
systems. To achieve this the collector must be mounted to turn with
the sun and must be far enough from its neighbor not to shade the
latter in morning or afternoon. Introducing a ground-coverage fac-
tor of one-third to allow for this, the output is cut to 163 horsepower.
But this figure applies only to the hours when the sun shines with
full intensity. Converting to a 24-hour basis of operation on clear
days in summer in Arizona, the output drops to 83; or in winter to
46 horsepower; or for the year to 68 horsepower. Passing on to the
average year of New York weather, the output is down to 30 horse-
power. Even if one stops at a reasonably attainable value of 50
horsepower in Arizona, that figure is one one-hundred-and-fiftieth
of the original 7,400 horsepower.

For rough orientation as to the meaning of these figures, suppose
the possibility of a 50-horsepower steady output from an acre in
Arizona be accepted. ‘To evaluate this power, let it be assumed that
electric power can be produced in a large modern steam plant at a
cost of 0.6 cents per kw.-hr., or $53 a kilowatt year, making the out-
put of our 1 acre worth $1,900 per year. In the absence of knowledge
of labor costs, maintenance, etc., one can only guess the capital value
of such an output. Capitalization at 15 percent is almost certainly
overoptimistic, and even that yields but $18,000 to spend on the en-
tire plant, or about $2.60 per square yard. Since the ground coverage
is but one-third, $8 are available to build each square yard of re-
flectors, mounts, and accessories. The result is one so often encoun-
tered in engineering projects: indecisive. It may be possible to build
a plant for such an amount; much more exact knowledge of perform-
ance and costs is necessary than was at hand in making the above
rough estimate. What I have particularly wanted to emphasize by
this preliminary consideration is perfectly obvious to the engineer,
namely, that solar power is not there just for the taking!

However, this preview has at least indicated that solar power is
not completely outside the realm of economic feasibility. It is worth-
while, then, to examine in more detail the problem of use of solar
energy by conversion to heat, a problem which has commanded the
attention of engineers for three-quarters of a century.

First, a moment on some elementary principles of heat transmis-
sion. If a black metal plate is exposed to the sun, and cooling water
is run under the plate fast enough to keep the plate from rising
appreciably above the surrounding air temperature, substantially all
the energy of the sun’s rays intercepted by the plate shows up as
energy in the water; the efficiency of collection of heat is nearly 100
percent, but the value of the heat is low because of its low tempera-
CONVERTERS OF SOLAR ENERGY—HOTTEL 153

ture level. If the water enters 50° F. above the surrounding air
temperature and flows through fast enough hardly to rise in tem-
perature, there is the same interception and absorption of solar
energy by the plate; but now much of it is used in keeping the plate
up to temperature; it is lost to the surroundings by radiation and
convection, and very little of the absorbed energy appears in the
water stream. To improve the efficiency the losses must be cut down.
There are several ways. The back side of the plate may be insulated,
since it never sees the sun. Or a plate of glass may be placed over
the metal plate and parallel to it, with an inch or so of air space
between. Then the plate receives and absorbs almost as much sun-
light as before—the glass transmits about 90 percent—but the losses
from the metal to the outer atmosphere are reduced: the convection
loss because of the imposed stagnation of the air, and the radiation
loss because glass, though transparent to the sun’s rays, is opaque
to the long-wave infrared radiation emitted by the hot metal plate.
Variations of this idea include the use of several glass plates and of
glass vacuum chambers. Another method of cutting down losses is
to reduce the area at which losses occur relative to the area of the
interceptor of the energy to be collected. This may be done by
choosing the most favorable orientation of the plate, that is, normal
to the sun’s rays, or by use of a concentrating device, such as a mirror,
which intercepts rays covering a large area and brings them to a
focus on an object of much smaller area where the heat loss is
consequently correspondingly small despite the high temperature.

From this discussion there emerges a threefold basis of classifica-
tion of solar energy collectors: (1) By nature of orientation of the
collector (whether and how completely it follows the sun), (2) by
amount of concentration achieved by mirrors, (3) by amount and type
of insulation of the receiver surface. It is perfectly obvious that
many of the early inventors and engineers in this field were familiar
with these principles in a general way.

One might now ask, “With all this work, have not the possibilities
of energy production by conversion to heat been so thoroughly studied
as to yield a definite answer?” Unfortunately, no. Qualitative
familiarity with the principles involved, these men had certainly ; but
with the exception of the work of Dr. Abbot, their experiments and
records indicate inadequate quantitative knowledge of the problem.
As an exemple, consider the simplest possible collector, the flat plate
insulated with several air-spaced glass layers. Willsie’s work at
Needles in 1909 indicated the possibilities of this simplest of solar
plants, but it left unanswered the question of merit relative to the
much more efficient—and more expensive—plant of Abbot, and did
not yield data permitting the design of such a plant for any given
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

climate. Among the projects at M. I. T. made possible by Dr. God-
frey Cabot’s endowment for research on utilization of solar energy
is one having as its first objective the determination of the perform-
ance characteristics of solar energy collectors of different types, the
performance, of course, being correlated with records of incident
solar energy so as to permit calculations of expected performance
in any locality where sunlight records are available. The first and
so far the only type of collector studied has been the flat plate, which
will now be considered briefly.

Since each additional layer of glass and air cuts down the losses
from such a plate, it is apparent that with glass having perfect
transmission one could build a collector which, without any focusing
or concentrating device, would still collect efficiently at a very high
temperature level. But the best glass is not perfect. It doesn’t ab-
sorb much solar energy when one picks the right glass—and there is
ample evidence that early experimenters were too casual in their choice
of glass in that respect—but there is a reflection loss of about 4 per-
cent at each surface. Consequently, as glass plates are added the
point is ultimately reached where the reduction in heat loss from the
metal plate is more than offset by the reduction in intensity of in-
cident radiation due to reflection losses. The optimum number of
plates to use will be less the more intense the sunlight, more the
colder the weather and the higher the temperature of collection of
heat.

The controlling part played by reflection losses in the design of
flat-plate collectors having been brought out, the desirability of a low
reflecting glass was discussed with Professor Hardy, of our Physics
Department. The result was the invention by Drs. Turner and Cart-
wright of a method of processing glass to give it a permanent sur-
face of reflectivity approaching zero at one point in the spectrum.
The process has already demonstrated its importance in a great many
uses ranging from spectacle lenses through bomb sights to high-speed
cameras and the solar-corona camera which was described in the first
article of this series. Here is an excellent example of a need in one
field stimulating research, the results of which have many applica-
tions in other fields. The special glass has not yet been used for an
experimental solar-energy collector, but calculations indicate that
its use should make possible the attainment of temperatures up to
800° I. without any mirrors or lenses or so-called concentrating
devices.

Another problem of flat-plate collectors is that of optimum tilt.
Obviously they are too cheap a type of collector system to warrant
being mounted to follow the sun, but they may profitably be tilted
permanently toward the Equator. A little consideration will in-
dicate that the optimum tilt depends very definitely on the use to
CONVERTERS OF SOLAR ENERGY—-HOTTEL 155

which the collected heat is to be put. If the objective is the max-
imum collection during the entire year, tilting should favor the sum-
mer season. If, on the other hand, the objective is to supply heat for
a load which varies throughout the year, the tilt should be chosen to
favor that part of the year in which the load is highest.

As to the use of such collectors, it has already been indicated that
one must find first just what they cando. But speculation is permissi-
ble. One might visualize a large artificial lake with sloped sides
formed by throwing up an earthen ring around a surface-scraped cen-
ter, the bottom and sloping sides being surfaced with asphalt. Float-
ing on this lake, which is, say, 20 to 40 feet deep, is an enormous raft
covering it completely. On the raft is a layer of insulation, then a sys-
tem of flat-plate collectors. Forced circulation of lake water through
the collectors whenever they attain a temperature above the reser-
voir will produce a large body of hot water available for continuous
operation of a power plant. The working fluid in the engine might
be low-pressure steam or, to cut down engine size, a fluid which
boils at lower temperatures. It is not possible to state at this time
whether such an idea has possibilities.

Another less ambitious use of flat-plate collectors might be that of
house heating in relatively cold but sunny climates, or summer air
conditioning. Some preliminary figures may indicate the prospects
in this direction. Consider house heating in New England, and
take as a basis the furnishing of one therm of heat throughout the
heating season—100,000 B. t. u.: the heat obtained by burning 1
gallon of fuel oil with normal efficiency of combustion. If 1 square
foot of flat-plate receiver covered with three plates of glass and
tilted 40° southward is operated in connection with 114 cubic feet
of water in a well-insulated tank, and the water is pumped from
the tank to the receiver and back whenever the receiver is hotter
than the tank, the combination will supply all but 15 percent of the
100,000 B. t. u. required during the season; the 15 percent has to be
supplied as auxiliary heat in December, January, and February.
The value of the heat saved is the cost of 0.85 gallons of fuel oil, or
about 6 cents. Capitalizing this at 6 percent gives only $1 available
to be spent on the roof collector and tank. This is plainly not enough,
but the answer is interesting because we have not determined the
optimum number of glass plates, or tilt, or ratio of roof to tank
area, or considered the possibility of some day having treated glass of
lower reflectivity. More particularly, the idea looks interesting for
localities where the ratio of winter to summer sunshine is somewhat
more favorable than in Boston, and the winter heating requirements
somewhat lower. According to a recent publication of Dr. Abbot’s,
Dr. F. G. Cottrell has proposed a somewhat similar storage system
in which sand is to be used instead of water. Whether the ad-
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

vantages of low-cost installation and ability to store heat at a higher
temperature would be offset by the disadvantage of lower efficiency
of collection is a point requiring study.

Whether the use of flat-plate collectors together with a storage
system is economically possible for house heating or air conditioning
in certain areas of the earth, whether other types of collector will
prove cheaper for these uses or for power generation, whether power
generation from solar heat demands the development of a new
heat-engine cycle, and whether power generation by any process
dependent on direct conversion of sunlight into heat with consequent
unavoidable losses due to the degradation of energy is sound—these
are questions which it is hoped this program will help to answer.
Regardless of the result, the present considerable and increasing
importance of solar heat for hot water in certain parts of this coun-
try indicates the need for a comprehensive study of the factors
involved in the design of collectors.

Now to come to a second project, related to the one just dis-
cussed. Conventional heat-power plants are characterized by a cost
of power production depending enormously on the capacity of the
plant; and we have seen that solar power does not now look very
attractive when compared to large-scale operation of steam plants.
If, on the other hand, it were possible to operate small solar plants
with an efficiency comparable to large ones, the comparison with
fuel-fired plants might lead to some very different conclusions.
So far as the collectors of the sunlight are concerned there is little
indication that the cost should be other than proportional to the
amount of collector area. If then it were possible to devise an
engine with moderate efficiency even in small units, one might have
something worthwhile. The second project is, in effect, a study
of a type of engine which may have just such desired characteristics.
When two dissimilar conducting materials are joined to form a
loop and the two junctions are kept at different temperatures, heat
flows into the loop at the hot junction, a portion of its energy is
converted to electrical energy and the rest flows out of the cold
junction as heat. The phenomenon involved here has itself long
been known; many investigators have been led to speculate upon it
as a possibility for large-scale thermoelectric power production, but
then to dismiss it as unimportant because the effect is small. Of the
early experiments in this field, the best yielded an over-all efficiency
of conversion of energy from gas to electricity of only 0.6 percent.
Consequently, until recently, the: sole use of the phenomenon has been
in the measurement of temperature.

In trying to better these results, one naturally asks, first, the ques-
tion “What property must a metal or alloy have besides high thermo-
electric power if it is to be of interest for heat-power generation?”
CONVERTERS OF SOLAR ENERGY—HOTTEL 157

Plainly, the material should have a low thermal conductivity to
minimize the loss of heat flowing from the hot to the cold junction.
Moreover, the electrical conductivity should be as high as possible
in order not to dissipate an excessive amount of electrical energy
as heat within the “engine.” The ratio of the two quantities, thermal
conductivity to electrical conductivity, is known as the Wiedemann-
Franz ratio; and it has just been shown that this ratio should be
as low as possible. A correlation of data from the literature and a
consideration of theoretical limitations indicate a sort of conspiracy
on the part of Nature to prevent the finding of any material with
a Wiedemann-Franz ratio less than a certain minimum value. A
study of the properties of zinc-antimony alloys indicates that the
thermoelectric power is a maximum for an alloy containing 36 per-
cent zinc, but that, owing to the extremely abnormal value of the
Wiedemann-Franz ratio in this alloy, there is an advantage in use
of an alloy containing 48 percent zinc, since the thermoelectric power
of such an alloy is almost as good as the best, and the Wiedemann-
Franz ratio is very much more favorable.

An “engine” consisting of an alloy of zinc and antimony contain-
ing 48 percent zine against the alloy copel has been found to produce
a 5 percent useful conversion of heat to electrical power in the
external circuit, when the temperature difference of the hot and cold
junctions of the system is maintained at 400° C. To the layman
this may not sound very imposing, but it is to be remembered that
25-percent efficiency is attained only in the best of modern steam
power plants and that 5 percent would not be considered bad for a
small engine. Moreover, it is to be remembered that a great many
alloys and compounds exist, the thermoelectric properties of which
are unknown, that it is not inconceivable that further study of the
problem may produce a material increase in efficiency in this kind
of an engine. With such an idea in mind, there has been initiated
at M. I. T. a program of study of the thermoelectric properties of
various compounds and alloys. The work is in too early a stage to
justify consideration at the present time.

So far in this discussion only the so-called heat engine has been
considered as a means of conversion of solar enregy to useful power.
The term, to an engineer, means a device which receives energy as
heat at a certain temperature, converts part of that energy to useful
power and throws away the rest to a so-called heat sink at a second
lower temperature. That this discussion was concerned in the first
instance with the use of steam in the engine and in the second in-
stance with the use of a thermocouple for conversion to power is
immaterial; in each case the first step has been the conversion of
solar energy to heat. Now, there is available to the scientist and
engineer a powerful tool, known as the second law of thermodynam-
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

ics, that permits him to appraise the possibilities of the heat engine;
and it tells him, for example, that the enormous reservoir of heat
which the earth’s atmosphere constitutes is not available for use in a
heat engine. This same second law of thermodynamics states that,
in the act of collecting sunlight and converting it to heat at a lower
temperature level, a degradation of solar energy has occurred; the
energy has been made less available for conversion to power even
though none of it has been lost; and no process—no matter how
clever the inventor—can restore the energy to a form as intrinsically
useful as when it arrived here as solar energy just before its conver-
sion to heat.

In consequence of this important limitation on what can be ex-
pected so long as one’s interest is restricted to heat engines, it is
appropriate to consider other means of conversion of solar energy to
power which do not involve as a first step the collection of the energy
as heat, but which instead make use of the special nature of the
energy as it arrives. Solar energy reaching the earth consists of a
jumbled mass of radiations of wave lengths varying from the short
ultraviolet through the visible spectrum and out into the infrared,
roughly one-third of the total energy lying in the visible spectrum.
The radiation might be likened, if the analogy is not pushed too far,
to a shower of bullets—unit quantities of energy, known as quanta,
each of a particular wave length. The quanta of shortest wave
lengths have the greatest unit energy content; and almost two-thirds
of the total energy consists of relatively impotent quanta in the
infrared. If, instead of pouring all these quanta into the funnel of
a heat engine, they are given a chance to show their individuality,
what are their specialties? One, of particular interest to us at pres-
ent, is the phenomenon of photoelectricity, the ability of light quanta
of certain wave lengths to knock electrons out of atoms or atomic
lattices in crystals and produce an electric current.

Many of you have encountered this phenomenon in using that type
of camera exposure meter which indicates on a dial the intensity of
illumination. Light is there being converted into electrical energy
which is in turn used to make the galvanometer needle move. The
light-sensitive unit of such a device is one of two kinds, each referred
to as a blocking-layer photocell. The copper oxide cell is typical; it
consists of a massive plate of copper which has been oxidized on one
face and then etched, to produce thereby a layer grading from
cuprous oxide through all proportions of oxygen down to pure cop-
per. The cuprous oxide surface is covered with a thin film of an-
other metal, so thin as to be transparent to light quanta. There is
thus produced a sandwich in which the outer layers are metal and
the inside layers consist of material graded in character in a direc-
tion normal to the surface. If a quantum of visible light strikes
CONVERTERS OF SOLAR ENERGY—HOTTEL 159

the thin metal cover of the cuprous oxide, it passes through that and
through the cuprous oxide layer, penetrating to some point in the
structure where the composition lies between that of cuprous oxide
and copper (the so-called blocking layer) ; and there the quantum—
the bullet of energy—succeeds in knocking out an electron from the
crystal lattice. The electron, being liberated in territory where the
view depends on which way it looks, finds, in general, that the going
is easier when it migrates toward the copper rather than through the
cuprous oxide to the other metal film. This preferential movement
of the electrons in one direction constitutes an electric current.

How important is this phenomenon for power generation from
sunlight? Tests on copper oxide photocells indicate that of the
visible light quanta falling on such a cell only about 5 percent suc-
ceed in causing an electron to show up in the external electric circuit,
that, furthermore, the voltage efficiency of the system is only about
10 percent, with a consequent over-all efficiency of conversion of
luminous energy to power of one-half of 1 percent. Preliminary
calculations indicate that a tenfold increase in this efficiency would
make copper oxide cells interesting for solar power production; and
there is no present reason to believe such an accomplishment im-
possible. It is not easy, however, for the physicist doesn’t really
know just what goes on in the blocking layer of the photocell.
Clearly the problem is one which demands a fundamental study com-
pletely divorced from any present considerations of a practical nature.
Such a project has been initiated in our Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment in connection with a broad program of study of insulators and
semiconductors—the cuprous oxide of our photocell is such—from the
atomphysical viewpoint. The problem is really one of studying the
laws of motion of electrons in semiconductors; the effect of crystal
versus amorphous structure; of crystal structures in which there is
strong ionic binding, such as sodium chloride versus crystal struc-
tures in which the bonding is atomic, as in sulfur; the effect of tem-
perature on conduction and break-down in insulators; the effect of
an excess of one of the components of a crystalline compound present
in the crystal. When the nature of the migration of electrons in
semiconductors is better understood, when their interaction with the
lattice structure is able to be formulated quantitatively, then one can
attack with some hope of success the difficult barrier-layer photocell
problem. Whether such an attack succeeds or not, the knowledge
acquired in the course of the problem is certain to be of enormous
value in a field of great practical importance, insulation research.

I come now to the last of the M. I. T. solar-energy projects, one
which like the previous one depends on the special properties of
sunlight rather than its over-all energy content. Dr. Thimann
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

pointed out in his contribution ? our complete dependence on the proc-
ess known as photosynthesis: the use by green plants of solar energy
in the visible spectrum to produce carbohydrates out of carbon doxide
and water. He also emphasized the extreme complexity of the proc-
ess—the fact that no one has been able to extract the essential
chlorophyll and carotenoids from a plant leaf and make the reaction
go in atest tube. By some process, which we have hardly begun to
understand, the leaf structure succeeds in capturing the energy of
sunlight and transferring it to the reaction: carbon dioxide+
water=carbohydrate+oxygen, a reaction absorbing 112 kilocal-
ories per gram atom of carbon. But to store solar energy chemically
one does not have to carry out the same reaction that nature does;
any chemical reaction which absorbs energy and produces a fuellike
product capable of later combustion to return the energy for use at
the proper time would be acceptable. Chemical industry has often
succeeded in competing with nature in the production of a material
of desired characteristics, not by attempting a complete imitation of
nature, but by focusing attention on those properties of the natural
material important to its use and imitating them with a synthetic
product, perhaps chemically quite different from nature’s product.

In the photochemical field, then, a combination of sensitizers and
catalysts might be attempted that would allow us to perform some
relatively simple energy-storing reaction such as the decomposition
of water. A major problem would be to provide suitable inter-
mediate steps in the process in order that the relatively small energy
quanta, which constitute visible light, could be used in stepwise fash-
ion such as nature apparently uses them in the photosynthetic ap-
paratus of green plants. The photochemical system would probably
have one of the characteristics of the photochemical system of the
plant, namly heterogeneity. But the heterogeneity might be accom-
plished not by constructing some sort of imitation leaf, but rather,
for example, by a colloidal solution.

Another approach to the problem is possible. We may renounce
the production of metastable products or mixtures with a high con-
tent of chemical energy—fuels or explosives—and turn our attention
to the utilization of the energy of the unstable intermediate products
obtained in almost every photochemical reaction. Among the ways
of utilizing these products is to convert their high energy content
into electrical energy. A reaction must be found in which passage
from the unstable to the stable state can be made to proceed as an
electrode reaction in a galvanic cell. Examples of this kind are
oxidation-reduction reactions in electrolytes. The properties of such
a reaction, carried out in what is known as a photogalvanic cell, are

?Thimann, Kenneth V., The action of light on organisms. Sigma Xi Quart., vol. 29,

CONVERTERS OF SOLAR ENERGY—HOTTEL 161

being studied at the Institute. The system chosen consists of an or-
ganic dye, thionine, and ferrous iron in the form, for example, of a
ferrous sulfate solution. The two components form in the solution
a reversible oxidation-reduction system.

(dyestuff) +Fet*= leukodyestuff+Fett*

(colorless)

Ferric iron is a much stronger oxidizing agent than thionine; there-
fore, in the dark, all the thionine is in the form of the dye, and all
the iron in the ferrous form. If, however, the mixture is illuminated
by the light absorbed by thionine—i. e., visible light in the region
5000-7000 A. (green, yellow, red light)—the thionine molecules are
activated by light and become capable of oxidizing ferrous iron.
Since the reduced thionine is colorless, the reaction is recognized by a
decoloration of the solution. This bleaching proceeds to a steady
state, whose exact character depends on the intensity of illumination.
In this state, the velocity of the photochemical bleaching reaction
is exactly compensated by that of the back-reaction restoring the
equilibrium. As soon as the light is switched off, the system reverts
to its original state.

Experiments have been conducted on the kinetics of this interesting
photochemical process, using a photometric method for the determina-
tion of the concentration of the dye under different conditions. Of
more interest in the present connection is the electrochemical effect of
light in the thionine-iron system. As the composition of the solution
changes through illumination, its electrode potential is also changed;
if two platinum electrodes are placed in the solution and the electro-
lyte surrounding one of them is illuminated while the other is kept
dark, a potential difference is established between the two electrodes
and a current flows from the dark to the illuminated electrode.
The problem of the photogalvanic effect demonstrated by this experi-
ment has two elements: the first and simpler question is that of the
electromotive force produced by a given illumination; the second is
that of the current that can be.drawn from such a photogalvanic
cell.

So far, experiments have been concerned with the first part of the
problem. The photogalvanic potential of the thionine-iron system
has been measured in relation to the concentrations of all the compo-
nents and the light intensity. A pronounced maximum of potential
is found at a certain concentration of the dyestuff, and a strong in-
crease in effect with decreasing acidity of the solution. From such
experiments, it has been possible to develop a quantitative picture of
the photogalvanic effect in satisfactory agreement with the experi-
mental results. The next step is a study of the factors affecting cur-
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

rent withdrawal from such a device, a phase of the program which
has just commenced.

As to whether photogalvanic cells of this or similar types have
practical importance as solar energy converters it is too early to
hazard an opinion. Certainly their study has the merit of presenting
problems in photochemistry which, while complex, are not so complex
as to defy analytical treatment. In that respect they satisfy the
condition which the scientist has learned to impose on himself, namely,
not to ask questions of Nature which are so difficult that he cannot
yet begin to understand her answer.

In summary, I have tried to point out that the best-known method
of utilizing solar energy by artificial means is the relatively simple
one of first converting the energy to heat; that, today, engineering
data are inadequate properly to determine the value of such heat,
whether for conventional use as heat or for conversion to power;
that, if heat is converted to power, we are limited in possible efficiency
by the second law of thermodynamics; that consequently it is necessary
to turn to the fields of photochemistry and photoelectricity where
theoretical limitations on expected output are less severe; that in
turning to these fields it is found that the problems which arise are
of so complicated a nature as to point plainly to the need for a long-
range program of research into fundamental phenomena, research
divorced almost completely for the time being from any considera-
tions of a practical nature. To summarize this summary, with respect
to the future of solar energy utilization, your guess is as good as
mine.

THE NEW FRONTIERS IN THE ATOM?

By ERNEST O. LAWRENCE

The University of California

[With 9 plates]

The anniversary celebration of a great university is indeed an
important occasion, and it is appropriate to signalize the event by a
symposium on “The University and the Future of America,” for a
a great institution of learning is eternally youthful, and youth looks
always to the future. I am greatly honored to be included in this dis-
tinguished gathering, and it gives me especial pleasure to join in wish-
ing our sister institution many happy returns.

In a discussion bearing on the future, the scientist is always in some-
thing of a dilemma. On the one hand, he is cautioned to make only
very limited prognostications, for he has learned the very limited
region of applicability of existing knowledge and the likelihood of
error in speculation. On the other hand, he faces the future with eager
excitement and curiosity about what is beyond the present frontiers
of knowledge, and he is naturally tempted to speculate and indeed
to indulge in day dreams. Perhaps I may convey something of what
is in the minds of physicists these days by a brief discussion of somé
recent developments of the current intensive attack on the new frontier
in the atomic world—the nucleus of the atom.

ATOMS

The atomic constitution of matter has long been a keystone of
natural science. At the beginning of this century it was a keystone
in a structure having as pillars the principles of the conservation of
energy and the indestructibility of matter. In the nineties, it was
almost axiomatic to say that the building blocks of nature are the
atoms—indivisible, indestructible entities, permanent for all time.
But the discovery of radioactivity altered all this. There followed

the discovery of the electron and the proton as smaller and more
fundamental constituents of matter and the atom itself became the
happy hunting ground of the experimental physicist. Atomic physics
developed rapidly; for the atom was found to be a domain of almost
incredible richness, and today, thanks perhaps to the newspapers,
our children speak knowingly of smashing atoms!

To explain the wonderful phenomenon of radioactivity, Rutherford
came forward in 1904 with a revolutionary hypothesis which reduced
the complicated and mysterious observations of radioactivity to simple
order. According to Rutherford, not all of the atoms have existed
for ages and will exist for all time, but there are some atoms in nature
that are energetically unstable and in the course of time, of their own
accord, blow up with explosive violence. These are the natural radio-
active substances, and the fragments given off in the atomic explosions
are the observed penetrating rays.

It was not long before Rutherford’s hypothesis was established as
a law of nature and formed a greater keystone, replacing the chem-
ists’ conception of the atom and serving as a foundation for a new
science, the science of the atomic nucleus.

Time does not permit an adequate historical résumé of the develop-
ment of nuclear physics, but for the present purpose it is sufficient
to say that the ideas of Rutherford and Bohr on the structure of
atoms are now firmly established. There is an abundance of evidence
that an atom consists of a nebulous cloud of planetary electrons
whirling about a very dense sun, the positively charged nucleus,
and that it is in the nucleus that the atomic explosions of radioactiv-
ity occur. Indeed, our assurance that this is so rivals our confidence
that the planets revolve about the sun!

ATOMIC NUCLEUS

Let us now proceed immediately to a consideration of the structure
of the nucleus. The nucleus consists of a closely packed group of
protons and neutrons, elementary building blocks of nature some
2,000 times heavier than the electrons. The neutrons are electri-
cally neutral while the protons carry positive charges, and for each
proton in the nucleus there is a corresponding negative electron out-
side, for the atom as a whole is uncharged. Since the number of elec-
trons outside determines the ordinary chemical and physical proper-
ties of the atom, it follows that the nuclear charge determines the
place of the atom in the periodic table of the elements.

Thus, the nucleus is the body and soul of the atom. More than
99.9 percent of the atom’s mass is in the nucleus and the nuclear
charge determines the nature of the atom, its chemical and physical
properties.

TRANSMUTATION OF THE ELEMENTS

These considerations reduce the age-old problem of alchemy to
simple terms. For we see to change one element into another is sim-
ply to change the nuclear charge, i. e., the number of protons, in the
nucleus. The subject of transmutation of the elements has recently
received a great deal of attention in the laboratory. All sorts of
transmutations have been produced on a minute scale—helium has
been made from lithium, magnesium from sodium, and even mercury
has been turned into gold. The day may come when we will indeed
possess the philosopher’s stone and will be able to transmute the ele-
ments on a grand scale. But interesting as these developments are, I
should like to draw your attention to two other subjects, artificial
radioactivity and the question of tapping the vast reservoir of energy
in the nucleus of the atom.

ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVITY

One of the early results of atomic bombardment was the discovery
that neutrons could be knocked in or knocked out of the nucleus
to produce radioactive isotopes of the ordinary elements. Thus, for
example, the nucleus of the ordinary sodium atom contains 11 neu-
trons and 12 protons, 23 particles in all, and so it is called sodium 238
(or Na?*); and by bombardment it was found that a neutron could
either be added to make sodium 24 or subtracted to make sodium 22,
both isotopic forms not occurring in the natural state. The reason
that these synthetic forms are not found in nature is that they are
energetically unstable. They are radioactive and in the course of time
blow up with explosive violence. Sodium 24 has a half-life of 14.5
hours, i. e., it has an even chance of disintegrating in that time,
turning into magnesium by the emission of an electron. Sodium 22,
on the other hand, has a half-life of 3 years and emits positive elec-
trons to turn to stable neon 22.

These artificial radioactive isotopes of the elements are indistin-
guishable from their ordinary stable relatives until the instant they
manifest their radioactivity. This fact deserves emphasis, and it
may be illustrated further by the case of chlorine. Chlorine consists
of a mixture of two isotopes, 76 percent of Ci®* and 24 percent of
Cl, resulting in a chemical atomic weight of 35.46 which is the
average weight of the mixture. By elaborate technique, to be sure,
it is possible to take advantage of the extremely slight difference in
chemical properties and bring about separation of these isotopes, but
in ordinary chemical, physical, and biological processes, the chlorine
isotopes are indistinguishable and inseparable. The artificial radio-
active isotopes Cl™* and Cl** are likewise indistinguishable. In fact,
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

Cl** is more nearly identical in properties to the natural isotope
Cl** than is the other natural isotope Cl*’7. And again I would say
that the radioactive characteristic of Cl®* becomes evident only at the
moment it blows up to turn into the neighbor element sulfur.

RADIOACTIVE TRACER ATOMS

In these radioactive transformations of the artificial radioactive
isotopes, the radiations given off are so energetic that the radiations
from individual atoms can be detected with rugged and reliable
instruments, called Geiger counters. Thus, radioactive isotopes can
be admixed with ordinary chemicals to serve as tracer elements in
complicated chemical or biological processes.

As an illustration of the power of this new technique of labeling
and tracing atoms, let us consider iodine in relation to the thyroid
gland. It is well known that the thyroid takes up and stores iodine,
and this fact can be demonstrated strikingly by feeding an individual
iodine including a small quantity of radioactive iodine. Before the
feeding, the radioactivity of the food can be measured by placing it
near a Geiger counter, thereby giving a measure of the iodine con-
tent. Later the progress of the iodine through the body can be
observed by placing the Geiger counter next to various parts of the
body. Likewise, the proportion of the fed iodine in the various
body fluids at any time can be determined quickly by taking small
samples of the fluids and measuring their radioactivity. After some
hours it is found that a large part of the iodine taken in has col-
lected in the thyroid, a fact that is readily established by placing a
Geiger counter next to the gland (pl. 1, fig. 1) and observing the
activity while finding no appreciable activity elsewhere. This tech-
nique makes it possible to study the behavoir of the thyroid in
health and in disease, and much interesting work along this line has
been carried out recently.

RADIO-AUTOGRAPHY

Although the tracer elements are readily detected with the Geiger
counter, there is a photographic method which for many purposes
has obvious advantages. This method is sometimes called radio-
autography and is illustrated by plate 1, figure 2. Here a minute
amount of radioactive phosphorus in the form of sodium phosphate
was added to the nutrient solution of a tomato plant, and after a
day or so Jeaves were placed against a photographic film enclosed in a
light tight paper envelope. The penetrating rays from the radio-
active phosphorus produced the developed contact image shown in
the figure, which gives an accurate and detailed picture of the uptake
of phosphate by the plant. Now, indeed, the same method works
NEW FRONTIERS IN THE ATOM—LAWRENCE 167

very well also for the thyroid, as is shown in plate 2, which is a
photomicrograph of a thin section of thyroid tissue containing
radio-iodine; alongside is the radio-autograph obtained from the
same microsection by placing it against a photographic plate. The
distribution of the iodine in various parts of the gland is shown in
surprising detail.

Similarly striking radio-autographs of the distribution of phos-
phorus and strontium in rats are shown in plate 3, figure 1. Here
two rats were fed radiophosphorus and radiostrontium respectively,
and then some hours or days later they were sacrificed, and frozen
sections of the entire bodies of the animals were placed against a
photographic plate. The resulting radio-autographs show clearly
that both strontium and phosphorus are selectively deposited in the
bones, phosphorus being more widely distributed in other tissue.
The distribution of the strontium in the bones also appears to be
quite different from that of phosphorus as radio-autographs of the
sections of bones clearly show (pl. 3, fig. 2).

These examples serve to illustrate the power of the new technique
of radioactive tracer atoms. It has often been said that the progress
of science is the progress of new tools and new techniques, and I
think we may look forward to accelerated developments in biology
resulting from the tracer elements.

ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES IN THERAPY

It is somewhat afield for me to discuss medical problems, but I
should like to direct your atention to the possibilities of the artificial
radioactive substances in the treatment of cancer and allied diseases.
It is well known that at the present time there are two main ap-
proaches to the treatment of neoplastic disease, surgery and radia-
tion. It is sometimes possible to cut out a cancer completely and
effect a cure, and in other circumstances, it is possible to destroy a
tumor by irradiation with X-rays or radium. The mechanism
whereby the radiation destroys the tumor without destroying an
excessive amount of surrounding norma] tissue is doubtless extremely
complicated, but in any case it is evidently important to localize the
radiation to the tumor as much as possible. Perhaps the idea would
be approached if a means were at hand to irradiate each and every
malignant cell without irradiating a single normal cell.

The artificial radioactive substances open for the first time the
possibility of an approach to such selective irradiation of tissue.
The above examples of tracers suggest the treatment of thyroid
tumors with radioactive iodine, bone tumors with radioactive
strontium and radioactive phosphorus. These possibilities are being
investigated as is the more specific problem of finding a radioactive
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

substance that is selectively taken up by tumor tissue. If there
were time, I should like to describe work along this line in progress
in several laboratories, and especially to speak of the important
progress that is being made in the treatment of leukemia, but I must
content myself with only mentioning these new developments in
medicine, which are so promising for the future.

ATOMIC ENERGY

For a long time astronomers have been vexed with a problem, the
problem of the source of stellar energy, for there is evidence that the
sun has been blazing at its present brilliance for thousands of millions
of years, and no ordinary fuel could be responsible for such an eternal
fire.

The discovery of radium posed to the physicist a similar difficulty ;
for it was found that radium gives off every hour enough energy to
heat its own weight of water to boiling, and this it continues to do for
more than a thousand years. Such a vast source of energy in the
radium atom was as difficult to understand as the evidently limitless
store of heat in the sun. The problem was of fundamental interest
and all sorts of possibilities were considered even to the abandonment
of the principle of the conservation of energy.

But the first clue to the solution of the problem appeared in 1905
when Einstein announced the theory of relativity. One of the revo-
lutionary consequences of the theory was that matter is a form of
energy and that presumably in nature processes go on in which
matter is destroyed and transformed into more familiar forms of
energy such as heat, radiation, and mechanical motion. The rela-
tivity theory gave as the conversion factor relating mass to equiva-
lent energy, the square of the velocity of light—a very large number,
even to an astronomer! Thus, the theory indicated that, if a glass
of water were completely destroyed, more than a billion kilowatt
hours of energy would be released, enough to supply a city with light
and power for quite a time!

This exciting deduction was immediately accepted by the astron-
omers, who said, “Doubtless within the sun conditions are such that
matter is being transformed to heat. Thus, slowly through the ages
the sun is losing mass; its very substance is radiating into space.”

Likewise, the physicists, who had other compelling reasons for
accepting the Einstein theory, concluded that the source of the energy
in the radium atom was a destruction of matter in the atomic
explosion giving rise to the penetrating rays.

Although the fundamental assumptions on which the relativity
theory was based were evidently sound, and the explanations of
the source of energy of the sun and stars and radioactivity were
NEW FRONTIERS IN THE ATOM—LAWRENCE 169

most attractive, until direct experimental verification was forth-
coming, Einstein’s great deduction could not be regarded as an
established law of nature.

The first direct evidence of the truth of this fundamental prin-
ciple was obtained in the first atom-smashing experiments a decade
ago. It was observed that, when the nucleus of a lithium atom is
hit by a proton having a kinetic energy of less than a million electron-
volts, the result is the formation of two helium nuclei which fly apart
with an energy of more than 17 million electron-volts; thus in the
nuclear reaction in which hydrogen and lithium unite to form two
helium atoms, there is a great release of kinetic energy.

Now one of the interesting and important occupations of the ex-
perimental physicist has been the measurement of the masses of
atoms and the weights of atoms are known with great precision—
much greater than any individual knows his own weight. In par-
ticular, it was known precisely that a lithium atom and a hydrogen
atom have a total weight slightly greater than the weight of two
helium atoms, and it was a great triumph for the Einstein theory
when measurements showed that the excess kinetic energy with which
the helium atoms flew apart in the hydrogen-lithium reaction corre-
sponded exactly with the disappearance of mass according to the
mass-energy relation. Literally hundreds of similar nuclear reactions
have been studied in the intervening years, and in each instance the
Kinstein relation has been verified. At the present time this great
principle has as firm an experimental foundation as any of our laws
of nature.

URANIUM FISSION

Now that it is an experimental fact that matter can be converted
into energy, it becomes of great practical importance to inquire
whether the vast store of energy in the atom will be tapped for
useful purposes. This question has recently taken on added interest
through the discovery of a new type of nuclear reaction involving
the heavy element uranium.

It has been known for some years that the heavy elements, such
as lead, gold, and uranium, are relatively heavier than the middle-
weight elements, such as copper and iron, or more precisely that the
average weight of the neutrons, protons, and electrons in the heavy
elements is greater than their average weight in the atoms near the
middle of the periodic table. Accordingly it is to be expected that,
if heavy atoms were split approximately in two forming correspond-
ing middle-weight atoms, there would be a vast release of energy
corresponding to the disappearance of matter in the transformation.
Indeed, from known values of the masses, it can be calculated on the
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

basis of Einstein’s mass-energy relation that each splitting or fission,
as the process is called, of a uranium atom into two approximately
equal parts releases an energy of about 200 million electron-volts,
which is millions of times more heat per atom than is given off when
ordinary fuel is burned. Thus, calculations show that 100 pounds
of uranium would yield a billion kilowatt hours, which at 1 cent
per kilowatt-hour would be 10 million dollars’ worth of electrical
energy.

For some time these considerations were largely academic because
no way was known for producing fission of the heavy elements. But
interest in the matter has now become extremely lively as a result
of the discovery that fission of uranium is actually brought about by
bombarding it with neutrons.

The phenomenon has, during the past 2 years, received intensive
study in laboratories all over the world and several salient facts have
emerged. First, the rare U?** isotope undergoes fission after absorp-
tion of a slow neutron. Second, the energy released in the fission
process has been measured; and, as expected, it is found that, when
a neutron having an energy less than an electron-volt enters the U?**
nucleus, about 200 million electron-volts of energy is released. Third,
it is found also that the fission process is so violent that usually the
U*** nucleus does not break up into two parts only, but more often
several neutrons are given off in addition to the two large fragments.

That neutrons are generated in the fission process is of the greatest
interest because it opens up the possibility of a chain reaction, a
series of nuclear reactions wherein the neutrons liberated in one fission
process go to produce additional fissions in other atoms which in
turn give rise to more neutrons which produce further fissions and
so on. It is this possibility of a chain reaction that has excited the
interest in uranium as a practical source of atomic energy.

Without going into further detail, it is perhaps sufficient to say
that there is some evidence now that, if U**® could be separated in
quantity from the natural mixture of the isotopes, a chain reaction
could, indeed, be produced. But herein lies the catch, for there is
no practical large-scale way in sight of separating the isotopes of
the heavy elements, and certainly it is doubtful if a way will be
found.

But I should not want to indicate that the uranium matter is a
disappointment, that after all we shall never find a way to bring
about fission of the heavy elements for useful purposes. Quite the
contrary !

The present situation is not unlike the circumstances 50 years ago
surrounding the then great question of whether man would ever be
able to fly. In those days the fundamental laws of classical mecha-
'

NEW FRONTIERS IN THE ATOM—LAWRENCE 7

nics were known, and they allowed the possibility of heavier-than-air
flight. Moreover, there was an abundance of supporting observa-
tional evidence that flight should be possible; there were kites and
there were the birds of the air. But man’s realization of the dream
awaited primarily the development of the combustion engine, a cir-
cumstance not so evidently connected with the fundamental problem
of flight. Likewise the fundamental laws of nature recently revealed
to us allow the possibility of obtaining useful nuclear energy, and
radium and the sun and stars bear witness that this vast source of
energy is being tapped in nature. Again success in this direction
may await the development of a new intrument or technique just as
the airplane depended on the gas engine.

Perhaps the problem awaits a deeper understanding of the forces
that hold nuclei together. That there are little-understood forces
operative in the nucleus is more than evident; especially from obser-
vations of the cosmic rays, it has been established that particles of
matter called mesotrons of intermediate mass between electrons and
protons play a dominant role in nuclear structure. Theoretical con-
siderations suggest that the mesotrons may be connected with the
primary forces in the nucleus, and accordingly, an understanding of
mesotron forces may ultimately yield the solution of the practical
problem of atomic energy.

THE GIANT CYCLOTRON

In order to study experimentally the mesotron problem, it is neces-
sary to bombard nuclei with atomic projectiles having energies in
the range of 100 million electron-volts rather than in the neighbor-
hood of 10 million electron-volts at present available in cyclotron
laboratories. To this end a giant cyclotron is now under construc-
tion on Charter Hill in Berkeley; some pictures of this great machine
are shown in plates 8 and 9. Whether it will be the key to the vast
store of energy in the atom, what new discoveries, what new insight
into nature it will bring—only the future will tell!

THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CYCLOTRON

The principle of the cyclotron has been described as follows in a
popular article by Henry Schacht.?

A circular chamber was placed between the poles of the magnet. Then all
air was removed from the chamber and heavy hydrogen gas allowed to flow in.
This so-called heavy hydrogen behaves in the same way as ordinary hydrogen.
However, while the nuclei of ordinary hydrogen atoms contain one positively
charged particle, or proton, heavy hydrogen nuclei contain two such particles

2Schacht, Henry, Lawrence’s cyclotron, Part I and Part II. California Monthly for
May and June, 1940.
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1941

plus one electron. Consequently, they weigh just twice as much as the nuclei
of ordinary hydrogen atoms. They are known as deuterons.

The deuteron’s added weight makes it an ideal atomic bullet. And here is
how Dr. Lawrence planned to send streams of deuterons crashing into the nuclei
of other atoms in a constant, destructive barrage: Inside the cyclotron cham-
ber was a heated filament that emitted streams of electrons. These particles
would collide with the electrons surrounding the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms
and in the ensuing mix-up the nuclei and their satellites would become sep-
arated. The deuterons would be left free to float around the chamber.
Hventually, the magnetic force set up by the cyclotron’s magnet would pull
them between two metal grids separated by a space across which an alternating
electrical current of 10 or 15 thousand volts would be operating. As the
deuterons floated into this space, they would receive a heavy shock, and under
this stimulus fly off toward the side of the chamber. But the magnetic field
would pull them back again in a semicircular path until they again came
between the two grids. Again they would be shocked and be sent flying out
toward the side. And again the magnet would pull them back to complete one
full circle of the chamber and be shocked again.

At each jolt from the current the deuterons would gather more energy. This
meant that they would go flying out from between the grids with constantly
increasing force and in constantly widening circles. So you get the picture of
the atomic bullets receiving shocks one right after the other from a weak
electrical force. Each time the bullets receive a shock their energy is increased
and they go on, describing wider and wider circles around the cyclotron
chamber. Finally, they circle so widely that they reach a slit in the chamber
wall and go flying out into the open air. The whole secret of the thing lies in
making sure by means of the magnet that the atomic bullets are forced to
come back for successive shocks until their energy is built up to the point where
they can force their way to the exit. Dr. Lawrence figured that to bombard
any Substance with his atomic bullets, all he had to do was clamp this sub-
stance over the slit and let the onrushing stream of deuterons crash into it.
This then was the theory put to the crucial test in 1934 at the Universiy
Radiation Laboratory. Dr. Lawrence threw the switch that sent a high-pow-
ered radio transmitter pumping energy into the cyclotron and the first experi-
ment with the 85-ton machine had begun.

Within a short time, physicists were amazed to hear that Lawrence and his
cyclotron were not only changing familiar elements like platinum into other
elements like iridium and gold, but were actually producing substances never
before seen on earth. These were the artificially radioactive elements. Perhaps
their character is best explained by illustration.

One of the experiments performed with the cyclotron involved the bombard-
ment of iron atoms with the high-speed deuterons produced by the cyclotron.
When the deuterons crashed into them with a force of about 8 million volts,
the iron atoms were broken up. Some changed into atoms of cobalt or man-
ganese. But others were converted into a new form of iron which, like radium,
emitted streams of electrically charged particles. In other words, this new iron
was radioactive. Thirty-four different elements were subjected to bombard-
ment with the 85-ton cyclotron and all of them underwent a transformation,
many turning into radioactive substances. Among the artificial radioactive
materials produced by the cyclotron were sodium, phosphorus, iron, and iodine.
It was even possible by bombarding bismuth to produce a degenerate form of
radium called Radium E.
NEW FRONTIERS IN THE ATOM—LAWRENCE 173

Another interesting product of these atomic bombardments was the neutron,
a particle often found in the atomic nucleus. It adds to the weight of the
nucleus but has no electrical charge, hence its name. When atoms were smashed
by the bullets from the cyclotron, they flew into two parts. One might be an
atom of a new radioactive element, and another an atom of a light element such
as hydrogen or helium. But more often than either of these two, a neutron
would appear. When the cyclotron was going full blast, 10 billion of these
particles could be liberated every second.

It was found that radioactive elements, such as sodium and phosphorus, had
certain advantages over radium which might make them extremely valuable
for treatment of human disease. Preliminary experiments indicated that
radioactive phosphorus might solve the problem of leukemia, the wasting blood
disease for which no cure has yet been found. Radioactive sodium, iodine,
phosphorus, and many other of the newly created elements proved to be price-
less instruments in the hands of scientists interested in finding out more about
our fundamental body processes. Finally, streams of released neutrons gave
every indication of being a more powerful weapon against cancer than the
X-ray. These discoveries marked the end of the first cycle of the cyclotron’s
career. So promising were the medical applications of its products that plans
were laid to build a new 225-ton cyclotron. This machine was finished and
housed in the William H. Crocker Radiation Laboratory on the University
campus during the spring of 1939.

In its first performance the new atom smasher produced deuteron beams with
a strength of 17 million volts, and “alpha rays,’ or beams of helium atoms,
with an intensity of 34 million volts. These voltages were greater than any
obtained with the original machine even though the electric current used to
energize the particles within the cyclotron chamber was only 60 kilowatts.
Such results were entirely unexpected, far exceeding anything Dr. Lawrence
had hoped for on the first trial run.

On April 8, 1940, The Rockefeller Foundation of New York City
announced its willingness, under certain conditions, to contribute
$1,500,000 toward construction of a 4,900-ton cyclotron at the Uni-
versity. It would be 56 feet long, 15 feet wide, and have an over-all
height of approximately 30 feet. About 12 feet of the vertical struc-
ture would be underground. It is estimated that 8,700 tons of steel
and 300 tons of copper windings would be used in the construction.
It is believed that such a machine could produce a deuteron beam 140
feet in length as compared with the 5-foot beam produced by the
present 225-ton machine. This next cyclotron is now under con-
struction at the University of California (see pls. 8 and 9) and when
it is completed the problem of subatomic energy may be solved and a
new power may be released to run the wheels of industry.
