XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Chancellor announced that the vacancies existing in the Execu-
tive Committee were customarily filled by the adoption of resolutions,
and General Wheeler introduced the following:

Resolved, That the vacancies in the Executive Committee be filled by the election
of the Hon. William L. Wilson and the Hon. Gardiner G. Hubbard.

Resolved, That the Hon. J. B. Henderson be elected chairman of the Executive
Committee.

On motion, the resolutions were adopted.

The Chaneellor announced the death of Dr. Henry Coppée, and
appointed Senator Henderson and the Secretary a committee to draft
suitable resolutions. Senator Henderson. on behalf of the committee,
presented the following:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
are called to mourn the death of their colleague, the late Henry Coppée, LL. D.,
acting president of Lehigh University, for twenty years a Regent of the Institution,
and long a member of its Executive Committee:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents feels sincere sorrow in the loss of one whose
distinguished career as a soldier, a man of letters, and whose services in the promo-
tion of education command their highest respect and admiration.

Resolved, That in the death of Dr. Coppée the Smithsonian Institution and the
Board of Regents have suttered the loss of a tried and valued friend, a wise and
prudent counsellor, whose genial courtesy, well-stored, disciplined mind, and sin-
cere devotion to the interests of the Institution will be ever remembered.

Resolved, That these resolutions be recorded in the journal of the proceedings of
the board, and that the Secretary be requested to send acopy to the family of their
departed associate and friend in token of’sympathy in this common affliction.

On motion, the resolutions were unanimously adopted by a rising
vote.

The Secretary presented his annual report for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1895, and said: ‘‘ I may speak of the last year as one of varied
and fruitful activities, which are detailed in this report, which, however,
does not cover some points I desire presently to bring before the
Regents.”

After discussion by the Regents of a report upon the condition of the
Avery fund, the Secretary said: “I may ask the attention of the Regents
to the fact that the Hodgkins fund prizes have been awarded, one of
which—the principal one, of $10,000—was given through the American
embassy in London to Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay for the dis-
covery of a new element in the atmosphere ‘Argon.’ A similar prize
of 50,000 frances was given nearly simultaneously to the same persons
by the Institute of France. The second prize was not awarded, and
the third (of $1,000) was given to M. Varigny for the best popular trea-
tise, in accordance with the terms of the announcement. Morever, three
Silver and six bronze medals have been awarded to the laureates out
of nearly two hundred contestants. Letters had been sent to these, with
the thanks of the Institution, and inviting them to say whether they
would have their memoirs remain here or be sent back. In certain
cases, in accordance with the suggestion made last year by General
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

Wheeler, preparations had been made for the publication of some of
the more meritorious ones. Some of them exhibited such care and pains
in the preparation that it was thought desirable to give some kind of
token of the appreciation of the Institution, and medals of silver and
bronze had been awarded. These medals (of which the Secretary
showed a photograph) were now being struck.”

Mr. Wheeler inquired if it was the papers that had received honorable
mention which it was proposed to print, to which the Secretary responded
that that was the purpose, save where the authors preferred to print
themselves.

The Secretary went on to say:

There has probably been no single event in the history of the Institution which
has drawn more attention to it abroad than the announcement and award of these
prizes, which the Regents will remember were given in accordance with the
expressed desire of the donor that such might be at any rate the first disposition of
the income of the amount especially set apart by him for the study of the atmos-
phere. Having done this, I feel that a sort of pious duty has been accomplished in
fulfilling the wishes of Mr. Hodgkins, but while the money has been well bestowed
for once in drawing the almost universal attention of the scientific world to the
Hodgkins bequest and to the Institution and the fund which it administers, as well
as to its fitness as an administrator of other trusts of this character, it may be
doubted if it is a wise policy to continue the giving of such large prizes, which have
rarely been found efficacious in stimulating discovery. Unless, therefore, I am
instructed by the Regents to do otherwise, the income hereafter will be spent in the
customary channels of the Institution’s activities, through the aid of investigations
in regard to the air which more immediately promote the general welfare.

The large amount required for the great prize to which I have alluded, and which
is not likely to be called for again, has, of course, naturally limited the application
of this fund to the aid of original research in more practical ways, which I hope it
will take hereafter; but I may mention one outcome of it, a valuable investigation
by Dr. Weir Mitchell and Dr. Billings in “The composition of expired air.”

Continuing, the Secretary said:

I now desire to bring before the Regents a matter in which they may see fit to
express some opinion.

The fundamental act creating the Institution, in enumerating its functions, appar-
ently considers it first as a kind of Gallery of Art, and declares that all objects of art
and of foreign and curious research, the property of the United States, shall be
delivered to the Regents, and only after this adds that objects of natural history
shall be so also.

The scientific side of the Institution’s activities has been in the past so much
greater than its esthetic that it is well to recall the undoubted fact that it was
intended by Congress to be a curator of the national art, and that this function has
never been forgotten, though often in abeyance.

In 1849, your first Secretary, Joseph Henry, in pursuance of this function of an
Institution which, in his own words, existed for ‘‘ the true, the beautiful, as well as
for the immediately practical,” purchased of the Hon. George P. Marsh a collection
of works of art—chiefly engravings—for the sum of $3,000, understood then to be
but a fraction of its cost, and which, owing to the great rise in the market value of
such things in the last fifty years, does not in the least represent its value to-day.
It is impossible to state what the present value of the collection is, without an
examination of the engravings and etchings, but experts that I have consulted say
that the rise in all good specimens of engraving and etching during the forty-seven
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

years which have elapsed since the purchase has been so great that if these had then
the value attributed to them they must be worth from five to ten times that amount
now, or even more.

Immediately after the fire at the Institution, in 1865, doubt was felt that the build-
ing was a place of safety, and a portion of the collection was transferred to the
Library of Congress, and in 1874 and 1879 other portions were lent to the newly
founded Corcoran Art Gallery. The transfer was with the express understanding
that they were there for deposit only, and to be reclaimed by the Regents at any
time.

A portion of the collection is identified by Mr. Spofford asin the charge of the
Library at the Capitol, except a few volumes and engravings which he hopes to find
at the time of the coming transfer to the new building. There is no question made
by the Corcoran Gallery about the fact of the engravings and etchings which they
have on deposit.

In view of the fact of the coming occupancy of the new Congressional Library,
in which it is expected that special quarters will be assigned to the Smithsonian
deposit, both for storing in the ‘‘ East Stack” of its now over 300,000 titles, and of
a suitable room for their consultation, and of the further fact that the Corcoran
Gallery will also shortly move into a new building, I have thought it might be
desirable for the Regents to take action looking to the reclamation of the engray-
ings, etchings, and other works of art.

This building has since been made fireproof, and recent changes have given it
_ Ineans of properly caring for these collections.

Senator Gray offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the question of the propriety of bringing the works of art belong-
ing to the Institution under thc more immediate control of the Board of Regents be
referred to the Executive Committee and the Secretary, with power to act.

The Secretary proceeded:

The charter of the Smithsonian Institution bears the date of August 10, 1846. For
some years the question has been under consideration how best to celebrate the com-
pletion of the first half century, and the matter was fuily discussed in 1893 with the
Executive Committee. It seems quite impracticable to arrange for a gathering of
delegates from other scientific institutions, such as are often held on similar occa-
sions by universities and academies of science. The simplest and most effective
means seems to be the publication of a suitable memorial volume, which should
give an account of the origin of the Institution, its achievements, and its present
condition.

Arrangements have been made, therefore, for the preparation of such a volume,
and the work is in an advanced state. The editorial supervision has been intrusted
to the Assistant Secretary, and a number of persons, eminent authorities in their own
specialties, have been inyited to contribute special chapters.

SMITHSON MEMORIAL TABLETS.
Continuing, the Secretary said:

in the same connection, I have, under the authority of the Regents, directed two
suitable bronze tablets to be set up at the burial place of Smithson, in Genoa—one
in the English Church and the other on his tomb.

SMITHSONIAN TABLE AT NAPLES.

The Secretary spoke of the Zoological Station at Naples, in connec-
tion with the Tables supported by foreign governments, and stated
that on the petition of American universities and scholars he had
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

paid, in 1893, $1,500 for the use of such a Table for three years, the
subscription expiring during the present year. He showed a petition
signed by the leading naturalists of the country asking that the Table
be continued. It had been the means of bringing the Institution into
closer relationship with colleges and universities throughout the coun-
try, and he was favorably inclined to the action. It was mentioned
now, not as needing any additional sanction from the Regents, but to
recall a matter of some possible interest to them, as the Institution
stood in this case in the same position as that occupied abroad by the
governments of such countries as Germany and Italy.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.
The Secretary resumed:

I do not think I have occasion to speak at length to the Regents about the inter-
ests of the different Government bureaus under their care, further than I have so
fully done in the report, but in regard to the need of larger quarters for the Museum,
and the dangerous character of the sheds used for storage purposes immediately
under the windows of the Smithsonian building, I ask the particular attention of
the Regents to the significant statement on page 5 of the report that no insurance
company will undertake to insure these shops, the property of the Institution, at
less than ten times the ordinary rate. They are under our walls, almost in contact
with them, and are a constant menace.

The Secretary added :

The complete remedy is to build the necessary quarters, but a partial remedy is
for Congress to give authority to lease warehouses in the vicinity for storage. The
present ones are choked with matter largely inflammable, and the condition can
hardly be worse or more dangerous than it is.

Many valuable gifts have been received during the year. A considerable number
of important scientific memoirs have been published, and many more are in prepa-
ration. More money and room are urgently needed, and the lack of these prevents
the proper utilization of the national collections.

Of the Bureau of Ethnology, I need only say that it has proceeded in its ordinary
path of usefulness under the efficient direction of Major Powell. I have myself,
however, used a certain unexpended balance in sending out an expedition under the
charge of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, which resulted in the exploration of a very inter-
esting ruin near the town of Moqui, the remains of a town which was destroyed by
hostile Indians before the first visit of the Spaniards. This is the first careful
exploration of a thoroughly pre-Columbian town site, and the collections obtained
throw much new light upon the customs of these ancient peoples. The collections,
it may be added, are of great intrinsic yalue, since the pottery is the finest that has
ever yet been exhumed, and the series obtained being monographic for a special
locality, is unequaled by any other of the kind in the world.

Ihave also authorized another expedition to investigate the Seri Indians, which
has been lately conducted to a successful issue by Mr. McGee.

THE BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.
The Secretary continued:

The Smithsonian numbers in the records of its Exchange Bureau about 24,000 cor-
respondents, scattered over the entire world.

The appropriation for the service is $17,000, and in addition an average of about
$3,000 a year has been received from Government bureaus and others for transporta-
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

tion of the exchanges. The service is not altogether satisfactory for lack of funds
to insure fast transportation. Reports and publications that should go promptly
are now compelled to wait because they are free freight. Nearly fifty years ago
some of the lines gave the Institution free transportation in the interest of ‘‘the dif-
fusion of knowledge.” This was once well enough, but the result now is that Goy-
ernment publications, which were not contemplated in the original gift, have to wait
till there is room which can not be used for paid freight. It is doubtful economy.

The United States Government, by treaty made at Brussels in 1886 and proclaimed
by thé President in 1889, is under obligation to maintain an exchange bureau. A
treaty was also nade at the same time for the immediate exchange of the parliamen-
tary proceedings of the countries concerned. For this no appropriation has been
made, though an estimate of the appropriation needed for the purpose, submitted
by me to the honorable the Secretary of State at his request, has been transmitted
by him in due form to Congress for action.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Proceeding, the Secretary said:

The park under the charge of the Regents is undoubtedly the finest natural site
for such a purpose in the immediate vicinity of any large capital, not only of this
country, but of Europe and the world. But comparatively little can be done under
an appropriation which is barely sufficient to police the park and keep alive and
safely house the animals there, without buying any new ones.

The Regents will remember that the park was intended originally for a national
rather than for a local purpose, and that the prominent feature of it was to be the
preservation of our native fauna from extinction. I want to ask the attention of
the Regents, and especially of those who can influence legislation in Congress, to a
paragraph in the report, on page 30, which, it seems to me, ought to be known to
Congress, and to call out some measure to relieve this threatened extinction. It is
popularly supposed that the remnant of the great body of bison which once covered
this continent is in safety in the Yellowstone Park, under Government control, but
the herd there is being so rapidly depleted that unless some measures are taken it
is doubtful if any will be left at the end of the present year. There is a stockade
there, put up at the expense of the Zoological Park appropriation, to hold those to
be sent to Washington preparatory to their transportation. None have yet occupied
it; but I think that unless the bison are transferred to this or to the Zoological Park
here, which has sufficient space for all that are left, the final extinction of all under
Government control, except the few already here, may be looked for in a few months
more.

The Secretary here read the letter of Captain Anderson, the Super-
intendent of the Yellowstone Park, as follows:

DECEMBER 12, 1895.

I can give you no definite information about the bison in the Hayden Valley, near
your corral. My scouting parties have reported the trails of several small bands
leading in that direction, but as the snowfall has been light they have not as yet
been driven to that narrow area. I do not expect to be able to get an accurate esti-
mate of their number before the latter part of January. I hope there are enough
remaining for a source of supply for your park, and if they can be inclosed the cost
of maintenance will be very small.

The reports made through the newspapers of the slaughter of the bison recently
are, of course, much exaggerated, but, unfortunately, several have been killed, I feel
pretty certain that ten were killed within the past four months. I have now in
custody in the guardhouse a man who was captured in possession of the scalps
of five.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XVII

I made a pretty thorough tour of their range in October last, and saw very few
signs. I am sure that I have heretofore overestimated their numbers. J doubtif
there are over fifty remaining, and these will not all winter in the Hayden Valley.
They increase but slowly under the best conditions, and here, where they are being
constantly pursued and where the winters are very severe, but small increase can be
looked for. Of course the stockade recently erected will be a great assistance in
their protection, if they can be secured within it.

All of the animals in the park are protected properly and are increasing, with the
exception of the bison, and of these it is difficult to predict as yet.

The Secretary resumed:

7

The park here is, however, fulfilling its functions as ‘‘the lungs of the city” and
for the ‘‘instruction and recreation of the people,” and no better evidence is needed
to corroborate this than the crowds which constantly visit it.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Concerning the Astrophysical Observatory, the Secretary said:

The Regents will remember that five years ago it was resolved: ‘‘ That if an appro-
priation should be made by Congress for the maintenance of an ‘astrophysical
observatory,’ under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, the Regents will
expend for this purpose, from moneys already donated to them, $10,000 for the con-
struction of buildings for said observatory, whenever a suitable site shall be desig-
nated by Congress and obtained for the purpose.” * * *

It was then anticipated that the first step to be taken by Congress in the matter
would be the provision of a suitable site. Congress, however, saw fit to make the
appropriation in terms which provided for the scientific work of an observatory
already in progress, and in order to utilize this appropriation, which would other-
wise have had to be returned to the Treasury, the temporary and inadequate quarters
in the sheds immediately behind the Smithsonian building were provided in 1890.

Ihave had too much personal concern with the work which has been done there
not to perhaps speak of it with a friendly bias, but if I may believe the expressions
of men of science competent in this matter, hardly any more important work in the
spectrum has been done in the century than has been going on and is still going on
here under the Smithsonian Institution, though under such disadvantageous con-
ditions.

Briefly, this research is giving us a knowledge of nearly thrice the amount of the
details of the solar energy that were known to Sir Isaac Newton, and in a region
which remained almost untouched since he left it until our own day, when these
researches took it up.

As has been stated in previous reports, there is an element of uncertainty in the
results, due to the fact that they are all obtained through an excessively delicate
instrument which registers minute vibrations set up by the sun, but which also regis-
ters (whether we will or no) vibrations coming from local causes, such as the tremor
of the ground, which always exists, however imperceptible to the ordinary sense, in
the midst of a great city. There are ways of discriminating between these true and
false effects, but the latter can hardly be eliminated - certainly not in very many
years of labor—in the present altogether unfit site, whereas the work already sketched
out could be pushed to successful conclusion and publication in a single twelvemonth
in a quiet locality.

In view of the delay in providing a site for a building, the Secretary has already
been authorized by a subsequent resolution of the Regents to expend the sum of
$10,000 bequeathed by J. H. Kidder and given by Alexander Graham Bell ‘‘in direc-
tions consonant with the known wishes of the testator and the donor,” but little of it
has been used; and unless some remedy is found against the tremor incident to this bad

site, it is contemplated to expend it during the coming year in a new installation, 1n
casé a suitable site can be obtained by Congressional action, such as on the old
Nayal Observatory grounds, or otherwise. The expenditure of this relatively small
sum will, it is hoped, provide the requisite indispensable buildings, which will be of
a very modest character.

On motion, the Secretary’s report was accepted.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, it was moved and carried—

That the recommendations in the Secretary’s report be referred to the Executive
Committee, with power to act.

Senator Henderson presented the report of the Executive Committee
for the year ending June 30, 1895.

On motion, the report was adopted.

Senator Henderson introduced the following customary resolution
relative to income and expenditure:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal yearending June 30, 1897,
bo appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secretary,
with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part of the
Secretary as to items.

On motion, the resolution was adopted.

The Secretary then read letters—

From the master of Pembroke (Smithson’s College), Oxford, thanking
the Institution for a set of its publications and asking for a portrait of
Smithson.

From the Royal Institution of Great Britain, returning thanks for a
portrait of Mr. Hodgkins.

From Mrs. J. C. Welling, for a copy of the resolutions passed by the
board on the death of Dr. Welling.

There being no further business to come before the board, on motion
it adjourned.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

FoR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1896.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Institution, the appropriations by Con-
gress, and the receipts and expenditures for the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the United States National Museum, the International Exchanges,
the Bureau of Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
Physical Observatory for the year ending June 30, 1896, and balances
of former years:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Condition of the Fund July 1, 1896.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to act of Congress of August
10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added by authority of Congress,
February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson and savings from
income and other sources to the amount of $154,831.

To this also have been added a bequest from James Hamilton, of
Pennsylvania, of $1,000; a bequest of Dr. Simeon Habel, of New York,
of $500; the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds, $51,500; a gift
from Thomas G. Hodgkins, of New York, of $200,000 and $8,000, being
a portion of the residuary legacy of Thomas G. Hodgkins, and $1,000,
the accumulated interest on the Hamilton bequest, making in all, as
the permanent fund, $912,000.

The Institution also holds the additional sum of $42,000, received
upon the death of Thomas G. Hodgkins, in registered West Shore Rail-
road 4 per cent bonds, which were, by order of this committee, under
date of May 18, 1894, placed in the hands of the Secretary of the Insti-

tution, to be held by him subject to the conditions of said order.

were, therefore, $62,330.96, or $6,474.61 less than the gross expenditures,
$68,805.57, as above stated.

All moneys received by the Smithsonian Institution from interest,
sales, refunding of moneys temporarily advanced, or otherwise, are
deposited with the Treasurer of the United States to the credit of the
Secretary of the Institution, and all payments are made by his checks
on the Treasurer of the United States.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTER. XLUI

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1896, each of
which bears the approval of the Secretary, or, in his absence, of the
acting secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bond approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

OMAHA EXPOSITION.

Cuap. 402.—An Act To anthorize and encourage the holding of a transmississipp1
and international exposition at the city of Omaha, in the State of Nebraska, in the
year eighteen hundred and ninety-eight.
Whereas it is desirable to encourage the holding of a transmississippi

aud international exposition at the city of Omaha, in the State of

Nebraska, in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, for the

exhibition of the resources of the United States of America and the

progress and civilization of the Western Hemisphere, and for a display
of the arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mine, and
sea; and

Whereas it is desirable that an exhibition shall be made of the great
staples of the transmississippi region which coutributes so largely to
domestic and international commerce; and

Whereas encouragement should be given to an exhibit of the arts,
industries, manufactures, and products, illustrative of the progress and
development of that and other sections of the country; and

Whereas such exhibition should be national as well as international
in its character, in which the people of this country, of Mexico, the
Central and South American Governments, and other States of the
world should participate, and should, therefore, have the sanction of
the Congress of the United States; and

Whereas it is desirable and will be highly beneficial to bring together
at such an exposition, to be held at a central position in the western
part of the United States, the people of the United States and other
States of this continent; and

Whereas the Transmississippi and International Exposition Associa-
tion has undertaken to hold such exposition, beginning on the first day
of June, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and closing on the first
day of November, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight: Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That a transmississippi and
international exposition shall be held at the city of Omaha, in the State
of Nebraska, in the year eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, under the
auspices of the Transmississippi aud International Exposition Associa-
tion: Provided, That the United States shall not be liable for any of
the expense attending or incident to such exposition, nor by reason of
the same. -

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1896.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the
operations of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30,
1896, including the work placed by Congress under its supervision in
the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Bureau of Interna-
tional Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical
Observatory.

I have, as is customary, given briefly in the body of the report an
account of the affairs of the Institution and of its bureaus for the year,
reserving for the appendix the more detailed reports from those in
charge of the different branches of work.

The full report upon the National Museum by the assistant secre-
tary, Dr. G. Brown Goode, occupies a separate volume (Report of the
Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, 1896).

SM 96—1 1
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 22, 1896, at 10
o'clock a.m. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto,
in the annual report of the Board to Congress, though reference is
made later on in this report to several matters upon which action was
taken at that meeting.

On December 18, 1895, Senator S. M. Cullom, of Illinois, was reap-
pointed Regent by the President of the Senate, and on December 20,
1895, the Speaker of the House reappointed Hon. Joseph Wheeler, of
Alabama, and Hon. R. R. Hitt, of Illinois, and appointed Hon. Robert
Adams, jr., of Pennsylvania. Hon. William L. Wilson, of West Vir-
ginia, a former Regent, was again appointed by joint resolution of Con-
gress, approved by the President January 14, 1896, as suecessor to the
late Dr. Coppée.

The Board elected Hon. William L. Wilson and Hon. Gardiner G.
Hubbard as members of the executive committee, with Hon. J. B. Hen-
derson as chairman. :

Formal action in memory of Dr. Coppée, who died on March 21, 1895,
was taken by the Regents at the above meeting, when the following
resolutions were unanimously adopted:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution are called to mourn the death of their colleague, the late
Henry Coppée, LL.D., acting president of Lehigh University, for
twenty years a Regent of the Institution, and long a member of its
executive committee:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents feel sincere sorrow in the loss
of one whose distinguished career as a soldier, a man of letters, and
whose services in the promotion of education command their highest
respect and admiration.

Resolved, That in the death of Dr. Coppée the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the Board of Regents have suffered the loss of a tried and
valued friend, a wise and prudent counsellor, whose genial courtesy,
well-stored, disciplined mind, and sincere devotion to the interests of
the Institution will be ever remembered.

Resolved, That these resolutions be recorded in the Journal of the
Proceedings of the Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send
a copy to the family of their departed associate and friend, in token of
sympathy in this common affliction.

ADMINISTRATION.

I have already remarked that the expenses borne by the Institution
incidental to its administration of Government trusts are not spe-
cifically provided for by any of the present appropriations, and that I
deemed it in the interest of economy that an appropriation be asked to
cover these items, which can not be done under their present terms,
but no decisive action has as yet been taken in this matter.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

On June 16 the President of the United States directed that the
classified civil service be extended to include the ‘several bureaus of
the Smithsonian Institution, and in accordance therewith the employees
of the National Museum, Zoological Park, Bureau of Exchanges,
Bureau of Ethnology, and Astrophysical Observatory were, on June
30, 1896, made subject to the civil service rules.

FINANCES.

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows:

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming a
part of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of
the properties of atmospherie air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the fun-
damental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, sech sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift,
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion
of the purposes thereof.

Under this section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, modified as above
noted, the fund of $912,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the United
States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest alone
being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

At the beginning of the fiscal year July 1, 1895, the unexpended
balance from the income and from other sources, as stated in my report
for last year, was $63,001.74. Interest on the permanent fund in the
Treasury and elsewhere, amounting to $56,395, was received during
the year, which, together with a sum of $6,474.61 received from the
sale of publications and from miscellaneous sources, made the total
receipts $62,869.61.

The entire expenditures during the year, including $11,000 paid for
prizes awarded from the Hodgkins fund, in accordance with the recom-
mendation of the award committee, and referred to in my last report,
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

amounted to $68,805.57, for the details of which reference is made to
the report of the executive committee. On June 30, 1896, the balance
in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Secretary for
the expenses of the Institution was $57,065.78, which includes the sum
of $10,000 referred to in previous reports, $5,000 received from the
estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell, the latter a gift made personally to the Secretary to promote cer-
tain physical researches. This latter sum was, with the donor’s con-
sent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds of the
Institution.

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations, besides
relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which may be
expected to mature as the result of different scientific investigations or
publications in progress.

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the
fiscal year 1895-96, of the following appropriations:

reported in accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of
October 2, 1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined, and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together

The crowded condition of the National Museum will be somewhat
relieved by the addition of galleries provided for under an appropria-
tion of $8,000 made by the last Congress, but there is still an extremely
urgent need for a new building, as stated more fully on a subsequent
page. There was also granted an additional appropriation for rent
of storage rooms and workshops for the Museum.

RESEARCH.

The time of the Secretary is almost wholly given to administrative
duties, although in the original plan of the Institution he was expected
by the Regents to personally contribute to the advancement of knowl-
edge.' The Secretary has continued to give what opportunities he could
spare from the administrative duties and what he could contribute
from his private hours to the investigations which have already been
referred to in previous reports.

The first of these, upon the solar spectrum, has been carried on at the
Astrophysical Observatory, and to this reference is made more at length
in another part of this report.

The second, beginning as an investigation of certain physical data of
aerodynamics, has arrived at an important stage in its development.

The possibility of mechanical flight was, until a comparatively few
years ago, considered a visionary one by most men of science. The
writer, who was led to an opposite conclusion, and who had commenced
experiments before he became connected with the Institution, published
under its auspices in 1891 a treatise entitled ‘Experiments in aerody-
namics,” which gave the results of direct experiment on the pressure
of the air on inclined surfaces, showing that rules hitherto relied on,
partly on the faith of the great name of Sir Isaac Newton, were not in
fact supported by a direct study of nature. These new experiments
gave evidence that mechanical flight—that is, not of balloons, but of
bodies heavier than air, impelled and supported by power—was at least
theoretically possible. This, however, was not saying that such machines
could be launched into the air and made to continue a horizontal course
or to descend to the ground with safety, matters to be determined by
trial and further experiment.

' Resolved, That the Secretary continue his researches in physical science, and pre-

sent such facts and principles as may be developed, for publication in the Smith-
sonian Contributions. Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents, January
26, 1847.
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The writer has, during the intervals of his official duties, continued
to experiment in this manner, until he has reached a measure of success
which seems to justify him in making the statement here that mechan-
ical flight has now been attained.

On the 6th of May last a mechanism built chiefly of steel and driven
by a steam engine made two flights each of over half a mile.’ In each
case the process was wholly mechanical, there being no support from
gas, but on the contrary the machine being a thousand or more times
heavier than the air in which it was made to move. Of the first of these
flights I beg to give a statement by an eyewitness, Mr. Alexander
Graham Bell, which was communicated in French to the Académie des
Sciences of the Institut de France, and which appeared as follows in
Nature:

EXPERIMENTS IN MECHANICAL FLIGHT.

I have been for some years engaged in investigations connected with aerodromic
problems, and particularly with the theoretical conditions of mechanical flight. A
portion of these have been published by me under the titles, ‘‘ Experiments in aero-
dynamics” and ‘‘The internal work of the wind,” but I have not hitherto at any
time described any actual trials in artificial flight.

With regard to the latter, I have desired to experiment until I reached a solution
of the mechanical difficulties of the problem, which consist, it must be understood,
not only in sustaining a heavy body in the air by mechanical means (although this
difficulty is alone great), but also in the automatic direction of it in a horizontal and
rectilinear course. ‘These difficulties have so delayed the work that in view of the
demands upon my time, which render it uncertain how far I can personally conduct
these experiments to the complete conclusion I seek, I have been led to authorize
some account of the degree of success which has actually been attained, more par-
ticularly at the kind request of my friend, Mr. Alexander Graham Bell, who has
shown me a letter which he will communicate to you. In acceding to his wish, and
while I do not at present desire to enter into details, let me add that the acrodrome,
or “‘flying machine” in question, is built chiefly of steel, and that it is not supported
by any gas, or by any means but by its steam engine. This is of between i and 2
horsepower, and it weighs, including fire grate, boilers, and every moving part, less
than 7pounds. This engine is employed in turning aerial propellers which move the
aerodrome forward, so that it is sustained by the reaction of the air under its sup-
porting surfaces.

I should, in further explanation of what Mr. Bell has said, add that owing to the
small scale of construction no means have been provided for condensing the steam after
it has passed through the engine, and that, owing to the consequent waste of water,
the aerodrome has no means of sustaining itself in the air for more than a very short
time—a difficulty which does not present itself in a larger construction, where the
water can be condensed and used over again. The flights described, therefore, were

necessarily brief.
S. P. LANGLEY.

Through the courtesy of Mr. S. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, I have had on various occasions the privilege of witnessing his experiments
with aerodromes, and especially the remarkable success attained by bim in experi-
ments, made on the Potomac River on Wednesday, May 6, which led me to urge him
to make public some of these results.

J had the pleasure of witnessing the successful flight of some of these aerodromes
more than a year ago, but Professor Langley’s reluctance to make the results public

'Since the preparation of this report this result has been nearly doubled.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. q

at that time prevented me from asking him, as I have done since, to let me give an
account of what I saw.

On the date named, two ascensions were made by the aerodrome, or so-called
“flying machine,” which I will not describe here further than to say that it appeared
tome to be built almost entirely of metal, and driven by a steam engine which I
have understood was carrying fuel and a water supply for a very brief period, and
which was of extraordinary lightness.

The absolute weight of the aerodrome, including that of the engine and all appur-
tenances, was, as I was told, about 25 pounds, and the distance, from tip to tip, of
the supporting surfaces was, as I observed, about 12 or 14 feet.

Tho method of propulsion was by aerial screw propellers, and there was no gas or
other aid for lifting it in the air except its own internal energy.

On the occasion referred to, the aerodrome, at a given signal, started from a plat-
form about 20 feet above the water, and rose at first directly in the face of the wind,
moving at all times with remarkable steadiness, and subsequently swinging around
in large curves of, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter, and continually ascending
until its steam was exhausted, when, at a lapse of about a minute and a half, and at
a height which I judged to be between 80 and 100 feet in the air, the wheels ceased
turning, and the machine, deprived of the aid of its propellers, to my surprise did
not fall, but settled down so softly and gently that it touched the water without the
least shock, and was in fact immediately ready for another trial.

In the second trial, which followed directly, it repeated in nearly every respect the
actions of the first, except that the direction of its course was different. It ascended
again in the face of the wind, afterwards moving steadily and continually in large
curves accompanied with a rising motion and a lateral advance. Its motion was, in
fact, so steady that I think a glass of water on its surface would have remained
unspilled. When the steam gave out again, it repeated for a second time the expe-
rience of the first trial when the steam had ceased, and settled gently and easily
down. What height it reached at this trial I can not say, as I was not so favorably
placed as in the first; but I had occasion to notice that this time its course took it
over a wooded promontory, and I was relieved of some apprehension in seeing that
it was already so high as to pass the tree tops by 20 or 30 feet. It reached the water
one minute and thirty-one seconds from the time it started, at a measured distance
of over 900 feet from the point at which it rose.

This, however, was by no means the length of its flight. I estimated from the
diameter of the curve described, from the number of turns of the propellers as given
by the automatic counter, after due allowance for slip, and from other measures, that
the actual length of flight on each occasion was slightly over 3,000 feet. It is at least
safe to say that each exceeded half an English mile.

From the time and distance it will be noticed that the velocity was between 20 and
25 miles an hour, in a course which was constantly taking it “‘up hill.” I may add
that on a previous occasion I have seen a far higher velocity attained by the same
aerodrome when its course was horizontal.

Ihave no desire to enter into detail further than I have done, but I can not but
add that it seems to me that no one who was present on this interesting occasion
could have failed to recognize that the practicability of mechanical flight had been
demonstrated.

ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL.
I do not know how far interest in this work may bias my judgment,
but it appears to me that in these things, whose final accomplishment
has come under the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, it has made
a contribution to the utilities of the world which will be memorable.

The results of Prof. E. W. Morley’s investigations on the density of
oxygen and hydrogen, referred to at length in my last report, have been
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

printed, as have also those of Drs. Billings and Mitchell. The valuable
researches of the latter gentlemen are being continued under an addi-
tional grant.

The subscription for the Astronomical Journal has been continued.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Institution has continued to carry on ethnological and natural
history explorations during the year, to which reference is made in the
reports of the Bureau of Ethnology. I may call special attention to
the explorations among the cliff dwellings of Arizona by Dr. Fewkes,
and in the territory of the Seri Indians in Mexico by Mr. McGee, as
also on the western coast of Florida by F. H. Cushing, where abundant
relics of the prehistoric age were discovered. Dr. William L. Abbott
has continued his contributions of natural history and ethnological
specimens collected by him in Africa and Asia.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Institution include the Contributions to
Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual Reports, the
first two being printed at the expense of the Institution, while the
reports are Government documents. Various publications are also
issued by the National Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology, to which
allusion is elsewhere made.

Contributions to Knowledge.-—Three volumes of the Contributions
were completed during the year, and two separate memoirs. Volumes
XXX and X XXI were the text and plates of an exhaustive illustrated
work by Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, entitled
“Oceanic ichthyology,” being a treatise on the deep-sea and pelagic
fishes of the world. '

Volume XXXII, on “Life histories of North American birds, parrots
to grackles,” by Maj. Charles Bendire, U.S. A., is a second contribu-
tion on this subject, the first volume, including gallinaceous birds,
pigeons or doves, and birds of prey, having been published by the
Institution several years ago.

The memoir by Prof. E. W. Morley on the density of oxygen and
hydrogen was published early in the year in a volume of 117 pages,
and has been reprinted in full in Zeitschrift fur Physikalische Chemie,
a duplicate set of blocks of the illustrations having been sent to the
publishers at their request. In this memoir Professor Morley describes
in detail the methods employed in his investigations and illustrates
the apparatus employed. The atomic weight of oxygen was studied
by two methods: (1) The synthesis of water, in which he achieved com-
pleteness by actually weighing the hydrogen, the oxygen, and the water
formed; and (2) by the density ratio between oxygen and hydrogen.
By both methods he reached the same result: O=15,879, with variation
in the fourth decimal place as between the two.

The results of the investigation by Drs. Billings, Mitchell, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

Bergey on the composition of expired air was published as a memoir
in the Contributions, forming a volume of 81 pages.

Two memoirs submitted in competition for the Hodgkins fund prizes
were in press but not ready for distribution at the close of the year.
One of these was by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay announcing
the discovery of argon and describing the methods of the investigation
leading to their discovery of that new element of the atmosphere. For
this achievement the authors were awarded the first prize of $10,000.

_ The second memoir was on atmospheric actinometry, by Prof. Emile
Duclaux, for which the author was awarded honorable mention.

Miscellaneous Collections.—In this series two works were completed
and four put to press during the fiscal year. The completed publica-
tions were Part II of the Index of the Genera and Species of the
Foraminifera, by Charles Davies Sherborn, and a revised edition of
the Smithsonian Meteorological Tables. The publications in press
are the Smithsonian Physical Tables, by Prof. Thomas Gray; an
illustrated description of the Mountain Observatories of the World,
by Prof. E. 8S. Holden; a paper by Dr. D. H. Bergey, on Methods of
Determination of Organic Matter in Air, and an exhaustive Catalogue
of Scientific and Technical Periodicals of the World, from 1665 to 1895,
compiled by Dr. Bolton.

The prize essay on “ Air and life,” by Dr. Varigny, as also some of
the other essays submitted in the Hodgkins prize competition, have
been put to press and will be issued during the next year.

There is also in preparation a supplement to Bolton’s Bibliography
of Chemistry, an Index of Mineral Springs of the World, by Professor
Tuckerman, and arecaleulation of atomic weights, by Prof. Ff. W. Clarke.

The usual separate edition has been issued of the several papers in
the General Appendix of the Annual Report.

Annual Reports.—The Smithsonian Annual Report is in two volumes,
the first devoted to the Institution proper and the second relating to
the National Museum. The General Appendix of Part I consists of
selected memoirs which have for the most part already appeared else-
where, but which are of such special interest and permanent value as
to appear worthy of republication by the Institution in the ‘increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

The report for 1894 was delivered by the printer after the close of the
fiscal year and some progress had been made on the report for 1895.

Proceedings and bulletin of the National Museum.—The publications
of the Museum are mentioned in Appendix I, and need not be referred
to here further than to say that the several papers of volume 18 of
the Proceedings were published in pamphlet form, and that Bulletin
47, on the Fishes of North and Middle America, by Dr. Jordan and
Professor Evermann, were nearly ready for distribution.

Bureau of Ethnology publications.—The Thirteenth Annual Report of
the Bureau of Ethnology was distributed during the year, and the
10 ‘REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

manuscript of the fourteenth, filteenth, and sixteenth reports had been
transmitted to the Public Printer.

LIBRARY.

in my last report I pointed out that the lists prepared in accordance
with the plans formulated by the Secretary, detailed in my report for
1887-88, had all been written for.

In further continuance of this work, which is never ee I have
accordingly employed the new manuscript list of the learned societies-
of the world in the Bureau of International Exchanges. Letters
have been written with the gratifying result that 299 new exchanges
were entered into, and 155 defective series were entirely or partially
completed.

Ithas been the policy of the Institution from its inception to endeavor
to have as complete a set as possible of the transactions of learned
societies and periodicals, and it is my desire that this collection should
continue to be as complete as the resources of the Institution render
possible.

The project of the Royal Society for the preparing of a bibliography
of science, beginning with the year 1900, referred to in my report for
1895, resulted in the calling by the British Government of a biblio-
graphical conference in London in July, 1596. An invitation to send
delegates to the conference was extended to the United States, along
with the other nations which it was presumed were interested.

The matter having been referred to me by the Secretary of State, I
had much pleasure in suggesting that the United States participate in
the conference, and in recommending Dr. John S. Billings, United
States Army, retired, director of the New York Public Library, and
Prof. Simon Newcomb, United States Navy, Superintendent of the
Nautical Almanac, as the delegates on behalf of the United States.
There is reason to hope that most fruitful results will proceed from
this conference.

The revised edition of the Catalogue of Scientific and Technical
Periodicals (1665-1882), published by the Institution in 1885, which I
stated in my last report was being brought down to 1895, is now com-
pleted and in the hands of the printer. It is expected that it will be
issued during the course of the coming year. Like the first edition, it
has been prepared under the direction of Dr. H. C. Bolton.

It is confidently expected that the new building of the Library of
Congress will be completed during the coming year, and that adequate
provision will be made for the reception of the Smithsonian deposit,
and a special reading room provided.

HODGKINS FUND,

As stated in my last report, the prizes offered by the Institution for
important discoveries in connection with the composition of atmos-

pheric air, and for essays on the air in relation to human life and
health, resulted in the award of the first prize of $10,000 to Lord Ray-
leigh and Prof. William Ramsay for their discovery of argon, a new
element of the atmosphere. The prize of $1,000 for the best popular
essay was awarded to Dr. Henry de Varigny, of Paris, for his essay
on ‘Air and life.”

Six of the papers submitted in competition for the prizes were
awarded honorable mention, together with medals, as announced in
my last report. The design for the medal is by M. J. C. Chaplain, of
Paris, a member of the French Academy and one of the most eminent
medalists of the world. The obverse bears a female figure carrying a
torch in her left hand and in her right a seroll, emblematic of Knowl-
edge, and the words ‘‘ Per orbem.” The reverse is adapted from the
seal of the Institution, designed by St. Gaudens, the map of the world
being replaced by the words ‘“‘ Hodgkins medal,” as is shown in the
accompanying illustrations, which are the size of the original. The
medals were struck at the Paris mint.

Dr. J. S. Billings and Dr. 8. Weir Mitchell having completed their
investigations on the composition of expired air and its effects on animal
life, their report has been published as a Memoir of the Contributions
to Knowledge. The investigators found that the air in inhabited rooms,
such as the hospital ward in which experiments were made, is contam-
inated from many sources besides the expired air of the occupants, and
that the most important of these contaminations are in the form of
minute particles or dusts, in which there are micro-organisms, including
some of the bacteria which produce inflammatory and suppurative dis-
orders. It is probable that these dust particles are the only really
dangerous elements in the air, and the important conclusion is reached
that it appears improbable that there is any peculiar volatile poisonous
matter in the air expired by healthy men and animals other than car-
bonic acid.

An additional grant has been made to Drs. Billings and Mitchell to
continue other lines of investigation, especially whether the long-
continued breathing of air rendered impure by respiration or by
volatile exhalations from the skin and mucous membranes increases
the susceptibility to infection by certain micro-organisms, especially
those which are now considered to be the specific causes of consump-
tion and croupous pneumonia, the diseases which are most fatal in
crowded and ill-ventilated rooms.

THE AVERY FUND.

The property devised to the Institution by the late Robert Stanton
Avery, of Washington City, consists of lots on Capitol Hill, some
improved by dwelling houses, and certain personal property, chiefly
represented by securities of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company.

The real estate is of an assessed District valuation of $28,931, and
the personal property, at its present market quotation, and after

deducting a legacy to Miss Julia N. Avery, is estimated to be valued
at between $6,000 and $7,000.

SMITHSONIAN HALF-CENTURY MEMORIAL.

The act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution was
signed by President Polk, August 10, 1846, and the first meeting of the
Board of Regents was held on September 7 of that year. In view of
the completion of the first half century, I discussed with the executive
committee, as far back as 1893, the best method of celebrating this
event. It seemed quite impracticable to arrange for a gathering of
delegates from other scientific institutions, such as is often held on
similar occasions by universities and academies of science. The simplest
and most effective means of commemorating the event appeared to be
the publication of a suitable memorial volume, which should give an
account of the institution, its history, its achievements, and its present
condition.

The late Dr. G. Brown Goode, whose acquaintance with the history of
the Institution was unrivaled, drew up a comprehensive plan for the
volume. This plan being settled upon, Dr. James C. Welling, having
at that time just retired from the presidency of Columbian University,
agreed to undertake the editorial supervision of the volume. His
death seemed to put a stop to the proposed work, for there appeared to
be no one sufficiently acquainted with the history of the Institution who
had the ability, the willingness, and the leisure to undertake this very
considerable task. It was then that Dr. Goode told me of his great
desire to undertake the work. Knowing how numerous his duties
already were, I at first refused, and it was only at his earnest solicitation
that I agreed to his editorial supervision of the volume.

At the time of his death the manuscript was so far advanced as to
render possible its completion for the press and publication upon the
lines he laid down. He had not only written many of the chapters
himself and made arrangements for the illustrations, but had almost
settled with the printers, as to the style of the type and form of the
page, and other details of the book. While its appearance has been
slightly delayed, I feel able to say that the volume will be published
early in 1897, and it is sufficiently advanced to allow the statement that
the editorial work is Dr. Goode’s, and to express the confidence that it
will be found as worthy of the Institution as was every other task ever
intrusted to his hands.

The volume will be a royal octavo of about 750 pages and will be
printed from type in an edition of 2,000, with 250 additional copies
on hand made paper. The scope of Part Lis indicated by the following
chapters:

CORRESPONDENCE.

Tn addition to the very voluminous routine and business correspond-
ence of the National Museum, or special correspondence of the Bureau
of Ethnology, of the Zoological Park, and of the Bureau of Exchanges,
a constantly increasing number of letters come directly to the Secre-
tary’s office from all parts of the country, on every imaginable subject
that can by any possibility be supposed to have a relation to science.
Requests for statistics that may be of great value and importance to
the writer, inquiries from teachers and others, are constantly received,
and it is still my aim that this correspondence shall receive the same
careful attention that was bestowed upon it in the early days of the
Institution, when the number of letters formed but a small fraction
of those received at present; but it will be understood that the fulfill-
ment of this aim grows increasingly difficult. An effort is made to
give a full reply to all such inquiries, often involving a large amount
of labor on the part of the curators, as well as of those immediately
occupied with the correspondence of the Institution, out of proportion
to the merits of the case.

Of the more important correspondence of the Secretary’s office, 3,788
entries were made in the registry book of letters received during the
year, while double that number of letters were received and referred to
the different bureaus of the Institution in the same time.

The card index of letters received and written is now complete from
January 1, 1892, to the present day, constituting the current file. The
correspondence prior to the current file has been placed in the
archives, and the index to the files is now practically complete.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Naples tables.—The Institution has renewed for three years the lease
of the Smithsonian Table at the Naples Zoological Station, and the
facilities thus afforded have proved of value to the investigators who
have carried on biological studies there during the year. Dr. J. 8.
Billings, U. 8. A., Dr. E. B. Wilson, Dr. C. W. Stiles, and Dr. Harrison
Allen have continued valuable aid in examining the testimonials of
applicants for the occupancy of the Naples table, as well as in the con-
sideration of various questions in connection with the assignment of
the table, to which I have asked attention.

Among the numerous additional applications for occupancy of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

table the following have been favorably acted upon: W. T. Swingle,
B. Se., Kansas State Agricultural College, 1890, assistant pathologist,
United States Department of Agriculture, appointed for two months in
the winter of 1895-96; and I’. M. McFarland, professor of biology and
geology, Olivet College, Michigan, assistant professor of histology,
Leland Stanford Junior University, appointed for three months during
the spring and summer of 1896. Prof. L. Murbach, who occupied the
table for two months in 1894, has submitted a memoir entitled ‘“‘Obser-
vations on the development and migration of the urticating organs of
sea nettles, Cnidaria,” which has been published in the Proceedings
of the United States National Museum.

The table has been occupied constantly since October 1, 1893, the
date of the first appointment, with the exception of May, 1894. In
several instances Dr. Dohrn, the director of the station, has courteously
arranged for the accommodation of two occupants at the same time.

In order that all investigators may be given an equal opportunity to
avail themselves of the facilities for study at Naples, final action upon
applications is not taken more than six months in advance of the date
for which the table is desired, and when more than one application is
filed for the same period, presumably of equal merit, the assignment
is made according to priority of application. No appointment is made
for a period of more than six months.

Art collection—The fundamental act creating the Institution, in enum-
erating its functions, apparently considers it first as a kind of gallery
of art, and declares that all objects of art and of foreign and curious
research the property of the United States shall be.delivered to the
Regents, and only after this adds that objects of natural history shall
be so, also.

The scientific side of the Institution’s activities has been in the past
so much greater than its esthetic that it is well to recall the fact that it
was intended by Congress to be a curator of the national art, and that
this function has never been forgotten, though often in abeyance.

In 1849 Secretary Henry, in pursuance of this function of an institu-
tion which in his own words existed for ‘‘the true, the beautiful, as well
as for the immediately practical,” purchased of the Hon. George P.
Marsh a collection of works of art, chiefly engravings, of much artistic
merit and now of great commercial value. <A portion of this collection
Was some years ago deposited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art and in the
Library of Congress, subject to recall by the Regents at any time. In
accordance with the terms of the deposit some of these objects have
already been returned to the Institution.

A collection of etchings and engravings was during the past year
presented to the Institution by Mr. Charles William Sherborn, of
London.

Atlanta Hxposition.—Under the provisions of an appropriation made
by Congress for a Government exhibit at the Cotton States and Inter-
national Exposition at Atlanta, during the autumn of 1895, a very
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

satisfactory exhibit was prepared, illustrating every phase of the
activities of the Institution and its bureaus, especially the National
Museum. A detailed description will be printed in the Museum Report
for 1896.

Zoological congress.—Dr. Charles W. Stiles, honorary curator in the
National Museum, was nominated by me, and appointed by the Secre-
tary of State, as United States representative at the International
Zoological Congress at Leyden, Holland, in September, 1895, and Dr.
Herbert Haviland Field was appointed as a second delegate to the same
congress. Dr. Stiles reports that 232 members attended the congress,
representing 22 nationalities. The business of greatest international
importance accomplished was the adoption of resolutions (1) establish-
ing a central bureau of bibliography for zoology, (2) appointing an
international commission upon the code of nomenclature, and (3) in
favor of the repeal of the section of the present internationai postal
laws which prohibits the sending of ‘‘animals living or dead” through
the international mails. Committees were appointed in accordance
with the provisions of these resolutions.

The Smithson Memorial tablets.—The bronze tablets mentioned in my
last report have been completed and will be placed on Smithson’s tomb
and in the English church at Genoa, in memory of the founder of the
Smithsonian Institution. The tablets, which measure 40 by 28 inches,
were designed by Mr. William Ordway Partridge, of New York City.
They bear a portrait of James Smithson, surrounded by a wreath and
on either side a torch, and beneath is the legend “James Smithson, F.
Rh. 8., founder of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington; erected by
the Regents of the Institution, 1896.” The accompanying illustration
of the tablets is from a photograph of the plaster model.

American Historical Association.—The annual report of the American
Historical Association for the year 1895 was transmitted to Congress
through the Secretary of the Institution, in accordance with the act of
incorporation of the association. These reports are Congressional docu-
ments, and the Institution has had no control of their distribution.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The museum of the Smithsonian Institution, which was formed in
part and for a time entirely maintained at the expense of the Smithson
fund, was the nucleus of the present National Museum, to which the
tegents have continued to contribute matter especially under their
charge, so that the Institution has in it a large pecuniary interest, and
has always maintained with it, on account of this history and owner-
ship, relationships of a more intimate kind than with some bureaus
which have not been at one time a part of itself.

Ever since 1858 Congress has appropriated money for the mainte-
nance of the Museum, but it has scarcely made any special appropriation
for the improvement of the collections by purchase, so that in respect

to the means at disposal for this it has been almost at the foot of all
American museums, being surpassed by every municipal museum of note.

In the earlier years of the Museum this was not of very great moment,
as numerous American natural-history specimens came in from the
various Government expeditions. It became evident later that for a
proper understanding of native products it was necessary to compare
them with those of other parts of the world. To obtain these exotic
specimens no adequate means have ever been provided, and it is not to
be expected that valuable, specially-selected specimens from foreign
lands will ever be procured in large numbers except by purchase or by
the sending out of expeditions.

The result of years of accumulation unsupported by purchases has
been that the collections of the National Museum are very unsymmetri-
cal—full and rich in some directions, especially in North American
natural history, surpassing all other museums, and exceedingly poor
in others.

In the meanwhile museums have sprung up in some of the large
cities of the United States, with liberal means for the acquisition of
Specimens by purchase and the sending out of expeditions, and these
are outstripping the National Museum in many of its departments by
the wealth of their collections.

From such causes the National Museum, while truly national in the
sense of possessing very full collections of the natural products of the
United States, maintains, with increasing difficulty, its supremacy in
this special respect over the wealthier private museums, and compares
very unfavorably, as regards the breadth of its collections, with the
national museums of Europe—in London, Paris, Berlin, St. Peters-
burg, Vienna, and Florence.

I called attention to this matter in a former report when I remarked
that the American Museum of Natural History in New York expended
$23,552.89, in 1892, for filling out its natural-history collections alone,
while the National Museum in the fiscal year 1892-93 expended only
$5,769.75 for specimens of all kinds.

The discrepancy has grown greater in succeeding years. In the
past fiscal year, for example, the National Museum expended $3,336
for all collections, while the expenditures of the American Museum of
Natural History, for acquiring natural-history collections alone, were
$41,959.65, or fully thirteen times as much as expended by the National
Museum, although the total amount of money available for the two
was not greatly different, that for the National Museum being in fact
the larger.

The causes of this discrepancy are not far to seek. The income of
the local museum is usually devotable wholly to its collections (which
in the case cited are housed in adequate buildings) and to their increase
and care, which include the services of officers and employees in charge
of them and who are devoted only to them.

SM 96——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Congress has laid upon the National Museum quite other and addi-
tional functions. Not to dwell upon the fact (so constantly insisted on
in previous reports) of the entire inadequacy of the buildings here for
the collections, the National Museum, containing all the diverse col-
lections of the Government, has many more departments and a very
much larger necessary expenditure for salaries, owing to the diversity
of its cares. It is also the source of supply which has been succes-
sively depleted for the exhibitions at Louisville, Cincinnati, and New
Orleans in 1884 and 1885, Madrid in 1892, Chicago in 1895, and Atlanta
in 1895; and a Jarge part of the force has thus been engaged in the dis-
arrangement of its own collections, a condition of things under which
no museum, public or private, could prosper.

It is also called upon by Members of Congress to send collections to
every portion of the country, and in the last year, on the request of
individual Members of Congress, collections comprising in all at least
39,000 specimens were sent out. The National Museum is also treated
as a National Bureau for scientific information, and is expected to
answer inquiries from every portion of the country.

These are some of the purposes for which the Museum is compelled
to use money which should go to collections, purposes not perhaps
alien to the objects of a National Museum, but widely diverse from
those of a private one.

The final result is shown in such figures as those above cited, were
museums no larger or even of less extent, paying in many cases higher
salaries to their officers and employees, are able to expend, as in the
instance alluded to, thirteen times the amount on collections.

All these are reasons why, in spite of the most earnest efforts and
self-sacrifice on the part of those in their immediate charge, the collec-
tions of the Government in many most important respects are not
advancing as fast as those of some civic museums.

It seems but justice to the late eminent nan—Dr. G. Brown Goode—
who gave his life to this Museum, and who had entire freedom in his
administration of it, to say that more than he did would have been, it
is believed, impossible under.the conditions just cited. He did more,
in fact, than could be demanded, for he supplemented these defects by
arousing, through his own enthusiasm and his unselfish interest, such
a like spirit in others, that a large portion of all the curatorships are
actually filled by those giving entirely voluntary and unpaid services,
there being, in fact, more exactly, eight curators who are paid (though
inadequately) to seventeen who receive their salaries in other Govern-
ment employment, but give their private time to their respective
departinents, 2 condition of things which it would be hard to parallel
elsewhere, but which alone has made it possible, under the depressing
influences already cited, for the Museum to not have fallen further
behind the progress of others than it has done. The clerical force,
which is relatively larger than it would be under conditions other than
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. . 19

those stated, is paid at rates considerably less than for similar service
in the Executive Departments.

IT again most earnestly commend this most regrettable state of affairs
to the attention of the Regents, and through them to Congress. It is
for them to apply the remedy.

In my previous reports I have called attention to the congested state
of the exhibition halls of the Museum, which prevents the collections
from being seen toadvantage. This condition has been met to a limited
extent by the appropriation of $8,000 for galleries, which will afford. a
temporary relief; but it is evident that a new building must soon be
provided, or the Museum will tend to present the appearance of a place
for storage rather than that of one for commodious exhibition. There
would not be the slighest difficulty in immediately filling a second build-
ing of the same size as the present one with objects of interest from the
collections already accumulated.

It may possibly be a matter of surprise that I should urge the increase
of appropriations for purchases, while the Museum building is thus
crowded; but, as I have stated above, the present collections represent,
in large part, not what is most desirable, but what has come to hand,
leaving everywhere great gaps, or at least, fragmentary series which, to
be properly presented, should be filled out by objects only obtainable
by purchase.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The researches relating to the American Indians under the direction
of the Smithsonian Institution have been continued. During the year
Special attention has been given to the more precise classification of
the Indians by Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau, and several
of his collaborators; meantime the customary operations have been
carried forward in such manner as to elucidate the arts, institutions,
beliefs, and languages of the native tribes.

As usual a part of the work of the Bureau was exploratory. An
extended exploration conducted by Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in
charge of the Bureau, was carried on over the territory of the Seri
Indians, including Tiburon Island, in the Gulf of California, and adja-
cent mainland area in the State of Sonora, Mexico. These Indians are
remarkable for primitive character and warlike disposition, and have
successfully protected their habitat from invasion by white men since
the time of Coronado. An account of this interesting journey will be
found in Major Powell’s report.

Archeologic explorations of considerable extent were carried forward
also in Arizona, and some of the ruins thereby discovered were exca-
vated with great success. The chief result of this work was a remark-
ably rich collection of symbolically decorated prehistoric pottery, made
by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes and transferred to the United States National
Museum,
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Another noteworthy archeologic exploration was made along the
western coast of Florida, south of the twenty-seventh parallel, bringing
to light abundant relics of the prehistoric age. In this case the collec-
tions were taken chiefly from salt-water bogs within coral islands or
atolls, in which domestic and ceremonial objects of wood, bone, shell,
and antler, together with implements and weapons of shark and other
teeth, and even textile fabrics were preserved in wonderful perfection.
Water-color sketches were made of all masks and other wooden speci-
mens liable to deteriorate in drying.

The work on the “Cyclopedia of the American Indians” has been
carried forward, and aconsiderable part of the material has been made
ready for the press.

Researches concerning the social organization and institutions of the
Indians have been continued, and some of the results have been incor-
porated in the reports of the Bureau.

The work in linguistics has gone on steadily. A comparative vocab-
ulary of Algonquian dialects is well advanced, and additions to it have
been made through studies of the Miami and Peoria tongues. The tri-
bal and linguistic development of the Iroquois Indians, or Six Nations,
has been studied with success, yielding a means of determining, within
limits, the prehistoric movements of these tribes. Substantial progress
has been made also in ascertaining the general laws of linguistics and
in applying these laws to the problems of the character and distribu-
tion of the aborigines.

One of the results of researches concerning the Kiowa ceremonials
was the discovery that the Indians deepened tieir trance condition,
and at the same time strengthened their bodies against fatigue, by the
use of the dried tops of a cactus which contains certain alkaloids of
remarkable properties.

The subject of native American mythology has received attention.
It has been found that the myths and ceremonials throw much light on
the origin and development of some of the industries and games of the
Indians, and give an insight into many characteristics of primitive
peoples in general. The ceremonials of the Pueblo Indians have been
studied with care, and new indications have been found of the intimate
connection between rituals and environment. A report dealing with
the operations and ceremonials of the Zuni Indians was practically
completed during the year. -

The Bureau made an exhibit in connection with the National Museum,
under the Smithsonian Institution, at the Cotton States and Interna-
tional Exposition held at Atlanta during the autumn of 1896. This
illustrated the characteristics and habits of the Cherokee Indians of
eastern United States, of the Papago Indians of the far Southwest, and
of the little known Seri of the western coast of Mexico. It received
the highest award—a diploma and a gold medal.

The details of the Bureau’s operations are recounted in a special
report from Director Powell, forming Appendix II.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Pad

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

The International Exchange Service was inaugurated half a century
ago aS a means for developing and executing in part the broad and
comprehensive objects paramount in the mind of the founder for the
“increase and diffusion of knowledge.”

The “increase of knowledge,” accomplished only by constant research
and persistent experiments, as prosecuted by the Institution in its vari-
ous branches, would not alone have fulfilled the objects and attained
the results desired by the founder. The knowledge obtained must also
be diffused, and in order that the memoirs, contributions to knowledge,
and annual reports published by the Institution might be systemat-
ically exchanged for publications of other scientific institutions through-
out the world, the exchange system was inaugurated.

The advantages of the service have not been confined to the Institu-
tion alone, but have been shared by scientific societies and educational
institutions everywhere for the ultimate purpose of increasing the
resources of their libraries. That the best results might be attained,
the Institution proceeded to establish relations with various scientific
societies and libraries in England and Germany, where the interchange
of publications was more extensive than in other countries, and it was
found to be not only advisable but necessary that agents should be
employed and paid some salary from the funds of the Institution. With
the exception of the two countries named there is a systematic exchange
of publications with nearly every nation of the civilized world without
any expense to the Smithsonian Institution for the distribution of pack-
ages after the delivery of cases to the authorized agency.

Although the exchange service was originally established in the
interest of science, for many years it has forwarded and received so
many publications of the United States that the latter function has
superseded the original design of the Bureau, both as to the number of
packages and their weight, and especially since it became the official
medium of the National Government for the distribution of parlia-
mentary and scientific publications of the several Bureaus it has
undergone a complete change and necessarily many improvements have
been adopted in the system.

The appropriations made by Congress for the support of the ex-
changes since 1851 have never been adequate, notwithstanding the
fact that treaty obligations made it compulsory for the Exchange
Bureau to forward Government publications and receive the parlia-
mentary documents of other countries for the Library of Congress.
Without mentioning the cost to the Smithsonian Institution of the
transmissions of the United States Government prior to the Exchange
Bureau becoming the official representative of the Government, the
Institution has advanced during that period over $45,000 from its own
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

income in excess of moneys appropriated by Congress, two-thirds of
which at least was directly. due to the expense of forwarding Govern-
ment publications, and which has never been reimbursed to the Insti-
tution. The benefit derived by the Government from the exchange
system has not been confined to the direct contributions of foreign
governments, but the accumulations of the Smithsonian Institution
have been systematically deposited with the Library of Congress,
known as the ‘‘ Smithsonian Deposit,” and at the close of this fiscal
year the publications thus deposited have reached the great number of
350,000.

By reference to the report, in the Peotine of the acting sips of
exchanges, it will be noticed that the expenditures of the year have
amounted to $20,568.14. Of this amount $17,000 were appropriated by
Congress, $2,727.43 were paid by Government bureaus, $271 by State
institutions, and $461.29 by other contributors. This amount was insuf-
ficient to meet outstanding obligations, and the Institution advanced

the sum of $98.42.
~The number of correspondents of the Exchange Bureau, both foreign
and domestic, has noticeably increased during the past year, and the
total now amounts to 24,914, of which 18, 900 are foreign, some of them
being in the most remote parts of hala

I have before suggested the advisability of adopting some means by
which to increase the store of parliamentary publications for the Library
of Congress as a more adequate return for the large number of publi-
cations of this Government sent to foreign countries, and as the new
Library building will in a few months be ready for cataloguing the books
now on hand, and as ample space will be available for accessions, it
seems most desirable that action should at once be taken to accomplish
this end. Correspondence can do much, but personal solicitation can
do more, and to attain the desired results a special representative in
the joint interest of the Institution and the Library of Congress should
be commissioned to visit the leading countries of the world.

THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

In former reports I have called attention to the general policy of
the Institution with reference to the National Zoological Park and the
embarrassments that have arisen in carrying it out. Some of these
embarrassments still remain, especially the absence of authority for
the purchase of animals in the appropriation act. Because of this the
proper growth of the collection is much retarded and many of the rarer
native animals now fast disappearing are not yet represented. Itis not
likely that such animals will often be presented to the park, as they are
rarely obtained and are always readily sold. For several years past
I have recommended to Congress the removal of this restriction by
restoring to the annual appropriation act an item for the purchase of
animals.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

The appropriation made for the park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1896, was in the following terms:

National Zoological Park: For continuing the construction of roads,

walks, bridges, wi vter supply, sewerage, and drainage; and for grading,
planting, and otherwi se improving the grounds: erecting and rep: uring
buildings and inclosures for animals ; and for administrative purposes,

care, subsistence, and transpor tation of animals, including salaries or
compensation of all necessary employees, and general incidental ex-
peuses not otherwise provided for, fifty-five thousand dollars, one-half
of which sum shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Colum-
bia and the other half from the Treasury of the United States; for con-
tinuing the entrance into the Zoological Park from Woodley Lane, and
opening driveway into Zoological Pp ark, from said entrance along the
west bank of Rock Creek, live thousand dollars, to be immediately
available, which sum is hereby appropriated out of any money in the
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, one-half chargeable to the reve-
nues of the District of Columbia. And of the sum hereby appropri-
ated five thousand dollars shall be used toward the construction of a
road from the Holt Mansion entrance (on Adams Mill road) into the
park to connect with the roads now in existence, including a bridge
across Rock Creek.

The greater part of this sum has necessarily been spent in the main-
tenance of the collection and in the care of the buildings and grounds.
It should not be forgotten that the preservation and maintenance of
the native beauty of the region in which the park is situated was one
of the primary objects had in view at the time of its establishment.
In consequence of this, great care has always been exercised to inter-
fere as little as possible with the natural features, though roads and

ralks following easy gradients and convenient for the public must
necessarily be made through the park.

The adjustment of the boundaries of the park to conform to the
newly devised system of highways that has been proposed for the Dis-
trict of Columbia has not yet been made. Since the date of the last
report the roadways on the western side have received attention, and it
is Supposed that they are now definitely settled about the entire circuit
of the park. It would seem, therefore, that the present is a proper
time to make such final adjustments in the boundary as may seem
desirable. The accompanying map shows the proposed roadways near
the park.

The remarks made in last year’s report with regard to changes upon
the eastern side are still applicable in the main, and may be profitably
repeated :

Plans for a system of roadways for the District have been completed
for that section lying to the eastward of the park. Here a broad street,
to be known as the “Park Drive,” reaches the boundary of the park
at its southeastern corner and thence proceeds along the eastern side
by gentle curves adapted to the topography of the region, as shown
upon the accompanying plan. The establishment of this road will

greatly improve the access to the park, which has always suffered
from the steep grades that are necessary for descent into the valley
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of Rock Creek. It will, however, entail some new difficulties which
should be met at once. The road does not skirt the boundary of the
park at all points, but touches or leaves it according to the contour
of the ground and the practicability of the grade. Some tracts of land
are therefore left between the drive and the park, and if these become
built upon, a succession of private houses will be thrust directly upon
the boundary, marring the air of seclusion that was one of the objects
for which the expenditure of the first purchase was made, and which
is still a principal attraction of the valley.

In order to avoid this the land in question should be added to the
park, the eastern boundary of which would then lie along a broad and
excellent roadway affording access to the park at several convenient
points. The accompanying map shows the land which should be added.
It involves a strip (C) lying immediately south of the bear pits much
needed for the security of the animals confined there. At present the
boundary of the park is so near the pits that the bank is very steep, and
as it is composed in considerable degree of soil and decomposed rock it
constantly crumbles under the action of the weather and precipitates
loose stones and débris into the pits, thus endangering the safety of the
animals and gradually undermining the boundary fence, which must
sooner or later fall inward. It should also include a tract of land lying
on a hillside to the north of the Quarry road and forming a portion of
the property of Mr. H. D. Walbridge. This is an exceedingly impor-
tant tract, as its possession would extend the park toward Kenesaw
avenue, which will doubtless be the principal route of access upon the
eastern side, and it would be desirable to extend the park on the
southern side by taking in the cemetery that now lies near the Adams
Mill entrance and constitutes a serious blot upon the surroundings of
the park.

In one particular it seems desirable to amend these recommendations.
As the cemetery situated to the southward of the park is probably of
considerable value and it would entail considerable expense to add the
entire tract to the park, it is believed that the interests of the Govern- -
ment will be equally well subserved by establishing a roadway through
it along the route marked in dotted lines on the map, and adding to the
park only so much of the land as may lie between such roadway and
the present boundary.

On the western side considerable readjustments of boundary are
desirable. Commencing at Woodley Bridge, it seems proper that a
small strip (marked H) should be added to the park, so that it may
reach the line of a projected roadway shown in dotted lines on the
annexed map. ‘This roadway extends along the natural contours of a
hill that slopes toward Rock Creek, and when it is established the
unsightly embankment made there for the purpose of entering the park
can be removed. It is recommended that the boundary run along the
eastern side of this road to meet the present boundary of the park.

Another extension seems desirable near the present western entrance
to the park upon Connecticut avenue extended. Here the boundary
now runs at no great distance from the avenue and there is no prop-
erly legalized right of way over the property into the park. Notwith-
standing this, the service of the electric cars on the avenue makes

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK AND PROPOSED ROADWAYS IN ITS VICINITY.

Ps

CONNECTICUT AVENUE

LE

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

this the most frequented of all the entrances. he ground which it is
proposed to include lies between the park and Connecticut avenue,
extending southward to Cathedral avenue and northward to Klingle
road. It is marked I on the accompanying map. It is represented as
being excellent grazing ground for antelope, elk, deer, or llamas.
Pasturage for these animals is now insufficient owing to the wooded
character of the park. Should the Rock Creek Park be likewise
extended to Connecticut avenue as is proposed, the two public parks
would then have acommon boundary along the Klingle road, which
would form a common avenue of entrance.

It will be noted that there were mentioned in the appropriation act
two roads to be constructed within the park, one entering from Wood-
ley Lane road and continuing along the western bank of Rock Creek,
a second to enter the park from the Adams Mill road and connect witb
the general park system.

The first of these roads is the one mentioned in last year’s report.
The amount of $5,000 appropriated for it, being immediately available,
was nearly all expended before the beginning of the present fiscal year.
Since this. road has to be built within the boundaries of the park, it
became necessary to make a heavy and expensive filling of earth near
the Woodley road. This is at present a very objectionable feature that
ean not be modified except by an additional fill sufficient to modify the
lines of the embankment so that they will simulate natural slopes. If
the modification of the boundary and the exterior road proposed by the
Commissioners is established here, this embankment should be removed
or made to conform to the grades that accommodate such exterior road.

sy consulting the annexed map it will be seen that this road soon
reaches the banks of the creek. At this point it becomes necessary to
cross, owing to the fact that the right or western bank becomes precipi-
tous and would not admit of the construction of a road except at great
expense and destruction of the natural features. It was first thought
that it would be necessary to construct a bridge here, but this seems
objectionable in some respects, as tending to give an artificial character
to a beautiful locality. It is thought that it may be well to try at this
point (marked A on map) the experiment of a ford, so managed that in
ordinary stages of the stream there would be but a few inches of water.
This would give sufficient access for carriages, and foot passengers
could cross upon a series of stepping stones. There would be but few
days in the year when such a crossing could not be used with satisfae-
tion, and upon such days but little traveling would be expected.

The second road is in fact a restoration of the old road which led from
the mill formerly established here by President John Quiney Adams,
and accordingly known on the map of the District as the Adams Mill
road. The mill with its dam has long since disappeared, but traces of
_ the roadway and of the miller’s dwelling still remain. It is believed
that a picturesque driveway can be made here. It must necessarily
be narrow, as otherwise it would deface too much the wooded bank
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

down which it descends. Work was commenced on this road toward
the close of the fiscal year. |

At the edge of the stream near the site of the old mill the two roads
are to unite in one, which a short distance above will cross the creek on
a rustic bridge (marked B on map), thus reaching the main body of the
park near the principal animal house.

Among the most satisfactory of the works undertaken in the park
for beautifying and secluding the grounds is the restoration of the area
between the seal pond and Rock Creek to something approaching its
prinitive wildness. This region had been connected with the body of
the park by high embankments meant to restrain the stream and pre-
vent it from destroying the seal pond. This object has now been
effected by removing the embankments and sinking under the ground
at each end of the pond a substantial wall of masonry.

Through the courtesy of the Fish Commission the park was enabled
during the year to acquire the plant for an aquarium which was used
at the Atlanta Exposition. It is intended to establish this in a suit-
able structure, thereby effecting an important addition to the zoological
resources of the park.

As the Yellowstone National Park is the source from which many
wild animals are supplied to the park here, and as great difficulty has
hitherto been experienced in properly confining and caring for animals
within that preserve, it has seemed desirable that an inclosure of con-
siderable extent should be fenced off in some suitable portion of that
park into which animals could be driven for the purpose of capture and
where they could be preserved indefinitely while becoming partially
tamed and awaiting transportation to the East. A site for such an
inclosure has been selected in the Hayden Valley, and during the sum-
mer of 1895 a strong corral inclosing a considerable tract was erected
there. It was hoped that most of the few bison stili remaining in the
Yellowstone Park might be brought into this corral, and here protected
from marauders. In this particular, however, my expectations have
not been realized. The pursuit of the bison by poachers has continued,
and it is understood from the superintendent of the park that there are
now but very few remaining.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The operations of the Astrophysical Observatory during the past
year, as detailed more at length in the appendix, have been very success-
ful in reducing prejudicial disturbances tc the work. It is expected
to make within a few months a publication of the results of the long
investigation of the infra-red spectrum which has thus far occupied so
much of the attention of the observatory. In this publication it is
believed that the degree of accuracy in the position of absorption lines,
which was mentioned in the report of last year as the aim of the inves-
tigation, will be fully realized.

Notwithstanding the gratifying progress in removing sources of error
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

which has been made during the past year, it must again be remarked

‘that the full degree of satisfaction to be obtained in the investigation
can not be hoped for in the present site of the observatory. During
the past year plans have been prepared for the construction of a more
suitable building, and some experiments have been made looking to the
determination of a site more free from magnetic and other disturbances,
but no steps have yet been taken to remove to such a situation.

It is proper to add that administrative duties have occupied too much
of my time in the past year to permit my giving the personal attention
I should have wished to the conduct of the observatory, and that for
the improvements above described credit is due chiefly to Mr. C. G.
Abbot, who efficiently aids me in its charge.

NECROLOGY.
GEORGE BROWN GOODE.

Since the close of the fiscal year the Institution has suffered the irrep-
arable loss of its assistant secretary, Dr. George Browu Goode, who
died on September 6, 1896, at his home in this city. A sketch of his
life will more properly be given in my next report, but I can not refrain
from saying a word at this time about one with whom I was not only
officially intimate, but who was a very dear personal friend.

Dr. Goode was born at New Albany, Ind., on February 13, 1851.
He was first associated with the Institution in 1873, and from that time
until his death was thoroughly devoted to the work he so loved—the
building up and development, under the charge of the Regents, of a
great National Museum. In 1887 he was appointed assistant secretary
of the Institution in charge of the National Museum, which, as it exists
to-day, is perhaps the most fitting monument to his memory.

He possessed an exact scientific training that made him eminent as
a zoologist, but it was as a specialist in museum administration that he
was perhaps skilled above all others, and he gave himself with entire
devotion to the care of the Museum, which was practically his charge,
refusing many advantageous offers to go elsewhere, for the peculiar
value of his services was everywhere acknowledged.

Dr. Goode united with his great administrative ability singularly
varied powers in other directions, and the most entire unselfishness in
their use I have ever known. My own trust in him grew with every
evidence of his special fitness for it, while our official relations continued
to be of the most happy character, and so also were those of his asso-
ciates and subordinates, for he possessed the rare art of maintaining an
exact discipline without sacrificing the affections of those over whom
it was administered. He is gone, and his successor is hard to find.

WILLIAM CRAWFORD WINLOCK.

After the conclusion of the transactions of the Exchange Bureau for
the fiscal year, and before the annual report of the Institution was
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ready for the press, the curator of exchanges, William Crawford Win-
lock, passed away.

Mr. Winlock died at Bare Head, N. J., September 20, 1896, having
but a few days before returned en a furans to Loa ilen. Leos and
Paris, whence he had gone in the interest of the affairs of the Bureau.

Mr. Winlock, already well known as an astronomer, having been
attached to the United States Naval Observatory, continued to exer-
cise the functions of his profession after associating himself with the
Institution, and, in addition to his onerous duties as curator of ex-
changes, he was made honorary curator of physical apparatus in the
United States National Museum. At the time of his death he ocen-
pied the chairs of astronomy in the Corcoran and Graduate schools of
the Columbian University.

In the death of Mr. Winlock the Institution has lost not only one of
its most efficient officers, and one to whom the exchange service was
specially indebted, but one whose personal character endeared him in
an uncommon degree to his associates.

GEORGE HANS BOEHMER.

George Hans Boehmer died at Gaithersburg, Md., November 20, 1895.
Mr. Boehmer was born in Berlin, Germany, May 6, 1842, and in 1868
came to the United States.

In 1876 he was appointed on the staff of the Smithsonian Institution,
and after various promotions became chief clerk of the Exchange
Bureau, which position he held at the time of his death. He was an
accomplished linguist, and his efforts aided greatly in bringing the
Hixchange Bureau to its present efficient standing.

Respectfully submitted.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX JI.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Srr: The following statement constitutes a résumé of the most important opera-
tions of the National Museum during the fiscal year which ended on June 30, 1896:

lccessions.—The records show the receipt of 1,299 separate accessions during the
year. These represent a total of more than 70,000 specimens of all kinds.

The following accessions are of special interest: From Dr. William L. Abbott, to
whom more than any other individual the Museum is indebted for contributions from
Africa and Asia, collections of natural-history specimens, ethnological objects, and
musical instruments, gathered in Kashmir, India, and Madagascar; from Mr. A.
Boueard, Isle of Wight, England, large and exceedingly valuable collections of
birds’ skins from different parts of the world, containing many species and several
fenera new to the Museum collection; from Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, New York City,
a valuable collection of southern gems and gem minerals, native silver from Arizona,
an especially fine specimen of green tourmaline from Mount Mica, Paris, Me., and
shells from New Zealand and various localities in Texas; from John Brenton Copp,
New Haven, Conn., a very interesting addition to the collection of household goods,
wearing apparel, pottery, glass, pewter jewelry, and other specimens transmitted by
him in a previous year; from Dr. A. Fenyés, Hélonan, Egypt, a fine collection of
natural-history specimens, fossils, Greek and Roman coins, and antiquities from
Egypt and the Transvaal; from Mr. R. D. Lacoe, Pittston, Pa., collections of Dakota
croup fossils and Paleozoic animal fossils, also specimens from a Sigillarian stump.
These collections will form part of the famous ‘Lacoe Collection.” Col. Charles
Coote Grant, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, has transmitted a large collection of
Clinton and Niagara group fossils from the vicinity of Hamilton. Dr. William L.
Ralph, Utica, N. Y., to whom the Museum is so deeply indebted, has presented some
very yaluable and interesting collections of birds’ skins. Among them is a skin of a
Philip Island parrot, now an extinct species. Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U. 8. A., Hub-
bard Park, Cambridge, Mass., transmitted collections of birds’ eggs from Virginia,
birds’ skins, including several new species, from Margarita Island and Venezuela, as
well as some natural-history specimens from the West Indies. Some very beautiful
specimens of the Tiffany Favrile glass, made under the personal supervision of Mr.
Charles L. Tiffany, have heen deposited in the Museum by Messrs. Tiffany & Co.
Special mention may also be made of a number of pieces of beautifully decorated
chinaware, pottery, etc., presented by Messrs. William and Edward Lycett, Atianta,
Ga., including yases, cups, and saucers of Japanese eggshell porcelain.

The scientific staf.—The vacancy created by the death of Prof. C. V. Riley, hon-
orary curator, on September 14, 1895, has been filled by the appointment of Mr. L.
O, Howard, who also sueceeded Professor Riley as Entomologist of the Department
of Agriculture. Custodians of special groups in the Department of Insects have
been appointed, as follows: Mr. D. W. Coquillett, custodian of the Diptera; Mr. W.
H. Ashmead, custodian of the Hymenoptera; Mr. E. A. Schwarz, custodian of Coleop-
terous larve, and Mr. O, F. Cook, of Huntington, Long Island, custodian of the
Myriapoda, .

29
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mr. George C. Maynard has accepted the custodianship of the collection of elec-
trical apparatus. Dr. C. Hart Merriam has been enrolled upon the list of associates
in zoology.

Distribution of specimens.—Nearly 30,000 specimens of all kinds have been distrib-
uted during the year. About four-fifths of this number were donated to institu-
tions. The total also includes a large number of specimens which were transmitted
in exchange to institutions and individuals. Specimens are in no case given to
individuals. Of the entire number of specimens distributed, probably two-thirds
consisted of fishes and invertebrate forms of marine life. More than 2,300 geological
specimens and about half as many casts of prehistoric implements are also included
in tae total number.

Visitors.—The number of visitors to the Smithsonian building during the year was
103,650, and to the Museum building 180,505.

Specimens received for determination.—There has been a noticeable increase in the
number of ‘‘lots” of material received for identification. ‘This is readily accounted
for by the encouragement which the Museum has always given in this direction. A
stone cr insect, actually worthless, but belieyed by the sender to have some scien-
tific or commercial value, is as carefully examined and reported upon as would be a
collection having recognized value, from a correspondent known to be engaged in
scientific work. The number of ‘‘lots” received during the year was 542, or an
increase of 75 over the number received last year.

Foreign exachanges.—Exchanges have been made with a number of foreign museums.
Among them may be mentioned the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, Italy;
Museu Paulista, Sao Paulo, Brazil; British Museum, London, England; Zoological
Museum, Turin, Italy; Horniman Museum, London, England; Australian Museum,
Sydney, New South Wales; La Plata Museum, La Plata, Argentina; Museuin of
Natural History, Paris, France; Museum of Natural History, Genoa, Italy; Royal

Austria. Exchanges of importance have also been made with individuals, among
whom may be mentioned Mr. Edward Lovett, Croydon, England; Mr. Edgar J.
Bradley, Happy Valley Water Works, South Australia; Dr. A. C. Haddon, Cam-
bridge, England; Prof. Guiseppe Bellucci, Perugia, Italy; Dr. Herman Credner,
Leipsic, Germany; Dr. A. Pavlow, Moscow, Russia; Col. Charles Scott Grant, Ham-
ilton, Ontario, Canada; Prof. M. Stossich, Trieste, Austria.

Publications.—The Report of the National Museum for 1893 was published early in
the year, and a considerable portion of the Report for 1894 is already in type.

Volume 17 of Proceedings of the National Museum was received from the Govern-
ment Printing Office and distributed in July. All the papers for Volume 18, except-
ing three, appeared as separates. ‘This volume will probably be ready for distribution
in bound form during November. Advance editions of three papers to appear in
volume 18 were also received and distributed. Two of these contained descriptions
of remarkable new genera and species of batrachia and crustacea obtained by the
United States Fish Commission from an artesian well at San Marcos, Tex. The
third contained preliminary diagnoses of new mammals from the Mexican border,
collected by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. A.

Bulletin 47, “The Fishes of North and Middle America,” by Dr. D. 8. Jordan and
Prof. B. W. Evermann, will shortly: be published, and Bulletin 49, “A Bibliography
of the Published Writings of Philip Lutley Sclater, F. R.8.” prepared by Dr. G.
Brown Goode, is now in type.

A second en of Part F of Bulletin 39, ‘‘ Directions for Collecting and eh Ae aere
ing Insects,” by Prof.C. V. Riley, has been printed, to meet the unusually large
demand for this pamphlet.

Special Bulletin No. 2, ‘Oceanic Ichthyology,” by Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr.
Tarleton H. Bean, is now ready for the press. This is a treatise on the deep-sea and
pelagic fishes of the world, and is based chiefly on the collections made by the steam-
ers Blake, Albatross and Fish Hawk in the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean. It is an
elaborate work, in quarto form, of 553 pages, with an atlas of 417 figures arranged on
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

123 plates. Special Bulletin No. 3 is also ready for the press. This is the second
volume of ‘‘ Life Histories of North American Birds,” by Maj. Charles Bendire.

In the series of circulars, No. 47 has been issued. The object of the circular is to
indicate the conditions upon which the Musewn will undertake the identification of
mollusks. The necessity of printing such a circular arose from the vast amount of
material of this kind received for examination during recent years. In almost every
instance the return of the material was expected, and thus the Museum was called
upon to do a very large amount of work with little or no return of any kind.

Beplorations.—Dr. William L. Abbott has continued his explorations in Africa and
India, and the Museum is deeply indebted to him for additional collections of ethno-
logical and natural-history objects. Among the latter, a fine series of skins of lemurs
and of the insectivores peculiar to southeastern Madagascar are of conspicuous inter-
est and value,

A yaluable collection, consisting of 1,553 specimens of antiquities, obtained in 1895
from the cliff dwellings and ancient pueblos near Tusayan, Ariz., has been gathered
by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes. This collection will doubtless be supplemented by others
of equal interest, as Dr. Fewkes is continuing his explorations this summer (1896).

A yery acceptable collection of natural-history material was obtained for the
Museum by Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U.S. A., during his travels in the West Indies and
South America.

Additional collections of mammals, birds, and other natural-history specimens,
obtained in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and the Gulf of California, have been received
from Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A.

A collection of objects illustrating the manner of life among the Kiowa tribes has
been gathered by Mr. James Mooney, of the Bureau of Hthnology, and transferred
to the National Museum.

As a result of explorations in a cavern near Duffield, Scott County, Va., conducted
by Gen. A. L. Pridemore, of Jonesville, Va., the Museum has received a large col-
lection of human bones.

hnportant collections have been received from the United States Fish Commission,
comprising material collected in various parts of the United States by exploring
parties sent out under the direction of the Commission. The Department of Agri-
culture has been instrumental in adding, through its explorations, to the Museum
collections. A fine collection of Lower Silurian fossils from Valcour Island, Lake
Champlain, and of trilobites from Rome, N. Y., was made by the United States
Geological Suryey, and will in due course be transmitted to the Museum. Several
large and valuable collections have been received from this source during the year.

Prof. R. Ellsworth Call, of Cincinnati, Ohio, has explored some of the caves in
Kentucky, and has transmitted to the Museum a large number of bats from the
Mammoth Cave.

Several of the curators and assistant curators in the Museum have at various times
during the year been engaged in collecting material. The results of these expeditions,
whieh were for the most part very successful, have been incorporated into the
Museum collections.

Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta.—The exposition opened on Sep-
tember 18 and closed on December 31. Fourteen departments of the Museum were
represented by special exhibits, and also several sections of the department of arts
and industries. The sum allotted to the Institution and the Museum was $22,000.
The Museum report for this year (1895-96), now in course of preparation, will contain
an elaborate report upon the exhibits of the Institution and the Museum, accompa-
nied by detailed lists of the objects exhibited.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1896.

Sir: Ethnologic researches have been carried forward throughout the fiscal year
in accordance with the act of Congress making provision ‘‘ for continuing researches
relating to the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian IJnstitu-
tion.”

As heretofore, the operations have been conducted in accordance with a plan sub-
mitted at the beginning of the fiscal year. Field operations of considerable extent
have been carried on in Arizona, Florida, Indian Territory, Indiana, Maine, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, and Sonora, Mexico. The office researches have been carried
forward by the use of material from most of the States and from various other parts
of the continent.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE WORK.

The immediate purpose of the Congress in instituting the Ethnological Bureau was
to obtain definite information concerning Indian tribes, to the end that they might
be arranged in amicable groups on reservations; and this primary purpose has been
constantly borne in mind and has from the beginning shaped the operations of the
Bureau. In considering the qualities which conduce toward amity or tend toward
enmity among the tribes it was found that differences in mythology or belief com-
monly engender distrust and strife, while similarities in mythology inspire mutual
confidence and thus promote peace; accordingly, it was deemed necessary to inves-
tigate the aboriginal mythology. It was also found that tribes and confederacies
controlled by similar laws and governed by chiefs chosen in the same way, and
organized or regimented on parallel lines, usually associate peacefully, while tribes
or other groups whose institutions are unlike can not associate without friction and
clashing; thus it seemed desirable to take up researches concerning the institutions
of the aborigines, and the early work in this direction proved so fruitful as to
encourage its prosecution. It was found, too, that tribes and other groups whose
industrial arts, sports, and games are of allied character are commonly harmonious,
while Indians whose arts are diverse are suspicious of each other and prone to
animosity; and for this and other reasons it was deemed needful to investigate the
aboriginal arts.

Finally, it was found that there is a relation between the beliefs, institutions, and
arts of the Indians and the languages spoken by them, and as the researches pro-
gressed this relation was found so intimate that the languages may safely be regarded
as indexes to those qualities, and hence that language alone can safely be used as a
basis for the determination of tribal qualities and for the arrangement of the Indians
in amicable groups. Accordingly, much attention was given to linguistic researches,
and gradually most of the tribes of the United States, with some of those in the con-
tiguous territory, were classified on a linguistic basis. Meanwhile investigations
concerning other subjects were carried forward, and were found of much importance.
In this way four primary lines of research were developed. So far as practicable, the
operations of the Bureau have been so conducted as to advance knowledge equally
along the several lines. Practical considerations have, however, led to a somewhat
arbitrary division of the work into the commonly recognized departments (1) ar-
cheology, (2) descriptive ethnology, (3) sociology, (4) linguistics, (5) mythology,

32
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

(6) psychology, (7) bibliography, and (8) publication, with the necessary adminis-
trative and miscellaneous work. Most of the researches are necessarily carried
forward in the field, while the field material is elaborated in the office. Accordingly,
the field work.and the office work are treated together except in so far as the former
may be considered exploratory, when it commonly relates to different lines of pri-
mary research.

EXPLORATION.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was in the field in Arizona,
haying completed during June a reconnoissance of the little-known country includ-
ing the northeastern extension of the Mogollon escarpment about the head waters of
Rio Verde. He repaired early in July to Holbrook, and proceeded to explore the ©
ruined villages of northeastern Arizona. After a more or less successful reconnois-
sance extending over a considerable district, he chose for detailed work the ruin
known as Sikyatki. Here he was joined by Mr. F. W. Hodge. It was ascertained
through tradition and literary record that the rnin represented a wholly prehistoric
village; and excavations were begun with the certainty that all material exhumed
would, for this reason, be of especial value in indicating the aboriginal condition of
the pueblo builders of this district. The anticipations were fully realized in the
results. In all of the abundant material exhumed and duly transférred to the United
States National Museum no trace of intrusive accultural art was found; every piece
was clearly prehistoric; and the collection was the richest both in quantity of mate-
rial and the quality of the ware and its symbolic decoration thus far obtained in this
country. While it is especially rich in decorated pottery, many other articles illus-
trating primitive handicraft and customs were obtained, together with a sufficient
amount of somatologic material—crania, etc.—to reveal the prominent physical char-
acteristics of the ancient people. Extensive collections were made also in the ancient
ruinof Awatobi. Dr. Fewkes’ operations were brought to a close toward the end of
August, when he returned to Washington with his collections, comprising seventeen
boxes from Sikyatki and Awatobi, and three from the ruins on the head waters of
Riv Verde.

Separating from Dr. Fewkes at Holbrook about the end of August, Mr. Hodge
made a reconnoissance of all the inhabited pueblos of New Mexico comprising Zuni,
Acoma, and Laguna in the western part of the territory, Cochiti, San Felipe, Santo
Domingo, Santa Ana, Sia, Jemez, Isleta, Sandia, Taos, Picuris, Santa Clara, San Juan,
San Ildefonso, Pojoaque, Nambe, and Tesuque, in the valley of Rio Grande. At
nearly all of these pueblos he was able to obtain valuable information relating to the
social organization, beliefs, migrations, and affinities of the natives. In several
cases the Indians have remained so completely isolated as to be little known to
students, and accordingly much of the information is essentially new.

The early part of the year was spent by Mr. James Mooney in the field in Okla-
homa in researches concerning the Kiowa Indians, the details of which are set forth
elsewhere.

Noteworthy exploratory work was conducted by Mr. W J McGee in continuation
ard extension of the explorations in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, begun during the
last fiseal year. Outfitting at Tucson, Ariz., he started southward on November 9,
1895, crossing the frontier at Sasabé and proceeding thence in a different direction
from that already reconnoitered. By the middle of the month he reached the most
elaborate prehistoric works existing in northwestern Mexico, near the rancho of
San Rafael de Alamito, on the principal wash known locally as Rio Altar. The
works comprise terraces, stone walls, and enclosed fortifications, built of loose stones,
nearly surrounding two buttes, of which the larger is three-fourths of a mile in
length and about 600 feet in height.

These ruins are known locally as ‘Las Trincheras,” or as ‘‘Trinchera” and
“Trincherita.” The whole of the northern side of the larger butte is so terraced
and walled as to leave hardly a square yard of the surface in the natural condition;

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and for hundreds of square rods the ground is literally sprinkled with fragments of
pottery, spalls, and wasters produced in making chipped implements, and other arti-
ficial material. Mr. Willard D. Johnson, who accompanied the party as topographer
(on furlough from the United States Geological Survey), and who carried forward a
route map, made detailed surveys of these ruins; a number of photographs were
taken also, while a considerable collection representing the fragmentary pottery
and stone art of the builders was obtained. After some days spent at this locality
the expeditions pushed on southward, traversing the principal mountain range of
western Sonora in a narrow canyon below Poso Noriega, and thence following for
50 miles the sand wash known as Rio Bacuache, which was not previously mapped.
~Leaying this wash near its indefinite termination on the desert plains, the course
was headed toward Rancho de San Francisco de Costa Rica, where a rancheria of
Seri Indians was found in 1894. On reaching this point it was ascertained that the
Indians had, through a combination of circumstances, become more hostile toward
white men than ever before, so that the prospect for studying their arts, institutions,
~ and beliefs seemed most gloomy. Nevertheless, it was decided to make the effort.

At the rancho a rude boat was built, with the aid of Senor Pascnal Encinas, of
Hermosillo; a preliminary trip was then made oyer the continental portion of Seri-
land, including the Seri Mountains, which were ascended for the first time by white
men, and were carefully mapped by Mr. Johnson. It was expected that the Indians
would be encountered on this trip; but unfortunately there had been a skirmish
between a small party of the Seri and a party of Mexican vaqueros two days before
the expedition entered Seriland proper, and the Indians had apparently withdrawn
to the coast and Tiburon Island. Returning from this side trip, the boat was, with
much difficulty, transported across Encinas desert and launched in Kino Bay, a reen-
trant in the coast of the Gulf of California. The stock, with the teamsters and
guides, were sent back to the rancho, while the main party proceeded up the coast
to the strait separating Tiburon Island from the mainland. It had been estimated
from the best available data that from five to seven days would be required for
crossing the strait, surveying Tiburon Island, and making collections; and ten days’
rations with five days’ water supply were provided. ‘The party, in addition to the
leader, comprised Messrs. W. D. Johnson, topographer, J. W. Mitchell, photographer,
and §. C. Millard, interpreter; Senores Andres Noriega, of Costa Rica, and Ygnacio
Lozania, of Hermosillo; Mariana, Anton, Miguel, Anton Castillo, and Anton Ortiz,
Papago Indians; and Ruperto Alvarez, a mixed-blood Yaki. A military organiza-
tion was adopied! strict regulations were laid down for the protection of life and
property, and watches were instituted and rigidly maintained.

On proceeding up the coast toward the turbulent strait El Infiernillo, severe gales
were encountered, whereby progress was greatly retarded; and on reaching the
strait the winds continued to blow so violently as to fill the air with sand ashore and
spray at sea, and to render it impossible to make the passage. Finally, after five
days, when the water was exhausted, the gale lulled sufficiently to permit a difficult
crossing with a portion of the party and a small part of the scanty food and bedding;
but when Messrs. Johnson and Mitchell set out on the return trip to bring over Senor
Noriega and two of the Indians, who remained with the supplies on the mainland,
the gale rose again and, despite the most strenuous efforts, blew the frail vessel 25
miles down the gulf, where it was practically wrecked on a desert island. On the
following day the wind subsided somewhat, and the two men were able to empty the
boat of the sand with which it had become filled, to repair it, and finally to reach
the rendezvous on the shore of Kino Bay in time to meet the teamsters from the
rancho on their return to bring in the party. Here water was obtained, and Messrs.
Johnson and Mitchell again worked their way up the coast in the face of adverse
winds, usually tracking the boat laboriously along the rocky coast; but it was not
until the end of the fourth day that they rejoined the three men left on the mainland,
who had suffered much from thirst, and again crossed the strait to find the larger
portion of the party with the leader on Tiburon Island. Meantime the group on the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

island had suffered inconvenience from dearth of food and blankets, and had been
compelled to devote nearly all their energies to obtaining water from a little tinaja,
or water pocket, in the rocks in the interior of the island 6 or 7 miles from the shore.
All hope of return of the boat had been abandoned, and when it finally appeared
the party were collecting driftwood and branches of the palo blanco—a tree grow-
ing sparsely on the mountains in the interior of the island—to build a raft, while
one of the party was engaged in making the necessary ropes from provision-bags
and clothing.

On the reassembling of the party the original plans were resumed; the leader
visited a score or more of Seri house bowers or rancherias, only to find them aban-
doned (though some bore evidence of occupancy within a few hours) while Mr,
Johnson continued the topographic surveys. By this time the food supplies were
practically exhausted, but were eked out by collecting oysters, clams, and crabs and
by a shark taken on the next to the last day of the stay on the island; and, as before,
most of the energies of the party were expended in carrying water from 4 to 15
miles, for which purpose squads of five or more heavily armed men were requisite,
since the danger of ambush was considerable and constant. By these journeys over
the jagged rocks, in which Tiburon Island abounds, the shoes of the white men and
the sandals of the Indians were worn out; and this condition finally compelled the
abandonment of further effort to come into communication with the wary Indians.
Considerable collections representing their crude arts, domestic and maritime, were,
however, made in their freshly abandoned rancherias, and a fine balsa, or canoe-
raft made of canes, was obtained.

After some delay and danger the strait was recrossed, and the party found them-
selves on the mainland, still beset by storms, without food or water, reduced by
arduous labor and insufficient food, and practically barefoot in a region abounding
in thorns and spines and jagged rocks. Moreover, they were still constantly under
the eyes of Seri warriors watching from a distance and awaiting opportunity for
attack. After fully considering the situation, the leader left the party and the boat
in charge of Mr. Johnson and skirted the coast on foot for 25 miles to the rendezvous
on Kino Bay in the hope of reaching the teamster from the rancho with supplies on
the last day of his stay there under the instructions given him by Mr. Johnson, on
last leaving that point after the wreck. He reached the rendezvous early in the
night of December 28, only to find it abandoned by reason of the accidental escape
r of the stock. He at once pushed on across the desert to the rancho, reaching there
early in the morning of the 29th, and immediately returning with food and water.
The entire party arrived at the rancho on the evening of December 31, and two days
later proceeded to Hermosillo, whence the leader returned directly to Washington,
while Mr. Johnson retraversed the country, thence northward to the Arizona bound-
ary, collecting objects and information among the Papago Indians and completing
the triangulation and topographic surveys. He reached Tucson about the end of
January.

While the expedition was, by reason of the hostility of the Indians, unsuccessful
so far as the anticipated studies of the Seri institutions and beliefs are concerned,
considerable collections representing their arts were obtained. Moreover, the whole
of Seriland, the interior of which was never before trodden by white men, was exam-
ined, surveyed, and mapped; and the expedition resulted also in a survey of such
character as to yield the first topographic map of a broad belt in Sonora extending
from the international boundary to Sonora River. The area covered by this survey
is about 10,000 square miles. Forty-seven stations were occupied for control, and a
considerably larger number of additional points for topographic sketching. The
portion of the map comprising Seriland, being essentially new to geographers, has
been published in the National Geographic Magazine (Vol. VII, 1896, Pl. xtv). It
is a pleasure to say that the work of the expedition was facilitated in all possible
ways by the State officers of Sonora.and the federal authorities of the Republic of
Mexico. By special authority of His Excellency Seiior Leal, secretario de fomento,
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the party was permitted to cross the boundary with the outfit and necessary supplies;
while the governor of Sonora, Seiior Ramon Coral, offered to furnish a guard of state
troops, and in other ways displayed constant interest in the work of the expedition.
Much is due, also, to Senor Pascual Encinas, an intrepid pioneer, to whose courage
and energy the extension of settlement in the borders of Seriland must be ascribed,
and a well-known citizen of Hermosillo, without whose assistance the work would
have been crippled.

OFFICE WORK.
ARCHEOLOGY.

Dr. J. W. Fewkes brought his field explorations and excavations to a close toward
the end of August and proceeded to Washington, where he was for several months
employed in unpacking, cleaning, repairing, labeling, and installing in the National
Museum the collections of pottery and other aboriginal material obtained in the
course of his work in Arizona. In connection with this duty he prepared a general
paper on the results of his work for the annual report of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and began the preparation of a more extended and fully illustrated memoir for
incorporation in the seventeenth annual report of the Bureau; he was occupied on
this memoir during most of December, 1895, and until his departure to the field in
May, 1896. In this report especial attention is given to the symbolic decoration of
the pottery and to its bearing on the mythology of the Pueblo Indians.

Toward the end of the fiscal year Dr. Fewkes returned to the field for the purpose
of making excavations and surveys of ruins brought to light through his previous
reconnoissance. Hewas accompanied by Mr. Walter Hough, of the National Museum,
who was detailed as a field assistant for the season. The operations were commenced
at the ruin known as Homolobi, on Little Colorado River, about 3 miles from Winslow,
Ariz. Asindicated by tradition, this village was the ancient home of a Moki Indian
clan. For a time the results of the work were not encouraging, but toward the
middle of June a productive part of the ruin was reached, and within a few days
400 fine specimens were obtained, including 250 beautiful bowls, dippers, vases, jars,
and other specimens of aboriginal fictile ware, similar to that obtained from Sikyatki
during the preceding season. Examination showed that the ware is typically Tusa-
yan, yet in its form and decoration is archaic and without influence of civilized
culture, thus demonstrating prehistoric character. The work at this point continued
successful until the ruin was exhausted. The party then repaired to another site,
known as Chevlon Pass, on Little Colorado River, also discovered by Dr. Fewkes. There
the excavations were successful almost from the first, so that by the end of June
the field catalogue of specimens had passed the number of 1,000. Several unique
and especially significant objects were brought to light at this ruin. Some of the
pottery found here is remarkably fine in texture, form, and decoration. Numerous
baskets were also recovered, as well as cotton cloth, sandals, pahos (or ceremonial
wands), and marine shells. Although Dr. Fewkes’ collections during the summer
of 1895 were unprecedented in wealth and scientific value, for the United States,
his collections during the first half of the season of 1896 were even richer and more
significant in their bearing on ethnic problems.

Early in December, Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing proceeded to Florida to resume
the researches relating to the Seminole Indians and to the archeology of that region,
which were commenced several months before and temporarily discontinued by reason
of the inadequacy of the funds at disposal for field work. It was found imprac-
ticable to make the requisite allotment for necessary field expenses, and a tender
was accepted from the Archeological Association of Philadelphia, representing the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, for cooperation. Under the terms of
the cooperation the Archeological Association assumed the cost of field work, includ-
ing the subsistence of the party, the salaries of assistants to Mr. Cushing, and inci-
dental expenses connected with the operations, while the material proceeds, in the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

form of collections, became the joint property of the Bureau and the association,
to be divided after examination and use in the preparation of reports, and the
scientific results remain the property of the Bureau for publication. Under this
arrangement Mr. Cushing organized a party, including Mr. Wells M. Sawyer, of the
United States Geological Survey (furloughed for the purpose), as photographer and
artist; Mr. Carl F. W. Bergmann, formerly of the United States National Museum,
as an expert assistant in collecting; Mr. Irving Sayford as clerk; and a number of
workmen, who were engaged in excayation.. Several localities were reconnoitered
and exploited with moderate success. During February the work was pushed into
the region of coral islands in the neighborhood of Punta Rassa, where traces of
extensive aboriginal handiwork were found on the islands, and especially in ancient
atolls and lagoons lined with bogs and saline marl. Here the works were of such
character as to indicate an extensive and well-organized primitive population, sub-
sisting on sea food, and cruising not only the lagoons and bays but also the open
gulf. Their island domiciles were protected by dikes built of large sea shells, evi-
dently collected for the purpose; their habitations, at least in part, were pile struc-
tures, ruins of which still remain. In some cases these structures were occupied so
long that the kitchen refuse accumulated to form mounds (initiating in time the cus-
tom of erecting mounds as sites for domiciles), and within the refuse heaps, or
midden-mounds, extensive traces of handiwork of the people were found.

The most extensive collections were, however, made from the bogs adjacent to the
habitations or beneath habitations occupied too briefly to permit extensive aceumu-
lations of middens. In these bogs were preserved numerous artifacts, comprising
shellwork in large variety ; wooden ware, including utensils, tools, weapons, masks
and other ceremonial objects, often elaborately carved and painted; textile fabrics
and basketry in abundance, though usually in such a state of decay as hardly to be
preservable; implements and other objects partly or wholly of teeth and bone of
sharks, land animals, etc.; and a few stone implements of the usual aboriginal
character. The painting and carving are especially noteworthy, not only as indicat-
ing moderately advanced symbolic art of the native type, but as suggesting com-
munity of culture between the maritime people of Florida and prehistoric peoples
of the western and southern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. The handiwork shows
no trace of accultural influence, and must therefore be regarded as pre-Columbian,
though the mode of life indicated by the relics is similar to that observed on the
Floridian peninsula by the earliest white explorers. The wooden ware, textiles, etc.,
preserved in the salt-water bogs commonly retained their aboriginal appearance
until exposed to the air, when they rapidly disintegrated and fell to pieces, or else
shrunk or warped so greatly as to give little indication of the original form. A
considerable part of the energies of the party were expended in efforts to preserve
these perishable articles by various devices and the use of such materials as could
be obtained at points remote from civilized stores, while Mr. Sawyer was constantly
employed in photographing or in drawing and painting in the original colors all the
more perishable objects; in this way the evidence concerning the prehistoric people
recorded in the better-preserved portions of the collection was greatly amplified and
extended.

In April the Director visited Mr. Cushing and remained with the party, personally
inspecting and directing the work, for several days. The operations in Florida were
brought to a close in May, when the collections were carefully loaded in a car and
transported direct to Philadelphia, where the space and facilities for unpacking were
ample. Mr. Cushing returned to Washington, and on the arrival of the car proceeded
to Philadelphia, where he unpacked that portion of the collection required for imme-
diate study.

Mr. Cushing’s Florida work threw new light on the shell mounds and other aborig-
inal works on the American coasts, and it was accordingly thought desirable to
review the earlier and more superficial examination of these works at different points
along the coast. Carrying out this plan, the Director proceeded about the middle
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of June to the coast of Maine, which has long been known to abound in aboriginal
shell heaps; there he was soon afterward joined by Mr. Cushing, and surveys and
examinations of the prehistoric works were under way at the close of the fiscal year.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

As administrative duties permitted, Mr. F. W. Hodge (acting chief clerk) carried
forward the Cyclopedia of the American Indians, his field work among the pueblos
in August and September yielding much information concerning the relations, and
especially concerning the clan organization of the southwestern Indians. In Febru-
ary Dr. Cyrus Thomas, having completed his revision and extension of work on
Indian land treaties, was transferred to the Cyclopedia, and during the remainder of
the fiscal year he was employed in collecting and arranging material relating to the
tribes of the Algonquian stock. The character of this Cyclopedia was set forth fully
in the last report. :

During the earlier part of the year Dr. Thomas revised and brought up to date the
Royce memoir on treaties with the Indian tribes relating to the cession of lands
(also described in the last report). The task proved greater than anticipated, since
extended research was required for bringing the work to date, and since this neces-
sitated the reconstruction of several of the maps. The laborious work was carried
forward energetically by Dr. Thomas, and the requisite additions to and modifiea-
tions in the schedule were made, the maps were prepared, and an introductory and
explanatory chapter was written. The work was completed early in April, and was
prepared for transmission to the Public Printer for issue as Volume VIII of the Con-
tributions to North American Ethnology, when on examination of the statutes it was
found that the public printing law approved January 12, 1895, seems to terminate
that series; accordingly, the document was held for incorporation in a forthcoming
annual report.

In the early part of the year Mr. James Mooney was employed in the field in
researches among the Kiowa and Comanche Indians of Oklahoma and Indian Ter-
titory. One of his lines of research related to the camping circle of the Kiowa-
Comanche group, in which the tents are arranged“in a certain definite order express-
ing the social organization and conveying other symbolic meanings; his studies
extended also to the patriarchial shields attached to the tents, and to the drawings
and paintings by which both shields and tents are decorated. He has found that
all of these decorations are symbolic, and collectively represent a highly elaborate
system of heraldry, and most of his time in the field was devoted to tracing the ram-
ifications and interpreting the details of the heraldic system. Special.attention,
too, was given to the calendars, or ‘‘ winter counts,” of which several were found
among these Indians. These calendars, which represent the beginning of writing,
are long-continued records of current events, represented pictographically by rude
drawings and paintings on skins or fabrics; and from them the important events
in the history of the tribes for many years can be determined with accuracy.

Another line of research related to the use of ‘‘mescal” by several of the southern
plaing’ tribes in their ceremonials as a paratriptic and mild intoxicant; this article,
as used by the Indians, is the upper part of the cactus known botanically as Anhalo-
nium lewinii, or Lophophora williamsii lewintit, which grows in the arid region of
Texas and eastern Mexico, The tops of the plants are collected and dried, when
they form button-like masses an inch or more in diameter and perhaps one-eighth of
an inch in thickness; these buttons are eaten by the Indians in certain protracted
and exhausting ceremonials. Their effect is to stimulate and invigorate the system
to such an extent as to permit active participation in the dance and drama for many
consecutive hours without fatigue, while at the same time mental effects somewhat
akin to those of hashish are produced, whereby the condition of trance or hallucina-
tion, which plays so important a part in all primitive ceremonials, is made more
complete than is customary or even possible under normal circumstances. In addi-
tion to the study of effects produced on the Indians themselves by the use of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

poison, Mr. Mooney collected a considerable quantity of the material for scientific
examination. By courtesy of the Department of Agriculture, the buttons were ana-
lyzed by Dr. Harvey W. Wiley and Mr. E. E. Ewell, of that Department, and were
found to yield three alkaloids, designated, respectively, as anhalonine, mescaline, and
alkaloid 3, besides certain resinous substances, all possessing peculiar physiological
properties. The physiologic action of the meseal buttons administered entire, and
also of the three alkaloids, has been tested by D. W. Prentiss, M. D., and I*. P. Mor-
gan, M. D., and the results have been found of great interest, leading the experi-
mentalists to consider the extracts as important therapeutic agents and valuable
additions to the pharmacopa@ia. On his return from the field Mr. Mooney began the
preparation of a memoir on the Kiowa calendars, which was nearly completed at the
end of the fiscal year, and has been assigned for publication in the seventeenth
annual report.

As during past years, much attention has been given to photographing Indians
and Indian subjects, and a small photographie laboratory has been maintained,
throagh the aid of Mr. William Dinwiddie. During the winter advantage was taken
of the presence of representative Indians in the national capital, and a number of
portrait photographs were obtained, together with considerable genealogic informa-
tion concerning various chiefs and leading men among several tribes.

SOCIOLOGY.

Except while occupied in administrative work, Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in
charge of the Bureau, has been carrying forward researches relating to the social
organization of the Indian tribes. His work is based on the voluminous records in
the archives of the Bureau and on observations especially among the Papago and
Seri Indians. It has been the aim to render this work fundamental, and to this
end the primary characteristics of mankind as distinguished from lower organisms
have been considered with especial care, and the studies of the Seri Indians havo
been particularly fruitful. Among the results of the researches there may be men-
tioned (1) an analysis of the beginning of agriculture, (2) the recognition of the
beginning of zooculture, (3) a study of the growth of altruistic motive, and (4) an
examination of early stages in the development of marriage. These results are
incorporated partly in a preliminary memoir on the ‘‘Siouan Indians” printed in
the fifteenth annual report, partly in several administrative reports, and partly in
an address published in the Smithsonian annual report for 1895.

It may be noted summarily that the researches concerning the beginning of agri-
culture indicate that this important art originated independently in different desert
regions, and was at first merely an expression of a solidarity into which men and
lower organisms were forced by reason of the environmental conditions character-
istic of the desert. Later the art was raised to a higher plane through the gradual
development of irrigation, and still later it was extended into areas in which irri-
gation was not required. The researches concerning zooculture serve to define a
Stage antecedent to domestication, as that term is commonly employed, in which the
relations between men and animals are collective rather than individual, and in
which the men and animals become mutually tolerant and mutually beneficial, as
when the coyote serves as a scavenger and gives warning, in his own cowardly
retreat, of the approach of enemies. Later, such of the tolerated animals as are
thereby made more beneficial are gradually brought into domestication, as was the
coyote-dog among many Indian tribes, the turkey among some, and the reindeer
among certain Eskimo. The researches concerning the development of human motive
are involved in the study of primitive law, and indicate that regulations concerning
conduct are framed by the elders in the interest of harmony and collective benefit,
and that these regulations are enforced until their observance becomes habitual,
when the habit in turn grows into motive. In some other directions, also, substan-
tial progress has been made in the study of the organizations and institutions of the
American Indians.
A0 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

LINGUISTICS.

During a considerable part of the year the Director has heen occupied in re-
searches concerning several characteristics of the American Indians, with the view
of developing a system of classification so complete as to indicate not only the affin-
ities of tribes and stocks among each other but the general affinities of the native
American people and their position among the races of men as well as among other
living organisms. In the course of this work much thought has been given to the
subject of Indian language, and the rich collections of linguistic material in the
archives of the Bureau have been scanned anew. It was the immediate purpose of
this study to trace the development of various languages in such manner as to educe
the laws of linguistic evolution. Satisfactory progress was made, and a considera-
ble body of manuscript was prepared, while a preliminary publication was presented
during the year in the form of an address delivered in the United States National
Museum May 23, 1896, entitled ‘‘The Relation Between Institutions and Environ-
ment,” and printed in the Smithsonian Report for 1895. The records indicate that
the four or five dozen distinct linguistic stocks in this country have been ren-
dered more or less composite by the blending of peoples; the researches seem to
show that a still larger number of distinct languages were originally developed
independently, in small, discrete groups, which gradually combined into larger
tribes and confederacies, and sometimes grew so large as again to subdivide and
spread over vast areas; and in various other directions these researches have been
found to throw light on the characteristics and relations of the Indians.

Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet has been continuously employed in the collection and study
of linguistic material pertaining to the Algonquian stock. During July he utilized
the services of Mr. William Jones, a mixed-blood Sauk of exceptional intelligence, a
pupil at Philips Academy, Andover. Although he has been absent from his tribe
for some time, he was able to convey to Dr. Gatschet a large amount of new material.
About the middle of October Dr. Gatschet visited the survivors of the Miami Indians
at Peru, Ind., and afterward proceeded to Miami town on Osage River, Indian Ter-
ritory, now the center of the Peoria confederacy. At both places he was able to obtain
extensive collections relating to the language and mythology of the people. During
the remainder of the fiscal year he was occupied in arranging the new material and
in comparing it with other Algonquian records, and made considerable progress in
the preparation of a comparative Algonquian vocabulary.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was employed in the early part of the year in applying the
laws of linguistic development to the Iroquoian stock, and thereby tracing the affin-
ities and prehistoric growth of this extensive and important group of American
Indians. Through this study he was able to ascertain the order in which different
members of the group differentiated, and either separated from the main body or
developed distinct organization. Representing the Iroquoian body as the trunk of
a genealogic tree, it appears that the lowest branch is represented by the Cherokee
and the second and third by the Huron and Seneca-Onondaga, the several tribes
represented by the uppermost branches being but slightly differentiated. Thus the
linguistic history of the Iroquoian stock is one of differentiation and division,
probably combined with assimilation from other stocks. It may be observed that
this history is parallel to that wrought out for the Siouan stock by Dorsey and that
which Gatschet is now tracing in the Algonquian stock; but this apparently aber-
rant course of linguistic evolution in certain instances is in no way inconsistent
with the general course of the development of language, which tends toward unity
through the combination and assimilation of the various tongues. Subsequently
Mr. Hewitt was occupied in analyzing and scheduling the vocabulary of the Tubari
language, collected in northern Mexico by Dr. Carl Lumholtz, and in preparing the
matter for publication. The closing months of the year were spent in cataloguing
manuscripts and other material stored in the fireproof vaults of the Bureau.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. A4l-

MYTHOLOGY.

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson continued the study and elaboration of her records
concerning the mythology and ceremonials of the Zuni Indians, and practically com-
pleted her monograph on this subject. ‘The Pueblo Indians, and especially the Zuni,
are characterized by an extraordinary subserviency to belief and ritual. Before her
connection with the Bureau Mrs. Stevenson became intimately acquainted with the
Indians of several pueblos and with their peculiar fiducial customs, and has conse-
quently had unprecedented opportunity for the study of observances and esoteric cere-
monials, and it has been her aim to record the details of her observations with pencil
and camera so fully as to perpetuate these mysteries for the use of future students. In
nearly every respect she regards her records concerning the Zuni as complete. At
the end of the fiscal year her monograph was finished with the exception of a single
chapter, the material for which was incomplete. It was planned to haye this mate-
rial collected during July and August, 1896.

During the greater part of the year Mr. Cushing’s work in mythology was sus-
pended, as he was engaged in general archeologic work. During the early part of
the year, however, he spent several weeks in combining the records of archeology,
mythology, and modern custom bearing on the evolution and multifarious uses of the
arrow, and incidentally on the invention of the bow. His researches illustrate well
not only the great importance of the arrow as a factor in human development, but
also the way in which primitive peoples think, act, and evolve. The final report on
this subject is not yet complete, but a preliminary statement of results was made
public in the form of a vice-presidential address before the American Association for
the Advancement of Science at the Springfield meeting, 1895.

PSYCHOLOGY.

Tt has not been found expedient in the Bureau to extend the researches to the
somatology of the Indians, and all the material pertaining to this subject has been
turned over to another branch of the Federal service; but it has been found impos-
sible to trace the development of the arts and institutions, beliefs and languages of
the aborigines without careful study of primitive modes of thought, and much
attention has been given by the Director and some of the collaborators to the sub-
ject of psychology, as exemplified among the Indians. The researches in this direc-
tion have been carried forward during the year in connection with the work in
classification of the Indians, and considerable material has been accumulated for
publication in future reports.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The bibliographic work, which has been continued for several years, practically
closed with the last fiscal year, and finally terminated, so far as the original plan is
concerned, with the death of James Constantine Pilling on July 26. The bibliogra-
phy of the Mexican languages was left in a nearly finished condition; but it has not
yet been found practicable to complete this work and prepare it for the press.

PUBLICATION,

Satisfactory progress has been made during the fiscal year in the editorial work
of the Bureau, which has been conducted chiefly by Mr. F. W. Hodge.

The manuscript of the fourteenth annual report was sent to press toward the close
of the last fiscal year, the first proofs were received on January 25, 1896, and by the
close of the fiscal year the body of the volume was nearly all in type. This report,
which is to be published in two volumes, making about 1,200 pages, comprises, in
addition to the report on the operations of the Bureau and an cxhaustive index, three
memoirs—‘‘ The Menomini Indians,” by Walter J. Hoffman, and ‘‘ Coronado’s Expe-
dition in 1540-1542,” by George Parker Winship, occupying the first part; the second
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

part containing a paper on the “‘Ghost-Dance Religion,” by James Mooney. This
report, like the preceding volumes of the series, will be amply illustrated, and it is
expected that it will be ready for distribution before the close of the calendar year.

Although the manuscript of the fifteenth annual report was transmitted to the
Public Printer on June 14, 1895, no text proof was received during the fiscal year;
the proofs of the illustrations have, however, been received and approved. The ac-
companying papers of the fifteenth report comprise ‘‘Stone Implements of the
Potomac-Chesapeake Tidewater Province,” by W. H. Holmes; ‘‘The Siouan In-
dians,” by W J McGee, a paper complementary with and introductory to a posthu-
mous memoir on ‘‘Siouan Sociology,” by James Owen Dorsey; ‘‘Tusayan Katcinas,”
by J. Walter Fewkes, and ‘‘The Repair of Casa Grande Ruin, Arizona, in 1891,” by
Comos Mindeleff. The volume contains upward of a hundred plates, in addition to ~
numerous figures in the text, all of which have been engraved.

The manuscript of the sixteenth annual report was sent to the Government Print-
ing Office on September 27, 1895. The illustrations have all been engraved, but no
proof of the text had been received at the close of the fiscal year. The accompanying
papers of thisreport are ‘‘ Primitive Trephining,” by Manuel Antonio Muniz and W J
McGee; ‘‘ Cliff Dwellings of Canyon de Chelly, Arizona,” by Cosmos Mindeleff, and
“The Maya Day Symbol,” by Cyrus Thomas.

The only volume published by the Bureau during the fiscal year was the thirteenth
annual report, which was delivered by the Public Printer in May, and at once trans-
mitted to the numerous correspondents of the Bureau throughout the world. ‘This
volume, for which the demand from students has been unusually large, contains, in
addition to the Director’s report of 59 pages, the following memoirs: (1) Prehistoric
textile art of eastern United States, by William H. Holmes, pages 3-46, Pls. I-IX,
figs. 1-28. (2) Stone art, by Gerard Fowke, pages 47-178, figs. 29-278. (3) Aborigi-
nal remains in Verde Valley, Arizona, by Cosmos Mindeleff, pages 179-261, Pls. X—L,
figs. 279-305. (4) Omaha dwellings, furniture, and implements, by James Owen
Dorsey, pages 263-288, figs. 306-327. (5) Casa Grande ruin, by Cosmos Mindeleff,
pages 289-319, Pls. LI-LX, figs. 328-330. (6) Outlines of Zuni creation myths, by
Frank Hamilton Cushing, pages 321-447.

Most of the material for the seventeenth annual report has been prepared for the ~
printer, though the manuscript has not yet been transmitted. The accompany-
ing papers comprise a memoir on ‘‘ The Seri Indians,” by W J McGee; the report by
Dr. Fewkes on decorative pottery and other material from Arizona; Mr. Mooney’s
memoir on ‘‘ Kiowa Calendars ;” a special paper on ‘‘ Navaho Heuses,” contributed by
Cosmos Mindelett, and the memoir on ‘Indian Land Cessions,” prepared by C. C.
Royce and revised by Dr. Thomas. The papers are fully illustrated by maps, photo-
graphs, and sketches. Like the fourteenth report, it will doubtless be bound in two
volumes.

MISCELLANEOUS WORK.

Library.—it is the plan of the Bureau to maintain a small working library for the
use of the collaborators, and it has grown slowly through accessions, acquired
chiefly by exchange for reports, the growth barely keeping pace with the publica-
tion of anthropologic works. At the end of the fiscal year the library numbered
5,501 volumes, having increased by 472 volumes during the preceding twelve months.
In addition, there was a proportionate accession of pamphlets and periodicals.

Illustrations.—The preparation of illustrations for the reports has been continued
under the direction of Mr. DeLancey W. Gill. The drawings have been executed by
a number of artists, while the photographs have been made chiefly by Mr. Dinwid-
die. In addition to the photographic work required for the immediate illustration
of reports, the various collaborators at work in the field are supplied with cameras,
and make considerable numbers of photographs, by which their notes are supple-
mented and enriched, and many of these photographs are incorporated in subsequent
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

reports. Extensive series of photographs were made during the year by Dr. Fewkes
in connection with his collections of pueblo pottery; by Mr. J. W. Mitchell, pho-
tographer for Mr. McGee in the Seriland expedition, and by Mr. Wells M. Sawyer,
artist for Mr. Cushing in his Florida work.

Exhibits.—The Bureau cooperated with the National Museum in arranging the
Smithsonian Institution exhibit in the Cotton States and International Exposition
held at Atlanta during the autumn of 1895. An alcove in the Government building
was allotted to the Bureau, and this was filled by the installation of six wall cases
and four floor cases, together with a number of bulky objects arranged on top of
the wall cases. This exhibit was so arranged as to illustrate the characteristics and
modes of life of three tribes, viz: The Cherokee Indians, who formerly occupied the
country in what is now northern Georgia, and whose descendants still live in
western North Carolina only 150 miles from the site of the exposition; the Papago
Indians, a little known though highly interesting tribe of peaceful Indians, occu-
pying southwestern Arizona and northern Sonora; and the Seri Indians, a fierce
and exclusive tribe of the Gulf of California, part of whom were found on their
borderland and in the course of an expedition by the Bureau during 1894. In
addition to the objects exhibited, there were in two wall cases illustrations of the
physical characteristics and costumary of the Papago and Seri Indians. The former
were represented by a group of life-size figures engaged in the manufacture of
pottery—their typical industry. In the other case a life-size figure of a Seri warrior
was introduced. The collections were supplemented by a series of twelve trans-
parencies, made from photographs, showing the Papago and Seri Indians in charac-
teristic attire, with their habitations and domestic surroundings. Inthe installation
of this exhibit, primary attention was given to fidelity of representation rather
than to artistic finish or grouping; and it is a source of gratification to observe
that the exhibit attracted much attention during the progress of the exposition. It
was awarded a grand prize, diploma, and gold medal.

NECROLOGY.

James Constantine Pilling, who died July 26, 1895, was a native of the national
capital, where he was born November 16, 1846. He was educated in the public schools
and Gonzaga College, and subsequently strengthened his predilection toward books
by taking a position in a leading bookstore of the city; at the same time he studied
the then novel art of stenography, in which he became remarkably proficient. At
the age of twenty he became a court stenographer. His services soon came into
demand among the Congressional committees and in different commissions employed
in the settlement of war claims. In every instance his notable speed and accuracy
were joined with even more notable discretion and straightforwardness that gained
for him the esteem of all with whom he came in contact. His career as stenographer
was in every respect exemplary, and his example served to hasten the general intro-
duction, and at the same time to elevate the standard, of stenographic art as an aid in
the transaction of the public business.

In 1875 Mr. Pilling was employed by the Director, then in charge of the geolog-
ical and topographical surveys of the Rocky Mountain region, to aid in collecting
native vocabularies and traditions, a task for which he was eminently fitted by

‘reason of his phonetic and manual skill. In this service as in his earlier work he
displayed not only high ability but signal strength of character. His connection
with the survey was continued until that organization was brought to an end in
1879 by the institution of the United States Geological Survey to carry forward the
geologic work and the Bureau of American Ethnology to continue the ethnologie
researches; he was then transferred to the Bureau of Ethnology, where his work on
the Indian languages was continued. During this period of connection with ethno-
logic work his studious habits were strengthened, and he developed great interest in
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the literature relating to the Indians; and he readily adopted the suggestion of the
Director to begin the preparation of a list of books and papers containing Indian
linguistics. In this study the industry and accuracy which characterized his steno-
graphic work were constantly displayed, and ever-increasing confidence was reposed
in his trustworthiness. In connection with his stenographic and bibliographic work,
he was intrusted with the supervision of the editorial work of the reports of the
Rocky Mountain survey and the newly instituted Bureau, and in addition consider-
able clerical work fell to him; yet every duty was performed with alacrity, fidelity,
and wisdom. Despite the multiplication of duties, his literary and bibliographic
methods remained excellent, and even improved with time; and his conscientious
care was so invariably manifested in his bibliographic work that his rapidly growing
list came to be recognized as a standard from which it were bootless to appeal. It
was during these years, from 1875 to 1880, that the foundation for Pilling’s character
as bibliographer was laid and securely established.

In 1881 the Director of the EKthnologic Bureau was made Director also of the
United States Geological Survey, and Mr. Pilling was appointed chief clerk of the
Survey, and the customary administrative duties were devolved on him. These
duties were ever performed energetically yet judiciously, and withal so courteously
and impartially as to gain for him the confidence of every collaborator in that
rapidly growing Bureau. In this position he continued until June 30, 1892. During
this period he served also as chief clerk of the Ethnologic Bureau in an eminently
acceptable manner; and although his administrative work as the second officer in
the two Bureaus might well have been regarded as sufficient to occupy all the ener-
gies of one man, he never forgot his bibliography, and so ordered his duties that
few days passed without some addition to his list of books on Indian linguistics.
Meantime his search for rare and little-known works brought him into correspond-
ence with dealers, bibliophiles, missionaries on the outposts of civilization, travel-
ers in Indian lands, and many others, and he frequently found it necessary to pur-
chase books in order that their contents might be examined and their titles noted;
and in this way he gradually accumulated a unique library—one of the richest col-
lections of rare books relating to Indian tongues now in existence. In 1885 there
was issued for the use of collaborators and correspondents of the Bureau, in a small
edition, a quarto volume of nearly twelve hundred pages, entitled ‘‘ Proof-sheets of
a Bibliography of the Languages of the North American Indians, by James Constan-
tine Pilling.” This volume represented the results of Mr. Pilling’s bibliographic
work up to that date, and served as a basis for the classification, on the part of the
Director, of the North American tribes by linguistic characters. The printing of this
_ volume served to deepen the interest of the bibliographer in his task, and within a
year or two the issue of a series of bibliographies relating to various Indian stocks
or families was begun.

As time passed Mr. Pilling began to develop premonitory symptoms of locomotor
ataxia, and his duties were varied, so far as the legal conditions controlling govern-
mental bureaus permitted, in the hope of bringing relief; but despite every effort
the malady increased. In 1892 he was relieved of his duties as chief clerk of the
Geological Survey and the Bureau of American Ethnology, and was transferred to
the latter Bureau and employed solely in continuing the bibliographic work. For
a time he benefited by the transfer, and his duty was performed with great energy-
and continued skill and success, so that by the end of 1894 his bibliographies of the
Eskimo, Siouan, Iroquoian, Algonquian, Athapascan, Chinookan, Salishan, and Wak-
ashan languages were completed and printed. He was then engaged in the bibli-
ography of the Indian languages of Mexico, and this was carried forward during the
early months of 1895, even after its author had become practically helpless through
the insidious and uncontrollable advance of a hopeless disease. This work was not
finished.

The series of bibliographies prepared by Mr. Pilling are a monument to his memory
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

and a model for students. In thoroughness and accuracy of work they afford a bright
example of American scholarship.

In personal character Mr. Pilling was above reproach. No man was more steadfast
to his moral and intellectual convictions, which were held with that charity for
others which is possible only to those who have strong and well-founded convictions
of their own. The example and influence of his character will long remain on the
institutions with which he was connected.

Respectfully submitted. J. W. POWELL,

Director.

APPENDIX ITI.

REPORT ON THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL
EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1896.

Sir: [ haye the honor to submit the following report upon the operations of the
Bureau of International ixchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896:

The actual number of packages received from all sources for distribution during
the year ending June 30, 1896, was 18,240 less than during the preceding year,
aithough 540 names were added to the list of foreign correspondents and the domes-
tic list was increased by 966.

During the year a large number of Government departmental publications,
being within the weight limited by the postal regulations, have been forwarded
direct by mail, whereas similar transmissions ordinarily pass through the Exchange
Bureau. This fact is accountable in part for the decrease of the number of trans-
missions as compared with the preceding year.

TABULAR STATEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE BUREAU.

The work of the Bureau is succinetly given in the following table, prepared in
accordance with the form used in preceding reports:

The expense of the exchange system is provided in part by direct appropriation
by Congress to the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose and in part by appro-
priations made to different Government Departments or Bureaus, either contingent
or specific, for repayment to the Institution for a portion of the cost of transportation.

Sven with the close economy necessarily exercised in the disbursement of the
direct appropriations in support of the exchange service, the Institution would not
have been able to transmit exchanges with requisite promptness or regularity had
it not been for the revenue derived, from the charge of 5 cents per pound weight
made to Government Departments and Bureaus and to State institutions on their
exchanges, both going and coming. This charge was authorized by the Board of
Regents as far back as 1878, and has since been maintained. Though the appropria-
tions have heen increased from time to time, they have not kept pace with the grow-
ing demands of the service, and since its inauguration there has never been a time
that the practice could have been abolished or even temporarily suspended.

The appropriation made by Congress to the Institution for the exchange service
during the fiscal year 1895-96 was in the following language:

“Wor expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, seventeen thousand dollars.”

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution on account of international exchanges for the year immediately preceding
July 1, 1896, were as follows:

The foregoing statement shows that the entire amount received from Government
Bureaus and other sources was $3,469.72, which, added to the direct appropriation
of $17,000, makes the aggregate income $20,469.72. This amount was insufficient
to meet outstanding obligations, and the Institution was therefore called upon to
advance the sum of $98.42.

CORRESPONDENTS.

The total number of correspondents of the Exchange Bureau now aggregates 24,914,
an increase of 1,506 over last year; of this number, 18,900 are foreign and 6,014 are
domestic, about 40 per cent of which being institutions and 60 per cent individuals.
This entire list may be considered active, and for convenience each debit and credit
account is kept on separate cards, easily discernible on account of using different
colors, thus aiding greatly in expediting the work. These cards are assembled in
geographical order, making them at all times accessible for quick reference.

The printing of a revised list of foreign correspondents deserves early considera-
tion. In March, 1895, the Secretary authorized the preparation of a revised list, and
Mr. Boehmer promptly perfected a card catalogue for that purpose, eliminating some
duplications and adding many new names. Action upon the publication of the list,
however, has not been approved for the reason that sufficient means in excess of
amount necessary to meet current expenses have not been available.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

The number of official United States Government publications sent to the State
libraries of foreign countries during the year in accordance with the act of Congress
of 1867 and the Brussels treaty of 1886 was 15,458, and the number received from those
sources and deposited in the Library of Congress was 8,038. The United States
Government Departments have forwarded to their foreign correspondents 16,621
packages, and have received in return 10,512. Taken collectively, the packages of
exchanges transmitted for the Government in all its branches aggregate 57 per cent
of the entire number handled.

While the receipts from abroad for deposit in the Library of Congress have been
much larger during the year than those reported for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1895, the increase has evidently been occasioned by large receipts from sources that
made no shipments during the previous year, and the considerable increase can not
therefore be considered permanent in character.

As the new building for the Library of Congress approaches completion and much-
needed space will soon be available for accessions, a special agent should be sent
abroad for the purpose of obtaining contributions, in order, if possible, to make the
receipts more consistent with the shipments,

EFFICENCY OF THE SERVICE.

The exchange relations with Greece are still, as in the past two years, in an unsat-
isfactory condition, and at present no packages are forwarded to that country except
those emanating from Government Bureaus and scientific contributions which as to
size and weight are sufliciently within the requirements of the postal service to admit
of their being forwarded direct by post.

The exchanges with Mexico also continue to be unsatisfactory, and the transmis-
sion of parliamentary documents is suspended pending the result of an effort now
being made through diplomatic correspondence to establish a systematic exchange of
publications by a responsible representative to be duly authorized by the Mexican
Government. Publications of scientific bureaus and societies are forwarded direct
by mail, however, as before stated.

The official exchange of public documents is also temporarily suspended with
Japan, owing to the absence of a systematic provision for the proper conduct of the

SM 96 4

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

work. The Japanese minister is in correspondence with his Government, and it is
hoped satisfactory arrangements will soon be effected.

The increased appropriation for 1895-96 over previous years has enabled the
Bureau to employ some additional assistance and to more expeditiously transmit the
packages intrusted to it. The foreign service could, however, be made much more
effective if the appropriation was sufficient to admit of forwarding cases by fast
steamers instead of being compelled to rely upon slower conveyance as is now occa-
sioned by forced economy.

No provision has yet been made in Congressional appropriations for the immediate
exchange of parliamentary documents in accordance with the treaty concluded at
Brussels in 1886, and for which the Secretary of State recommended that $2,000 be
appropriated.

It is my pleasure to inform you of the efficiency of the employees of the Exchange
Bureau, and to express my appreciation of the energy with which they uniformly
endeavor to prevent the work from accumulating. I beg also to call your attention
to the interest taken in all affairs of the Institution by its agents in Europe, Dr.
Felix Fliigel in Leipsic and Messrs. William Wesley & Son in London.

Below is a list of transportation companies and others that continue to aid the
Institution to a marked degree in contributing free freight or charging only a mini-
mum, and in otherwise disinterestedly aiding in the diffusion of knowledge:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

HISTORY OF THE EXCHANGE SERVICE.
By W. 1. ADAMs.

The following history of the exchange service and its methods has been prepared
by Mr. W. I. Adams from the archives of the Institution:

Tt seems altogether appropriate, while the Smithsonian Institution is commemo-
rating the fiftieth year of its usefulness, to succinctly review the progress and
accomplishments of its system for the exchange of the duplicate copies of literary
and scientific publications from the beginning. Though but a subordinate branch
of the Institution, the division of exchanges has done a large part in the increase
and diffusion of knowledge, and materially assisted in the promotion of the object
for which the Institution was established by its founder.

The forwarding by the Smithsonian Institution of its publications and annual
reports to other scientific institutions and to individuals interested in science through-
out the world was inaugurated almost at the very commencement of these publica-
tions, under a plan of procedure adopted by the Board of Regents Deceraber 8, 1847,
upon the recommendation of Professor Henry, and in exchange the Institution
solicited the scientific works published by its correspondents.

The details attendant upon this important function of the Institution were in the
beginning supervised by Professor Henry, and so fully did they command his atten-
tion that not a little of the work was done by him personally, until July, 1850, when
Professor Baird was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Institution, and almost
immediately assumed direct charge of the exchanges.

Mr. George H. Boehmer, in his History of the Smithsonian Exchanges compiled to
1881, recites the fact that other attempts had been made for the exchange of literary
and scientific publications, notably by the Royal Library of France in 1694, and in
the United States early in the present century by the American Philosophical
Society, founded in Philadelphia in 1743, and by the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, founded in Boston in 1780. The prime object in each case cited was the ulti-
mate enrichment of its own library by reciprocal exchange, while the results desired
by the Smithsonian Institution were not solely for the purpose of increasing its
collection, but for the diffusion of knowledge among men.

So favorably did Professor Henry’s plan impress scientists that a committee was
appointed by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to consider its methods in
detail, and on December 7, 1847, the committee reported as follows:

“Tf can scarcely be doubted that an important impulse would be given by the
Smithsonian Institution in this way to the cultivation of scientific pursuits, while
the extensive and widely ramified system of distribution throughout the United
States and the world would insure them a circulation which works of science could
searcely attain in any other way.”

At the commencement of its exchange system the Institution was much annoyed
by the excessive expense and troublesome delays caused by the requirements of the
United States custom-house service, and no relief was felt until, after earnest and
concerted effort, Congress was led to adopt the enlightened policy of admitting
through the custom-houses free of duty scientific publications from foreign countries
addressed to the Smithsonian Institution, either for its own use or as contributions
to learned societies and institutions throughout the United States.

This appropriate act of the American Congress stimulated foreign scientific soci-
eties to interest their Governments to the same end. Among the first to take active
steps in this direction was England.

On March 19, 1852, Mr. Edward Sabine, vice-president and treasurer of the Royal
Society, wrote Professor Henry, in reply to his letter urging action by the Royal
Society in the same direction, saying:

“The subject has since been brought by the Earl of Rosse under the consideration
of Her Majesty’s Government, who have shown, as might be expected, much readi-

ness to meet in the same spirit the liberal example which has been set by the United
States, inexempting free of duty scientific books sent as presents from this country
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to the Smithsonian Institution, and through that institution to other institutions and
to individuals cultivating science in the United States.”

The sentiments thus expressed, although duly presented to Parliament, did not at
once meet with results entirely satisfactory, though duties were remitted on books
not foreign reprints of British copyrights. It was but a short time, however, before
the generous cooperation of the Royal Society and the course recommended by it to
the Government of Great Britain had its effect, and subsequently all packages from
the Smithsonian Institution were admitted to the English ports free of duty, not only
those bearing addresses in Great Britain, but to many places on the continent of
Europe and the East Indies. ; !

The matter of admitting exchanges free of duty having been satisfactorily ad-
usted with the Governments of the United States and Great Britain, and after thus
establishing a precedent, other Governments, recognizing the desirability of the plan,
soon adopted like measures, and in the Smithsonian Report for the year 1854 the
Secretary stated:

“There is no port to which the Smithsonian parcels are shipped where duties are
charged on them, a certified invoice of contents by the Secretary being sufficient to
pass them through the custom-house free of duty. On the other hand, all packages
addressed to the Institution arriving at the ports of the United States, are admitted,
without detention, duty free. This system of exchange is, therefore, the most exten-
sive and efficient which has ever been established in any country.”

The establishment of the Smithsonian exchange system soon became so widely
known that the increased responsibilities and augmented expense threatened a drain
upon the resources of the Institution to such an extent as to be alarming, and seemed
to indicate a probable necessity of curtailing in some manner the expense of the task
it had undertaken single-handed. :

In 1855, with a view to diminishing, if possible, a part of the expense of the
exchange system, letters were written to the principal transportation companies
setting forth the nature of the undertaking, and, in consideration of the great ben-
efit derived from the service, asking that they consider the subject of a reduction of
rates. The replies received from nearly all the companies addressed were gratifying
in the extreme—some consented to charge merely a nominal rate, while others cheer-
fully offered to transport exchanges free of any charge whatever.

With this generous assistance of the transportation companies, the Institution was
enabled to continue the work and to maintain the system for the time being, not-
withstanding the growing demands upon it.

The cooperation of the Department of State has been of incalculable value in the
furtherance of the aims of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge, and the
results attained would have been difficult to surmount had it not been for the intel-
ligent and courteous aid contributed by the representatives of the diplomatic and
consular service in all parts of the world. The same consideration is due to the dip-
lomatic representatives of foreign Governments residing in Washington, many of
whom have not only done their utmost to aid their countrymen in obtaining the
most advanced ideas of scientists throughout the world, but have been personaliy
interested in scientific study.

In no field of international exchange of the products of afei is reciprocity so ener-
getically demonstrated as in the promulgation of scientific research and higher edu-
cation. The history of the Smithsonian exchanges demonstrates the far-reaching
influence of study to such an extent as to make it impossible to conceive of the mag-
nitude to which the service may attain and the results that must necessarily follow
to the benefit of mankind.

Although on several occasions subsequent to 1840 special measures were adopted by
Congress for the foreign distribution of special Government publications in exchange
for similar works of other countries to be deposited in the Library of Congress, no
general action was taken until 1867, when the following act was passed:

“‘ Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Unitid States of America
Congress assembled, That fifty copies of all documents hereaiter printed by order
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AM

of either House of Congress, and fifty copies additional of all documents printed in
excess of the usual number, together with fifty copies of each publication ¢ssued
by any Department or Bureau of the Government, be placed at the disposal of the
Joint Committee on the Library, who shall exchange the same, through the agency
of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works published in foreign countries, and
especially by foreign Governments, as may be deemed by said committee an equiva-
lent; said works to be deposited in the Library of Congress.

‘Approved March 2, 1867.”

It will be observed from the text of the law that the primary object of the act
was to secure for the Library of Congress promptly, and with regularity, the official
publications of foreign countries concerning legislation, jurisprudence, commerce,
manufactures, agriculture, statistics, ete.

No appropriation was made, or even intimated, for this service, but as several
months and perhaps a year would elapse before a sufficient number of documents
would accumulate to admit of a systematic transmission, a circular letter was mailed
through the official channel of the Department of State for the purpose of ascertain-
ing what Governments would cooperate in the proposed arrangement. In due course
so many foreign Governments accepted the proposition as to insure its success, though
some countries were derelict in specifying to whom or in what manner the cases
should be forwarded, it being understood that they would be delivered free of freight
charges to any place in Washington or New York that might be designated.

These delays in consummating the desired plan were primarily due to the absence
of concerted action in designating proper officers or establishing bureaus in differ-
ent countries and providing sufficient means for defraying the attendant expenses.
Though supported by the leading men in literature and science throughout the
world, it was a slow process to obtain Government aid in the several countries most
interested in the movement.

Several attempts were made by the Institution to induce Congress to assist in
defraying the expense incurred in the distribution of Government publications, and
also to obtain aid in the distribution of works upon scientific and literary subjects,
the entire expense of which having in the year 1876 exceeded $10,000, or one-fourth
of the income of the Institution, and was threatening a curtailment of expenses and
serious impediment to research in its several scientific branches.

The persistent efforts of scientists and the growing interest manifested by the
various Governments resulted in the holding of an International Congress in Paris
during the months of August and September, 1875, at which were present several
hundred scientists from all parts of the globe, and representing the following National
Governments: Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Chile, Dominican Republic, France, Ger-
many, Italy, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Swiss
Confederation, Turkey, and the United States. As a result of this conference the
following plan for the international exchange of scientific publications was proposed
and unanimously adopted:

“The undersigned delegates propose to request their respective Governments to
organize in e: ich countr y a central bureau, whose duty it shall be to collect such
cartographic, geographic, and other publications as may be issued at the expense of
the State, and to distribute the same among the various nations which adopt the
present programme,

“These bureaus, which shall correspond directly with each other, shall serve to
transmit the international scientific communications of learned societies.

“They shall serve as the intermediate agents for the procurement, on the best pos-
sible terms, of books, maps, instruments, etce., published or manufactured in each
country, and desired by any of the contracting countries.

“Bach country shall transmit at least one copy of its national publications to the
other contracting countries.”

In order to formulate the general plan adopted by the International Congress into
tangible form to admit of more definitely arriving at the desired conclusions by the
different countries interested, Baron de Vatteville was charged by his colleagues
with the duty of forming at Paris a commission of exchanges, which, on January 29,
1876, adopted a code of rules, a copy of which was duly transmitted to Professor
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Henry through the Department of State, asking for an expression of opinion as to
its feasibility. The plan provided that each Government should designate a repre-
sentative bureau for the administration of all the affairs pertaining to exchanges.

After extensive correspondénce between the commission of exchanges at Paris, the
Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution with regard to
the position this country would take in the organization of a proposed exchange
bureau, it was finally made apparent that the Secretary of State was anxious to
make the Smithsonian Institution the Government’s official representative in the
matter, its experience during more than a quarter of a century making it unquali-
fiedly the most efficient agency. The great expense, already burdensome to the
Institution, and which must necessarily be largely increased by assuming the duties
of the official medium of exchange of the Government, caused a renewal of effort in
the direction of obtaining financial assistance from Congress, and the Department of
State recommended that Congress should make an appropriation of $7,000 in aid
of the Institution for the year of 1881. An allowance, however, of $3,000 only was
granted. Even that amount was of great assistance, and admitted of the assump-
tion that annual appropriations would follow in course.

The precedent of making Congressional appropriations in support of international
exchanges thus being established, appropriations were thereafter made yearly, and
in proportion more nearly commensurate with the growing demands of the service.

Although the act providing for the distribution of fifty copies of all Government
publications was approved in 1867, the delay previously noted prevented their ship-.
ment abroad until 1873, since which time cases have been forwarded at comparatively
regular intervals on an average of three cases each year, the parliamentary publica-
tions forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution in exchange being invariably for the
Library of Congress.

Subsequent conferences held at Brussels in 1877 and 1880, and again in 1883, tended
to more fully perfect the plan inaugurated at the Paris congress. The articles of
agreement adopted at the conference in 1883 were referred by the Department of State
to the Smithsonian Institution for review, and on March 15, 1886, another conference
was called at Brussels, at which the articles were signed by duly appointed diplo-
matic delegates and laid before Congress, with the result that the agreement was
approved and made the subject of a proclamation by the President January 15, 1889.
The countries becoming parties to this agreement were Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Por-
tugal, Servia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.

The second agreement, adopted by the same convention and by the same countries,
with the exception of Switzerland, provided for the immediate transmission of par-
liamentary journals and documents to the other countries signing the agreement as
soon as they were published. Uruguay and Peru subsequently became parties to
the agreement, making a total of ten States under treaty obligations to maintain
exchange relations.

The first treaty, so far as this country was concerned, did not change the existing
practice of the exchange service as conducted by the Smithsonian Institution. The
second treaty, providing for the immediate exchange of parliamentary journals, has
not been made effective on the part of this Government through lack of action by
Congress, first, by not placing the necessary documents at the disposal of the exchange
bureau, and second, by not providing financial aid for carrying on the work; nor, in
fact, has this treaty been fully complied with by any of the contracting Governments.

Although England, France, Germany, and Russia, it will be noticed, did not become
parties to the Brussels treaties, special exchange arrangements were made between
these countries and the United States under the act of Congress of 1867, and have
since been successfully conducted.

In France and Russia exchange bureaus are supported as a part of the administra-
tive functions of their respective Governments, while between England and Germany
and the United States special arrangements have been made for the exchange of par-
liamentary publications.

Although exchange relations have been established with nearly all civilized
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

nations, the quantity of publications received has not, with the possible exception
of England, compared favorably with the quantity sent. This inequality may per-
haps be explained by the fact that no country publishes as liberally as the United
States, and hence has fewer duplicate copies to offer in exchange.

During the past ten years an average of about thirty-five boxes of official publica-
tions of the United States Government have been forwarded to each of forty-three
countries, the total number of publications thus sent being 227,400, or an average of
5,300 to each Government, while it is estimated that but 45,169 packages have been
received from all foreign countries for the Library of Congress during the same
period.

It is hardly equitable to use the above figures in comparison, as the outgoing pub-
lications are of actual record, while exchanges from foreign countries are often
received in packages containing several pamphlets or volumes, and the actual num-
ber of publications can not be ascertained, as the packages are not opened in the
exchange bureau, and, furthermore, owing to the crowded condition of the rooms
occupied by the Library of Congress the boxes for several years arriving intact have
not been opened for inspection and classification pending the removal of the Library
to its new building.

As before mentioned, the entire expense of supporting the Smithsonian exchange
service was borne by the Smithsonian fund from 1846 to 1881. The cost of the
service for the five years from 1846 to 1850, inclusive, was $1,603. The next year,
1851, the expense was materially increased, being $2,010.49. In 1868 it had risen to
$4,870.72, and in 1876 to $10,199.10. By the assistance from Congress in appropri-
ating $3,000 in aid of the exchange service in 1881, the expense to the Institution was
reduced to $7,467.84 for that year.

Although free freight had been granted by many transportation companies, both
at home and abroad, and duties had been remitted everywhere, and although learned
societies throughout the world had cooperated with the Institution to a marked
degree, the expense to the Institution to 1881 had aggregated $141,508.96.

The National Government, although increasing its appropriations from time to
time, has not entirely supported the exchange bureau, even in later years. During
the period that Congressional appropriations have been effective the Smithsonian
has been compelled to advance from its limited income an aggregate of $45,175.82
for the transportation of Government documents, which amount has not been
refunded by Congress.

The rules under which the exchange bureau is conducted provide, in addition to
the distribution of official publications of this Government to State libraries of
foreign countries, for the forwarding of publications of literary and scientific socie-
ties and individuals as donations to correspondents in foreign countries and intended
as exchanges, for which like contributions are expected in return.

No reimbursement is exacted from scientific societies, institutions of learning, or
individuals when their contributions for foreign distribution are delivered at the
Institution, domestic charges prepaid. In order to prevent an overtaxation upon the
resources of the Institution, its Regents in 1878 authorized a charge to the bureaus
of the National Government and to State institutions of a part of the expense
incurred, both on incoming and outgoing exchanges, and the uniform rate in such
instances of 5 cents per pound weight was adopted and has since been maintained.

Packages when delivered to duly authorized foreign agents for transmission to
the United States are also forwarded without any expense to the contributor, and
upon arrival at the Institution are entered and forwarded to destination by regis-
tered mail under frank. The franking privilege is not only employed in the United
States, but also in sending packages to Canada and Mexico.

The above is in brief an explanation of the method employed in the transmission
of exchanges between the United States and foreign countries. The procedure
which should be invariably pursued by contributors is more particularly illustrated
in the following:

Packages should be enveloped in stout paper and secured with strong twine, each
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

package not exceeding one-half of one cubic foot in bulk; they should be addressed
legibly and as fully as possible without using abbreviations, and if an acknowledg-
ment is required a blank receipt should be inclosed. When a consignment is com-
plete all packages should be inclosed in boxes and forwarded by freight to the
Smithsonian Institution, carriage prepaid. Before delivering consignments to trans-
portation companies a list of names and addresses corresponding to those on packages
should be forwarded by mail to the Smithsonian Institution, or to the foreign dis-
tributing agent of the Institution, according as the transaction may be of domestic
or foreign origin. This procedure not only serves as a means for verifying each
package when received, and enables the Institution to trace consignments if not
delivered after a reasonable time has elapsed, but forms a permanent record for
future reference.

Upon the receipt at the Institution of a consignment the entire transaction is given
an invoice number, which serves as a basis for all entries made in connection with
its distribution, and when debiting institutions or individuals to whom packages are
addressed the corresponding invoice number is used, thereby avoiding the necessity
of writing the name of the donor oneach card. After all entries are made the books
are packed in boxes and are forwarded by freight to the agents of the Institution
abroad or to the distributing bureaus in foreign countries that have been designated
toactin such capacity. Ineach package a receipt card is inserted bearing the invoice
number assigned to each particular contribution, and when, as is often the case,
several individual contributions are assembled in one package bearing asingle address,
the card inserted bears all the invoice numbers of the contents of that package. It
is of the utmost importance that these cards should be receipted and returned to the
Institution without delay as evidence of proper delivery, and as each acknowledg-
ment is noted, a habitual failure in this regard may give rise to a doubt of delivery
and subsequent packages may be returned to the contributors as undeliverable.

Packages received from abroad for distribution in the United States are treated
in the same manner, and similar receipts are inclosed in parcels, which are returna-
ble to the Institution under frank. These cards are, for the purpose of preventing
confusion, of a color unlike those forwarded with packages for foreign distribution.

Purchased books, instruments, and natural history specimens (whether purchased
or presented) are not accepted for transmission by the Institution or its agents with-
out special permission in each instance.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX IY.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896:

Considerable attention has been paid during the year to the improvement of the
grounds and the construction of roads authorized by Congress. The principal road
of the park, which runs from the Quarry road westward to Connecticut avenue
extended, has been improved over a part of its course by a good layer of macadam.
It would have been well to have completed the macadamizing, but the funds at the
disposal of the park did not permit this, and it will be deferred until next year.
Work has been continued upon the driveway that proceeds from the Woodley road
into the park. It will be remembered that the Woodley road lies so far above the
level of the park that the construction of this driveway made necessary a heavy
filling of earth. This is very unsightly, as the slopes are abrupt and difficult to
modify by planting. If it is to remain where it now is, a sufficient amount of earth
should be added to make the slopes easy and natural. The amount appropriated
was insufficient to complete the fill so as to make an easy grade and neither mac-
adam nor gutters have been provided, so that the road washes badly during the
winter storms and is impracticable for pleasure driving during wet and freezing
weather. It is, however, passable from the Woodley Bridge as far as Rock Creek.

It has been decided to restore the old-Adams Mill road upon practically its former
line. The configuration of the ground forbids making this the ordinary width of
the roads of the park, the hillside on which it is built being quite steep at certain
places, but a satisfactory driveway can be constructed. The survey of this work
was completed and a contract for it prepared before the close of the fiscal year.
The road will be well macadamized, with a top dressing of pulverized limestone.
Retaining walls will be built where necessary, and the whole will be properly gut-
tered and protected.

A number of interesting features have been added to the park, either for the pur-
pose of beautifying it or for the convenience and accommodation of the animals.
Two small fish ponds have been built near the Quarry road entrance, the banks in
the neighborhood of the seal pond have been dressed and planted, and the débris
from the intercepting sewer has been removed.

The accompanying illustrations show what has been done in preserving the native
beauty of the Park. The {first of these shows a rustic bridge formed of bowlders
thrown across a little chasm cut out by a small stream that falls into Rock Creek.
This has taken the place of an unsightly wooden bridge. Another picture shows
where a small artificial pond for waterfowl empties into Rock Creek. The great
advantage of such treatment is in the fact that it harmonizes with the surround-
ing scenery, and the visitor need not realize that any interference with the natural
features has occurred, while the surface after treatment presents a striking contrast
with the raw and denuded condition of those localities where engineering work has
been carried on without regard to final effect.

The principal animal house has been greatly improved by the construction of com-
modious exterior cages into which the animals can pass whenever the weather is

61
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

suitable. Water is provided for each of these, and shade trees, suitably protected,
have been planted in them, so that it is believed that they will add greatly to the
comfort of the animals. Another very important improvement in this house has
been effected by repairing the roof of the extension and rearranging the heating
apparatus so as to adequately warm it. Although more habitable than before, it is
not yet by any means a satisfactory building for tender animals, and it is hoped that
this extension may at no distant day be rebuilt of stone, so as to correspond with the
remainder of the house.

Perhaps the most urgent need of the park at the present time is the erection of
buildings in which animals requiring varied conditions of exposure can be properly
treated. At present there are practically but two conditions provided, those for
animals that live out of doors during the entire winter and those of animals that
require heat but are able to endure considerable changes of temperature. There is
no provision for animals that live in close tropical climates where the heat varies but
little.

Birds and monkeys and other animals from the valleys of the Amazon and the
Orinoco find rapid changes very unfavorable. Besides this, it is impossible to give
proper attention to the natural habits and idiosyncrasies of animals when they are
kept promiscuously within asingle inclosure. Timid animals suffer greatly when put
in a house with large carnivorous beasts. The sight of such animals terrifies them
and the cries of creatures whom they instinctively recognize as their natural enemies
sometimes affects them so that they die from fright. A new building for monkeys
and birds and a new elephant house are greatly needed.

The quarters for hardy animals are not in every respect what they should be.
The principal defect is in the bear yards and dens in the abandoned quarry, near the
main entrance to the park. These are too damp in winter and too hot in summer for
the health of the animals, and are really unsuitable for them. One of the cages has
become dangerous, because of the falling into it of large masses of rock. While
they are picturesque and striking, much better quarters could be devised for
the animals in other parts of the park. Upon some heavily wooded and cool
slope an inclosure of considerable size could be made,so that they could be con-
stantly upon the natural ground. Dry shelters could be provided either in hollow
trees or by adapting crevices of rocks. In such a yard a considerable number of
bears could be placed under conditions very similar to those of their native wilds.
If care were taken to select young animals that were properly tamed before being
placed in the inclosure, they would never have any fear of the public and would form
an attractive exhibit.

The buffalo yards should be much larger than at present. As the animals destroy
every green thing within reach, their paddocks soon present a very bare and forlorn
appearance. This could be partially avoided by having two sets of paddocks, one
of which could be occupied while the other was being allowed to recover from hard
usage. If the paddocks were larger, there would be less danger of the animals
injuring each other in their frequent conflicts, The largest bull of the herd was
killed during the year by the attack of one of the smaller ones, who determined to
contest his supremacy, and the small size of the inclosure prevented him from getting
away from his antagonist.

The need of a proper public comfort house at the park is even more pressing each
year as the number of visitors increases.

Some deaths of animals have occurred from accidental causes. A fine sea-lioness
was killed by the accidental explosion of a large quantity of dynamite near the pond
when she wasswimming. This dynamite was to be used by the workmen employed
in excavating for the intercepting sewer that passes through the park. The shock
of the explosion was heard all over the city. The sea-lioness was not immediately
killed, but died within twenty-four hours of the occurrence.

The beavers of the park are kept in two inclosures, and in both of these have built
themselves dams and shelters. It is found, however, that care must be taken to

APPENDIX VY.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1896.

Sir: The bolometric investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum has, under your
general direction, continued to be the main feature of the work of the Observatory
for the past year. While it has been found necessary to postpone a final account of
the result of this long investigation, yet it is confidently believed that such a pub-
lication can be made before many months more; and that the limit of accuracy
in determining the position of absorption lines, which was mentioned in the report
for the last year as the aim of endeavor, will be reached in the results shortly to be
communicated.

The year’s prosecution of the research will, for convenience, be discussed under
the following heads:

A. Measurement and elimination of ‘“‘the drift”! and other sources of error
in the spectrobolo-metric processes.

B. General spectrobolographic work.

C. Accessions of apparatus.

A. MEASUREMENT AND ELIMINATION OF SOURCES OF ERROR IN THE SPECTROBOLO-
METRIC PROCESSES.

As detailed in the report for the year ending June 30, 1895, it was then evident
that the bolographic curves were so encumbered with minute deflections due to earth
vibrations and extraneous electrical and magnetic disturbances, that the small and,
it was presumed, very numerous deflections corresponding to fine absorption lines
were greatly obscured. One of the means proposed for eliminating false and
retaining true lines has been the process of composite photography. The method
of application of this process had been as follows: 1. All the deflections in a series
of curves of a greater magnitude than a certain arbitrary amount were by the
“‘cylindric process” drawn out into lines. 2. The resulting ‘‘cylindrics” were suc-
cesstvely exposed before a single plate to give a composite.

It must be remarked the process of experiment has shown that this procedure is
not free from objection. While it is unquestionable that deflections great enough to
be surely recognized as genuine will be brought out, owing to the greater prominence
given them in ‘‘blocking in” the curves preparatory to making the ‘cylindrics,”
yet many of the genuine deflections of the same size as the accidental ones (for dis-
tinguishing which the process is chiefly useful) may possibly be eliminated; for
owing to the various sources of error in the bolometric processes, particularly the
superposition of accidental deflections over the true ones, to the personal error in
blocking in, and to the errors introduced in the photographic processes, slight lateral
displacements of the true lines in the separate cylindrics will always occur. Thus
it may frequently happen that in the final composite the less prominent lines, being
thus variable in their position to an amount equal to their own width, or even more,
may be eliminated. Lines corresponding to accidental deflections may, on the other
hand, be retained, since their number is very great in comparison with the number
of cylindrics employed in making composites, for it may thus frequently happen

17% will be remembered that “the drift” has hitherto been a principal source of
trouble in these researches. It consists in a slow progressive movement of the
needle due to a great variety of extraneous causes.

68
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

that there will be sufficiently close correspondence between such false lines in all the
cylindrics employed, so that they will appear in the final composite.

Of late another method of combining the results to be derived from the separate
curves has come into use at the observatory, which is briefly as follows:

1. Each of the several observers independently superposes the set of curves under
investigation, and from the general appearance and size of the deflections selects
those which he considers to probably correspond to genuine absorption bands, and
marks them relatively to their importance and to the evidence of their genuineness.

2. He then measures upon the comparator the positions of his selected deflections
on each curve separately without sight of the others.

3. The results thus obtained are averaged, throwing out such deflections as appear
from the divergence of the measurements to be accidental.

4, The mean results of the separate observers are compared and reduced, indicat-
ing the extent to which the observers agree with regard to the importance and verity
of the different deflections.

In view of the limitations of the composite process, it is proposed that it be kept
subordinate to that just described, and only used in the preparation of a spectrum
map in which the exact place of each line appearing shall be independently deter-
mined.

The multiplicity and injurious character of the accidental deflections continued
painfully evident throughout the bolographic harvest season of the year (the
months of September, October, and November). Fine days were also frequently lost
after cold weather came on, owing to the rapid ‘‘drift” of the galvanometer needle,
caused by the changing temperature conditions incident to the warming of the
observatory.

In these circumstances the work of taking bolographs was suspended for some
months, and the following important improvements were, after many experiments,
adopted, which have separately and in concert been signally successful in reducing
these sources of error:

1. In extension of the principle introduced at Allegheny, a battery of sixty storage
cells connected in parallel replaced the four cells formerly employed, and effected
great reduction of small accidental deflections of the galvanometer needle.

2, A specially constructed rheostat, entirely surrounded by a water jacket and pro-
vided with a slide wire adjustment operated mechanically from without, replaced
the resistance box before used to balance the bolometer strips. In this instrument
only asingle pair of coils of the same resistance as the particular bolometer employed
is used. The number of contacts between dissimilar metals is reduced to a mini-
mum, and all are kept from fluctuations of temperature by a continuous current of
water. ;

3. The galvanometer, formerly supported upon a system of flat stones and rubber,
has been suspended by three wires from a tripod, after the manner of Julius.! This
method of support is found to decidedly reduce the vibrations of the galvanometer

‘needle due to ground tremors.

4. The double-walled room which surrounds the spectrometer has been extended
to include the galvanometer also; and thus temperature fluctuations about the gal-
vanemeter control magnets have been reduced, to the great diminution of the
“ drift.”

5. The whole observatory has been equipped with an automatic system of temper-
ature regulation, and the heat is supplied both night and day from steam boilers in
the basement of the Smithsonian main building. So successful has this system
proved that during the cold months the whole fluctuations of temperature within
the spectrometer room are reduced to little more than a tenth of a degree.

6. A new galvanometer needle has been constructed with a considerably higher
degree of astaticism and somewhat greater sensitiveness than the one before in use.

As the result of the improvements mentioned above, the ‘‘ drift,” heretofore so

70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vexatious, has been reduced to such a degree that its whole amount for a week’s time
often does not exceed 2 centimeters, or the amount which it had in the early experi-
ments in a single minute. This result, it must be remembered, is reached with the
galvanometer adjusted to such a sensitiveness that a millimeter deflection on the
scale corresponds to six teu-billionths of an ampere in the galvanometer circuit. Not
only is the drift thus practically eliminated, but the small deflections from accidental
causes which heretofore so obscured the deflections corresponding to real absorption
lines, while still very numerous, are now reduced to an amplitude rarely exceeding
two-tenths ofa millimeter. Occasional deflections of a little greater magnitude occur,
but not often, and these can be readily eliminated in a comparison of curves. The
deflections now remaining are almost wholly due to ground tremors not entirely
eliminated by the system of suspension of the galvanometer.

This large decrease of drift and incidental deflections brought out the defects in
the construction of most bolometers hitherto in use, and on analysis it was found
that the enhanced ‘‘ drift” when these were employed was due to the hard rubber
insulation, and that small accidental deflections were caused by imperfect fastening
of the strips atthe ends. A bolumeter frame of metal with mica insulation was filled
at the observatory and has proved very satisfactory.

Another source of drift not before noticed was found to be the falling of the spec-
trum. upon the bolometer case during arun from A to 0, and it was entirely removed
by a suitable diaphragm.

These observations on the drift and false deflections in the record may be suitably
closed by the remark that under your instructions of March, 1896, it has been the
invariable practice to make a short record curve, with no heat falling on the bolom-
eter, both at the beginning and end of each bolograph, to show the instrumental
conditions prevailing. Such records were occasionally taken in former years, and
were included in the report of the number of bolographs taken. So many haye tbis
year been taken, however, that it seemed misleading to include them in the count,
and they are accordingly entirely neglected in the table of photographs given below,
and only those curves which represent some part of the spectrum are there counted
as bolographs.

After the approach of hot weather rendered it impossible to continue uniform
temperature conditions, the work of taking bolographs was again discontinued, and
extensive quantitative experiments were prosecuted to determine the magnitude of
the probable error arising from the many sources attendant upon the complicated
bolometric process. The results of these experiments revealed in several instances
greater error than was suspected, and led to important changes in the apparatus
which are not at the close of the period covered by this report entirely completed.

A detailed account of the methods employed in determining the various sources of
error must be postponed till the appearance of the forthcoming publication; but it
will be proper in this place to give a brief summary of the investigations.

Laying down as in the report for last year ending June 30, 1895, an accuracy of
one-tenth millimeter in position of a deflection upon the bolographic curve (corre-
sponding under the convention of speeds adopted to six-tenths second of are in
the spectrum, or to three-tenths second of arc on the circle) as the limit of accuracy
desired in the final results, this amount of error will be treated as in a sense the unit
of error in this discussion:

I. Sources of error in the optical apparatus.

1. Apparent displacements of the slit—
a. Momentary, from ground tremors and from air currents of different density
Displacements now negligible, as a result of recent improvements.
b. Periodic, from temperature and other changes in the supports of optical
apparatus. Important errors from this cause were within the last month
covered by this report eliminated.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Th

2. Imperfect adjustment of the prism-mirror combination for minimum deviation—

Errors from this cause proved negligible under the assumption of parallel rays.
As steps are now being taken to introduce a system of collimation for the
beam with a view to improve the definition of the optical system, further
discussion for a divergent beam is unnecessary.

3. Changes in the temperature of the prism—

No new data on the change of deviation with the temperature have been
obtained, but referring to those of a preliminary nature contained in your
paper on the ‘‘Temperature of the Moon,’'! it is believed that errors from
this source in curves taken under usual conditions will not exceed 2 seconds
of an arc in deviation. With the attainment vf accurate data such errors
may be corrected,

II. Sources of error which introduce accidental deflections in the record curves.

1. Disturbances primarily affecting the galvanometer needle including (a) earth
tremors; (b) magnetic disturbances.

2. Disturbances secondarily affecting the galvanometer needle through the bolome-
ter circuit including (a) those causing ‘“‘drift;” (b) those causing “ flutter”
in the records.

The whole effect of these four classes of disturbances as shown by the record
curves already mentioned will be, under usually good conditions, to displace
true deflections on an average about one-tenth millimeter on the plate. All
true deflections of a magnitude not greater than two-tenths millimeter are
lost among the false ones.

III. Sources of error from imperfect mechanisms.

1. Irregularities in the motion of the plate.
Errors from this source negligible.
2. Irregularities in the motion of the circle. ~
Errors now occasionally as great as 3 seconds of are; but steps being now
taken which promise to reduce these irregularities to a magnitude of five-
tenths second.
. Difficulty in correctly determining the ratio of plate and circle motions.
A more accurate method of determination now projected will undoubtedly
give sufficient accuracy.

(Ss)

IV. Sources of error in preparing cylindrics.

1. Personal error in “‘ blocking in.”
Experiments show that the mean displacements of lines from this cause vary
with three persons from 0.16 to 0.32 millimeter.
2. Imperfect adjustments of camera.
As a result of recent changes the error from this cause will not exceed one-
tenth millimeter in the length of a 20-centimeter plate, and is within certain
limits proportional to the length of the plate employed.

VY. Errors in comparator measurements.

1. Personal error in the determination of a minimum upon the curves.

Experiments show that the average deviations of the mean of two observations
by one observer from the mean result of six observations on the same curve
by three observers varies with different persons from 0.022 to 0.016 millimeter.

2. Errors peculiar to the comparator.

A new comparator is projected for use in the observatory in which it is

believed these errors will be negligible.

1S. P. Langley, ‘‘Temperature of the Moon.” Memoirs of the National Academy
of Science, Volume IV, 9, Appendix 3.
G2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

VI. Sources of error inherent in the bolometric method.

1. From tardy action of the galvanometer, due to electrostatic causes, damping of
the needle, etc., causing displacement of deflections.
May be eliminated by reversing the direction of motion of the circle between
different runs, as has already been pointed out, and heretofore practiced.

As a general summing up of these investigations it may be said that if the steps
now being taken are successful in their outcome, it will be possible to determine the
difference of deviation between the lines appearing on the bolographs and the A line
in the visible spectrum, with an error not exceeding 1 second of arc.

The number of lines which may be theoretically discriminated with the process
and apparatus employed is very large. With a perfect prism of the size used,
and a galvanometer of somewhat greater sensitiveness, more than a thousand might,
if they exist, be discovered within the region in which we are now working. But
this supposes all minor tremors in the bolographic curves to be eliminated, and it is
certain that this has not yet been done, and that very many of the lines shown in
maps exhibited in illustration of the process will prove to have been due to such
causes. The chief aim at the present stage of the investigation is to give a number
of lines with their positions in the spectrum of a 60° rock salt prism, which may be
regarded as ‘‘standards,” and as many more as may be considered to have been
verified beyond reasonable doubt. Of these it is believed that at least 260 can be
presented in the forthcoming publication.

B. GENERAL SPECTROBOLOGRAPHIC WORK.

In the following table is given the number of photographs of various kinds taken
at the observatory during the year, not including instrumental records taken to show
the magnitude of the accidental galvanometer deflections:

Grand total, 362.

Full comparator measurements on curyes of April. 1894, and March, 1896, have been
made by three observers after the manner already described, and the results have
been reduced to deviation. The curves measured were taken with coarse bolometer
at a rapid rate of speed, and the finer lines were thus eliminated. About 80 promi-
nent or ‘‘standard” lines were verified in each of the sets of curves measured.

It has been repeatedly remarked in these reports that the most satisfactory results
can not be obtained in the site at present occupied by the observatory within the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (eo

city, subject to all sorts of ground and electric tremors, when the elimination of
these tremors is so vitally necessary to success. While the effects, due to vibration,
have been greatly reduced by means already alluded to, yet they still exist. It may
be incidentally observed that experiment has shown that these small ground tremors
are only about one-third as great at night as in the day, a condition owing to the
difference in the amount of traffic in the neighboring streets. Experiments were
also to be made to compare the magnetic disturbances due to electrical causes with
those at the magnetic station at the United States Naval Observatory without the
city, but only a small difference in favor of the latter site was found. Induction
effects in the bolometer circuit might have been expected to be caused by electric
currents in neighboring street lines; but owing to the special winding of the coils
and careful arrangement of all connections this disturbance has been much smaller
than has been anticipated. When all is said, however, it unfortunately remains
true that the best results can never be reached in the present situation.

C. ACCESSIONS or APPARATUS.

The principal accessions of apparatus during the past year are as follows:

1. A 6-inch telescope with photographic and visual objectives, 4 eyepieces, 2 ampli-
fying lenses, and spectroscopic attachment.

2. Special camera for exposing the moving plate in making bolographs.

3. A slit with 12-centimeter jaws for use in place of cylindric lens in producing
linear translations of bolographs.

4. Special rheostat with slide wire all inclosed by water jacket for use in the
bolometer circuit.

5. Great battery of 60 storage cells for the bolometer circuit, with appropriate
switch for charging and discharging.

6. Temperature controlling apparatus.

7. A new governor for the siderostat.

8. Stereoscopic camera.

9. Telephoto camera.
_ 10. Projection lantern with accessories.

PERSONNEL.

Mr. C. G. Abbot succeeded Mr. R. C. Child as aid acting in charge, January 1,
1896. Mr. R. C. Child left the observatory June 30, 1896. Mr. L. E. Emerson was
appointed as assistant on June 26, 1896.

Imay sum up the results of the last year’s work in saying that an entirely new stage
of accuracy has been reached by the elimination of sources of error of long stand-
ing, and that as a result of this accuracy between 200 and 300 well-determined lines
may be expected to appear in a communication which it is expected in the next year
to publish.

Respectfully submitted.

In addition to this there have been added to the Secretary’s library, office library,
and the library of the Astrophysical Observatory 276 volumes and pamphlets, and
2,061 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,337, and a grand total of accessions for
the year of 34,920 volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts.

These accessions show a gain of 2,967 in volumes and parts of volumes over the
previous year; and in the number of entries, 3,366.

Of these accessions 333 volumes, 759 parts of volumes and periodicals, and 1,047
pamphlets were retained for the use of the United States National Museum, and
993 medical dissertatiens were deposited in the library of the Surgeon-General,
United States Army, the remaining publications being sent to the Library of
Congress on the Monday after their receipt.

The names on the lists, procured in accordance with the plan of the Secretary for-
mulated in 1887, for increasing the library by exchanges, having been exhausted the
Secretary directed that this work for the present be continued by entering into cor-
respondence with all publishing societies on the new lists of the Bureau of Exchanges,
whose publications were not already being received by the Library. In pursuance
of this direction 732 letters were written asking for the publications which were not
on the list or for numbers to complete the series already in the Library, with the
gratifying result that 249 new exchanges were entered into and that 155 defective
series were either completed or added to as far as the publishers could supply the
missing parts.

The following universities have sent complete sets of their academic publications,
including inaugural dissertations:

Basel, Dorpat, Jena, Michigan,
Berlin, Erlangen, Johns Hopkins, Minnesota,
Bern, Freiberg, Kiel, Pennsylvania,
Bonn, Giessen, Konigsberg, Strassburg,
Breslau, Griefswald, Leipzig, Tubingen,
Chicago, Halle, Louvain, Utrecht,
Columbia, Heidelberg, Lund, Wurzburg,
Cornell, Helsingfors, Marburg, Zurich.

GENERAL APPENDIX

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1896.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a promiment object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1896.

THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY.!

By Prof. Simon NEWCOMB. .

Assembled, as we are, to dedicate a new institution to the promotion
of our knowledge of the heavens, it appeared to me that an appropriate
and interesting subject might be the present and future problems of
astronomy. Yet it seemed, on further reflection, that, apart from the
difficulty of making an adequate statement of these problems on such
an occasion as the present, such a wording of the theme would not fully
express the idea which I wish to convey. The so-called problems of
astronomy are not separate and independent, but are rather the parts
of one great problem, that of increasing our knowledge of the universe
in its widest extent. Nor is it easy to contemplate the edifice of astro-
nomical science as it now stands, without thinking of the past as well
as of the present and future. The fact is that our knowledge of the
universe has been in the nature of a slow and gradual evolution, com-
mencing at a very early period in human history, and destined to go
forward without stop, as we hope, so long as civilization shall endure.
The astronomer of every age has built on the foundations laid by his
predecessors, and his work has always tormed, and must ever form, the
base on which his successors shall build. The astronomer of to-day
may look back upon Hipparchus and Ptolemy as the earliest ancestors
of whom he has positive knowledge. He can trace his scientific descent
from generation to generation, through the periods of Arabian and
medieval science, through Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, La Place, and
Herschel, down to the present time. The evolution of astronomical
knowledge, generally slow and gradual, offering little to excite the
attention of the public, has yet been marked by two cataclysms. One
of these is seen in the grand conception of Copernicus that this earth on
which we dwell is not a globe fixed in the center of the universe, but is
simply one of a number of bodies, turning on their own axes and at the
same time moving around the sun as a center. It has always seemed
to me that the real significance of the heliocentric system lies in the
greatness of this conception rather than in the fact of the discovery
itself. There is no figure in astronomical history which may more

appropriately claim the admiration of mankind through all time than
that of Copernicus. Scarcely any great work was ever so exclusively
the work of one man as was the heliocentric system the work of the
retiring sage of Frauenburg. No more striking contrast between the
views of scientific research entertained in bis time and in ours can be
seen than that seen in the fact that, instead of claiming credit for his
ereat work, he deemed it rather necessary to apologize for it and, so
far as possible, to attribute his ideas to the ancients.

A century and a half after Copernicus followed the second great
step, that taken by Newton. This was nothing less than showing that
the seemingly complicated and inexplicable motions of the heavenly
bodies were only special cases of the same kind of motion, governed
by the same forces, that we see around us whenever a stone is thrown
by the hand or an apple falls to the ground. The actual motions of
the heavens and the laws which govern them being known, man had
the key with which he might commence to unlock the mysteries of the
universe.

When Huyghens, in 1656, published his Systema Saturnium, where
he first set forth the mystery of the rings of Saturn, which, for nearly
half a century, had perplexed telescopic observers, he prefaced it with
a remark that many, even among the learned, might condemn his
course in devoting so much time and attention to matters far outside
the earth, when he might better be studying subjects of more concern
to humanity. Notwithstanding that the inventor of the penduium
clock was, perhaps, the last astronomer against whom a neglect of
things terrestrial could be charged, he thought it necessary to enter
into an elaborate defense of his course in studying the heavens. Now,
however, the more distant objects are in space—I might almost add
the more distant events are in time—the more they excite the attention
of the astronomer, if only he can hope to acquire positive knowledge
about them. Not, however, because he is more interested in things
distant than in things near, but because thus he may more completely
embrace in the scope of his work the beginning and the end, the
boundaries of all things, and thus, indirectly, more fully comprehend
all that they include. From his standpoint

“‘ All are but parts of one stupendous whole,

Whose body nature is and God the soul.”
Others study nature and her plans as we see them developed on the
surface of this little planet which we inhabit; the astronomer would
fain learn the plan on which the whole universe is constructed. The
magnificent conception of Copernicus is, for him, only an introduction
to the yet more magnificent conception of infinite space containing a
collection of bodies which we call the visible universe. How far does
this universe extend? What are the distances and arrangements of
the stars? Does the universe constitute a system? If so, can we com-
prehend the plan on which this system is formed, of its beginning and
THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY. 85

of its end? Has it bounds outside of which nothing exists but the
black and starless depths of infinity itself? Or are the stars we see
simply such members of an infinite collection as happen to be the
nearest our system? A few such questions as these we are perhaps
beginning to answer; but hundreds, thousands, perhaps even millions
of years may elapse without our reaching a complete solution. Yet
the astronomer does not view them as Kantian antinomies, in the
nature of things insoluble, but as questions to which he may hopefully
look for at least a partial answer.

The problem of the distances of the stars is of peculiar interest in con-
nection with the Copernican system. The greatest objection to this
system, which must have been more clearly seen by astronomers them-
selves than by any others, was found in the absence of any apparent
parallax of the stars. If the earth performed such an immeasurable
circle around the sun as Copernicus maintained, then, as it passed from
side to side of its orbit, the stars outside the solar system must appear
to have a corresponding motion in the other direction, and thus to
swing back and forth as the earth moved in one and the other direc-
tion. The fact that not the slightest swing of that sort could be seen
was, from the time of Ptolemy, the basis on which the doctrine of the
earth’s immobility rested. The difficulty was simply ignored by Coper-
nicus and his immediate successors. The idea that nature would not
squander space by allowing immeasurable stretches of it to go unused
seems to have been one from which medizval thinkers could not entirely
break away. The consideration that there could be no need of any such
economy, because the supply was infinite, might have been theoretically
acknowledged, but was not practically felt. The fact is that magnifi-
cent as was the conception of Copernicus, it was dwarfed by the con-
ception of stretches from star to star so vast that the whole orbit of the
earth was only a point in comparison.

An indication of the extent to which the difficulty thus arising was
felt is seen in the title of a book published by Horrebow, the Danish
astronomer, some two centuries ago. This industrious observer, one of
the first who used an instrument resembling our meridian transit of the
present day, determined to see if he could find the parallax of the
stars by observing the intervals at which a pair of stars in opposite
quarters of the heavens crossed his meridian at opposite seasons of
the year. When, as he thought, he had won success, he published his
observations and conclusions under the title of Copernicus Trium-
phans. But alas! the keen criticism of his contemporaries showed that
what he supposed to be a swing of the stars from season to season
arose from a minute variation in the rate of his clock, due to the differ-
ent temperatures to which it was exposed during the day and the
night. The measurement of the distance even of the nearest stars
evaded astronomical research until Bessel and Struve arose in the
early part of the present century.
86 THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY.

On some aspects of the problem of the extent of the universe light
is being thrown even now. Evidence is gradually accumulating which
points to the probability that the successive orders of smaller and
smaller stars, which our continually increasing telescopic power brings
into view, are not situated at greater and greater distances, but that
we actually see the boundary of our universe. This indication lends a
peculiar interest to various questions growing out of the motions of the
stars. Quite possibly the problem of these motions will be the great
one of the future astronomer. Even now it suggests thoughts and
questions of the most far-reaching character.

I have seldom felt a more delicious sense of repose than when ecross-
ing the ocean during the summer months I sought a place where I
could lie alone on the deck, look up at the constellations, with Lyra
near the zenith, and, while listening to the clank of the engine, try to
calculate the hundreds of millions of years which would be required by
our ship to reach the star a Lyre if she could continue her course in
that direction without ever stopping. It is a striking example of how
easily we may fail to realize our knowledge when I say that I have
thought many a time how deliciously one might pass those hundred
millions of years in a journey to the star a Lyre, without its occurring
to me that we are actually making that very journey at a speed com-
pared with which the motion of a steamship is slow indeed. Through
every year, every hour, every minute, of human history from the first
appearance of man on the earth, from the era of the builders of the
Pyramids, through the times of Cesar and Hannibal, through the period
of every event that history records, not merely our earth, but the sun
and the whole solar system with it, have been speeding their way
toward the star of which I speak on a journey of which we know neither
the beginning nor the end. During every clock beat through which
humanity has existed it has moved on this journey by an amount which
we can not specify more exactly than to say that it is probably between
5 and 9 miles per second. We are at this moment thousands of
miles nearer to a Lyre than we were a few minutes ago when I began
this discourse, and through every future moment, for untold thousands
of years to come, the earth and all there is on it will be nearer to @
Lyre, or nearer to the place where_that star now is, by hundreds of
miles for every minute of time come and gone. When shall we get
there? Probably in less than a million years, perhaps in half a million.
We can not tell exactly, but get there we must if the laws of nature
and the laws of motion continue as they are. To attain to the stars
was the seemingly vain wish of the philosopher, but the whole human
race is, in a certain sense, realizing this wish as rapidly as a speed of
6 or 8 miles a second ean bring it about.

I have called attention to this motion because it may, in the not dis-
tant future, afford the means of approximating to a solution of the
problem already mentioned—that of the extent of the universe. Not-

withstanding the success of astronomers during the present century in
measuring the parallax of a number of stars, the most recent investi-
gations show that there are very few, perhaps hardly more than a score,
of stars of which the parallax, and therefore the distance, has been
determined with any approach to certainty. Many parallaxes deter-
mined by observers about the middle of the century have had to disap-
pear before the powerful tests applied by measures with the heliometer ;
others have been greatly reduced and the distances of the stars increased
in proportion. So far as measurement goes, we can only say of the dis-
tances of all the stars, except the few whose parallaxes have been
determined, that they are immeasurable. The radius of the earth’s
orbit, a line more than ninety millions of miles in length, not only van-
ishes from sight before we reach the distance of the great mass of stars,
but becomes such a mere point that when magnified by the powerful
instruments of modern times the most delicate appliances fail to make
it measurable. Here the solar motion comes to our help. ‘This motion,
by which, as I have said, we are carried unceasingly through space, is
made evident by a motion of most of the stars in the opposite direction,
just as passing through a country on a railway we see the houses on
the right and on the left being left behind us. It is clear enough that
the apparent motion will be more rapid the nearer the object. We
may therefore form some idea of the distance of the stars when we
know the amount of the motion. It is found that in the great mass of
stars of the sixth magnitude, the smallest visible to the naked eye, the
motion is about three seconds per century. As a measure thus stated
does not convey an accurate conception of magnitude to one not prac-
ticed in the subject, | would say that in the heavens, to the ordinary
eye, a pair of stars will appear single unless they are separated by a
distance of 150 or 200 seconds. Let us, then, imagine ourselves looking
at a star of the sixth magnitude, which is at rest while we are carried
past it with the motion of 6 or 8 miles per second which I have described.
Mark its position in the heavens as we see it to-day; then let its posi-
tion again be marked 5,000 years hence. A good eye will just be able
to perceive that there are two stars marked instead of one. The two
would be so close together that no distinct space between them could be
perceived by unaided vision. It is due to the magnifying power of the
telescope, enlarging such small apparent distances, that the motion has
been determined in so small a period as the 150 years during which
accurate observations of the stars have been made.
The motion just described has been fairly well determined for what,
astronomically speaking, are the brighter stars; that is to say, those
visible to the naked eye. But how is it with the millions of faint tele-
scopic stars, especially those which form the cloud masses of the Milky
Way? The distance of these stars is undoubtedly greater, and the
apparent motion is therefore smaller. Accurate observations upon
such stars have been commenced only recently, so that we have not
88 THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY.

yet had time to determine the amount of the motion. But the indica-
tion seems to be that it will prove quite ‘a measurable quantity and
that before the twentieth century has elapsed it will be determined for
very much smaller stars than those which have heretofore been studied.
A photographic chart of the whole heavens is now being constructed
by an association of observatories in some of the leading countries of
the world. I can not say all the leading countries, because then we
Should have to exclude our own, which, unhappily, has taken no part
in this work. At the end of the twentieth century we may expect that
the work will be repeated. Then, by comparing the charts, we shall
see the effect of the solar motion and perhaps get new light upon the
problem in question.

Closely connected with the problem of the extent of the universe is
another which appears, for us, to be insoluble because it brings us face
to face with infinity itself. We are familiar enough with eternity, or,
let us say, the millions or hundreds of millions of years which geolo-
gists tellus must have passed while the crust of the earth was assuming
its present form, our mountains being built, our rocks consolidated,
and successive orders of animals coming and going. Hundreds of
millions of years is indeed a long time, and yet, when we contemplate
the changes supposed to have taken place during that time, we do not
look out on eternity itself, which is veiled from our sight, as it were, by
the unending succession of changes that mark the progress of time.
But in the motions of the stars we are brought face to face with eternity
and infinity, covered by no veil whatever. It would be bold to speak
dogmatically on a subject where the springs of being are so far hidden
from wortal eyes as in the depths of the universe. But, without
declaring its positive certainty, it must be said that the conclusion
seems unavoidable that a number of stars are moving with a speed
such that the attraction of all the bodies of the universe could never
stop them. One such ease is that of Arcturus, the bright reddish star .
familiar to mankind since the days of Job, and visible near the zenith
on the clear evenings of May and June. Yet another case is that of a
star known in astronomical nomenclature as 1830 Groombridge, which
exceeds all others in its angular proper motion as seen from the earth.
We should naturally suppose that it seems to move so fast because it
is near us. But the best measurements of its parallax seem to show
that it can scarcely be less than two million times the distance of the
earth from the sun, while it may be much greater. Accepting this
result, its velocity can not be much less than 200 miles per second, and
may be much more. With this speed it would make the circuit of our
globe in two minutes, and had it gone round and round in our latitudes
we should have seen it fly past us a number of times since I commenced
this discourse. It would make the journey from the earth to the sun
in five days. If it is now near the center of our system it would prob-
ably reach its confines in a million of years. So far as our knowledge
THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY. 89

of nature goes, there is no force in nature which would ever have set it
in motion and no force which can ever stop it. What, then, was the
history of this star, and, if there are planets circulating around, what
the experience of beings who may have lived on those planets during
the ages which geologists and naturalists assure us our earth has
existed? Did they see at night only a black and starless heaven?
Was there a time when in that heaven a small faint patch of light
began gradually to appear? Did that patch of light grow larger and
larger aS million after million of years elapsed? Did it at last fill the
heavens and break up into constellations as we now see them? As
millions more of years elapse will the constellations gather together in
the opposite quarter and gradually diminish to a patch of light as the
star pursues its irresistible course of 200 miles per second through the
wilderness of space, leaving our universe farther and farther behind it,
until it is lost in the distance? If the conceptions of modern science
are to be considered as good for all time—a point on which I confess to
a large measure of scepticism—then these questions must be answered
in the affirmative.

Intimately associated with these problems is that of the duration of
the universe in time. The modern discovery of the conservation of
energy has raised the question of the period during which our sun has
existed and may continue in the future to give us light and heat. Mod-
ern science tells us that the quantity of light and heat which can be
stored in it is necessarily limited, and that, when radiated as the sun
radiates, the supply must in time be exhausted. <A very simple calcu-
lation shows that were there no source of supply the sun would be
cooled off in three or four thousand years. Whence, then, comes the sup-
ply? During the past thirty years the source has been sought for in a
hypothetical contraction of the sun itself. True, this contraction is
too small to be observed. Several thousand years must elapse before
it can be measurable with our instruments. Granting that this is and
always has been the sole source of supply, a simple calculation shows
that the sun could scarcely have been giving its present amount of
heat for more than twenty or thirty millions of years. Before that time
the earth and the sun must have formed one body, a great nebula,
by the condensation of which both are supposed to have been formed.
But the geologists tell us that the age of the earth is to be reckoned
by hundreds of millions of years. Thus arises a question to which
physical science has not been able to give an answer.

The problems of which I have so far spoken are those of what may
be called the older astronomy. If I apply this title it is because that
branch of the science to which the spectroscope has given birth is
often called the new astronomy. It is commonly to be expected that a
new and vigorous form of scientific research will supersede that which
is hoary with antiquity. But I am not willing to admit that such is
the case with the old astronomy, if old we may call it. It is more
90 THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY.

pregnant with future discoveries to-day than it ever has been, and it is
more disposed to welcome the spectroscope as a useful handmaid, which
may help it on to new fields, than it is to give way to it. How useful it
may thus become has been recently shown by a Dutch astronomer,
who finds that the stars having one type of spectrum belong mostly to
the Milky Way, and are farther from us than the others.

In the field of the newer astronomy perhaps the most interesting
work is that associated with comets. It must be confessed, however,
that the spectroscope has rather increased than diminished the mystery
which, in some respects, surrounds the constitution of these bodies.
The older astronomy has satisfactorily accounted for their appearance,
and we might also say for their origin and their end, so far as questions
of origin can come into the domain of science. It is now known that
comets are not wanderers through the celestial spaces from star to star,
but must always have belonged to our system. But their orbits are so
very elongated that thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of years
are required for a revolution. Sometimes, however, a comet passing
near to Jupiter is so fascinated by that planet that, in its vain attempts
to follow it, it loses so much of its primitive velocity as to circulate
around the sun in a period of a few years, and thus to become, appar-
ently, a new member of our system. If the orbit of such a comet, or
in fact of any comet, chances to intersect that of the earth, the latter
‘In passing the point of intersection encounters minute particles which
causes a meteoric shower. The great showers of November, which
occur three times in a century and were well known in the years 1866-67,
may be expected to reappear about 1900, after the passage of a comet
which, since 1866, has been visiting the confines of our system, and is
expected to return about two years hence.

But all this does not tell us much about the nature and make-up of a
comet. Does it consist of nothing but isolated particles, or is there a
solid nucleus, the attraction of which tends to keep the mass together?
No one yet knows. The spectroscope, if we interpret its indications in
the usual way, tells us that a comet is simply a mass of hydrocarbon
vapor, shining by its own light. But there must be something wrong
in this interpretation. That the light is reflected sunlight seems to
follow necessarily from the increased brilliancy of the comet as it
approaches the sun and its disappearance as it passes away.

Great attention has recently been bestowed upon the physical consti-
tution of the planets and the changes which the surfaces of those bodies
may undergo. In this department of research we must feel gratified
by the energy of our countrymen who have entered upon it. Should I
seek to even mention all the results thus made known I might be
stepping on dangerous ground, aS many questions are still unsettled.
While every astronomer has entertained the highest admiration for the
energy and enthusiasm shown by Mr. Percival Lowell in founding an
observatory in regions where the planets can be studied under the
THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY. 91

most favorable conditions, they can not lose sight of the fact that the
ablest and most experienced observers are liable to error when they
attempt to delineate the features of a body 50,000,000 or 100,000,000
miles away through such a disturbing medium as our atmosphere. Hven
on such a subject as the canals of Mars doubts may still well be felt.
That certain markings to which Schiaparelli gave the name of canals
exist, few will question. Butit may be questioned whether these mark-
ings are the fine, sharp, uniform lines found on Schiaparelli’s map and
delineated in Mr. Lowell’s beautiful book. It is certainly curious that
Barnard at Mount Hamilton, with the most powerful instrument and
under the most favorable circumstances, does not see these markings
as canals.

I can only mention among the problems of the spectroscope the ele-
gant and remarkable solution of the mystery surrounding the rings of
Saturn, which has been effected by Keeler at Allegheny. That these
rings could not be solid has long been a conclusion of the laws of
mechanics, but Keeler was the first to show that they must consist of
separate particles, because the inner portions revolve more rapidly than
the outer. The question of the atmosphere of Mars has also received
an important advance by the work of Campbell at Mount Hamilton.
Although it is not proved that Mars has no atmosphere, for the exist-
ence of some atmosphere can scarcely be doubted, yet the Mount Ham-
ilton astronomer seems to have shown, with great conclusiveness, that
it is So rare as not to produce any sensible absorption of the solar rays.

I have left an important subject for the close. It belongs entirely to
the older astronomy, and it is one with which I am glad to say this
observatory is expected to especially concern itself. I refer to the
question of the variation of latitudes, that singular phenomenon
scarcely suspected ten years ago, but brought out by observations in
Germany during the past eight years, and reduced to law with such
brilliant success by our own Chandler. The North Pole is not a fixed
point on the earth’s surface, but moves around in rather an irregular
way. True,the motion is small; a circle of 60 feet in diameter will include
the pole in its widest range. This is a very small matter so far as the
interests of daily life are concerned; but it is very important to the
astronomer. It is not simply a motion of the pole of the earth, but a
wabbling of the solid earth itself. No one knows what conclusions of
importance to our race may yet follow from a study of the stupendous
forces necessary to produce even this slight motion.

The director of this new observatory has already distinguished him-
Self in the delicate and difficult work of investigating this motion,
and I am glad to know that he is continuing the work here with one of
the finest instruments ever used in it, a splendid product of American
mechanical genius. I can assure you that astronomers the world over
will look with the greatest interest for Professor Doolittle’s success in
the arduous task he has undertaken.
92 THE PROBLEMS OF ASTRONOMY.

There is one question connected with these studies of the universe
on which I have not touched, and which is, nevertheless, of transcendent
interest. What sort of life, spiritual and intellectual, exists in distant
worlds? Wecan not for a moment suppose that our little planet is the
only one throughout the whole universe on which may be found the
fruits of civilization, warm firesides, friendship, the desire to penetrate
the mysteries of creation. And yet this question is not to-day a prob-
lem of astronomy, nor can we see any prospect that it ever will be, for
the simple reason that science affords us no hope of an answer to any
question that we may send through the fathomless abyss. When the
spectroscope was in its infancy it was suggested that possibly some
difference might be found in the rays reflected from living matter,
especially from vegetation, that might enable us to distinguish them
from rays reflected by matter not endowed with life. But this hope
has not been realized, nor does it seem possible to realize it. The
astronomer can not afford to waste his energies on hopeless speculation
about matters of which he can not learn anything, and he therefore
leaves this question of the plurality of worlds to others who are as
competent to discuss it as he is. All he can tell the world is:

He who through vast immensity can pierce,
See worlds on worlds compose one universe;
Observe how system into system runs,
What other planets circle other suns,

What varied being peoples every star,
May tell why Heaven has made us as we are.
THE INVESTIGATIONS OF HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ ON
THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS
AND MECHANICS.!

By Dr. LEO KOENIGSBERGER.

Distinguished assembly, we are met to celebrate the anniversary of
that day when an honored and enlightened ruler of this land infused
new life into our university, and. inaugurated that era of great scien-
tific achievements of which we shall shortly commemorate a completed
century.

At such a time our thoughts naturally turn with veneration and
gratitude to our late illustrious rector, Von Helmholtz, who constantly
strove with keenest interest and most energetic effort to broaden and
strengthen the foundations of the prosperity and renown of this insti-
tution. Surely we can express our gratitude no more appropriately
than by revering that great scientist, who during his administration
was the pride and ornament of our university and our fatherland.

Thus we dedicate these festal hours to the memory of one of the great-
est and most profound scientists of this century. I will ask you to
regard his achievements from the standpoint of the mathematician, a
science of which he was thoroughly fond, and which from this very
place thirty-three years ago to-day he so clearly and beautifuily
described in these words:

We see in the science of mathematics the conscious logical activity
of the human mind in its purest and most perfect form. While we are
impressed with the arduous labor of its procedure and the difficulty
of forming and comprehending its abstract conceptions, we at the same
time learn to confide in the security, reach, and fruitfulness of its rea-
sonings.

It is but a short time since the whole world mourned the loss of
Hermann von Helmholtz, who was associated with our university from
1858 to 1871, when at the height of his fame, and who, with Bunsen
and Kirchhoff, made it a great center of scientific research.

94 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

He who attempts to adequately describe the full significance of the
service of Helmholtz to mathematical science must refer to each of
his two or three hundred published writings, for all of them, even
when mathematical language is not employed, excite the highest
interest of the mathematician by reason of their eminently acute log-
ical reasoning. But the difficulty of treating each research with full
justice becomes apparent when we consider that the historian must
follow his unparalleled investigations through all branches of natural
science. In short, physiologist, physicist, mathematician, philosopher,
and master alike of nature and art must he be who would regard so
great a thinker as Helmholtz not merely with wonder and amaze-
ment, but fully and intelligently. It was not the nature of his mind
to pursue mathematical investigations for their own sake, or to delight
in the discovery of purely abstract truths deduced from algebraic or
geometrical conceptions to find possible future use in the exact natural
Sciences. On the contrary, he obtained his mathematical problems
direct from observation of nature, and this is certainly the only true
way, yet fruitful only in the hands of so great a master. His starting
point was the axiom that science, whose aim it is to apprehend nature,
must admit that she is capable of being understood, and for him that
meant no less than what his greatest pupil, Heinrich Hertz, has said:
“The necessary logical consequences of the inner conceptions of outer
phenomena should correspond with the necessary natural consequences
of the phenomena conceived of, which requires that the problems of
nature should be mathematically formulated.” Thus in all his works
appears an inexhaustible richness of results full of interest from a
purely mathematical point of view, that nevertheless find a mechanical-
physical significance, and then lead to the discovery of profound and
general natural laws, which, when divested of their mathematical
exposition, have prepared the way not only in the natural sciences, but
also in the world at large, for essentially new conceptions of the pro-
cedure of natural events. He was interested in mathematical investi-
gations for their own sake only in treating of the axioms and founda-
tions of mathematical science. With this aim he made researches in
each of the three great branches of mathematics—geometry, arithme-
tic, and mechanics—which have marked radical advances both in
philosophy and in the whole development of mathematical physics.
Here also, in contrast with the methods of other distinguished mathe-
maticians engaged in the same or similar investigations, he continually
verified his deductions by references to observation and experience in
proceeding to attain the most abstract mathematical truths.

The science of mathematics in its whole extent, as I shall here regard
it, deals with three independent primary conceptions, those of space, of
time, and of mass. The province of geometry embraces considerations
of space, that of arithmetic embraces time, and the relations of mass
to space and time constitute the subject-matter of mechanics and
mathematical physics. The view brought forward by Kant that space

and time are transcendental forms of perception which are more exactly
determined by the axioms was almost universally accepted among
mathematicians and philosophers till Helmholtz brought the matter so
far within the scope of his investigations as to raise question with
regard to the a priori existence of these axioms. His objections were
based, not on the ground of abstract mathematical considerations, as
had been the case in part with those of Gauss and Riemann, but
physiological-optical researches had caused him to consider the
source of the general perception of space, and he was very soon led to
the conviction that only the appearance of space relations causes us to
grant as self-evident that which, in reality, is a particular character-
istic of our exterior surroundings, and we therefore regard the axioms
of geometry as laws given by transcendental perception.

As early as 1852, in his academic dissertation, delivered at Konigs-
berg, ‘‘ Upon the nature of human sensations,” he showed by a thorough
physiological-physical comparison of objects and their corresponding
sensations, that light and color perceptions are only symbols for the
actually existing relations; and thus he paved the way for further
progress in the investigation of the nature of sense perceptions.
According to what may be termed the ‘“nativistic” theory of form
perception, it is assumed that the retina itself discerns impressions
with reference to its own surface, particular forms being therefore
distinguished by means of an innate mechanism, and thus the special
localization of each impression is given by the simple perception.
Opposed to this is the empiric theory of which Helmholtz was the
originator. By this theory, on the other hand, the sense-perceptions
serve only as the symbols to our consciousness of outward things
and events, whose significance is referred to our judgment. Follow-
ing this theory it would, for example, be unnecessary that in the
perception of difference of position there should be any similarity
between the local sight-symbol for this interval and the correspond-
ing external difference of position; or that in general an exact cor-
respondence should exist between the laws of thought and percep-
tion and those of the outside world. These physiological-philosophical
views were elaborated in a series of researches, interesting also from a
mathematical standpoint, which appeared in the years 1862 to 1864
under the title ‘Upon the horopter.” The horopter was defined by
him as the geometrical position of those points in space whose images
are formed upon corresponding parts of the two retinas, and therefore
are perceived as single. The general form was found by him to be a
curve in space of the third degree. Designating as a line horopter the
surface upon which right lines of a given direction must lie in order
that during a continuous congruent displacement upon this surface the
images of the whole lines shall correspond, without necessary corre-
Spondence of the separate points, it was shown by Helmholtz that for
the vertical and borizontal horopters, or for lines which in both fields

of vision appear normal or vertical to the retinal horizon, these sur-
faces were of the second degree. An exact mathematical discussion of
them appeared in his Physiological Optics, with the addition of the
assumption of the asymmetry of the retina and a somewhat modified
definition of the identical points in the two retinas. Thus there was
erowing up within him the conviction, based on incontrovertible mathe-
matical-physical reasoning, that since in the act of seeing there are two
channels through which the sensations come separately to the brain,
there to be blended to form a single perception of the material world,
through an act of intelligence dictated by experience, it is altogether
impossible to separate that part of our perception which corresponds to
the simple sensation from that which is the result of experience. It
appeared also that only in the relations of space and of time and of the
function derived from them, number—that is, only in mathematics—is
the outer and inner world the same, and that, therefore, here alone can
a complete correspondence between the images and the things per-
ceived be expected. The questions now arose, In what manner is this
correspondence of space and time perceptions with the things which
give rise to them brought about; what in these perceptions is a priori;
what the result of experience, and what is the origin of space percep-
tions in general?

An investigation of these questions appeared in a memoir published
in 1868, ‘‘On the data which form the basis of geometry.” Helmholtz
guarded himself perhaps from raising objections to Kant’s conception
of space as a transcendental form of perception; but he made himself
clear as regards perception by means of the senses. Thus, for example,
it results from the very organization of our eyes that all which we see
must consist in a distribution of colors upon a surface, and this dis-
tribution of colors does not necessarily condition any particular series
of phenomena of time or space. The question might then be raised
whether for this form of transcendental space perception the assump-
tion is involved that after, or at the same time with a given space per-
ception, another determined by it must appear; or, in other words,
whether the assumption of certain axioms is necessarily implied. In
the endeavor to distinguish between the logical development of geom-
etry and the results derived from experience, which are apparently
necessary to the processes of thought, he recognized as the basis of
all the demonstrations of the geometry of Euclid the proof of the con-
gruence of figures in space, and therewith as a postulate the supposi-
tion that these figures can be brought together without alteration in
their form or dimensions. He was then confronted with the question
whether the assumption of the possibility of free movement, which
we have experienced from our earliest youth, contains no logically
unproved hypothesis, and by profound investigation of the question he
was able to show with a very great degree of certainty that it did not.

Helmholtz depicted geometry limited to two dimensions, as it might
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 97

conceivably be, for example, to beings living on the surface of a
solid body and without the ability to perceive anything outside of this
surface. For us, dwellers in space of three dimensions, it is possible
to conceive what manner of perceptions of space beings limited to two
dimensions would have, though we can not, on the other hand, con-
ceive of space of more than three dimensions, because all our means of
perception extend only to tridimensional space. What would in the
case of dwellers in two dimensions become of these axioms of our
geometry: (a) Between two points only one shortest line, the straight
line, can be drawn; ()) through three points not lying in a straight line a
surface called a plane can be passed, such that all straight lines joining
any pairs of points upon it lie wholly within the surface; and finally,
(c) if two straight lines lying in the same plane, which never meet, how-
ever far produced, be defined as parallel, only one line parallel to these
can be drawn through a point not lying upon either of them. What
would become of these and of all the other axioms that require the con-
tinuity of geometrical figures? The surface dwellers would in general
draw shortest lines between two points, which, however, would not nec-
essarily be straight lines, and which Helmholtz called straightest lines,
But in the simplest case, a sphere, an infinite number of straightest
lines might be drawn between the two poles, though parallel straightest
lines could not be drawn, and the sum of the angles in a triangle would
be different from two right angles. These beings would, like us, find
space endless though of finite extent, and in the development of a geom-
etry they would have other axioms than we, but they could still move
their figures about the sphere at will without altering their dimensions.
Yet this peculiarity would in general be lost upon surfaces of other
forms, since only those surfaces possess it, which have at all points a
constant curvature, and of these, surfaces of a constant positive or
negative curvature other than spherical are such as may be unwrapped
from a sphere without bending or tearing, and may be called pseudo-
spherical. An analytical investigation of surfaces of this latter kind
shows that it is possible for straightest lines to be infinitely extended
without ever returning to the surface, and that, as in the plane, only
one shortest line is possible between two points. But the validity of
the parallel axiom fails here, since through a point outside a straightest
line an infinite number of other straightest lines may be drawn, which
when infinitely extended do not cut the first. Thus the three axioms
mentioned above are necessary and sufficient in order to characterize
the surface for which Euclid’s geometry holds in distinction from all
other figures having two dimensions, as plane. Passing now to space
of three dimensions and considering it as a domain of quantities in
which the situation of any point may be determined by three measure-
ments, we may compare it with other threefold extended subjects
of consideration, such, for example, as the arrangement of systems of
colors affords, in order to investigate whether we may discover special
sM 96——7
98 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

characteristics of our space. Thus it may be shown that such peculiar-
ities do indeed exist which depend on the completely free motion of
solid bodies without change of form, and on the particular value of the
measure of curvature. In the space under consideration this must be
put equal to zero—as it is, among surfaces, for the plane alone and
surfaces derived from it in order to give rise to the axioms of Euclid
concerning the singularity of the shortest line and the essential con-
ditions to parallelism. Ifthe curvature was different from zero, triangles
of great area would, it is true, have for the sum of their angles a value
diiferent from smaller ones; but the result of geometrical and astro-
nomical measurements, which always gives the sum of the angles of a
triangle as very near but never exactly equal to two right angles,
warrants us only in the conclusion that the measure of curvature for
our space is extremely small. It can not be proved that its value is
zero—it is an axiom. Helmholtz went, however, still further. He
showed that the consideration of a spherical or pseudospherical world
developed by analogy from the plane might be extended in all direc-
tions, so that the axioms of our geometry throughout can not be fixed
in their present form by our intuitive faculty. And he even made it
appear plausible that if our eyes were provided with suitable convex
glasses we might come to look upon the pseudospherical space as quite
natural, and that we would be deceived in our estimations of size and
distance only in the first few instances.

These researches formed in part the subjects of some lectures deliy-
ered in Heidelberg in 1868. Twenty years later he referred again in
his article on ‘Shortest lines in the color system” to the results
obtained by himself and Riemann. They found that ali the character-
istics of our particular kind of space may be derived from the fact that
one may express the distance between two neighboring points in terms
of the corresponding increments of their coordinates. To know the
distance between two points of a solid it requires that these end points
shall be completely given, and the distance shall remain constant
through whatever movements and displacements the solid body be
subjected. Analogously, Helmholtz proposed to determine colors by the
quantities of three suitably chosen primary colors required to produce
them, these primary colors taking the place of coordinates. In this
analogy the conception of difference between two colors nearly alike
corresponded to the distance between points in space. He deduced a
very simple analytical expression which he hoped would play the same
role in expressing the difference in hue that the formula for the length
of the linear element does in geometry. This expression determined
the variation in brightness and hue which occurs corresponding to a
simultaneous change in the quantities of the three primary colors
uniting to produce it. Analogously to the shortest line between
two points he defined as the shortest series of colors that series of
intermediate shades between given end colors of different brightness
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 99

and hue for which the sum of the perceptible differences is a mini-
mum. This conception of the field of color sensation led him, in the
memoir on “The extinction of the application of the law of Fechner
in the color system,” to extend this law, which contemplated only
changes of brightness in a light of a constant color, to embrace a
diversity of cases of more than one dimension, and to take into con-
sideration the greatness of successive gradations of the tone and of
the saturation of colors corresponding to change in the brightness.

In one of his last investigations ‘‘On the cause of the correct inter-
pretation of sensory impressions,” he returned again to the question of
space perception, and was led to very acute and significant philosoph-
ical considerations upon the subject. The perception of the stereo-
metric form of a material object played for him the role of one of a
great number of cases of impressions derived through the senses which,
quite independently of the geometrical definition, can only be brought
together by an understanding of the law in accordance with which the
perspective impressions follow each other. Starting with this view, he
recognized our unconscious mental activity as the cause of the merging
together of separate impressions with results essentially like those of
our conscious thinking. According to Helmholtz, the conclusions of
induction are nothing more nor less than the expectation that the phe-
nomena observed in their beginning will proceed in a way correspond-
ing with our previous observations, and false induction is identical
with deceptions of our senses; so that our science is only the expres-
sion in words of such knowledge as, with our natural organization and
with the help of the conclusions of induction depending on the uncon-
scious activity of our minds, we are able to collect.

Long after the publication of his memoirs on the axioms of geometry
he returned again to a similar subject in his investigation of the theory
of the conception of number and measure, in a paper dedicated to
Edward Zeller, in 1887, on the fiftieth anniversary of taking his doc-
tor’s degree. In this paper he opposed the view of Kant, that the
axioms of arithmetic are laws given a priori, which determine the
transcendental perception of time in the same sense that the axioms of
geometry govern that of space. He investigated the significance and
correctness of calculation with pure numbers and the possibility of
their application to physical quantities. As he derived from consid-
ering numeration that we are able to retain in mind the order of sue-
cession in which acts of consciousness are performed, the science of
pure numbers was for him essentially a method built up on physio-
logical facts for the consistent application of a system of signs of
unbounded capacities for extension and improvement, with the purpose
of representing the different methods of combining these signs to reach
the same final conclusion. After deducing from this conception a defi-
nition of the regular series of positive whole numbers and the signifi-
cance of their succession, he proceeded to establish the conception of
100 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

addition of pure numbers, and showed that the axioms of arithmetic of
the equality of two numbers in respect to a third, the association law
of addition, and the commutation law, can only be proved by the agree-
ment of the results arithmetically derived with those which can
be obtained by counting of exterior numerable objects. That the
objects should be numerable, certain conditions must be fulfilled con-
cerning whose presence only experience can decide. Since that objects
which in any particular respect are alike and can be numbered may be
regarded as units of number, the result of their enumeration as a defi-
nite number, and the kind of units which compose it as the denomina-
tion of the number, the conception with respect to the equality of two
groups containing given numbers of objects of the same denomination
is given by these numbers. If we designate as quantities objects or
attributes of objects which, when compared with similar ones, may be
greater, equal, or less, and if we can express these quantities by known
numbers, we call these numbers the values of the quantities, and the
process by which we find them measurement. Thus we measure a force
by the masses and displacements of systems upon which they have
been exercised; or in dynamic measurements by the masses and move-
ments of systems upon which they are working; or in the static method
of measurement by bringing the forces into equilibrium with others
already known. It only remains to consider under what circumstances
quantities may be expressed by numbers and what is thereby attained
in actual knowledge. With this purpose were instituted interesting and
valuable considerations on physical equality and the commutation and
association law for physical combination. Addition was regarded as a
combination of quantities of the same kind, such that the result remained
unchanged when the single elements were exchanged, or when the num-
bers were replaced by equal quantities of the same kind. In introduc-
ing irrational relations Helmholtz placed himself at the standpoint of
the physicist, and in later development of the principles of mechanics
he retained, as we shall see, the same point of view, showing that in
geometry and physics no discontinuous functions are met with for which
it is not enough to know with sufficient accuracy the bounds within
which the irrational values lie. The mathematicians, however, it must
be said, recognize functions of another kind, and the recent investi-
gations of Boltzmann seem to point to a physical application of such
analytical conceptions.

We now come to by far the most difficult part of our task as we
attempt. to describe the service of Helmholtz to analytical mechanics;
for in order to understand the partial reconstruction of the science in
consequence of some of his most brilliant researches it will be neces-
sary to accurately follow him through his great series of wonderful
mathematical-physical investigations and far-reaching physical discoy-
eries in the great fields of hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, and electricity,
which have contributed to the investigation of the axioms of mechanics.
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 101

Many physiologists of the time assumed, quite in defiance of the laws
of mechanical natural philosophy, that through the action of the so-
called life force the ordinary natural forces might be generated without
limit. In his “Theory of the physiological heat phenomena” Helm-
holtz, starting from the proposition based on mechanical laws that
a given quantity of a moving force can never by any complication
of mechanism produce more than a definite corresponding quantity of
motion, proceeded to discuss the question of the source of auimal
heat—so weighty in the theoretical consideration of life processes.
The results of this investigation and of that simultaneously instituted
‘¢ Upon the evolution of heat attending muscular action” gave him the
verification of the great law of the conservation of energy which formed
the subject of a lecture before the Physical Society of Berlin in the
year 1847. It was certainly an interesting moment in the history of
the sciences when thirty years ago to-day one of the most distinguished
physicists of this century, Gustav Kirchhoff, in the course of his beauti-
ful and luminous discourse ‘‘On the goal of the natural sciences,”
delivered from this spot, and in the presence of Helmholtz, declared
the discovery of this law undoubtedly the most momentous which has
been made in the province of natural science during the present century.
Hertz also, in his posthumous work, ‘‘The Principles of Mechanics,”
asserts that physics at the end of our century has turned its preference
to an entirely new method of thought, and, influenced by the tremendous
impression made by Helmholtz’s discovery of the constancy of energy,
it is now preferred to refer all phenomena in their analyses to the laws
of transformation of energy. For the sake of a proper appreciation
of this great discovery of Helmholtz, as well as of his later fundamental
researches upon the principles of mechanics, I must here briefly review
the historical development of theoretical mechanies.

From the early investigations of the lever, the pulley, and the
inclined plane, there were soon developed the general conceptions
which are the basis of the science of equilibrium. With the definition
of work as the product of a force by the infinitely small displacement
of amaterial particle along the direction in which the force is measured
arose the principle of virtual velocities, upon which rests the theory of
statics. According to this principle, a material system is in equilib-
rium when for each virtual displacement—that is, a displacement com-
patible with the connection of the system of points—the total work
done within the system is equal to zero. After the discovery of the
inertia of masses by Galileo, and the conception of gravitation by
Newton, the development of mechanics was founded upon the three
famous laws of Newton. These may be stated as follows: (a) Every
body remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line
unless compelled by outside force to change that state; (b) the accele-
ration of a material point by the action of a constraining force takes
place in the direction in which the force acts and is equal to the
102 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

intensity of the force divided by the mass of the material point; and
(c) the actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and
take place in opposite directions. J*rom these laws there follows, for
Newtonian forces at least, and with the assumption of a rigid connec-
tion between the points of the system, the principle of d’Alembert
which holds sway in the whole province of dynamics. If we designate
as supplied forces those which must be made to act at each point in
order that it should move if separated from the system as it actually
does move, then the principle of d’Alembert asserts that all the sup-
plied forces suffice to maintain equilibrium, and thus furnishes the
mathematician a method of determining for any moment the situation
of all points of the system, when the constraints of motion of the
points, the forces which act upon them, and the place and velocity of
one of the points are known for the moment under consideration.

The advance of mechanics in this line was accompanied by the inves-
tigation of all the forces of nature—that is to say, the investigation of
all the properties of matter—for we can know nothing of these except.
to recognize the forces which are there in play. After the discovery of
these principles of equilibrium and of motion, it was the endeavor of
scientists to obtain general laws and relations of motion. One of the
most important and far-reaching of these in its consequences was the
principle of the conservation of the so-called vis viva. If we define as
the vis viva of a material point one-half the product of its mass into the
square of its velocity, and the sum total of the vis viva for all points of
a system in which the separate particles are connected by ties restraining
their free motion as the kinetic energy of the system, then, for any system
subject to the conditions of the d’Alembert principle, the increase of
the kinetic energy attending the motion of the system from one situa-
tion to another is exactly equal to the work done by the various forces
during the time interval in which the displacement occurs. If now
the work done by the forces of the system during the displacement is
dependent only on the initial and final situations, it follows that if the
system returns again from the final to the initial condition the kinetic
energy returns to its original value. This law is called the law of the
conservation of the kinetic energy, and systems to which it applies are
called conservative systems. A simple transformation of this law leads
to the most far-reaching consequences. The fact that a body by its
motion from one place to another does a certain amount of work neces-
sitates that its capacity for performing work, or, in other words, its
potential energy, was in its initial situation greater than in its final sit-
uation; so that for conservative systems the law of the conservation of
kinetic energy goes over into the law of the constancy of energy. This
may be expressed as follows: For any conservative system the sum of
the potential and kinetic energies is unchangeable. It is important to
remember the supposition upon which this is based, namely, that the
work done by the motion of the system is dependent only on the initial
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 103

and final situations and not upon the intermediate positions. For the
Newtonian forces, to which this principle is immediately applicable, the
validity of this law means the impossibility of a perpetual motion; that
is, the combination of natural bodies in such manner as to continually
generate force without expenditure of work. For in the absence of this
law we would be able, by a selection of the method by which we caused
the system to return to its original condition, to save up some of the
work done in its displacement, and thus, by repetition of the process, to
generate mechanical energy out of nothing forever. The impossibility
of such contrivances was long known, and the law of the constancy of
energy established for forces of this kind; but not all the forces of
nature seemed thus controlled. If a system moved through the same
path first without, then with friction, the kinetic energy would, in the
latter case, be diminished, owing to the smaller velocity, and thus it
was necessary, to sustain the law of the constancy of ehergy in its gen-
erality, that the conception of potential energy, which had previously
meant only energy of position, should be extended to other forms of
energy, such as those which exist in heat and other natural phenomena.

In the case just cited, the loss in mechanical energy would require to
be compensated by an equivalent quantity of heat energy developed
by the friction. KR. Mayer, starting with the presumption that the
creation or annihilation of force is a matter lying outside the scope of
human conception or achievement, asserted the equivalence of heat and
mechanical work as the fundamental law of natural phenomena. Helm-
holtz, without knowledge of Mayer’s researches, and including all
natural forces within the circle of his investigations, followed out the
assumption of the validity of the law of the constancy of energy, and
was able to show, experimentally, the impossibility of a perpetual
motion for a great series of physical phenomena where heat, light, elec-
tricity, and chemical affinity enter as acting forces. This is equivalent
to the law that the work done by natural forces of all kinds during the
passage of a system from one condition to another is dependent solely
on the initial and final conditions without regard to the way in which
the change is affected. From this he inferred that in any closed sys-
tem every increase of energy involves an equal loss of energy, and thus
achieved the great and comprehensive result that the energy of the
world is constant.

With his customary remarkable modesty he emphasized the fact that
it was his purpose simply to lay before physicists, in as complete form
as possible, the theoretical and practical importance of the law of the con-
stancy of energy, ‘‘ whose complete verification must be regarded as one
of the chief objects of physics in the immediate future.” It deserves
special emphasis that Helmholtz, in opposition to the foliowers of meta-
physical speculation, who sought to establish the law of the conservation
of energy from a priori considerations, declared the law, like all knowl-
edge of the phenomena of the actual world, to be the result of induction,
104 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

and based upon the negative issue of numerous futile attempts to con-
struct a perpetual motion. This great general law governing the quan-
titative relations which must subsist during all transformations, does
not, however, determine whether work can be changed into heat with-
out reserve, and vice versa, and the same uncertainty exists with
regard to light, electricity, and other forms of energy. These are
questions whose answer shall later exhibit the deep and comprehensive
significance of the energy conception in mathematical physics.

After Helmholtz had investigated the physical aspects of this funda-
mental principle of mechanics from most varied points of view, he
turned his attention to physiological researches growing out of his notice
on the “ Theory of acoustics,” and from this to very general mechanical
problems and special hydrodynamic investigations. In the year 1858
appeared his famous memoir ‘ Upon the integrals of the hydrodynamic
equations which correspond to wave motions.” This research formed
the foundation for an entirely new conception of the motions of fluids,
which was later made fruitful in various branches of physics, notably
by W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in his theory of vortex atoms, and by
other physicists as well. Upon the assumption that for a perfect fluid—
that is, one in which there is no friction between the particles—the
pressure is equal in all directions, Euler and Lagrange had already
obtained analytical relations between the pressure in the fluid, its
density, the time, the coordinates of the particle under consideration,
and, on the one hand, the velocity components; on the other, the
position of this particle at the beginning of the motion. Further, they
had inferred the so-called continuity equation, which required that the
mass of a given particle of the fluid should not change with the time,
therefore that the surface of the liquid should be continually com-
posed of the same particles.

All these equations form for the perfect fluid the analogue of the
principle of d’Alembert and lead to the determination of the variable
quantities through the time and the original situation as a mathemat-
ical problem whose solution, to use an expression of Kirchhoff, would
describe the motion. The problem can be solved for some particular
cases in which the components of the velocity of each fluid particle
may be placed equal to the differential coefficients of a determined
function, which Helmholtz called the velocity potential, along the corre-
sponding directions. This function, for incompressible fluids at least,
has the same form as the potential of gravitating masses for points out-
side of them. But such a veiocity potential does not always exist, and
so Helmholtz attacked the extremely difficult problem of the forms of
motion with complete generality in the memoir above referred to,
which appeared in the year of his coming to Heidelberg.

First of all, he recognized that the change which an indefinitely
small volume of fluid undergoes in an indefinitely small interval of
time is composed of three different motions—a displacement of the
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 105

particle in space, an extension or contraction along three directions at
right angles, and, finally, a rotation about a temporary axis. The exist-
ence of a rotation is, however, excluded when a velocity potential
exists. Helmholtz designated forms of displacement, for which a
velocity potential is not to be derived, as vortex motions. In deter-
mining the change in the velocity of rotation during the continuance
of motion, he discovered that those particles of fluid which do not
already possess rotation do not have such motions imparted to them in
the progress of the disturbance. Defining a vortex line as a line whose
direction is throughout coincident with the direction of the instantane-
ously existing axes of rotations of the particles along it, a remarkable
law was deduced, which may be expressed as follows: A vortex line
remains continually with the same particles, progressing with these
particles through the fluid. and the value of the resulting velocity of
rotation for any particle of the fluid varies directly with the distance
of this particle from its neighbors in the vortex line. If, further, we
designate as a vortex thread the portion of the fluid inclosed within
an indefinitely thin mantle of vortex lines, the product of the velocity
of rotation by the cross section of the vortex thread is constant through-
out its whole length, and so remains during a progressive motion of
the same. It follows that a vortex thread can never cease within the
boundaries of the fluid, but must be either a closed ring wholly within
the fluid or must continue to its boundaries. In the attempt to deter-
mine from the velocity of rotation the velocity of translation, Helm-
holtz succeeded by methods of great mathematical interest in making
it possible to form a conception of the forms of motion, though the
complete analytical solution of the problem was possible only in the
simplest cases. Under certain preliminary circumstances relative to
the nature of the surroundings, the vortex threads and vortex rings
retain unchanged the same quantity of the fluid and are permanent.
In this case it was shown that two vortex rings whose axes are the
same and which have the same direction of rotation would proceed in
the same direction, the foremost becoming distended and moving slower
and slower, while the follower would concentrate itself and move faster,
till finally—provided the velocities of translation lie within certain lim-
its—the follower would overtake the leader, pass through it, and assume
the role which the other played before. This procedure would, how-
ever, in the actual phenomena of vortex motions be very soon inter-
rupted, owing to the friction.

The regularity and relative stability of vortex phenomena have led
W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) to put forward an interesting hypothesis
in which the atoms are supposed to have the form of vortex rings, with
the aim of uniting the theory of the continuity of matter and the
atomic theory. He has also succeeded in connecting the results of the
theory of vortex-atoms with the motion of solid bodies in fluids, and
thus to join with those investigations which aim to eliminate action at
106 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

a distance from the province of physics. To this latter point I shall
return in discussing later researches of Helmholtz.

Helmholtz soon became dissatisfied with his hydrodynamic investiga-
tions thus far referred to, and in the course of the preparation of his
famous handbook of physiological optics he became convinced that, in
order to eliminate the discordance between the results of theory and
experiment in the investigation of the problems of motion of liquids, it
would be necessary to take into consideration the friction between the
liquid particles and the sides of the vessel. As the problem (due to
some experiment of Bessel) of the vibrations of a pendulum ball under
the influence of a surrounding liquid had already been treated, he
investigated upon the basis of Bessel’s observations, with the help of the
already known equations of motion, the condition of the interior of a
liquid mass which is subjected to the friction produced by the pro-
gressive rotary vibrations about one of its diameters of a pendulum
ball consisting of a liquid producing friction. He succeeded in solving
the problem mathematically, expressing the wave motions of the liquid
produced by friction, and in this way was able to check the experi-
mentally derived constants of viscosity for various liquids.

Two laws, important both theoretically and practically, were discov-
ered by him, according to which, under certain circumstances, the flow
of viscous liquids through cylindrical tubes is so divided into stationary
streams that the loss in kinetic energy caused by the friction is a mini-
mum; and in cases of equilibrium of a body swimming in a slow sta-
tionary stream the friction itself assumes a minimum value. Following
this, in the year 1868, appeared his research, of great interest for the
theory of functions, ‘‘On discontinuous fluid motions,” in which he
investigated still further the discharge of fluids and the formation of
independent streams, and treated of the discontinuity of motion char-
acteristic of fluid discharge and of the formation of vortices. Helm-
holtz assumed that from the nature of the problem—the determination
of the origin of independent fluid streams—a discontinuity must neces-
sarily be met with, and that therefore the fundamental hydrodynamic
equations must admit the possibility of a discontinuous relation
between the quantities appearing in them. In fact, in the motion of
an incompressible fluid the pressure, whose diminution is directly pro-
portional to the kinetic energy, becomes negative when the latter
exceeds a certain value, and the fluid must be then torn asunder. It
was shown that any geometrically completely sharp corner by which
the fluid flows must, with fair velocities, cause a parting of the liquid,
but that a blunted angle will only cause such a separation when the
velocity is considerably greater. With the help of the methods of the —
theory of functions, the extremely difficult problem of the form of the
independent streams was discussed. In this discussion it was assumed
that, except for friction, no outside forces are acting, that the streams
are stationary, that the velocity potential depends only on two coordi-
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 107

nates, and that the vessel and orifice have special forms. Finally, the
value of the earlier results relative to vortices was shown for the
determination of the motion of fluid particles in discharge.

In the early part of his stay at Heidelberg, and while engaged in his
hydrodynamic researches, he was also pursuing acoustic and aerody-
namic investigations. In his articles, “On combination-tones” and
‘Upon the tone color of the vowels,” he again adopted the view of other
physicists which he had abandoned in some of his earlier and less
important works, namely, that each sensation, as it is aroused by the
atmospheric vibrations going out from a single sounding body, is com-
pounded from simple sensations or tones such as are caused by a simple
vibratory motion of the air. This hypothesis he formulated mathe-
matically, proceeding from the theorem of Fourier for the representa-
tion of any periodic motion as the sum of a series of sine-motions.
The pitch of a tone was defined as the height of the lowest of its con-
stituent tones, which is called the fundamental, the others being dis-
tinguished as overtones. Exact experimental investigation showed
that the musical tone color depends only on the presence and strength,
but not on the phase differences, of the overtones which are included
in the sound. The sounds as they penetrate the ear could be resolved
into their simple factors, and these could be again reunited. The
sounds produced by the voice were found to differ from the sounds of
most other musical instruments in that the strength of their overtones
depends not on the corresponding cardinal numbers, but on their abso-
lute pitch. Throughout these researches we may perceive the design
to make a Sharp distinction between the sensations in so far as they
consist in impressions peculiar to our nerve apparatus, such as those
due to overtones, and the perceptions which form our ideas of outside
objects, as, for example, the ideas of the sound combined from the par-
tial tones.

In all the previous considerations of acoustics the very far-reaching
hypothesis had been made that the vibratory motions of the air, and
other elastic bodies which are produced by the simultaneous action of
several sources of sound, are always the exact sum of the motions due
to all the separate sound-sources. Helmholtz, however, showed that
this law only holds in strictness when the vibrations are of indefinitely
small amplitudes, and therefore the density changes are so slight that
they are negligible i comparison with the whole density, and the dis-
placements of the vibrating particles are also negligible compared with
the whole masses. A distinction was made between cases where this
law was followed undisturbed both within and without the ear, but the
Sensations not accurately combined to form the perception, and cases
where the combination tone was different from the summation of its con-
stituents from causes operating before the auditory nerves are reached.

His studies in acoustics were soon pursued much further with the
aid of the most refined analysis. In his famous treatise on the ‘“‘Theory
108 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

of air vibrations in tubes with open ends” (1859) we find researches
analagous to those in hydrodynamics already referred to. The question
is raised in what way plane sound waves, excited within cylindrical
tubes and corresponding to simple tones, are modified upon passing
out into the free air.

This inquiry prepared the way to determine the form of vibration
which finally results when the cause exciting the vibratior operates
regularly and continuously. The most important of the general laws
of the potential function were found to be applicable to sound waves;
for it was shown that when sound waves are excited at a point within
a space filled with air their velocity-potential at any other position is
the same as this quantity would be at the first point were waves of the
same intensity excited at the second, and from this it follows that the
phase difference is the same in both cases. Assuming certain restric-
tions in the dimensions of the opening, Helmholtz obtained the relation
between the plane waves within the tube and the semispherical diverg-
ing waves in the free space at a distance, and thus was able to answer
the inquiry with regard to the influence of the open end on the plane
waves. Further investigation gave the positions of the maximum
and minimum amplitude of vibration and the pitch of the tone of
strongest resonance. He treated the difficult question for which of a
series of forms of tubes the motion of the air in the orifice is charac-
terized by the greatest wave length. In a later memoir it was shown
that the results of calculation agree better with experiment when the
interior friction of the air is taken into consideration.

All these results of his acoustical investigations, among which I have
presented only those of the greatest mathematical interest, are contained
in connected order in his famous work, ‘‘The study of tone perceptions
as the physiological basis for the theory of music.”

Among the many results important for the science of music, it may
be mentioned that he distinguished in exact mathematical way between
melody as the basis of music and harmony which serves only to
increase the effect of melody, and that he found a mathematical foun-
dation for the observation that for an harmonious union of several
tones the rates of vibration must stand in a simple ratio, in the fact
that the partial tones accompanying the fundamentals are disagreeable
to the ear when their relative vibration numbers are not in a small,
simple multiple of the ratio of the fundamentals.

Before proceeding to a short account of the much later aerodynamic
investigations of Helmholtz, so far as they are of interest to mathe-
maticians, some consideration is due a memoir on the border between
hydrodynamics and aerodynamics which appeared in 1873 with the
title, “On a theorem concerning geometrically similar motions of fluid
bodies, together with an application to the problem of governing air
balloons.” Hydrodynamic equations were here employed to enable the
production of results of observation obtained by the use of apparatus
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 109

of a certain size, and having a given velocity in a certain fluid to appa-
ratus of another size and another velocity moving in a mass of another
fluid of a similar geometrical form. The extension of the results
analytically obtained for an incompressible liquid to gases led to a
series of interesting applications. Thus Helmholtz found, among other
things, that there is a limit to the size of birds beyond which the mus-
eles would require to do more work in proportion to the mass than
now. In the great vulture nature has probably reached the limit in
size of a creature which shall be able to sustain itself for a long time
in air, and thus man can have no hope by use of the most suitable
wing-like mechanism, which he could move by muscular effort, to raise
and sustain his weight in air. In applying the principle of comparison
above mentioned to the construction of air balloons and ships the inter-
esting result was reached that when the balloon weighs about half as
much as the person propelling it the relation between working force
and weight would be about the same as we are accustomed to see in
steam war vessels.

In the years 1888-1890 Helmholtz extended his investigations of the
motion of fluids in order to show how in masses of air discontinuous
surfaces may result from the continuous action of forces. In these
researches ‘‘on atmospheric movements” and “the energy of the waves
and the winds” the inner friction of the fluids were taken account of,
as in his former hydrodynamic investigations. After showing, by an
exact mathematical treatment, that the effect of the friction at the
earth’s surface was very inconsiderable in the higher layers of air, that
dissipation of the kinetic energy by friction was accomplished chiefly
at the surface of the earth and at the surfaces of separation caused by
rotary motions; and, further, that heat transference, excepting in the
vicinity of the earth’s surface and at the inner discontinuities, is effected
only by radiation and by the convection of the warmer air particles, he
raised the question why the circulation of the atmosphere is not accom-
panied by higher winds than actually do occur. He assigned as the
reason that different layers of air are mixed by the vortices caused by
the rolling together of discontinuous surfaces. In this way the layers
become broken up and receive such a great extension of their surfaces
that the transference of heat and the equalization of their motion
through friction is much facilitated. A still more important cause of
the breaking up and intermixture of the various layers of air is found
in the regular march of waves through the atmosphere, which, as on
water surfaces, is caused by the superposition of two layers of air of
different specific gravities. The existence of such layers is only visible
when the humidity of the under layer becomes so great that mists
gather on the crests of the waves where the pressure is less, and then
there appear strips of parallel clouds which extend over great regions
of the sky. Helmholtz, therefore, was convinced that it was of the
greatest importance to work ont the theory of waves on the boundary
110 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

between two fluids, but on account of the great mathematical difficulty
restricted the investigation at first to the simplest case of the motion
of a rectilinear wave line which proceeds unchanged in form and with
a constant velocity along the unlimited bounding surface between two
fluids of different density. As a level water surface over which blows
a wind of constant strength is in a condition of neutral equilibrium, and
thus readily permits the creation of water waves, so it is with layers of
air of different densities, except that here the phenomenon progresses
on a vastly greater scale. Helmholtz, therefore, investigated the rela-
tions of energy and its division between air and water, and was led to
very general mechanical speculations whose consideration will form the
conclusion of our account. Very interesting but very difficult deduc-
tions were made, which established the difference between stable and
labile equilibrium, and just as, long before, the condition of stable
equilibrium for stationary bodies was found to be a minimum of the
potential energy so for stationary waves with constant velocity-poten-
tial the condition of stable equilibrium was found to correspond to the
minimum of energy.

I turn now to sketch the last great category of his mathematical
physical labors, which led him finally to discoveries of the greatest sig-
nificance for the principles of nechanics. I refer to his investigations in
electricity, which began practically in 1870 and continued for ten years.
Of these the most conspicuous are entitled, ‘On the equations of
motion of electricity for stationary conductors” (1870); ‘‘On the theory
of electro-dynamies” (1870-1874), and ‘‘Comparison of the laws of
Ampere and of Neumann for the electro-dynamic forces” (1875). Most
German physicists at that time deduced the laws of electro-dynamies
from the hypotheses of Wilhelm Weber. ‘These were founded on the
laws of Newton for gravitational forces, and on Coulomb’s law for
static electricity, according to which the intensity of the electrical
force transmitted with infinite velocity in all directions throughout
space, is directly proportional to the product of the two acting electri-
cal quantities and inversely as the square of the distance between
their points of situation. The force is repulsive when the electrical
charges are of the same kind, and attractive when they are of opposite
kinds. Weber extended the assumptions of Coulomb by introducing
besides the distance the velocity and acceleration with which the two
electrical quantities approached or receded from each other. These
suppositions of forces, which depend not simply on the distance but
also on the motion of the points of action, seem now, to be sure, to
contradict the results attained by Helmholtz in his earlier investiga-
tions, for he had showed that forces which depend on the distance and
velocity in general infringe the general law of the conservation of
energy, which holds as well for electro-dynamie as for other phenomena.
But he had not at that time considered the complicated case of the
laws of Weber, where the acceleration was introduced, and it can,
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. jae

indeed, be shown that no reversible process can be derived from
Weber’s law by which work could be done without expenditure of
energy. Besides the hypothesis of Weber, based on the action between
electrically-charged points, there was the older one of F. E. Neumann,
which considered not the action of one charged point upon another, but
of one linear current element on another. This was regarded by Helm-
holtz as one of the happiest and most fruitful conceptions which the
newer mathematical physics has produced. The law which can be
deduced from the hypothesis of Weber for the mutual action of two
linear current elements differs from the Neumann potential law, and
Helmholtz found himself, in the course of his investigations, confronted
with the question whether this hypothesis did in fact represent the
true state of affairs and how both the law of Weber and that of Neu-
mann were related to the laws of Maxwell, which I shall soon have
occasion to mention.

He found that all these laws may be reduced to a common form and
differ then only in the values of a constant which appears. All phe-
nomena which are presented by the circulation of closed currents
through metallic circuits can be accounted for equally well under any
of the several hypotheses; but in the case of incomplete circuits they
lead to considerably different consequences. For the purpose of decid-
ing between these hypotheses, Helmholtz developed, with the help of
his generalized induction law, the equations of motion of electricity in
an extended conducting solid. He found that for a negative value of
the undetermined constant, such as is required by the assumptions of
Weber, a condition of neutral equilibrium of the electricity results, and
thus there may be generated currents of infinite strength and the con-
dition of infinite electrical density. The value zero required by Max-
well and the positive value required by Neumann for this constant do
not, on the contrary, lead to these difficulties. These conclusions were
subjected to many attacks, and their opponents sought both theoretic-
ally and experimentally to show that the hypothesis proposed by E.
Neumann and extended by Helmholtz to form the fundamental law of
electro-dynamic phenomena was incompatible with observation. There
is, in fact, a difference between the potential law of E. Neumann for
closed circuits when applied to incomplete circuits and the form of the
induction law which Helmholtz had earlier derived. For the potential
law ascribes electro-dynamic effect only to currents of electricity and
their action ata distance, and not to the electrical charges put in
motion with the conductors. Experiments show that this assumption
is contradicted by the fact.

With wonderful acuteness of perception Helmholtz had from the
start seen that the solution of all these questions could only be accom-
plished by the very difficult experimental investigation of incomplete
circuits, and he was indeed uncertain that a solution would ever be
obtained, since there might be no incomplete circuits, as the insulator
112 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

which intercepts the conduction of the current might itself be under-
going changes in the distribution of the electricity, so that apparently
incomplete circuits might in reality be complete.

Faraday, who would not admit the existence of forces atting at a dis-
tance, because it appeared to him unthinkable that an action could take
place between two separated bodies without change in the medium
lying between, sought to find such a medium intervening between elec-
trical or magnetic bodies. He succeeded in showing that in almost all
bodies there exists magnetism or diamagnetism, and that in good insu-
lators under the action of electric forces, a change may be observed,
which he designated as dielectric polarization. If, now, one assumes
with Faraday and with Maxwell, who mathematically stated this
hypothesis, that in insulators there may be set up electro-dynamic
activity by which these become dielectrically polarized, then the poten-
tial law follows from the complete theory without modification.

Partly before, partly during the progress of these important re-
searches on the theory of electro-dynamics, Helmholtz pursued investi-
gations on the laws of the division of electric currents in solid con-
ductors and on electric boundary layers. In these investigations the
theorem of the charging of a surface with electricity was extended
with regard to electromotive forces for which a certain distribution of
electrical potential upon the surface of a conductor may be predicted,
which in all other adjacent conductors produces exactly the same cur-
rents as the given distribution of electromotive forces within the inte-
rior of the conductor. It was further shown that the previous assump-
tion that electricity when in a state of equilibrium on one or more bodies
leaves the interior of the bodies completely and is distributed in an
infinitely thin surface layer, is only correct when we have to do with a
single electrical boundary layer on a conductor which touches neigh-
boring conductors or insulators without sudden changes in the poten-
tial function. In those cases, on the other hand, in which irregularities
in the value of the potential function occur on the boundary between
different bodies, as when two conductors under the influence of a gal-
vanic force working between them touch each other, there is formed
along the boundary surface an electrical double layer, whose signifi-
cance for the phenomena which occur when liquids flow along a solid
wall which they moisten was investigated.

In the meantime the conceptions of Maxwell, who, as already men-
tioned, following Faraday, replaced the notion of action at a distance
by the action of the intervening medium, had become of deciding influ-
ence on the works of Helmholtz. In an investigation published in
1881 with the title “On the forces acting in the interior of bodies sub-
jected to magnetic or dielectric polarization,” Helmholtz showed that
it is possible to determine the mechanical forces which act in the inte-
rior of bodies electrically or magnetically polarized without making
any hypotheses regarding the inner constitution of the bodies. The
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 113

analytical treatment led him to expressions from which the forces at a
distance completely disappeared and were replaced by the reactions of
the polarized medium. He thus verified the conceptions of Faraday
and Maxwell, who regarded the ether as the conveyer of tensions in
Space empty of ponderable substance, and who saw in the motions of
electricity in conductors nothing else than the effects of the arising and
passing away of polarization in the insulators. Helmholtz accepted
these views still more completely in a memoir which appeared in 1882
“On systems of absolute measurement for electrical and magnetic
quantities.” In this investigation the theory of Faraday-Maxwell was
given the preference over all other electro-dynamic theories which
assume direct action at a distance having a magnitude and direction
dependent on the absolute or relative motion of two electrical quanti-
ties. For these latter theories violate either the principle of the finite-
ness and constancy of energy or that of the equality of action and
reaction; and first of all, in order to make the theory the basis only of
conservative processes, exclude those phenomena in which, by reason
of friction, heat is created and electrical or magnetic energy lost.

This research, in which, by reason of the observations of Faraday,
he was confronted with the question whether actions at a distance
really exist and must be taken into consideration, shows the wholly
new train of thought upon which he was engaged and whose results
were shortly to appear in discoveries of the greatest value for the
principles of mechanics. But it was first necessary to pursue investi-
gations in other branches of science in order to build thereon a treat-
ment of the principles of mechanics which should embrace the laws of
all the phenomena of nature. He therefore turned his attention to
theoretical chemistry and published in 1882 a treatise ‘“‘On the thermo-
dynamics of chemical processes.” In this the fundamental principles
of the mechanical theory of heat were applied to chemical processes,
and the generalized conception of the principles of mechanics is plainly
visible, though appearing completely in physical form.

Since the loss of mechanical energy by friction creates heat, and a
gain in mechanical energy implies the loss of heat; and since, further,
the quantity of mechanical energy lost or gained is proportional to the
amount of heat correspondingly gained or lost, it becomes natural to
regard heat as a form of energy. The hypothesis may be made that
each particle of a warm body is continually moving with varying
direction and velocity in such a way that its place in the body remains
sensibly unchanged. If this be the case, a part of the energy of a
warm body must be in the form of kinetic energy, and energy of
whatever kind transformed into heat must be measurable in that form.
But the principle of the conservation of energy gives no indication
whether work may be completely transformed into heat and heat
retransformed into work without limit; and a similar uncertainty exists
for all forms of energy. It was to this point of great theoretical and

SM 96 8

114 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

practical interest that Helmholtz next directed his attention. He
investigated how large a part of the heat developed in a galvanic cell
by chemical processes appears in the work done by the current, and
endeavored to arrange the different forms of energy in’ the order in
which they may more or less completely be transformed into work.
The previous experiments on the work equivalent of chemical processes
had been concerned almost exclusively with the evolution or disap-
pearance of heat accompanying the formation or solution of a com-
pound, though in most chemical changes there are changes also in the
condition of aggregation and density of the bodies, for which, also,
work is performed or required. Since in most chemical processes the
changes of melting, evaporation, etc., abstract heat from the surround-
ings, it becomes necessary to inquire what the work equivalents of
these changes are. When one further considers that the chemical
forces may produce not simply heat, but also other forms of energy
without requiring that any of the change of temperature corresponding
to the operation should enter into their production, it appears neces-
sary that in the chemical processes a separation should be made
between the paris of the forces of affinity which are directly changed
to other forms of energy and those which generate heat. These two
parts of the inner energy were designated by Helmholtz as free and
combined; and he found that a chemical reaction proceeding from a
state of rest, and at a constant temperature without the application of
external work, can only go in such a direction that the free energy —
decreases. Thus, under the assumption of the universal application of
the laws of the mechanical theory of heat, the value of the free energy
decides in what sense chemical affinity shall act.

The calculation is only possible when the changes supposed are in
the thermodynamic sense reversible. Helmholtz was led to consider
under what circumstances, if at all, the latent heat of the gases set
free by the decomposition of water would exert influence on the electro-
motive force of cells, but required, in order to pursue this inquiry, to
first give analytical expression to the principles of thermodynamics.
In previous applications of the conception of potential energy, changes
of temperature had not in general been taken into account, either
because the forces entering into the energy changes under evaluation
did not materially depend on the temperature, such, for example, as
gravitation, or else because the temperature remained constant during
the cycle of events considered, or was a function entering into a mechani-
cal change fully determined, as, for example, in the motion of sound
waves the temperature may be considered as a function of the density
of the gas. But when, as might bein the last case, the density is a
function of the temperature, the arbitrary constant must be redeter-
mined for each new temperature, and one can not make a transforma-
tion from one temperature to another.

Helmholtz showed that the thermodynamic equations require for
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 3 4)

their formation only the differential coefficients of the so-called ergals,
completely determined asa function of the temperature. [or processes
taking place at constant temperature the value of the potential fune-
tion is thus determined, and this value he designated as the free energy.
So that, if we call the difference between the total inner energy and
the ergals the bound energy, this latter, divided by the temperature,
gives the quantity termed entropy, already in use. In order to clearly
distinguish what had. in theoretical mechanics been called the vis viva
or kinetic energy from the mechanical equivalent of heat energy,
which was to be considered for the most part as invisible molecular
kinetic energy, he called the first the kinetic energy of organized motion,
defining organized motion—and this distinction is of fundamental signifi-
cance for later works of Helmholtz—as such that the components of
the velocity of the moving masses may be regarded as the differential
coefficients of the space coordinates. Unorganized motion, on the
other hand, is such that as in heat the motion of a single particle has
no necessary similarity to that of its neighbor, and, on account of the
relatively coarse means at our disposal, can not be directly transformed
into other forms of energy. In this sense Helmholtz designated the
value of the entropy as a measure of the disorganization. Ifa change
of condition proceeding with constant entropy be defined as adiabatic,
the entropy becomes the heat capacity for the heat generated during
adiabatic processes at the expense of the free energy. For all changes
of condition in which the temperature remains constant work is per-
formed only at the expense of the free energy, the bound energy chang-
ing in amount at the expense of the heat entering and proceeding away.
Assembling these results, it appears that all exterior work is done at
the expense of the free energy, all evolution of heat is at the expense of
the bound energy, and finally for each rise of temperature of the system
free energy goes over in definite quantity and becomes bound. From
this Helmholtz derived results on the emission and absorption of heat
in the formation and breaking up of chemical compounds, which were
substantiated by observations with galvanic elements.

In the last ten years of his life, from 1884 to 1894, he was occupied
with his great researches on the principles of mechanics, in which he
verified all the theoretical conclusions which he had derived in the
course of his long and difficult investigations in the whoie range of
physics and physiology.

The general principles of mechanics, the principle of d’Alembert,
the law of the motion of a material point, the law of surfaces, the prin-
ciple of the conservation of kinetic energy, and the principle of least
action were all proved with the assumption of Newtonian forces and
rigid connection. It had later been found by observation that the laws
So derived were much more general in their application in nature than
followed from their proofs, and it had been on the one hand supposed
that certain general characteristics of the Newtonian conservative
116 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

forces of attraction were common to all natural forces, while on the
other hand it had been doubted whether, for example, the application
of the principle of the equality of action and reaction was generally
permissible. As already pointed out, the hypothesis had been made that
action at a distance was resolvable into continuous dynamic reactions
in an invisible intervening medium, thus establishing an analogy with
the role of a spring or cord in the transmission of force. Since, how-
ever, it is the province of physics to refer the phenomena of nature to
the simple laws of mechanics, the question arises first of all what con-
stitute the first principles of mechanics, and what are, as Hertz has
said, the final and simplest laws which each natural motion must obey,
which no motion can ignore whose presence in nature is determined by
our everyday experience, and from which as the fundamental principles
of mechanics the whole science may be deduced without further refer-
ence to observation.

Until the pioneer researches of Helmholtz on the conservation of
energy, mechanics, as has been remarked, following Galileo’s concep-
tion of the inertia of masses, had been developed by application of
the three laws of Newton. When, however, the whole structure was
systematically and critically examined, a want of clearness was appar-
ent in the definition of mechanical quantities, and the proofs of funda-
mental laws of statics, such as the laws of the parailelogram of forces
and of virtual velocities, were found to be not altogether rigorous.
Knowledge of the action of forces at a distance and of molecular,
chemical, electrical, and magnetic forces was purely empirical.

The discovery of the principle of the conservation of energy made
possible a consistent development of theoretical mechanics. The idea
of force became less prominent, while mass and energy came forward as
the indestructible physical quantities. Energy is present in two great
divisions, of which the one—kinetic energy—is in all cases given by a
constant function of the velocity of masses, while the other—the poten-
tial energy—is determined by the relative position of the masses, but
must be derived in each case with consideration of their particular
nature. The discussion of the different forms of energy, as well as of
their mutual transformation, forms the subject of both physics and
chemistry. In expressing the progress of phenomena as a function of
the time, Helmholtz did not, like most of his predecessors, make the
equations of motion the starting point from which to derive the genera
principles of mechanics, because in this method it becomes necessary
to make certain assumptions regarding the forces operating and
regarding the limiting conditions of the problem, and these limi-
tations exclude from the consideration a large number of possible
motions. He proceeded, on the other hand, from the principle of least
action, and by this means brought into the discussion many examples
of relations between forces found in nature, but not occurring in
treatises in which the former method is pursued,
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. LEG

These matters formed the contents of memoirs which Helmholtz pub-
lished in 1886 and 1887 with the titles, “On the physical significance of
the principle of least action,” and “The history of the principle of least
action.” Hertz regarded these works at the time as marking the fur-
thest advance of physics. Defining, after Leibnitz, the quantitative
measure of the action following from the inertia of a moving mass as
the product of the mass into the space traversed into the velocity, or
as the product of the kinetic energy into the time, then the principle of
least action requires that the total amount of the action shall have a
limiting value in the passage from a given position of starting toa
given position of rest. In performing the variation the coordinates of
the points corresponding to intermediate positions of the system are
varied simultaneously with the time in such a manner that the total
energy of the system is not changed. This latter requirement can be
satisfied by the condition that.the energy at a given instant shall be
the same for all variations as at the same instant in the unvaried
motion, without regard to the magnitude of this latter, which it is pos-
sible might change in the course of a normal motion. In this way
Lagrange and Hamilton have treated the problem. Jacobi, however,
made the preliminary condition that the potential energy is independent
of the time, and this requires that the amount of energy shall retain a
definite value, in which case this relation may be used to eliminate the
time increment from the action. Physically, Jacobi’s restricting con-
dition holds for a completely determined and closed system, while the
Lagrange-Hamilton form of the equations of motion also holds true for
an incompletely closed system, upon which variable outside influences
are at work independent of the reaction of the moving system.

Hamilton, keeping the Lagrange conditions, has given the principle
of least action another form in which it is called ‘‘ Hamilton’s principle.”
Defining the principal function of Hamilton as the difference between
potential energy and the kinetic energy of the system, then the principle
which bears his name requires that the negative mean values of the
principal function, reckoned for equal time elements, shall have a
definite value for a normal motion between given points.

But Lagrange, Hamilton, and Jacobi had proved the principle (first
stated, but not proved by Maupertuis in 1744) only under the physical
assumption of Newton’s laws; and the motion of the points of a material
system had been deduced from it under the condition of a rigid con-
nection of the points, and with the express assumption of the principle
of the constancy of energy. When Helmholtz had showed the general
validity of the law of the constancy of energy, this last hypothesis
remained a limitation no longer for cases in which all the forms are
known in which energy equivalents are transformed during the progress
of the change. It now remained to decide whether physical processes
which depend not simply on the motions of determinate masses for
which Newton’s laws are applicable, but in which quantities of energy
118 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

come to consideration, may be treated by the principle of least action.
As the forces of heat had already been referred to the hidden motion
of conceivable masses, and as Maxwell had recognized the source of
electrodynamic actions in the motion of unseen masses, Helmholtz
wished to introduce the motion and energy of such hidden masses gen-
erally in physical problems. He recognized as antecedent to obscure
phenomena motion and masses, which are to our senses invisible.

He chose Hamilton’s principle for the expression of all motion, since
it admits that upon a mechanical system whose inner forces may be
deterinined as differential coefficients of force functions independent of
the time, external forces may be exerted depending on the time. The
work done by such forces is to be independently computed as not
belonging to the conservative process, but dependent on other physical
events.

Since, as Lagrange has showed, the outwardly directed forces of the
moving system may be expressed through the principal function,
Helmholtz called this the “kinetic potential,” and thus by the principle
of least action there follows this general characteristic of the progress
of all physical phenomena: The negative mean value of the kinetic
potential reckoned for equal time elements along the path is a minimum,
or when longer intervals are considered it has a limiting value in com-
parison with all other neighboring paths which lead from the starting
point to the end point in the same time. The kinetic potential goes
over into potential energy for the case of a-body at rest, and from the
Hamilton principle it follows that for equilibrium the potential energy
isaminimum. It was already known that when certain coordinates
are represented in the value of the principal function only by their
differential coefficients, and the corresponding forces are equal to zero,
the Lagrange expression for the forces acting along the other coordi-
nates becomes, analytically, exactly as in the general cases, a trans-
formed principal function, which no longer as before contains the deriv-
itives of the coordinates only in the second, but contains them also in
the first degree. Thus, forms of the kinetic potential may appear in
which the separation of the two forms of energy can not be recognized.
Indeed, the kinetic potential may be any function whatever of the
general coordinates and of the corresponding velocities. These facts
led Helmholtz to inquire what form the principal function must take in
order that the Lagrange expression for the external forces should
remain unchanged. He found at once that this condition is satisfied
when this function is increased by the sum of the products of the coor-
dinates into the exterior forces expressed as a function of the time and
resolved along these coordinates. This expanded expression for the
law of least action gives the Lagrange formula for the forces immedi-
ately on performing the variation.

The importance of Lagrange’s form of the equations of motion had
already been shown by Helmholtz, since it is applicable to cases where
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 119

in addition to the potential and actual energy of weighable masses,
thermal, electrodynamic, and electromagnetic equivalents of work
appear. For he had expressed the laws of reversible heat processes in
the form of Lagrange’s equations of motion, and therefore through the
law of the minimum characteristic value of the kinetic potential. It
was found, however, that the temperature as a measure of the thermal
motions did not, like the velocities in the kinetic energy of a ponder-
able system, enter into the expression only in the second power. Hence
if it is desired to determine the general characteristics of systems which
are governed by the principle of least action, the assumption must be
abandoned that the velocities enter only in the Values of the kinetic
energy, in the form of homogeneous functions of the second degree, and
the principle must be discussed under the supposition that the prinei-
pal function is any function whatever of the coordinates and the veloci-
ties. The immediate occasion. for these general considerations on the
part of Helmholtz was the investigation of the form of the kinetic poten-
tial demanded for Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics, in which the
velocities of electricity enter as a function of the second degree whose
coefficients are not constants as in the measure of the value of the
kinetic energy for ponderable systems, and where besides these appear
linear functions of the velocity, whenever the action of permanent
magnets comes into account.

Since the phenomena of light may be in the main explained under
the hypothesis that the ether is a medium with properties similar to
those of ponderable elastic solids, the principle of least action must
be looked upon as applicable to the motion of light. Thus Helmholtz
regarded the proper domain of this principle as far outreaching the
bounds within which is included the mechanics of weighable bodies,
and he held it as in the highest degree probable that it is the general
law of all reversible natural processes. It is, moreover, to be noted
that irreversibility rests not in the nature of things but in the limita-
tions of our means of investigation, which do not enable us to reor-
ganize unorganized atomic motions so as, for example, to reverse the
motion of all atoms affected by the motions characteristic of heat.

The general validity of the principle of least action makes it of great
value in formulating the laws of new classes of phenomena, in that it
embraces in a single mathematical expression all the essential condi-
tions of these phenomena. All cases of physical processes in which
the kinetic potential contains the velocities in linear members were
called by Helmholtz instances of hidden motion. It was shown that
the principle of least action, as expressed in the above-mentioned gen-
eral form, embraces the principle of the conservation of energy, and
that the value of the energy may be determined from the values of the
kinetic potential. As it does not, on the other hand, appear that in
ali cases where the constancy of energy is preserved the principle of
least action is obeyed, the latter asserts more than the former, and
120 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

expresses a particular characteristic of the natural forces in considera-
tion not included in the fact that they are conservative forces. The
derivation of the value of the kinetic potential from the energy intro-
duces arbitrary quantities which are homogeneous functions in the first
degree of the velocities. This fact is of significance in that it shows
that it is not possible with a complete knowledge of the relations of
the energy to the coordinates and the velocities to find the kinetic
potential and with it the laws of motion of the system, assuming that
the principle of least action is followed. It is necessary in addition to
these facts to discover the linear functions of the velocities which cor-
respond to the hidden motions.

After developing some general correlated relations between the
forces exerted by a system in different directions, as, for example, the
thermodynamic law that if with rising temperature the pressure of a
material system increases then compression will cause a rise of tempera-
ture, Helmholtz was able to show, at least for a restricted number of
coordinates, that, conversely, the principal of least action is applicable
when these correlated relations exist. Finally he derived both the
total and partial differential equations of motion of Hamilton for the
generalized form of the kinetic potential. Krom them he obtained a
series of results for reversible motions of a system; that is, for such
motions that the series of positions assumed in a positive motion should
be reassumed in a return motion without the action of exterior forces,
and with the same time intervals intervening.

We shall presently discuss further applications of the principle of
least action as generalized by Helmholtz, and it need here only be
remarked that Hertz discovers another generally valid law at the basis
of this principle, which describes the motions of all systems directly.
This law asserts that where the connections of a system can be dis-
solved for an instant all the masses of which it is composed will part
asunder in rectilinear and uniform motions, but when such a dissolu-
tion is impossible the system will approximate to these preferred
motions as nearly as possible.

The derivation of the characteristics of motion from the principle of
least action involved great mathematical and physical difficulties and
led Helmholtz to investigations described in ‘‘Studies upon the staties
of monocyclic systems” (1884), and ‘‘ Principles of the statics of mono-
cyclic systems” (1884). These mark a distinct advance in the method
of treatment of mathematical and physical problems, which has already,
in the hands of Boltzmann, reached a commanding place in the theo-
retical physics.

When a system of bodies is affected with motion there is in general
a change either in the position of the system in space or else in the
condition of the bodies. This, however, is not necessary, as is exem-
plified in the passage of a long-continued current of electricity through
awire. In this case the position, the temperature, the magnetic condi-
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 121

tion sn neighboring masses of iron, all remain at every point unaltered.
Hence the motion which we regard as the cause of the phenomenon
must in a sense be so far stationary that as soon as a particle leaves its
place there must, within an infinitesimal time, be substituted another
moving in the same direction with the same velocity, so that, in spite
of the continual motion, there is at no point in space any apparent
change. Helmholtz designated motions, such, for example, as the
motion of a rotating top or that of a frictionless liquid in a circular
canal, as cyclic. When all the motions of a system of bodies are cyclic,
the system is said to be a cyclic system. Cyclic motions are generally
hidden motions, since they do not alone cause a change in the appear-
ance of the distribution of masses, and, conversely, hidden motions are
usually cyclic. <A coordinate is called cyclic when the whole condition
of the system is not altered by changes in this coordinate. Since the
kinetic energy of the system remains unchanged, it is not a function of
a cyclic coordinate, but in general its differential is, since the kinetic
energy is greater the faster the cyclic motion progresses. The condi-
tion of a system may be determined through other than cyclic coor-
dinates, which Helmholtz called the slowly varying coordinates or
parameters. These change so slowly that their differential coefficients
with respect to time may be neglected, and the kinetic energy is there-
fore a function of the parameters, but not of their differential coefficients.
When the parameters remain constant for a long period of time the
motion taking place during the interval is cyclic. Systems are classi-
fied, according to the number of their cyclic coordinates, as monocyclic,
etc., and are in general polycyclic.

The condition for the existence of a cyclic system can be fulfilled
with any degree of approximation whenever the system possesses
chiefly cyclic coordinates, provided the parts of the energy which are
due to the velocity of change in the parameters are small in compari-
son with the parts which depend on the cyclic intensity, or in other
words, provided the velocity of change of the parameters is negligible
compared with that of the cyclic coordinates. The forces of a cyclic
system are by definition independent of the velocity of change of its
parameters, as follows immediately also from the Lagrange expression
through the kinetic energy. It follows also that when no forces operate
on the cyclic coordinates of a cyclic system the whole cyclic move-
ment of the system, determined by the product of the mass by the veloc-
ity, is constant. In this case the motion is defined as adiabatic. The
motions characterized by Helmholtz are defined in accordance with
their properties as such that the potential and actual energy of the
system are independent of a certain number of coordinates which
would be necessary to completely determine the position of the system,
but which are represented in the values of the energy only by their
differential coefficients with reference to the time. This would also be
the case with motions not strictly stationary when the changes in the
122 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

system were allowed to proceed so slowly that the system is never appre-
ciably removed from conditions in which it might continuously remain.
The motion of heat is not strictly monocyclic, for each atom probably
continually alternates in the direction of its motion, and only in that an
enormous number of atoms represent all stages of motion is the
mechanical] character of a monocyclic motion simulated.

Helmholtz raised the question under what general conditions the
known physical characteristics of heat motion could be produced by
other known classes of motions, and whether there is any special class of
motions understood to be mechanical for which there exist restrictions
to the transformation of work equivalents similar to the second law of
thermodynamics. He extended the definition of a monocyclic system
so as to include, besides those containing only one cyclic coordinate,
others in which several such coordinates appear, but all but one of
these functions are of another order of magnitude from the one under
consideration. The very important and interesting case was discussed
in which certain mechanical means are made use of to correlate the
velocities in two monocyclic systems, these devices being of such a
nature as to exert no influence when the motion proceeds with regu-
larity, as desired, but which oppose with appropriate force any devia-
tions from regularity. Helmholtz called a system of this sort, as for
example two tops whose axes are so connected that they are forced to
rotate with equal velocity, fettered, and the condition, the coupling of
the system. He recognized in the device of coupling the only means
of acting directly on the inner motion of monocyclic systems. Thus
in heat motion we are debarred from influencing particular isolated
atoms, and are forced to act without distinction on all contained within
a given space. When, now, two originally independent monocyclic sys-
tems are by suitable regulation of exterior forces caused to assume a
state corresponding to the conditions of a rigid connection, such a
rigid connection may be inserted without disturbing the motion in
progress, which continues in future as restrained by this linkage. In
a Similar way two bodies at equal temperature may be placed in con-
tact without altering their inner motions, so that they retain equal
temperatures while slow changes of temperature are made, and the
equality is not prejudiced by pressure or action at a distance between
the two systems upon coming together.

With the help of mathematical considerations quite analogous to
those employed in thermodynamical investigations, Helmholtz showed
in general that when monocyclic systems admit only of such mutual
connections that the external forces of each separate system depend
only on the momentary condition of the system, and not upon the
beginning or ceasing of connection with other systems, then the
coupling is a pure coupling of motion, and creates a new monocyclic —
system. When upon the beginning of interchange of internal motions
between two or more systems the equilibrium of internal motion
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS. 123

between them requires that a certain function of the parameters—in
heat, the temperature—should have the same value in all the systems,
then the third property of heat expressed by the law of Carnot, namely,
the restricted capacity for transformation, is here in evidence.

The three last memoirs of Helmholtz are in part in correction and in
part in amplification of these investigations, fundamental for the prin-
ciples of mechanics, on the principle of least action. They rest upon
the conceptions worked out by Faraday, Maxwell, and Hertz, accord-
ing to which the electrical oscillations in the ether are, in their velocity
of propagation, their nature as transverse vibrations, and the conse-
quent possibility of phenomena of polarization, refraction, aud reflection,
exactly analogous to the oscillations of light and heat, and constitute
the method of performance of the apparent actions at a distance by
conveying the force through the intervening medium.

In the memoir on “The principle of least action in electrodynamics”
(1892), Helmholtz investigated whether the empiric laws of electrody-
namics, aS expressed in Maxwell’s equations, may be brought into the
form of a law of minima. Upon the ground of considerations already
referred to, he was able to show that the ponderomotive forces could
in fact be deduced from the generalized Hamilton principle in a form
completely agreeing with Maxwell’s theory. The energy was divided
into two parts which played the same roles toward one another as the
potential and actual energy for ponderable masses. The electrical
energy corresponded to the potential energy of masses at rest so long
as no changes occurred in the moments or electric currents, while the
magnetic energy correspouded to vis viva.

He penetrated still further in the electromagnetic theory of light,
and proceeding from the consideration that the dispersion of light is
brought about only at the boundaries of spaces which contain ponder-
able masses besides the ether, he sought, in an article which appeared
in the year 1892, to explain the color dispersion with the aid of this
theory. The mathematical theory of Maxwell requires that pondero-
motive forces must exist along with the electric oscillations of the ether,
which are capable of setting in motion heavy atoms which lie in the
ether. Helmholtz showed that the material particles must also have
charges of electricity, so that in the equations of motion to be formed
the electric movements due to the electricity of each particle, since
they are of different magnitude and direction, and are also affected by
other than electrical forces—as, for example, inertia, friction, etc.—are
to be distinguished from those in the free ether and particularly inves-
tigated in order to deduce the laws of color dispersion.

His general ‘“‘Consequences of Maxwell’s theory of the motions of
the pure ether” (1893) is of very great interest. Capacity for motion
is ascribed to the ether, and it is represented as receiving motions
imparted to it by ponderable masses which permeate it, and as being
thus moved along with them. Such mixtures occur in all substances
124 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS.

which are either conducting or refracting with respect to a vacuum, or
have values of the dielectric and magnetic constants different from
those of a vacuum. From the motions of the ponderable parts the
corresponding motions of the ether may be determined. For space
free from ponderable masses and filled only with ether, the question
arises, if pure ether is free from inertia whether it makes way for the
motion of material bodies through it, or penetrates them, remaining in
either case wholly at rest, or whether it in part moves with them and
in part makes way for their passage. Under the assumption that the
ether has, mechanically considered, the properties of a frictionless,
incompressible liquid, but without inertia, Helmholtz showed that the
laws founded by Maxwell and elaborated by Hertz are sufficient to
completely determine the laws of the changes and motions which take
place in the ether. ‘The recapitulation of the laws of electrodynamics
under the principle of least action, as already made by Helmholtz,
required for this purpose only the introduction of the hypothesis of
uncompressibility. This would be accomplished by supplying in the
expression for electrokinetic potential the left-hand member of the
definition equation of incompressibility. In this way important con-
clusions could be drawn concerning the rise and decline of pondero-
motive forces in ether at rest and in motion.

In an incomplete ‘‘ Supplement to the paper: On the principle of least
action in electrodynamics” (1894), Helmholtz returned once more to
his recapitulation of the Maxwell-Hertz laws of electrodynamics in the
generalized form of the principle of least action, in order to decide
whether the observed values of the total energy of electromagnetic
processes required the addition of a linear function of the velocities,
and where this is the case to derive the expression for the.ponderomo-
tive forces from this principle.

Here ended the long series of brilliant mathematical and mathemati-
cal-physical researches of this incomparable investigator, which, so far
as was possible without going deeply into the refinements of his mathe-
matical analyses I have endeavored to outline before you, although
certainly in an incomplete manner. What might have been the con-
tents of the address which Helmholtz was preparing for the quadren-
nial scientific assemblage at Vienna with the title, “On continuous
forms of motion and apparent substances,” and of which he left but a
few pages of manuscript for the introduction, will forever remain
unknown to us. But one may well surmise that the world of science
would have found there the philosophic kernel of the great researches
which he carried out in the last years of his life on the foundations and
principles of mechanics and physics.
PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE
ATMOSPHERE!

By Prof. ALFRED CORNU,

D.C. L., F. R. S., Officer of the Legion of Honor, Vice-President of the Academy of
Sciences, Paris.

The primary and effective cause for almost all the physical phe-
nomena that occur in the earth’s atmosphere is the heat of the sun.
The atmosphere may then be considered as an immense heating appara-
tus that has for its fire the sun, for its boiler the earth or the clouds
heated by the solar rays, and for its condenser the radiation that occurs
toward interplanetary space.

The means at the disposal of physicists and meteorologists for study-
ing the different regions of the atmosphere are very limited; they are
usually obliged to content themselves with very indirect observations
and to proceed by induction. Most interesting phenomena do indeed
occur in the upper regions at almost inaccessible heights. The pur-
pose of this paper is to show by a few experiments that physical
meteorologists are beginning to attain a true explanation of natural
phenomena. You will see, indeed, that in certain cases they can not
only exactly produce those phenomena, but often they are able to effect
a true synthesis of them by using means in every way analogous to
those actually operative in nature.

I will commence by enumerating the means in use among meteorolo-
gists for studying the different regions of the atmosphere.

The most direct method is founded upon the use of the aerostat.
The aerostat, or balloon, allows us, in fact, to transport our meteorolog-
ical instruments into the very midst of the atmospheric strata we wish
to study.

Unhappily this method is difficult, expensive, and even dangerous;
therefore it is employed only in exceptional cases. The aerostatic
ascensions most productive of results have been those of Gay-Lussac
(1804), of Glaisher (1862), and recently that of Dr. Berson of Stassfurt
(1894), who ascended more than 9,000 meters.

‘Translated from the Proceedings of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, Vol.
XIV, pp. 638-648, :

126 PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF UPPER REGIONS OF ATMOSPHERE.

The most important facts observed from the balloon were entirely
unexpected. I will briefly state them:

1. Clouds formed of ice crystals occur very frequently; they consti-
tute the cirrus clouds that float at very great heights.

2. The direction of the wind changes at different heights.

3. The temperature does not always decrease regularly with the
increase in altitude, cold strata and warm strata often alternating with
each other.

The second method of studying the atmosphere is by the establish-
ment of mountain observatories, upon isolated peaks when possible.
At these stations the unexpected inversion of the temperature at vari-
ous altitudes is daily verified.

The ice clouds are too high to be directly reached by mountain
observatories.

A view of the principal mountain observatories of France will prob-
ably interest you.

Photographs of the following observatories were then thrown on
the screen:

Pic du Midi (altitude 2,800 meters), in the Pyrenees.

Mont Ventaux (altitude 1,900 meters), in Provence.

Puy-de-Dome (altitude 1,900 meters), in Auvergne.

Eiffel Tower (altitude 330 meters), at Paris.

This last observatory, thanks to the lightness of its construction of
open work, may almost be considered as a captive balloon fixed perma-
nently at 300 meters above the ground.

Halos.—Since ice clouds are situated at altitudes (6,000 to 10,000
meters) greater than that of the highest mountain observatories, we
are condemned to the use of the balloon alone for all observations upon
them. Fortunately the presence of ice crystals is revealed by an opti-
cal phenomenon that can be observed even at ordinary levels—the halo.
This is a brilliant circle having a radius of about 22 degrees that sur-
rounds the sun or moon. It has a reddish tint within and is slightly
bluish at its outer border. It is explained, as are many appearances of
a similar kind, by the refraction of the light of the sun or the moon
in passing through icy needles. In fact the ice erystals are hexagonal
prisms, the faces of which are inclined to each other, twe by two, at an
angle of 60 degrees. These, scattered through the air and facing in
every direction, refract the light, but the refracted rays can not pass
beyond the angle of 22 degrees imposed upon them by the minimum of
deviation discovered by Sir Isaac Newton. The limit of the refracted
rays is then a cone of 22 degrees around the line that passes from the
eye to the luminous body. .

Experiment imitating a halo.—By forming crystals in a transparent
medium made by mixing appropriate liquids, there is exactly repro-
duced the mingling of the warm, moist strata of the atmosphere with
the coid ones which produces ice crystals.

To do this place in a glass jar a saturated aqueous solution of potash
alum, and send through the jar a luminous beam projecting the image
of a circular opening like that of the sun upon the dark sky. Then
PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF UPPER REGIONS OF ATMOSPHERE. 127

add to the contents of the jar a quarter of its total volume of rectified
spirits; the alum, insoluble in the alcoholic mixture, precipitates in
very minute crystals that float within the liquid. The image of the
sun first becomes dim as in a fog, but soon a brilliant and slightly
iridescent circle is seen, simulating very closely the appearance of a
halo. The experiment is brilliant and instructive.

This phenomenon is well known to country people; it is a certain
Sign of rain when it appears during a warm day, even when no other
sign predicts a meteorological disturbance.

Alteration and inversion of temperature. —In neighboring observatories
situated at widely different altitudes, like those of Puy-de-Dome and
Clermont, we often find that warm currents exist in the upper regions.
It is to successive inversions of this character that Mr. Amsler, of
Schaffouse, attributes the beautiful phenomenon known in Switzerland
as the “‘Alpengliihen,” which consists in a renewal of the illumination of
the snowy summits of the Alps some moments after the setting of the
sun has darkened them.

There was thrown on the screen a photograph of the summits of the
- Bernese Oberland, the Jungfrau, the Monch, the Higer; the view being
taken from St. Beatenberg, near the Lake of Thun. <A picturesque
imitation of the phenomenon just cited was given by means of a colored
glass and suitable diaphragms.

The explanation of Mr. Amsler is founded on the change of direction
of curvature that is given to the trajectory of the luminous rays accord-
ing as the air at the bottom of the valleys is warmer or colder than
that of the more elevated regions.

Before sunset, the earth’s surface, heated by the solar rays, gives
the trajectory a curvature, S A M B, like that of a mirage; that is,
convex toward the earth; the sun, while setting at S’, causes the
Shadow of the summit, A, to be projected upon the summit, B, which
it would seem ought henceforward to remain in shadow, since the sun
continues to descend and its last rayis S’ A M’ B’. But if, during the
interval, the air of the valley becomes sufficiently cool, the trajectory
curves in the opposite direction, 8’ A M” B’’, and the summit, B, is
illumined anew.

Haperiments showing the inversion of curves of luminous trajectories.—

By using some care we can place in a transparent jar, 20 em. in diam-
eter, three strata of liquid, a lower one of chloride of zine, heavy but
128 PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF UPPER REGIONS OF ATMOSPHERE.

less refringent, and an upper one of diluted glycerin, lighter but also
less refringent than the middle one. A movable mirror, LL, throws a
beam of light through an opening, S, of a diaphragm. By throwing
this beam in appropriate directions, it is reflected either from the upper
or the lower stratum. A little fluorescein lights up the trajectories of
the beams and makes their curvatures quite visible; we can thus
represent the Alpengliihen with some accessory features.

Scintillation of the stars.——This phenomenon is also a proof of the
alterations of temperature and movement that occur in the higher
strata of air. Spectrum analysis shows that the scintillation is pro-
duced by the disappearance of the successive colors of the spectrum
following a somewhat regular course, according to the distance of the
star from the zenith.

Imitation of this phenomenon.—A very striking experiment showing
this can be made by projecting with a lens, L, the image of a luminous
opening, O, upon a small silvered ball, B, 3 to 4 inches in diameter,

placed upon black velvet. We thus obtain the appearance of a fixed
star of remarkable brilliancy.

But the luminous opening, O, is made in a cardboard upon which is
projected the spectral image of a slit, F, dispersed by a prism for
direct vision, P. The cardboard, CO, is not exactly at the focus of
the spectrum; that being formed farther away, in the plane of the lens,
L. It hence results that the iridescent image of the slit in the card-
board has at its middle, where is placed the opening, O, a white region.
The light thrown upon the ball, B, is therefore perfectly colorless. But
on leaving the opening, the beam expands into a spectrum upon the
projection lens, L, which recomposes it at B, as in the celebrated
Newtonian experiment.

Then by shifting before the lens, L, a grating with large meshes,
certain radiations are intercepted, and the star, B, appears colored.

A diverging half lens, D, having the same focus as L, annuls its
effect, and the spectrum of the star, with the artificial bands caused by
PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF UPPER REGIONS OF ATMOSPHERE. 129

the grating, appears on a white screen beside the ball. This is an
imitation of the spectrum analysis of the scintillation of the stars.

We see by these few examples that the study of the optical phe-
nomena of the atmosphere aided by physical analysis and synthesis,
may and must teach us much concerning the calorific phenomena of
inaccessible regions.

Dynanic phenomena of the atmosphere—The phenomena we have
hitherto studied are due to states of almost complete equilibrium in
the atmospheric strata; we might call them static. But the calorific
action of the sun, combined with the cooling action of radiation into
space, may produce phenomena of movement presenting every degree
of intensity, from the weakest to the most violent. We will call these
dynamic phenomena.

They are manifested under very diverse forms:

1. Under the form of mechanical energy; which results in the forma-
tion of winds, whirlwinds, cyclones, waterspouts, ete.

2. Under the form of calorific energy; which results in the formation
of clouds, rain, and hail, corresponding to the changes of state of water,
the ever variable element of the atmosphere.

3. Under the form of electrical energy; lightning, thunder, ete.

In fact, the transformation of solar energy into mechanical energy
is the fundamental phenomenon and the one that leads to all others.
For the sake of brevity this is the only transformation that we will
consider here.

The most simple mechanical phenomenon that is produced in the
atmosphere is the wind. ‘The wind has for its origin a difference of
pressure between two more or less distant points. We have known
since Pascal that the pressure of air is measured by the barometer.
We might, then, think that the direction of the wind could always be
determined by the indications of that instrument; that is to say, that
the wind ought to go from the point where the barometrical pressure
is greatest to the point where that pressure is least.

But, strange to say, this is almost never the case; the real direction
of the wind is always oblique to that theoretical direction.

This fact has only been known for a few years. It has been put
beyond doubt by the general meteorological charts which, conceived
thirty years ago by Le Verrier, are to-day so widely circulated.

The wind seems to move around the point in the chart where the
minimum is found, its direction, in the northern hemisphere, being the
reverse of that taken by the hands of a watch, or in the same direction
with the hands around the point of maximum pressure. In the south-
ern hemisphere these directions are reversed.

In a word, the most ordinary movement of the atmosphere is a
gyratory one, that which is called cyclonic.

This whirling movement of the air was noted long ago. We see it
occurring quite frequently around us; dust and dead leaves are raised

SM 96 9

130 PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF UPPER REGIONS OF ATMOSPHERE.

by the wind in gyrations similar to the eddies of water in rivers.
Sailors are acquainted with cyclones and water spouts, and dread their
dangerous effects. On the American continent there are also observed
terrible hurricanes, called tornadoes. These gyratory movements
might appear to belong only to great tempestuous disturbances, but as
we pursue in detail the study of the atmosphere we find that this kind
of disturbance is met with in all the manifestations of displaced air.
We conclude from this that the cyclonic movement is in some way the
normal state of agitated air. It does not seem possible to use any force
upon a gaseous mass without developing in it more or less rapid rota-
tions that tend to become permanent.

ieperimental proof.—W henever we eject a strong jet of gas there are
found about it one or more cyclonic currents. The cyclone takes the
form of a ring if the ejected column is quite cylindrical, as is seen in
the rings of smoke that occur after the explosion of cannon, guns, etc.

Here was shown the well-known experiment of producing fine
wreaths of vapor by striking the canvas bottom of a box filled with
vapors of ammonium chloride and having a circular opening in its top,
the wreaths being rendered visible by placing them within the range of
an electric light.

Multiple origin of the gyratory movements of the atmosphere.—Almost
all the general causes that affect the movement of the atmosphere are
gyratory influences; when the movement is once set up it continues of
itself and sometimes increases. We ought to mention, in the first
place, the rotation of the earth, which always involves a small com-
ponent of rotation effecting the displacement of a gaseous mass in
latitude or altitude. In the second place, and acting as a controlling
cause, we have the solar heat, which warms the air near the ground or
the clouds. As the ascensional force of the heated gas can not be uni-
form over all the surface exposed to solar radiation (both because of
the nature and the configuration of the surface), there is a disturbance
of the equilibrium at certain points, and columns of air tend to rise.
We have then before us the case of the jets already cited, the condi-
tions being favorable for gyrations around horizontal axes. When the
gyration has once started, the causes that led to it keep it up and
increase it.

The existence of whirlwinds with horizontal axes has been observed
in hailstorms (in particular in the storm of May 20, 1893, at Pitts-
burg) by an American meteorologist, Mr. Frank W. Very, and has
attorded him a very ingenious explanation of the formation of hail.
Such a whirlwind, if it is of sufficient size, transports the warm, moist
air from the surface of the earth into elevated cold regions. The
moisture freezes, and the ice crystals are carried along in the gyratory
movement; they alternately rise and fall, following the spirals of the
whirlwind, and at every passage into the lower regions, charged with
moisture, they increase in size. This explanation accounts for all the
special phenomena that we observe in the fall of hailstones; their zonal

structure, their very low temperature, the peculiar noise before their
fall, the electric phenomena that accompany them; for a whirlwind of
hail is a true inductive electrical machine—a sort of replenisher.

Artificial reproduction of natural gyratory phenomena.—The phe-
nomena produced by the rapid rotation of air are quite unexpected
because of the singular behavior of the forces set in play. The ordi-
nary laws of mechanies, familiar to us from our daily experience, appear
to be entirely different from those which the cyclonic movements seem
to obey. And this ought not to astonish us. We have reduced
mechanics to its most simple elements; a material particle, a constant
force, rectilinear motion. Thanks to these simplifications, we have well
mastered the motion of spherical projectiles, of a pendulum, of the
rotation of a fly wheel, etc. But as soon as the solid body becomes
complex in form, whenever the movement that it may assume involves
both translation and rotation, our imagination does not well seize it.
If to the complication of form there is further added the resistance of
_the surrounding medium, we then have no longer any idea of the
probable effect that will result. Witness the boomerang. As to the
movements, they are so difficult for us to foresee that we are always
surprised if we succeed in manipulating a vessel filled with water. As
soon as the mass of liquid becomes somewhat considerable the tumultu-
ous disturbance that we involuntarily cause in it always leads us to
commit some awkward act.

You will see, then, how impossible it is that we should be able to
predict the movements of the atmosphere, whose mass is immense, each
cubic meter weighing 1,300 grams. If the energy expended in moving
such masses is considerable, inversely the stability of the controlling
forces 1s very great, since it must last until that energy is dissipated
by passive resistance, almost all of which is due to friction against the
earth’s surface.

We will not seek, therefore, to analyze the forces involved in the
gyratory movements ofthe air. I will confine myself to repeating before
you some of the beautiful experiments of M. Ch. Weyher, who has been
so kind as to come himself to assist me and to set up the apparatus that
4 now place before you.

You see here a sphere composed of 10 semicircular blades, made to
rotate rapidly around the axis AB (fig. 1, Pl. 1). The air attracted by
this rotation produces a general cyclonic movement symmetrical with
reference to the plane of the equator. The air is drawn toward the
revolving sphere from all sides, as may be shown by bringing near to
it smoke or bits of paper. This air is expelled along the equatorial
circumference, as you will see by these paper wreaths, which maintain
themselves concentrically about the equator in a position that reminds
one of the rings of Saturn, the tension of the paper and its rapid vibra-
tion clearly showing that it is the repulsion of the equatorial current
that maintains them.
132 PHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF UPPER REGIONS OF ATMOSPHERE.

It might be supposed from this that equatorial repulsion only can be
produced by such a revolving sphere; but the complexity of cyclonic
movements baffles our most assured expectations. If we bring near
the sphere a light ball, it is strongly attracted and commences to turn
rapidly about the moving sphere in the equatorial plane. A second,
a third, launched in the same way, follow it with varying velocity and
represent satellites. The planetary similitude is then complete.

This paradox of a repulsion changed into attraction by changing the
form of the body presented is easily understood when we consider the
_resultant of the attractive and repulsive forces on the surface of the
movable body. Cyclonic attraction dominates throughovrt a greater
angular extent around the revolving sphere. This can be easily proved
by placing below the sphere a basin full of hot water. If the air of the
room is quite calm, we see the steam gradually unite into a whirling
column extending from the surface of the water to the revolving sphere.
This is an imitation of a waterspout. The importance of this phe-
nomenon has led M. Weyher to reproduce it in a more striking form,
using a much greater amount of mechanical energy, corresponding
more nearly to that which occurs in nature.

The gyratory movement, which in nature has its source in the upper
regions of the atmosphere, is set up by a fan placed three meters above
a vessel of water 4 meters in diameter (fig. 2, Pl. 1). When the fan is
made to revolve (400 to 500 revolutions per minute) the aerial cyclone
thus formed reaches gradually the surface of the water, which is seen
to be agitated, forming centripetal spirals that unite in a cone several
centimeters in height. Above this cone there forms a sheaf of droplets
that fall back with a whirling metion. This attraction at a distance is
rendered still more striking when the water is slightly heated. The
steam then forms a hollow tube, the empty part of which is distin-
guished by its dark tint and its geometrical regularity. It passes from
the surface of the water toward the fan, raising light objects like bits
of straw that float on the liquid. :

Such is the experiment that was made in the open air at the works
of the Société Weyher et Richmond in 1887. With the smaller appa-
ratus which you see here (fig. 3, Pl. I) we can repeat it under equally
conclusive conditions. The fan is placed at the upper part of this case,
which is 2 meters high and provided with a glass front. The water,
slightly heated and containing a little soap, is placed in a basin at the
bottom of the case. As soon as I set the fan going you observe the
agitation of the water, the soap bubbles rushing toward the foot of a
column of steam. Soon that column takes on the form described above
and simulates exactly the appearance of a natural waterspout. Below
we see the ‘‘ bush”’—that is to say, the sheaf-like arrangement of bub-
bles; above, the hollow funnel of steam. A light ball placed on the
surface of the water is first drawn toward the center of disturbance
and caught at its foot. By increasing the velocity of rotation (which

increases the power of the cyclone) the ball is raised by the waterspout,
sometimes following the funnel throughout its entire height.

The helicoidal movement of this light ball, as well as the appear-
ance of the nebulous funnel, show very well how the waterspout is
formed. We can see the whorls of helicoidal currents superposed on
each other, some going up, others going down. There is a perpetual
passing and repassing between the fan and the surface of the water.
As all the currents turn in the same direction, if those going up describe
right-hand helices, those going down describe left-hand helices. It
is the failure to recognize this double movement of ascent and descent
that has kept up the misunderstanding between the partisans of the
ascending spouts and those who claim that they are always descending.

The ascensional movement of the light ball drawn into the spout
shows the upward velocity very well. It is more difficult to demon-
strate the downward motion, which some theorists consider the only
one, because the space in which it acts when the experiment is shown on
this reduced scaie is quite contracted, being confined to the very interior
of the nebulous envelope, where a dark color shows a central cavity.
Still I shall be able to demonstrate this movement by means of a very
simple device. I place at the upper part of the spout a body that emits
smoke. We see that this smoke is soon drawn into the spout, is twisted
into a long, pointed cone, and descends toward the surface of the water.
This is exactly what is seen in nature when in a marine waterspout
the clouds descend in the form of a funnel that attaches itself to the
“bush” formed by the water on the surface of the turbulent ocean.
This funnel might be called the safe portion of the spout. The danger-
ous part is invisible, being the envelope of air that whirls about this
funnel. In the experiment you see before you the reverse is the case.
The cyclonic envelope is quite visible, thanks to the steam that has
been supplied. The internal funnel remains dark. By introducing the
smoke we verify its existence and form.

I could proceed to show you that with a similar apparatus it is
possible to reproduce a cyclone with all its peculiarities. The varia-
tions of pressure at the time of its passage—the low barometer, the
central calm, the sudden outburst of the wind, the eye of the storm,
etc.—all these M. Weyher has demonstrated. But time is wanting.
The experiments you have just seen will suffice, I hope, to show how
complete these experimental syntheses are and how they reproduce
natural phenomena even in the most minute details.

I will conclude by merely calling your attention to the great gain, —
both in extent and certitude, that must accrue to meteorology by its —
becoming an experimental science.

NEW RESEARCHES ON LIQUID ATR!

By Professor DEWAR, M. A., LL. D., F. Rk. 5., M. hk. I.

Of all the forms of engineering plant used in low-temperature
research, the best and most economical for the production of liquid air
or oxygen is one based on the general plan of the apparatus used by
Pictet in his celebrated experiments on the liquefaction of oxygen in
the year 1878. Instead of using Pictet’s combined circuits of liquid
sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide, maintained in continuous circula-
tion by means of compression, liquefaction, and subsequent evapora-
tion, it is preferable to select ethylene (after Cailletet and Wroblewski)
for one circuit, and for the other either nitrous oxide or, better, carbon
dioxide. Further, instead of making highly compressed oxygen to be
liquefied by heating potassium chlorate in an iron bomb directly con-
nected with the refrigerator, it is safer and more convenient to use gas
previously compressed in steel cylinders. The stopcock that Pictet
employed to draw off liquid and produce sudden expansion was in his
apparatus placed outside the refrigerator proper, but it is now placed
inside, so aS to be kept cool by the gases undergoing expansion. This
improvement was introduced along with that of isolating the liquid
gases by surrounding them with their own cooled vapor in the appa-
ratus made wholly of copper, described and figured in the Proceedings
of the Royal Institution for 1886. In all continuously working circuits
of liquid gases used in refrigerating apparatus, the regenerative princi-
ple applied to cold, first introduced by Siemens in 1857, and subse-
quently employed in the freezing machines of Kirk, Coleman, Solvay,
Linde, and others, has been adopted. Quite independently, Prof. Kam-
erlingh Onnes, of Leyden, has used the regenerative principle in the
construction of the cooling circuitsin his cryogenic laboratory.” Apart,
therefore, from important mechanical details and the conduct of the gen-
eral working, nothing new has been added by any investigator to the
principles involved in the construction and use of low-temperature appa-
ratus since the year 1878. Detailed drawings of the Royal Institution

refrigerating plant now in use have not been published, simply because
changes are constantly being made in the apparatus. Science derives
no benefit from the description of transitional apparatus when there is
no secret about the working process and how to carry it into effect.
The Philosophical Magazine of February, 1895, contains a fantastic
claim put forward by Professor Olszewski, of Cracow, that because he
used in 1890 a steel tube combined with a stopcock to draw off liquid
oxygen he had taught the world, to use his own language, ‘‘the
method of getting large quantities of liquid gases.” In addition the
professor alleges, four years after the event, that the experiments made
at the Royal Institution are chiefly borrowed from Cracow, and that he
is entitled to the credit of all low-temperature research. As to such
claims, one can only wonder at the meager additions to knowledge that
in our time are unhesitatingly brought forward as original, and more
especially that scientific men could be got to give them any currency
in this country. Such persons should read the late Professor Wro-
blewski’s pamphlet entitled ‘‘Comment lair a été liquéfié,”! and make
themselves generally acquainted with the work of this most remarkable
man before coming to hasty conclusions on claims of priority brought
forward by his sometime colleague.

Liquefying apparatus.—A laboratory apparatus for the production of
liquid oxygen and other gases is represented in section in Plate II. With
this simple machine 100 ce. of liquid oxygen can readily be obtained,
the cooling agent being carbon dioxide, at the temperature of —79°.
If liquid air has to be made by this apparatus, then the carbonic acid
must be kept under exhaustion of about 1 inch of mereury pressure, so
as to begin with a temperature of —115°. Under such conditions the
yield of the liquid gases is much greater. The gaseous oxygen, cooled
before expansion by passing through a spiral of copper tube immersed
in solid carbon dioxide, passes through a fine-screw stopcock under a
pressure of 100 atmospheres, and thence backward over the coils of
pipe. The liquid oxygen begins to drop in about a quarter of an hour
from starting. The general arrangement of the circuits will be easily
understood from the sectional drawing. The pressure in the oxygen
cylinders at starting is generally about 150 atmospheres, and the best
results are got by working down to about 100. If a small compressor
is combined with the apparatus, the liquefaction can go on contin-
uously. This little apparatus will enable liquid oxygen or air to be
used for demonstration and research in all laboratories.

Vacuum vessels.—It has been shown in previous papers” that a good
exhaustion reduces the influx of heat to one-fifth part of what is con-
veyed when the annular space in such double-walled vacuum vessels is
filled with air. If the interior walls are silvered, or excess of mereury

is left in the vessel, the influx of heat is diminished to one-sixth part of
the amount entering without the metallic coating. The total effect of
the high vacuum and silvering is to reduce the ingoing heat to one-
thirtieth part, or, roughly, 34 per cent. Vessels constructed with
three dry-air spaces only reduced the influx of heat to 35 per cent. An
ordinary mercury vacuum vessel is therefore ten times more economical
for storing liquid air, apart from considerations of manipulation, than
a triple annular-spaced air vessel. It has been suggested that the
metallic coating of mercury does no good, because Pictet has found
that all kinds of matter become transparent to heat at low tempera-
tures. The results above mentioned dispose of this assumption, and
direct experiment proves that no increase in the transparency of glass
to thermal radiation is effected by cooling it to the boiling point of air.'

An ocular demonstration of the correctness of the above statements
can easily be shown by mounting on the same stem three similar
double-walled test tubes, two of which have been simultaneously
exhausted and sealed off from the air pump together, while the third is
left full of air. One of the vacuum test tubes is coated with silver in the
interior. The apparatus is shown in fig. 1, Plate IiI. A has the annu-
lar space filled with air; B and C are exhausted, C being coated with
silver. On filling liquid ethylene to the same height into each vessel
and inserting corks with similar gas jets and igniting the escaping gas,
the relative volumes of the flames is roughly proportional to the influx
of heat, and resembles what is shown in the drawing. It is satisfac-
tory to have independent corroboration of the advantages of the use of
vacuum vessels, and this may be found in a paper by Prof. Kamerlingh
Onnes, of Leyden, communicated to the Amsterdam Academy of Sci-
ences, 1896, entitled ‘‘ Remarks on the liquefaction of hydrogen, on
thermodynamical similarity, and in the use of vacuum vessels,” in
which he says: “In the same degree as it becomes of more importance
to effectuate adiabatic processes at very low temperatures, the impor-
tance of the vacuum vessels of Dewar will increase. It seems to me
that they are the most important addition since 1885 to the appliances
for low-temperature research.” . . . “It is a rejoicing prospect that
practical engineers will doubtless feel the want of such nonconducting
manties. For as soon as this stage is reached numbers of heads and

1At a meeting of the French Academy in 1895 a paper by M. Solvay, of Brussels,
was read, in which my 1892 device of vacuum vessels was attributed to M. Cailletet,
and tacitly accepted by him. In 18751 had already used a highly exhaustive vessel,
of similar shape to the vacuum test tube, in calorimetric experiments. See paper
on “The physical constants of hydrogenium,” Trans. Koy. Soc. Ed., Vol. XXVII.
Even as late as April, 1896, Professor Tilden, D.Sc. F. R.S. of the Royal College of
Science, in a paper entitled ‘“ L’Appareil du Dr. Hampson pour la liquéfaction de
Vair et des gas,” communicated to the Revue Générale des Sciences, thought proper
to write as follows: ‘‘Un manchon de verre, dans lequel on a fait le vide (manchon
semblable a ceux décrits par Cailletet ou Dewar).” Where did Professor Tilden find
Cailletet’s description of a vacuum vessel? This is not the only statement in the
paper requiring correction.
138 NEW RESEARCHES ON LIQUID AIR.

hands are disposed to take over the problem from the scientific
researcher.”

Solid air.—As Professor Olszewski has recently alleged that air does
not solidify at the lowest pressures,’ the author’s former experiments
were repeated on a larger scale. If a liter of liquid air is placed in a
globular silvered vacuum vessel and subjected to exhaustion, as much
as half a liter of solid air can be obtained and maintained in this con-
dition for half an hour. At first the solid is a stiff, transparent jelly,
which, when examined in the magnetic field, has the liquid oxygen
drawn out of it to the poles. This proves that solid air is a nitrogen
jelly containing liquid oxygen. This statement was made in a paper
“On the refraction and dispersion of liquid oxygen, and the absorption
spectrum of liquid air” (Professors Liveing and Dewar), published in the
Philosophical Magazine for September, 1895, yet Professor Olszewski,
in 1896,” is declaring ‘that Professor Dewar has stated that liquid air
solidifies as such, the solid product containing a slightly smaller per-
centage of nitrogen than is present in the atmosphere. My experiments
have proved this statement to be incorrect.” The Cracow professor may
well have the satisfaction of correcting a statement which was never
made byme. He seems also to forget that in 1893 (Proceedings Royal
Institution, ‘‘ Lecture on liquid air”), it is distinctly stated that “all
attempts to solidify oxygen by its own evaporation have failed.” Solid
air can only be examined in a vacuum or in an atmosphere of hydrogen,
because it instantly melts on exposure to air cooled to the temperature of
its boiling point, giving rise to the liquefaction of an additional quantity
of air. It is strange to see a mass of solid air melting in contact with
the atmosphere, and all the time welling up like a kind of fountain. The
apparatus shown in fig. 2, Plate III, is well adapted for showing the direct
liquefaction of the air of a room and its solidification. A large vacuum
vessel, G, is mounted on a brass stand containing another smaller vessel,
B, of the same kind. By means of the two cocks, C and D, either the
large vessel G or the bulb B can be connected to the air-pump circuit.
Liquid oxygen is placed in A, which can, by opening the stopcock D, be
cooled to —210° by exhaustion. If the stopcock C is shut and a baro-
metric gauge is joined on at F, the dropping of the liquid air from the
outside of A will go on even at as low a pressure as 4 inches of mercury;
which is equivalent to saying that this apparatus would liquefy air if
taken by a balloon 10 miles high. If F is now opened, giving a supply
of air at atmospheric pressure, the cup B soon fills with liquid air.
Unless the air supply is passed over soda lime and strong sulphurie,
the liquid is always turbid from the presence of ice crystals and solid
carbonic acid. Now, on shutting F and opening C the air in B is placed
under exhaustion and soon solidifies to a jelly-like mass. When the
vacuum is about 14 mm. then the temperature of the solid air is —232°
by the platinum resistance thermometer, or —216° C. On allowing
the air to enter, the solid instantly melts and more liquid air is formed.

The same experiment may be repeated many times by simply opening
and shutting the stopeocks. When the liquid air loses too much
nitrogen, then it no longer solidifies. This apparatus may be used to
show that when liquid air is running freely into B liquefaction is
instantly arrested by allowing hydrogen to enter instead of air.

Samples of air liquefied in sealed flasks—In a paper ‘“‘On the
relative behavior of chemically prepared and of atmospheric nitro
gen,” communicated to the Chemical Society in December, 1894, the
plan of manipulating such samples was described. The arrangement
shown in Plate IV, illustrates how oxygen in A under 0.21 of an atmos-
phere pressure, and nitrogen in B under 0.79 of an atmosphere, can be
compared as to the first appearance of liquefaction in each, and finally
as to their respective tensions when the temperature is as low as that
‘of solid nitrogen. The flasks A and B have the capacity of more than
a liter. Each has a manometer sealed on, and in each phosphorie
anhydride is inserted to secure dryness. A large vacuum vessel, C,
holds the liquid air, which is gradually lowered in temperature by
boiling under exhaustion. The moment liquefaction takes place the
tubes D’/ D’”’ begin to show liquid. The tubes must be drawn fine at
the end when accurate observations are being made. In the same
manner two oxygen flasks were compared. One was filled with gas
made from fused chlorate of potash contained in a side tube sealed onto
the flask. The other was treated in the same way, only the chlorate
had a little peroxide of manganese added. The former gave perfectly
clear blue liquid oxygen; the latter was turbid from solid chlorine.
Two flasks of dry air that had stood over phosphoric anhydride were
liquefied side by side, the only difference between the samples being
that one was free from carbonic acid. The one gave a liquid that
was perfectly clear; the other was turbid from the 0.04 per cent of
carbon dioxide.

The temperature was lowered by exhaustion until samples of
liquid air from two flasks placed side by side as in Plate IV, became
solid. The flasks were then sealed off for the purpose of examining
the composition of the air that had not been condensed. The one
sample contained oxygen, 21.19 per cent, and the other 20.7 per cent.
This is an additional proof to the one previously given that, substan-
tially, the oxygen and nitrogen in air liquefy simultaneously, even
under gradually diminishing pressure, and that in these experiments
all the known constituents of air are condensed together. These
results finally disprove the view expressed in “‘A system of inorganic
chemistry,”! by Professor Ramsay, where he says: “ Air has been
liquefied by cooling to —192°, but as oxygen and nitrogen have not the
same boiling points, the less volatile oxygen doubtless liquefies first.”
My old experiments” showed that the substance now known as argon
became solid before nitrogen, but chemical nitrogen and air nitrogen,

140 NEW RESEARCHES ON LIQUID AIR.

with its 0.1 per cent of argon, bebaved in substantially the same way
on liquefaction.

Liquid nitric oxide.—Great interest attaches to the behavior of nitric
oxide at low temperatures. Professor Olszewski has examined the
liquid and describes it as colorless. Samples of nitric oxide have been
prepared in different ways. These have been transferred to liquefae
tion flasks, where they were left in contact with anhydrous potash, sul-
-phurie acid alone, a mixture of sulphate of aniline and sulphuric acid,
or phosphoric acid, for many days before use. Each of the samples,
when cooled, gave a nearly white solid, melting into a blue liquid. The
color is more marked at the melting point than at the boiling point.
Liquid nitric oxide is not magnetic; neither is the solid phosphorescent.
Color in the oxides of nitrogen evidently begins with the second oxide.,
Solid nitric oxide does not show any chemical action when placed in ~
contact with liquid oxygen, provided the tube containing it is completely
immersed; but if the tube full of liquid oxygen is lifted into the air,
almost instantly a violent explosion takes place.

Specific gravities taken in liquid oxygen.—In a good vacuum vessel
specific gravities may be taken in liquid oxygen with as great ease as
in water. The shape of the vacuum vessel which works best is shown
in fig. 1, Plate V. It must contain excess of mercury and be thoroughly
boiled out, so that the inner vessel becomes completely coated with a
mercury mirror as soon as the liquid oxygen is filled in. Instead of a
mereury vacuum, the interior may be silvered and highly exhausted bya
Sprengle pump. The flasks must also be thoroughly clean and free
from dust, otherwise the liquid oxygen will not remain tranquil. Any
superheating is prevented by inserting a long narrow piece of wood for
a moment before the final weighing.

Some twenty substances were weighed in liquid oxygen,' and the
apparent relative density of the oxygen determined. The results were
then corrected, using Fizeau’s values for the variation of the coefficient
of expansion of the solids employed, and thereby the real density of
liquid oxygen calculated. The resulting value was 1.1375, bar. 766.5,
in the case of such different substances as cadmium, silver, lead, cop-
per, silver iodide, cale-spar, rock crystal. The following table gives
