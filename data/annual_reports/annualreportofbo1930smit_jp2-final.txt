OF THE

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN
INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBor
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1930

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1930. The first 24 pages contain a summary
account of the affairs of the Institution. Appendixes 1 to 11 give
more detailed reports of the operations of the United States National
Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the
National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the Divi-
sion of Radiation and Organisms, the United States Regional Bureau
of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Smith-
sonian library, and of the publications issued under the direction of
the Institution; and Appendix 12 contains a list of subscribers since
November 15, 1929, to the James Smithson Memorial Edition of the
Smithsonian Scientific Series.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
OUTSTANDING EVENTS OF THE YEAR

Several events of unusual importance to the Institution have oc-
curred during the year just passed, and its scientific work has pro-
gressed in a satisfactory manner. To mention some of the high-lights
of the year’s advance, Congress authorized an appropriation for the
construction of the much-needed wings on the Natural History
Building of the National Museum at a cost not to exceed $6,500,000.
The work of the Astrophysical Observatory has shown an apparently
large and important influence of small short-period solar variations
on the temperature in the United States. The new Division of Radia-

I
Z ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

tion and Organisms has made rapid progress in the construction and
equipment of laboratories for physical, chemical, and biological
investigations, and has already obtained preliminary results in two
highly interesting researches. Dr. R. H. Goddard, whose experi-
ments in designing and building a rocket to explore the unknown
upper layers of the atmosphere the Institution has aided for 12
years, brought the work to the point of practical demonstration.
The late Simon Guggenheim, at Colonel Lindbergh’s suggestion, has
made a large grant to complete this development under most favor-
able auspices. Dr. C. U. Clark, under a grant from Ambassador
Charles G. Dawes, has made important discoveries of unpublished
early Spanish-American records in European archives. Four more
volumes of the Smithsonian Scientific Series were practically ready
to be issued at the close of the year, making eight volumes completed,
and the last four are well advanced in preparation. Substantial
sums have already been received by the institution as royalties on
the sale of this series. The fifth and sixth awards of the Langley
Gold Medal for Aerodromics were made to Charles Matthews Manly
and Commander (now Admiral) Richard Evelyn Byrd. Under the
auspices of the Institution and its branches many expeditions went
into the field to obtain necessary data and collections. Reference
to these will be found in the following reports. Many monographs
and smaller papers embodying the results of original researches have
been published and widely distributed throughout the world.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who, in 1826, bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “establishment ” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of
the executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three members of the Senate, and three Members of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

the House of Representatives, together with six other persons other
than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the
city of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some
State, but no two of them the same State.” One of the Regents is
elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has fallen
upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suitable person
is chosen by the Regents as Secretary of the Institution, who is also
secretary of the Board of Regents, and the executive officer directly
in charge of the Institution’s activities.

The only change occurring in the personnel of the board during
the year was the resignation of Chief Justice Taft and his succession
by Charles Evans Hughes, both as Chief Justice and as Chancellor
of the Board of Regents.

The roll of the Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as fol-
lows: Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States,
chancellor; Charles Curtis, Vice President of the United States; mem-
bers from the Senate, Reed Smoot, Joseph T. Robinson, Claude A.
Swanson; members from the House of Representatives, Albert John-
son, R. Walton Moore, Robert Luce; citizen members, Robert S.
Brookings, Missouri; Irwin B. Laughlin, Pennsylvania; Frederic
A. Delano, Washington, D. C.; Dwight W. Morrow, New Jersey;
and John C. Merriam, Washington, D. C.

FINANCES

The permanent investments of the Institution consist of the fol-
lowing:

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST

AWARD OF LANGLEY MEDAL TO CHARLES MATTHEWS MANLY AND TO
COMMANDER RICHARD EVELYN BYRD, UNITED STATES NAVY

The fifth and sixth awards of the Langley Gold Medal for Aero-
dromics to Charles Matthews Manly (posthumously) and to Com-
mander (now Admiral) Richard Evelyn Byrd, United States Navy,
were made at the Annual Meeting of the Board of Regents of the
Institution on December 12, 1929. The medal had been hitherto
awarded four times, to Wilbur and Orville Wright, to Glenn H.
Curtiss, to Gustave Eiffel, and to Charles A. Lindbergh. The award
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

to Mr. Manly was made in recognition of his pioneer contributions
to the development of the airplane engine, and that to Commander
Byrd for his pioneer flights over the North and South Poles, his non-
stop flight over the Atlantic Ocean, and the scientific discoveries
associated with these flights.

The posthumous award to Mr. Manly will be presented through
the person of his son. Commander Byrd was notified of the award
to him by radiogram to Little America, Antarctica. The actual
presentation of the two gold medals had not been made at the close
of the year.

ADDITIONS TO THE NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING OF THE NATIONAL
MUSEUM

An event of capital importance to the future of the Smithsonian
and the National Museum occurred on June 19, 1930, when Congress
passed the following bill:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled, That the Smithsonian Institution is hereby
authorized to extend the Natural History Building of the United States National
Museum by additions on the east and west ends thereof, in accordance with
plans to be approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, and to engage, if neces-
sary, architectural and inspection services, without regard to the restrictions
of existing law governing such services. There is hereby authorized to be
appropriated a sum not exceeding $6,500,000 for this purpose.

The present Natural History Building has for years been over-
crowded, both as to exhibition halls and to laboratories and storage
rooms. The additions authorized by Congress, which will approxi-
mately double the present floor space, will not only permit of a more
satisfactory arrangement of exhibits for the benefit of the more than
one million visitors every year, but also will provide additional facili-
ties for the growing research work of the Museum staff.

The bill quoted above is only an authorization and does not carry
an actual appropriation. Plans have not yet been prepared, but in
general the additions will conform in style and general arrangement
with the present structure.

RESEARCHES IN EUROPEAN ARCHIVES

Karly in 1929 Ambassador Charles G. Dawes provided the Institu-
tion with a fund for the purpose of conducting researches among
Kuropean archives in search of documents relating to the early
history and ethnology of middle America. In April, 1929, Dr. C. U.
Clark was appointed by the Smithsonian to conduct this mission, and
early in October Doctor Clark began his work in Europe, Since that
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

time he has studied diligently at several of the principal archives
containing early American material and has discovered a consider-
able number of valuable early manuscripts hitherto unpublished.
In addition to the titles listed below Doctor Clark has excerpted
many hundreds of pages of interesting ethnological material relating
to the Americas from manuscripts which were not of special interest
in their complete form, such as reports, letters, ete. The manuscripts
copied and prepared for publication are as follows:

Vatican Library.—Reginus Lat. 1608. Contains four leaves containing a
Nahuatl vocabulary and Nahuatl sentences for priests learning the language.
Twelve typewritten pages.

Vatican Library—Codex Barberini. Latinus 241. Written in Latin 1552 by
Indian trained by Franciscans. Illustrated by 185 aquarelles in color repre-
senting plants and flowers. Sixty-three folios 6 by 8%.

ROCKET EXPERIMENTS OF DR. R. H. GODDARD

For the past 12 years the Institution has supported by annual
grants the researches of Dr. R. H. Goddard, of Clark University, on
the development of a rocket to explore the upper atmosphere. In
1916 Doctor Goddard presented to the Institution such a convincing
mathematical demonstration of the theory that a self-propelling
rocket could be sent to the limit of the earth’s atmosphere, and even
beyond, that Doctor Walcott, then Secretary of the Smithsonian,
after consultation with a committee of experts, agreed to support the
investigation. The work progressed so favorably that the Institu-
tion has continued its support until the present time,
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

The highest level of the air which can now be studied is about
20 miles up, reached by sounding balloons, but these balloons often
drift as much as 150 miles from their starting point, and their
recovery is slow and uncertain. A rocket, on the other hand, would
go straight up to any desired height and provided with a parachute
would return in a short time at or very near its starting point. With
suitable automatic apparatus, such a rocket could bring back samples
of the upper air for chemical analysis, measure the temperature and
pressure of the higher atmosphere, expose spectographs above the
ozone layer where the ultra-violet spectrum of the sun could be
observed, and record the condition of the atmosphere from 5,000 feet
upward in the interests of aviation. In short, a whole new field of
investigation would be opened up—the unknown upper Nia of the

earth’s atmosphere.

This investigation was pioneering in character; little was avail-
able as a eats After much experimenting with a rocket equipped
with a ees for feeding small charges of high explosive, Doctor
Goddard turned finally to the scheme of a steady combustion of
hydrocarbon in liquid oxygen. After further modifying the design
of the rocket itself to adapt it to the use of this new means of
propulsion, Doctor Goddard was ready at the close of the fiscal
year for an actual field trial of the device.

It may be said that on July 17, 1929, a trial of the liquid-pro-
pelled rocket was made at Worcester, Mass., the device functioning
satisfactorily as regards the flow of liquid, the ascent of the rocket,
and its rapid motion in air. The trial rocket was guided only
by vanes on its rear end, and these proved inefficient, the rocket
describing a high arch and returning to the ground instead of
making a vertical flight. Doctor Goddard has already designed
automatic stabilizers, however, and these together with the neces-
sary automatic recording devices are seemingly all that is needed
to insure a successful, practical flight of the rocket to the higher
layers of the atmosphere and its return with the first records of an
unknown region.

The apparently assured success of Doctor Goddard’s experiments
has drawn support from a source better equipped financially to
provide it than the Smithsonian. The late Simon Guggenheim at
Colonel Lindbergh’s suggestion made a large grant of funds and
set up an advisory committee of which the secretary, Doctor Abbot,
isamember. Doctor Goddard’s experiments are now going on under
these auspices in New Mexico. It is a pleasure to record here that
the Smithsonian has again been able to support during its more or
less uncertain pioneering stages an investigation of great promise
for the increase of knowledge.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ll
LOW TEMPERATURE RESEARCHES

The Smithsonian has made two small grants during the year
to Prof. Dr. W. H. Keesom, director of the Cyrogenic Laboratory
at Leiden, in aid of his important researches on the properties
of matter at very low temperatures. Two investigations were in
progress by Doctor Keesom, with the aid of his collaborators, namely,
the measurement of the specific heat of gases at very low tempera-
tures, and the measurement of the thermomolecular pressure differ-
ences at very low temperatures.

In connection with the first, it seemed desirable to obtain measure-
ments on the specific heat of helium gas at the temperatures obtain-
able with liquid helium. Such a measurement had already been
made by Meissner in Berlin, who found the specific heat of helium
gas at a temperature of 5.5° K. (approximately —450° F.) and a
pressure of 0.75 atmosphere to be about 65 per cent of the normal
value, and ascribed this result to quantum effects. There is reason
to doubt, however, whether quantum effects can be demonstrated in
such a way because of the influence of intermolecular forces on
specific heat. To investigate this matter, Doctor Keesom and his
assistants elaborated a method of measuring the velocity of propaga-
tion of sound at these very low temperatures and at pressures smaller
than 1 atmosphere. From this velocity, the specific heat may be
derived.

Measurements of this velocity have already been made with great
accuracy at the temperatures of liquid oxygen and of liquid hydro-
gen, and preliminary measurements have been made of the velocity
of sound in helium gas at the temperature of liquid helium, but
further developments in the method must be made for this last
investigation.

Doctor Keesom’s second research relates to the investigation of
the thermomolecular pressure differences between the bulb of the
helium thermometer and the manometer used in the measurement of
the lowest temperatures obtainable. In his latest measurements the
temperature recorded was 0.89° K. (approximately, =458° F.). Ex-
act measurements of these pressure differences have now been made
at the temperatures of boiling oxygen and of boiling hydrogen;
measurements at the temperatures obtainable with liquid helium will
follow.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS

The report of the director on the first year’s work of this new
and important branch of the Smithsonian’s investigations in physical
science shows remarkably rapid progress. The construction of labo-
ratories and their equipment has been particularly difficult because
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

of the borderline character of the researches; it was necessary to
provide for physical, chemical, and biological fields of investigation.
In spite of the constant construction and equipment problems, actual
research work was started, and two experiments, the one on photo-
tropism, the other on infra-red absorption of pure chemicals, were
carried to interesting preliminary results.

Offices for the division were provided by remodelling the hitherto
unused flag tower of the Smithsonian Building, and space in the
basement previously used for storage was reconstructed into a mod-
ern physical, chemical, and biological laboratory. A small group of
highly trained specialists has been assembled to carry on the inves-
tigations, and these men work in close cooperation with the Smith-
sonian Astrophysical Observatory, the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory of
the Agricultural Department, the University of Maryland, and the
Research Corporation of New York.

The chief aim of the division is to build up a strong spectro-
photometric laboratory, whose staff of physicists and technicians
will work in cooperation with men of biological training. The re-
searches to be undertaken fall into two classes: (1) Direct investiga-
tion upon living organisms, and (2) fundamental molecular struc-
ture and photochemical investigations related to the biological
problems. In connection with the first, an experiment was made
to determine the amount of bending of plants towards light of var-
ious wave lengths. Briefly, the experiment showed that red or infra-
red light produced no effect; that yellow light produced a small but
measurable bending; that green hght was 1,000 times more effective
than yellow; and that blue hight was 30 times more effective than
green, or 30,000 times more effective than yellow. These results are
so interesting that preparations are under way for a more elaborate
experiment.

Under the second heading above, no work could be undertaken °
at the Smithsonian because of lack of funds and shop equipment.
Some progress was made, however, in the preparation of equipment,
and through the cooperation of the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory, Mr.
Liddell of its staff continued an investigation begun there by Doctor
Brackett before his appointment by the Smithsonian. This project,
which was completed as far as the equipment permitted, involved
the study of the near infra-red absorption spectra of the halogen
deviations of benzene.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Expeditions in the field are essential to the Smithsonian’s work
in anthropology, biology, geology, and astrophysics. Twenty-eight
major expeditions went out during the year to widely scattered
regions, bringing back necessary information and valuable speci-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

mens. The Institution bore the entire expense of a few of these
expeditions. For the cost of the others, in part at least, it is indebted
to friends of the Smithsonian or to other institutions equally
interested in the proposed work.

The regions visited by the year’s field expeditions included China,
Alaska, Canada, the West Indies, South America, Africa, Europe,
the Philippines, and Siam, as well as 13 localities in the United
States. I may mention especially Assistant Secretary Dr. A,
Wetmore’s bird collecting expedition in Spain, Dr. Paul Bartsch’s
explorations for mollusks in the West Indies under the Walter
Rathbone Bacon Travelling Scholarship; anthropological studies in
Alaska by Dr. AleS Hrdlitka and Mr. Henry B. Collins, jr.; an
extended botanical exploring trip in Amazonian Peru and Brazil,
by Mr. Ellsworth P. Killip; and three separate expeditions to the
island of Santo Domingo, namely, Mr. E. C. Leonard’s botanical
exploration of northwestern Haiti, Mr. Herbert W. Krieger’s archeo-
logical work in the Dominican Republic, and Mr. Arthur J. Poole’s
explorations in Haitian caves.

Brief accounts of all of these expeditions, fully illustrated,
appeared in “Explorations and Field-Work of the Smithsonian
Institution in 1929,” Smithsonian Publication No. 3060, and notices
of some of them will be found in the reports of certain of the bureaus
under the Institution’s direction, appended hereto.

COOPERATIVE ETHNOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

In 1928 Congress authorized the appropriation of $20,000 for
cooperative ethnological and archeological investigations in the
several States. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution was
designated to approve the investigations proposed, and if found
desirable, to allot from the money appropriated a sum equal to that
raised for the purpose by any State educational institution, or
scientific organization in the United States. He was named also
to direct the work and to divide the results thereof. Fifteen allot-
ments for approved investigations have been made during the year,
as follows:

The above list, with that given in my last annual report, will serve
to indicate the widespread interest aroused through this coopera-
tive project for the study and preservation of the Indian material

and data in the various States.
PUBLICATIONS

The publications of the Institution are issued in 11 distinct series,
which total approximately 10,000 pages a year. ‘The Institution
proper publishes three of the series, namely, Smithsonian Annual Re-
ports, Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, and Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections; the other series are issued by the bureaus
under Smithsonian direction. The Contributions to Knowledge, in
quarto, which for many years was the best known of all of the series,
has in recent years been suspended because the higher costs of print-
ing made it impracticable to issue monographs in the more expen-
sive quarto form. The Institution expects however to resume the
Contributions when more resources become available.

A total of 95 volumes and pamphlets appeared during the year,
and 168,163 copies of Smithsonian publications were distributed,
including 19,575 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections, 29,886 volumes and separates of the Smithso-
nian Annual Reports, 4,598 Smithsonian special publications, 87,323
publications of the National Museum and 24,868 publications of the
Bureau of American Ethnology. ‘Titles and authors and other in-
formation regarding the year’s publications are given in the report
of the editor, appendix 11,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

The Annual Report of the Board of Regents to Congress con-
tained the usual General Appendix made up of articles in semipopular
style to present the progress in nearly all branches of science during
the year. These reports continue in wide demand, and many letters
are received expressing appreciation of the Institution’s efforts to
give the nontechnical reader an authentic survey of the yearly
advance along the scientific front.

SMITHSONIAN SCIENTIFIC SERIES

As stated in my last report, the Institution decided in 1928 to
issue a popular, profusely illustrated series of 12 volumes relating
to the several branches of science coming within the scope of its
activities, with the expectation that through the sale of this series,
increased resources might become available for the furtherance of
its scientific work. The sale of the books, known as the Smith-
sonian Scientific Series, is entirely in the hands of the New York
publishers, the Smithsonian’s part being only that of author.

Volumes one to four appeared in 1929, as follows:

1. The Smithsonian Institution, by Webster Prentiss True.

2. The Sun and the Welfare of Man, by Charles Greeley Abbot.

3. Minerals from Earth and Sky. Part I, The Story of Meteorites, by George
P. Merrill; Part Il, Gems and Gem Minerals, by William F. Foshag.

4. The North American Indians. An account of the American Indians north of
Mexico, compiled from the original sources, by Rose A. Palmer.

Volumes five to eight were still in press at the close of the fiscal
year, but were expected to be received from the printer very soon
thereafter. They are as follows:

5. Insects: Their Ways and Means of Living, by R. E. Snodgrass.

6. Wild Animals in and out of the Zoo, by William M. Mann.

7. Man from the Farthest Past, by C. W. Bishop, C. G. Abbot, and A. Hrdlitka.

8. Cold-Blooded Vertebrates, by C. W. Gilmore, D. M. Cochran, and S. F.
Hildebrand.

The remaining four volumes are in press or in an advanced state
of preparation, and will be issued during the coming year.

LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library is composed of 10 divisional and 36 sec-
tional libraries. The divisional libraries include the Smithsonian
deposit in the Library of Congress, which is the Institution’s main
library, the office library, the Langley Aeronautical Library, and the
seven libraries of the bureaus under administrative direction of the
Institution, the largest of which is the National Museum library.
This last includes the 36 sectional libraries, which are the working
units kept in the various divisions of the Museum. The whole library
numbers over 800,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts. The year’s
accessions totaled 14,277 items, of which 7,979 were volumes and 6,298
were pamphlets and charts.
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

An important change during the year was the removal of the
Langley Aeronautical Library from the Smithsonian Building to the
Library of Congress, where although still remaining a unit of the
Smithsonian library, it will be more centrally available to the stu-
dent. Many gifts were received during the year, among which may
be mentioned a collection of 1,400 volumes on various subjects from
Mr. James Townsend Russell, jr.; 150 volumes and 1,000 periodicals
chiefly on aeronautics from the National Aeronautic Association;
and 58 volumes on Japanese history and literature from the Histori-
ographical Institute, Tokyo.

Further progress was made on the union catalogue, but this large
task will require many years for completion unless additional assist-
ants are provided. The congested condition of the Museum library
was relieved for the time being by the installation of 400 feet of new
shelving.

The librarian notes that although two additional assistants are
provided for in the coming year, six more are needed to enable the
library to render the desired service to the work of the Institution.

GOVERNMENTALLY SUPPORTED BRANCHES

NATIONAL MUSHUM

The event of the year for the Museum was the passage of the
Smoot-Elliott bill authorizing an appropriation for the extension
of the Natural History Building by the construction of wings at
the east and west ends at a cost of $6,500,000. These additions,
which will follow the style and general arrangement of the present
building, will relieve the greatly overcrowded condition of the offices
and exhibition halls, and also will permit of normal expansion of
the national collections which are the foundation for researches in
pure science and consequently for their application to the welfare of
mankind.

The appropriations for the maintenance of the Museum for the
year totaled $762,514, an increase of $14,490, of which $9,500 pro-
vided for salaries of five additional positions, namely an assistant
curator of mollusks, an additional clerk in the administrative office,
and three sergeants of the watch. These additions to the personnel
were of great benefit to the Museum’s work, but several offices are
still undermanned, both as to scientific and clerical workers.

Additions to the collections during the year totaled 410,815 speci-
mens, the majority coming to the department of biology. Material
sent in for expert examination and report numbered 1,306 lots, and
gifts of duplicate material to schools totaled 11,474 specimens. Ex-
changes to the number of 12,649 specimens were sent out, and 33,208
were loaned to scientific workers outside of Washington.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17

Large collections of material representing the Indian and Eskimo
tribes of Alaska came to the department of anthropology through
the field work there by Dr. AleS Hrdlitka and Mr. Henry B. Col-
lins, jr. ‘There may also be mentioned an ethnological collection
from Nigeria and the gold and ivory coasts of Africa, from Mr.
C. C. Roberts; prayer stones and other objects of a religious nature
from Tibet, presented by Mr. Charles 8. Isham; and ethnological
material from the Dominican Republic collected by Mr. H. W.
Krieger.

Among the great amount of material received by the department
of biology there stand out extensive collections given by the Na-
tional Geographic Society, including birds and plants brought from
western China by Dr. Joseph F. Rock and insects and plants from
northern Brazil collected by Mr. E. G. Holt; further general natural
history collections made in China by the Rev. D. C. Graham; bi-
ological material from Siam from Dr. Hugh M. Smith; and a very
complete series of birds’ eggs from Mr. A. C. Bent.

The most important single object received by the department of
geology was the great flawless crystal ball 127 inches in diameter
presented by Mrs. Worcester Reed Warner as a memorial to her
husband. Through the income of the Roebling fund and of the
Frances Lea Chamberlain fund, a considerable number of fine min-
eral specimens and gem stones were added to the collections.
Through the field work of Resser, Gilmore, Gidley, and others of
the Museum staff, large and valuable collections of fossils have been
added.

Many interesting accessions came to the arts and industries de-
partment, prominent among them being the gift by Mr. Rudolph
Kickemeyer of a large series of examples of his own work in pic-
torial photography, together with a library of works on photography.
Mr. EKickemeyer has provided in his will a fund for the care of the
collection. The division of history received among other historical
material five pieces of china used in the White House by President
James Madison, presented by Miss Mary M. McGuire, and a gown
worn by Mrs. Calvin Coolidge presented for the costume collection
by Mrs. Coolidge.

A large number of field expeditions went out under the direction
of members of the Museum staff, financed chiefly by the private
income of the Smithsonian Institution or through the aid of inter-
ested friends and patrons. These expeditions are described briefly
in the report of the National Museum, Appendix 1.

The lecture rooms and auditorium of the Museum were used by
Government and other agencies for hearings, meetings, and lectures
to the number of 135. Visitors to the Museum totalled 1,894,989 for
the year. Sixteen volumes and 35 pamphlets were published, and
87,323 copies of Museum publications were distributed.
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930
NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

The leading event of the year was the exhibition in the gallery of
the 78 American paintings purchased during the last 10 years from
the Ranger fund, which are subject to consideration as additions to
the gallery’s permanent collections as provided in the Ranger be-
quest. The paintings were lent for the exhibition by the institu-
tions to which they were assigned by the National Academy of De-
sign. The exhibition was opened on December 10, 1929, with a
reception by the Secretary and Regents of the Institution, the Director
of the National Gallery, and the members of the National Gallery
of Art Commission; the National Academy of Design was repre-
sented by six of its officials.

Besides the exhibition of Ranger paintings, four special exhibits
were held during the year, namely, sculpture of Edgardo Simone,
portraits by Edwin B. Child, paintings, sculptures, ete., by contem-
porary Hungarian artists, and paintings by American Negro artists.

FREER GALLERY OF ART*

Additions to the collections by purchase during the year include
examples of early Egyptian bookbinding; Chinese bronzes; Chinese
jade objects; Persian and Egyptian manuscripts; Persian, Indian,
Chinese, and Egyptian paintings; Chinese porcelain bowls; Chinese
pottery; South Indian bronze sculpture; Chinese silver objects; and
Chinese silver-gilt objects.

Curatorial work included the documentary study of inscriptions
on new purchases as well as those on objects already in the collection.
Expert opinion was given to other institutions and individuals re-
garding 834 objects and 185 photographs of objects sent in for
examination. With the expert aid of Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy,
a large group of paintings in the Near Eastern section, purchased in
1907 from Col. H. B. Hanna, has undergone complete revision and
reclassification.

The year’s total attendance was 120,651; of these 1,349 visited the
offices for general information or for study purposes. Sixteen
groups were given docent service in the exhibition galleries, and 10
classes were given instruction in the study room. ‘Two lectures were
given in the auditorium: “ The Caves of the Thousand Buddhas,” by
Sir Aurel Stein; and “ Indian Sculpture: Intention and Develop-
ment,” by Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy.

The field expedition was able, in spite of disturbed conditions, to
make interesting investigations at the site of the Liang dynasty
(A. D. 502-556) tombs, near Nanking, China.

4The Government’s expense in connection with the Freer Gallery of Art consists
mainly in the eare of the building and certain other custodial matters. Other expenses
are paid from the Freer endowment funds.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

The work of the bureau covered the usual wide range of ethnologi-
cal and archeological investigations on many Indian tribes and sites
of the United States. The chief, Mr. M. W. Stirling, made an
archeological reconnaissance of the Ten Thousand Islands, Fla., and
excavated mounds at Lacooche and at Safety Harbor, Fla. He de-
livered lectures before numerous scientific and educational bodies.
Dr. John R. Swanton continued his field work on the Choctaw of
Mississippi and the Creeks of Oklahoma, and began the work of
translating the words of his Timucua dictionary. Dr. Truman
Michelson studied the Algonquian tribes of Oklahoma, and Mr. John
P. Harrington obtained much of the language and ethnology of the
San Juan Tribe of California through an aged informant.

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., conducted extensive archeological ex-
cavations at the Long H Ranch, in eastern Arizona, revealing 18
pit houses, 3 jacal, pole, and mud structures, and a pueblo ruin con-
taining 49 rooms and 4 kivas. Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt continued his
studies of the Iroquois Indians of Canada and New York State, and
Dr. Francis LaF lesche nearly completed his Osage dictionary before
his retirement on December 26, 1929. Miss Frances Densmore
studied the music of 10 tribes—the Acoma, Menominee, Winnebago,
Yuma, Cocopa, Mohave, Yagui, Makah, Clayoquot, and Quilente.

Five bulletins and a list of publications of the bureau were issued
during the year, and a total of 24,868 copies of bureau publications
were distributed.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

The Exchange Service handled during the year a total of 694,665
packages of governmental, scientific, and literary publications, which
represented a total weight of 708,094 pounds. This constitutes an
increase of 12 per cent in number of packages, and 14 per cent in
weight over the previous year.

The material handled by the Exchange Service includes publica-
tions received from this country for transmission to foreign coun-
tries, and also those sent from abroad for distribution to addresses
in this country. They are classified as parliamentary documents,
departmental documents, and miscellaneous scientific and literary
publications. The parliamentary and departmental documents in-
clude all matter published by Congress and by the Government de-
partments, bureaus, and commissions. ‘These constitute the bulk
of the publications handled by the Exchange Service, 74 per cent
of the work of the office being conducted in behalf of the United
States governmental establishments. The miscellaneous scientific
and literary publications are received for distribution chiefly from
learned societies, educational institutions, scientific organizations,
and museums.
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Animals added to the collection during the year numbered 759,
while 974 were removed through death, exchange, and return of ani-
mals, the collection standing at 1,996 at the close of the year. Owing
to lack of further housing facilities, it has been necessary to choose
very carefully in making additions to the collection, with the result
that the park now contains a great many rarities, including a number
of species not shown in any other American zoo.

The total attendance at the park was estimated at 2,525,141, about
the same as in the preceding year. This total included 28,814 stu-
dents from 465 different schools. The value of the park as an educa-
tional institution, quite apart from its recreational value, is coming
to be more and more recognized. Here may be seen visitors of all
ages and all degrees of learning, from the young child to the veteran
research worker and the advanced medical man, each of whom can
learn something of value concerning animals and animal life.

Construction of the new reptile house authorized by Congress
was started in March, 1930. The best modern ideas as to the exhibi-
tion of reptiles will be incorporated in the building, which will per-
mit the National Zoo to show for the first time an adequate
representation of these interesting creatures. The next most ur-
gently needed building is one for small mammals, with which also
would be exhibited the great apes; these latter are at present shown
in inadequate cages where comparatively few people can see them
at a time.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

The central station at Washington and the three observing sta-
tions on Mount Montezuma, Chile; Table Mountain, Calif.; and
Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa, have continued the exact
measurement of the intensity of the radiation of the sun as it is at
mean solar distance outside the earth’s atmosphere. The values from
Mount Montezuma have continued to be satisfactory and are cabled
to Washington each day; the values from Table Mountain are found
to be influenced by the haziness or humidity of the atmosphere,
and a new method of reduction to allow for these effects was being
developed at the close of the year, preliminary trials of which give
promising results. Reduction of Mount Brukkaros observations is
being postponed until this method is further tested for Table
Mountain.

It has recently been discovered that a variation of large percentage
exists in the quantity of ozone at high levels above Table Mountain.
In order to make ozone corrections to solar constant values obtained
there from the year 1925 on, it became necessary to devise a method
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

of computing the correction from the daily solar constant observa-
tions themselves, and this was successfully accomplished during the
year.

The most important feature of the year’s work was the discovery of
an apparently considerable influence of short-period solar variation
on the temperature of the United States. The variations as recorded
through six consecutive years at Mount Montezuma were compared
with temperature changes in Washington, Williston, and Yuma,
selecting for the purpose sequences of ascending and descending solar
radiation values occupying about four days per sequence. Cor-
responding to the average change of 0.8 per cent in the sun, there
appear to be temperature changes of the order of 5° F. in Washing-
ton. The sign of the correlation changes in a very interesting way
during the year. Although this relation is complicated, it offers
promise for weather forecasting nearly a week in advance. These
are tentative results. It is proposed to study barometric pressures as
well as temperatures, and to extend the investigation to other parts
of the United States and of the world.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Since the suspension of publication of the International Catalogue
because of the inability of European countries to bear their share
of its financial support following the World War, the United States
bureau has made it a policy to spend only as much of the annual
congressional appropriation as is needed to keep the organization
alive pending the resumption of publication.

The report of the assistant in charge, Appendix 9, quotes from
an article in Science by Dr. E. C. Richardson, who presents a strong
case for the importance of revivifying the International Catalogue.
His conclusions, in brief, are that the catalogue is an indispensable
tool for research workers; that an organization which, if scrapped,
would require a $3,000,000 endowment to build up again, is ready
and waiting to resume the work of the catalogue when a very modest
fund is made available to it; and that in the catalogue the research
trust endowments wil] find an organization that can give the greatest
bibliographical service to research for the least outlay of funds.

NECROLOGY

WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT

William Howard Taft, Chief Justice of the United States and
Chancellor of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,
died in Washington on March 8, 1930. Of a man so prominently
before the American public for so many years, it seems unnecessary
here to present more than a very brief outline of his career.

* 28095—31——3
ya ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Born in Cincinnati in 1857, Taft graduated from Yale University
in 1878. He took the law course, and after a short period as law
reporter for a newspaper, his public career began. In turn assistant
prosecuting attorney, collector of internal revenue of the first dis-
trict of Ohio, and assistant county solicitor of Hamilton County,
he was next appointed judge of the Supreme Court of Cincinnati,
and in 1890, Solicitor General of the United States. For eight
years beginning 1892 he was United States circuit judge for the
sixth judicial district, and in 1901, President McKinley appointed
him civil governor of the Philippine Islands. In 1908 came his
election as President of the United States, and after the completion
of his term, there followed a few years of private life. In 1921 he
was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, from which
position he had been forced by ill health to resign only a short time
before his death.

Through his many high offices, Mr. Taft had been connected with
the Institution for many years, serving as a member of the Insti-
tution and its presiding officer, ex officio, and as Chancellor of its
Board of Regents.

GEORGE PERKINS MERRILL

George Perkins Merrill, head curator of geology, died suddenly
in Auburn, Me., on August 15, 1929. Doctor Merrill was born in
Auburn on May 31, 1854, and was graduated from the University of
Maine with the degree of B. S. in 1879. He pursued advanced
studies at Wesleyan and Johns Hopkins Universities which later
resulted in the degrees of M. S. and Ph. D. from his alma mater.
In 1893 he became professor of geology at Columbian, later George
Washington University, continuing his lectures until 1916, and was
given the honorary degree of Sc. D. in 1917.

Doctor Merrill’s connection with the National Museum began with
the organization of 1880. He served in various capacities in the
geological division until 1897, when, under a reorganization, he was
appointed head curator of the department of geology, which position
he held until his death. The growth of the department from a com-
paratively few specimens, resulting chiefly from the United States
Land Office and other early Government surveys, to its present
position among the notable geological collections of the world, is
largely due to Doctor Merrill’s ability as an executive and his devo-
tion and loyalty to the Institution. He was preeminently a museum
man and an artist in methods of display, as can be attested by the
harmonious arrangement of the exhibition halls under his charge.

Doctor Merrill early became interested in building stones and was
regarded as the leading expert on this subject, his opinion being
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23

sought in connection with such important structures as the Lincoln
Memorial, the Washington Cathedral, and many other public build-
ings. His treatise on “Stones for Building and Decoration ” ran
to three editions.

Again, his researches on rock weathering and soil formation led
an eminent authority to say: “ The greatest work on the genesis of
soils we owe to Merrill.” A publication on “ Non-Metallic Min-
erals—Their Occurrence and Uses ” further illustrates his versatility
in geological research.

Later, the collection of meteorites in the Museum became the object
of special interest, his researches on these celestial bodies, resulting
in no less than 60 papers, receiving recognition by the presentation
of the J. Lawrence Smith medal! of the National Academy of Sciences.
“The Story of Meteorites,” written in popular style, appeared as
part 1 of volume 3 of the Smithsonian Scientific Series—* Minerals
from Earth and Sky.”

Among the most interesting and valuable of his many contribu-
tions is his historical work on geological subjects. His “ contribu-
tions to a History of American Geology,” published in 1904 as part
of the report of the Smithsonian Institution, was, in 1924, expanded
into “ The First One Hundred Years of American Geology.” He also
compiled a “ History of American State Geological and Natural
History Surveys,” issued as Bulletin 109 of the National Museum.

A paper for the Museum’s archives, practically completed just
before Doctor Merrill left on his vacation from which he never re-
turned, is “An Historical Account of the Department of Geology in
the U. S. National Museum ”—most timely in its preparation since
no other could have been so well qualified to prepare such a record.

ARTHUR BENONI BAKER

Arthur Benoni Baker, assistant director of the National Zoological
Park, died in Washington February 8, 1930. Mr. Baker was born
at Otisco, New York, in 1858, and as a young man worked in Ward’s
natural science establishment. At that time Ward’s, though a com-
mercial institution, served as a training school for numerous young
men who afterwards attained distinction in scientific work. With Mr.
Baker were such men as Carl Akeley and William Morton Wheeler.
Later Mr. Baker spent eight years fossil hunting in Kansas, and
then in November, 1890, accepted a position in the National Zoologi-
cal Park, where he served continuously until his death, except for a
period of six months when he was on furlough and in charge of the
Boston Zoological Garden.

In 1909 he made a trip to Nairobi, East Africa, and brought home
a collection of animals that had been presented to the Zoo by Sir
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Donald MacMillan through Theodore Roosevelt. On the trip out
he made a hurried inspection of many zoological gardens in Europe
and much of the information he gained there was used in the develop-
ment of the National Zoological Park. Another expedition was to
Porto Rico, where in company with other Smithsonian scientists he
made valuable natural history collections.

It is largely due to the knowledge and devotion of Mr. Baker that
the Zoological Park has attained its present position. His knowl-
edge of zoos in general was profound; of the National Zoological
Park, complete. He retained in his remarkable memory an almost
unbelievable mass of detail.

Respectfully submitted.

C. G. Asgor, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1930:

The total appropriations for the maintenance of the National Mu-
seum for this period amounted to $762,514, an increase of $14,490 over
the appropriations for the year 1929. Of this amount $9,500 pro-
vided salaries for five additional positions on the staff, namely, an
assistant curator of mollusks, an additional clerk in the administra-
tive office, and three sergeants of the watch. This assistance in per-
sonnel has very definite value in the administration of the various
units concerned and brings added efficiency to the organization as
a whole.

A small sum of the increase indicated provided efficiency promo-
tions for a number of trained mechanics who had not been cared
for properly when other classes of employees had been promoted
previously. There was a further increase to provide for the con-
struction of a gallery to give additional space for study collections
in the vertebrate paleontological laboratory, where crowding had
become serious. The construction for this is of the same general
type as that used for a similar gallery in the National Herbarium.

The second deficiency bill for 1930 contained an item of $3,500
under repairs and alterations of buildings, available in the fiscal
years 1930 and 1931, for the remodelling of a comfort room in the
Arts and Industries Building. As this bill became law on July
3, 1930, after the close of the fiscal year here under report, these
funds accordingly will be used in the fiscal year 1931, and a state-
ment on them will be made in the report for that year.

Growth in personnel in the National Museum has progressed
reasonably, but further additions are required in a number of the
administrative units before the staff can be considered properly de-
veloped to enable it to function as it should. There are several
major groups of animals where systematic workers of high type are
needed as curators to carry on necessary research that the Museum
may be able to assist the public who desire information concerning
the creatures in question. Additional assistance in the scientific
grades is also required in some of the major groups where the volume

26
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

of work is beyond the capacity of the present staff to handle en-
tirely adequately. Clerical assistance also is at a minimum, and
there remain a considerable number of offices in which stenographic
and clerical help is not at present available. Naturally this detracts
from the efficiency of these offices since scientific workers who should
be occupied otherwise are through necessity compelled to devote con-
siderable time to routine work of a clerical nature. It is impera-
tive that regular additions be made to our personnel to assist in these
necessary functions. J*urther assistance is required in the shops, on
the guard force, and in the labor force since it is at present neces-
sary annually to obtain temporary workers in the groups concerned.
The employment of temporary services, particularly where specialized
work is concerned, is of doubtful expediency since necessarily part
of the time is occupied in training, and there is more liability to
error than with workers on a permanent basis.

Exploration and field work under the National Museum are
financed largely by the Smithsonian Institution through its private
income, and by friends who supply funds for various projects of
particular interest. Existing appropriations for the National Mu-
seum are so largely taken up with routine expenditures that there
is little available that may be used for research in the field. Further
money should come from our appropriations for these ends.

Interest of the general public in scientific matters, particularly
of the type that comes within the scope of the National Museum, is
plainly evident through the demand that comes for popular exposi-
tion in scientific subjects. So far as the National Museum is con-
cerned this interest is shown by the nearly 2,000,000 visitors who come
annually to its halls. These persons, together with the many others
who have an interest in such things, are among those who contribute
to national income in the form of taxes. With their interest in these
matters In mind it seems entirely logical that a part of their con-
tributions should be devoted to furthering the development of the
Museum which serves them in such various ways.

ADDITIONS TO THE NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING

The Congress gave definite consideration during the year to the
question of additional housing for the collections of the National
Museum, with the result that the Smoot-Elliott bill authorizing the
extension of the Natural History Building through wings at the
east and west ends at a cost of $6,500,000 was passed without a dis-
senting vote. The bill was approved by the President on June 19,
1930.

Under this authorization it is planned to add to the present build-
ing so that it will extend from Ninth to Twelfth Streets on the same
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY FF

width of base. In general it is contemplated that the style of the
present structure will be duplicated, with the ground and third floor
occupied by offices and laboratories, and the two intermediate floors
devoted to exhibits. Present plans contemplate a request for funds
for the preparation of definite architect’s designs in the urgent defi-
ciency bill for 1931. The friendly consideration given to the import-
ant matter of the authorization for this work by the congressional
committees involved has been deeply appreciated by the Institution.

The construction planned will provide adequately for housing
needs for the natural history collections. Following this, careful
consideration should be given to proper space for the arts and indus-
tries series. The present building occupied by these collections, the
old National Museum built in 1881, is now antiquated in design and
unfitted for modern needs in museum exhibition. It should be re-
placed by a new structure that will provide ample halls for the show-
ing of the important and valuable exhibits of the type mentioned.

The historical collections of the Nation, of interest and attraction
to every patriotic American, at present are also in the old building.
These collections, which are steadily growing with the accession of
irreplaceable specimens, should be housed in a separate structure
where such objects as the Star-Spangled Banner and the memorabilia
of many famous men may be fittingly and attractively displayed.

COLLECTIONS

Additions to the collections of the National Museum during the
fiscal year have reached the total of 410,815 separate specimens,
the greater part of these coming as in previous years to the depart-
ment of biology. The additions, while not quite equal to those of last
year, are of comparable value and importance to those of the last
few years. Large donations have come from a number of sources,
the museum as a governmental institution being recognized as a
permanent organization in which valuable material will receive the
care and attention that insure long preservation. The growing
recognition of the National Museum as a repository of this kind is
highly gratifying. Materials of various kinds sent in for examina-
tion and report during the year amounted to 1,306 lots, including
many thousands of separate specimens. Gifts of duplicate materials
made to schools and other educational institutions included 11,474
specimens, while in exchange with other scientific organizations and
individuals there were sent out 12,649 specimens, these being dupli-
cates for which return was made to the Museum collections. Loans
to scientific workers outside of Washington included 33,208 speci-
mens, many of which were of considerable value.

Following is a digest of the more important accessions for the
year in the various departments and divisions of the Museum:
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Anthropology.—Collections from Alaska again are of major im-
portance among the accessions in this department. Among these
there are two principal lots of material that have come in part
through the assistance of the Smithsonian Institution. Doctor
Hrdlicka in travel down the Yukon River obtained rich collections
representing Indian and Eskimoan tribes, and in addition obtained
valuable sets of ivory implements from the Bering Sea area. Henry
B. Collins, jr., in further field work on St. Lawrence Island and sites
on the coast of Bering Sea and Kotzebue Sound secured a collection
containing many ivory and other implements that are of great
value in supplementing his collections of last year. Further there
was obtained by purchase a series of specimens from Point Hope
representing various phases of Eiskimoan culture. The entire lot
represents a selection of western Eskimoan artifacts from the earliest
times, still further increasing the value of our excellent series of this
kind.

A further collection from Nigeria and the Gold and Ivory coasts
of Africa presented by C. C. Roberts has supplemented previous gifts
of a similar nature from the same source, until now we have for the
first time adequate representation of the Haussa, Fulah, and Yoruba
tribes.

The Department of Agriculture, through Dr. E. W. Brandes of
the Bureau of Plant Industry, transferred excellent collections of
stone axes, decorated human heads, and other objects from New
Guinea.

Collections from Tibet were presented by Charles §. Isham, of
New York, including prayer stones and other objects of a religious
nature, as well as materials of personal adornment. Further collec-
tions have come from China through the efforts of the Rev. D. C.
Graham, of Szechwan.

In American archeology there came three decorated limestone
blocks from the Maya Temple of Chac Mool, deposited by the
Republic of Mexico through its Secretaria de Educacion. Valuable
specimens were obtained from the excavations in Colorado of Dr.
Frank H. H. Roberts, jr., of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
and from field work by H. W. Krieger, of the National Museum,
in the Dominican Republic, funds for this project having been fur-
nished by Dr. W. L. Abbott.

Through the Bruce Hughes fund there were acquired artifacts
of Sumerian and Babylonian origin for exhibition with other
materials from the Old World.

Liology.—In the department of biology there were secured exten-
sive collections as a gift of the National Geographic Society, includ-
ing particularly birds and plants collected by Dr. Joseph F. Rock
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

in western China, and birds, insects, and plants obtained by E. G.
Holt in northern Brazil. Other excellent collections came from the
Hon. Gifford Pinchot as the result of a cruise to the Caribbean and
Pacific Islands on the yacht Mary Pinchot. A notable collection
obtained through the cooperation of the Navy Department was
secured by Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, on the Island of
Panay, in the Philippines, during service as medical officer to the
Naval Solar Eclipse Expedition.

Doctor Bartsch, traveling under the Walter Rathbone Bacon
Travelling Scholarship, obtained large series of mollusks in the West
Indies, which add remarkably to our collections from that region.
Dr. G. A. MacCallum, of Baltimore, presented his entire collection of
helminthological material, including many type specimens.

Collections forwarded by the Rev. D. C. Graham from western
China include many things of great value, particularly among mam-
mals, birds, fishes, reptiles, and insects. There may be mentioned
especially three skins of the giant Panda.

Further excellent collections from Siam were received from Dr.
Hugh M. Smith, long an honorary associate of the Institution.

A. C. Bent, a collaborator of the Smithsonian Institution, depos-
ited in the division of birds his collection of North American birds’
eggs, a most excellent and complete series. From the Minneapolis
Public Library there were obtained more than 1,500 bird skins from
the Philippines comprising the Menage collection. The Smith-
sonian-Parish expedition to Haiti obtained excellent series of birds,
reptiles, and other materials. Under the Swales fund, through
money left by the late Bradshaw H. Swales, there were secured 34
skins of birds new to the Museum.

The Victorias Milling Co. of Manila presented a considerable
number of insects collected by Dr. W. Dwight Pierce. For the
division of mollusks there were purchased series of land shells from
Jamaica and Haiti through the Chamberlain fund. Through a
botanical expedition to Peru and Upper Brazil under E. P. Killip
there were acquired more than 27,000 specimens of plants.

Geology.—In the department of geology the single accession of
greatest importance during the year was the crystal ball presented
to the National Museum by Mrs. Worcester Reed Warner as a
memorial to her husband, long a friend to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. This ball of flawless crystal 127 inches in diameter, weighing
10634 pounds, is believed to be the largest perfect sphere of its kind
in existence. It is one of the most striking objects found in the
Museum halls.

Through the income of the Roebling fund there have been secured
23 species of minerals not previously represented in our collections,
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

together with a considerable number of exceptionally fine specimens
of other kinds. Among them there may be mentioned a topaz crystal
weighing over 7 pounds, sets of tourmaline crystals, and a cut yellow
sapphire of 25.8 carats.

Through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund there were secured
blue and yellow diamonds, a Brazilian emerald, and carvings of
jade, tourmaline, coral, amber, carnelian and lapis-lazuli.

Valuable specimens of ores and stones have come from several
sources. Numerous type specimens have been accessioned in the
division of stratigraphic paleontology, particularly fossil plants
described by Prof. E. W. Berry. Further fossil plants from the
Grand Canyon of the Colorado in Arizona, collected and described
by Dr. David White, have been presented by the Carnegie Institution
of Washington.

A collection of several hundred fossils from English localities
secured by Mr. B. B. Bancroft has come as a deposit from the Smith-
sonian Institution. Other valuable specimens secured in field work by
Dr. Resser have included more than 1,200 Cambrian forms.

Eight articulated skeletons of the fossil horse Mesohippus bairdi
from the Oligocene of Nebraska were purchased. Large series of
excellent fossil horse skulls have come also from the field work
of Dr. Gidley in Idaho. Valuable material collected by Mr. C. W.
Gilmore in the San Juan Basin, N. Mex., has come to the fossil
reptile collection through work financed by the Smithsonian
Institution. |

Dr. Remington Kellogg and N. H. Boss collecting in Alabama
and Mississippi under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington secured a valuable specimen of zeuglodont, together
with other material. ‘There may be mentioned also a complete skull
and other bones of a large whalebone whale collected by Dr. Kellogg
at Governors Run, Md.

Arts and industries—The gift of the Rudolph Eickemeyer col-
lection of photographs and books to the section of photography con-
stituted one of the most important accessions to this department,
as it includes not only an excellent series of pictorial photographs
but also a library of books dealing with this subject, and a series
of medals and awards made to Mr. Eickemeyer for the excellence
of his work. The gift is further accompanied by an item in the
will of Mr. Eickemeyer through which $15,000 is designated as a
fund to be used in connection with this collection.

The collection of Edward Goodrich Acheson memorabilia, record-
ing the researches of this worker, presented by the Acheson Oildag
Co., has given important historical material, as has also a collection
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

of drawings and documents and other things relating to the indus-
trial development of the steam boiler presented by the Babcock and
Wilcox Co., of New York City, through its President, A. G. Pratt.

A series of 21 airplane propellers was presented by the American
Propeller Co. The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey trans-
ferred 26 specimens of early surveying and navigation instruments,
including examples 50 to 75 years old.

The family of Leander James McCormick through Robert Hall
McCormick presented eight models of labor-saving farm machinery
invented and constructed between 1829 and 1835 by Robert Mc-
Cormick, of Walnut Grove, Va. These include early types of the
McCormick reaper.

Many specimens of scientific value added to the study collections
of woods include a series of 598 woods from various parts of the
world.

To the division of graphic arts there came 1,210 prints as a gift
from J. Townsend Russell, jr., including the work of many im-
portant engravers. The Eastman Kodak Co. presented a number of
items to the section of photographic apparatus.

History.—Silverware formerly owned by Thomas McKean, one
of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, presented by
Mrs. Frances T. Redwood, and five pieces of chinaware used in the
White House by President James Madison, presented by Miss Mary
M. McGuire, are among the important accessions in this division.

To the costumes collection there came a rose chiffon velvet gown
worn by Mrs. Coolidge, on the occasion of the last formal reception
in the White House during the administration of her husband, Presi-
dent Calvin Coolidge. The gown was presented to the Museum
by Mrs. Coolidge.

An item of importance added to the military collections was a
set of uniforms and accessories of the type worn during the World
War and subsequently by officers and enlisted men of the Turkish
Army. This material was presented by the Government of Turkey
through Ahmet Mouhtar Bey, Turkish Ambassador to the United
States.

A considerable series of specimens came as a deposit to the numis-
matic collections from the American Numismatic Association, in-
cluding recent coinages of many countries. The Bureau of the Mint
of the Treasury Department transferred a number of ancient and
modern coins of importance.

The philatelic collection received a large number of specimen
stamps from the Post Office Department, as well as a special collec-
tion of Chinese stamps presented by the Hon. Liu Shu-fan, Director
General of Posts of China.
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930
EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Researches in the field have been carried on as usual by various
members of the scientific staff of the Museum, principally by means
of funds provided by the Smithsonian Institution through its pri-
vate income, with assistance in some instances in the form of con-
tributions from friends of the organization who have been interested
in different projects. Certain investigations have been financed
also under some of the specific funds of the Smithsonian. For some
expeditions small allotments have been made from the annual ap-
propriations, but these constituted only a small part of the total
expenditure for field work, by far the greater portion having come
from other sources. An additional appropriation that could be
used for field researches is a definite need of the National Museum,
and would be of great assistance in promoting its work. A brief
account of field work for the present year follows:

During the months of December and January, Henry B. Collins,
jr., assistant curator in the division of ethnology, conducted field
work in Mississippi, the investigations being carried on in cooper-
ation with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History,
that organization being represented by Messrs. Moreau B. Cham-
bers and James A. Ford. The most important result was the finding
in Yazoo County of an ancient Indian village site in which the
complete floor plan of a large house site was traced by means of
the postholes. The structure was round, 60 feet in diameter, and
was probably a council house somewhat similar to those described
by early explorers in the Creek and Cherokee regions. The open-
ing of the fiscal year in July found Mr. Collins in the field excavat-
ing at old Eskimo sites on St. Lawrence Island in Bering Sea, and
along the coast of Kotzebue Sound in western Alaska. His work
included a reconnaissance of the western Alaskan coast from Norton
Sound to Point Hope. Actual excavations were carried on at Cape
Kialegak on St. Lawrence, Cape Denbigh, Imaruk Basin, and Point
Hope, resulting in a large archeological collection. Work on St.
Lawrence Island was begun again in June, 1930, with most impor-
tant results as indicated by preliminary reports from the field.
The National Museum is deeply indebted to the Revenue Cutter
Service for its active cooperation in these investigations through trans-
portation provided on its vessels to points otherwise inaccessible.

Field work in the Dominican Republic was continued by Herbert
W. Krieger, curator in the division of ethnology, who began
archeological and historical studies in that area in 1928. Mr. Krie-
ger’s investigations were made possible by the assistance of Dr. W. L.
Abbott, whose interest in the island is of long standing and whose
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 33

first visit to Santo Domingo was in 1883. Investigations during
the current year included a reconnaissance of the mountainous inte-
rior of the provinces of La Vega, and of Azua, and actual excava-
tions at former Indian village sites in the valley of Constanza and
on the Caribbean coast at Andres, on the Bay of Andres, 25 miles
east of the capital city of Santo Domingo. There was no noteworthy
distinction between the artifacts recovered from middens at Con-
stanza and at Andres except for the lack of marine products such as
bones of fish and turtles, and shells of mollusks in the middens of the
central mountains. Shell deposits on the Caribbean coast resemble
those found in caves in the province of Samana, and also those in-
cluded in the kitchen middens of Monte Cristi Province. Middens
throughout the Dominican Republic yield typically Arawakan objects
of great variety, ranging from the petaloid polished stone celt, dec-
orated pottery with incised and punctate designs, and molded figurine
heads of post-archaic type, to the beveled celt of Strombus gigas,
shallow undecorated earthenware bowls, crude beads of shell with
hour-glass-shape perforation, and other artifacts that in Cuba have
been designated as products of the “Ciboney.” Frontal-occipital
deformation of skulls from cemeteries, fragments of stone collars,
and well-known types of Arawak zemis supply additional evidence
of the thorough penetration of the island by the Arawak and con-
versely tend to stress the lack of cultural stratigraphy or evidence
of the previous occupancy of the island by pre-Arawak tribes.
From May 15 to September 23, 1929, N. M. Judd, curator of Amer-
ican archeology, was in Arizona supervising the Third Beam Expedi-
tion of the National Geographic Society. As a result of these inves-
tigations, Dr. A. E. Douglass, of the University of Arizona, was
able to complete his tree-ring chronology by establishing a single
series of annual growth rings in pine trees, extending from the year
1929 back to 700 A. D. Thus, with over 1,200 years represented,
some 40 pre-Spanish Pueblo villages of the Southwest have been
correlated with our own calendar—certainly the most outstanding
contribution to American archeology in the past quarter century.
Following his researches for the National Geographic Society, the
curator, at the suggestion of Senator Carl Hayden, visited the Gila
and Salt River valleys, Ariz., to examine remaining vestiges of a
former network of prehistoric canals and to determine the most feas-
ible means of preserving a permanent record of them. On behalf
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Mr. Judd returned to Ari-
zona in mid-January to cooperate with Lieut. Edwin B. Bobzien and
Sergt. R. A. Stockwell, of the Army photographic personnel, in an
aerial survey of the major prehistoric canal systems bordering both
the Gila and Salt Rivers. The mosaic photographic maps made from
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

the air resulting from this survey, though not yet completely studied,
indicate results of importance.

Doctor Hrdlicka, curator of physical anthropology, during the
summer of 1929 made his second expedition to Alaska. The work of
the present season covered the Yukon from White Horse to Fort
Yukon as a reconnoissance, and from Fort Yukon downward con-
tinued as an intensive exploration in abandoned and partly washed-
away village sites, resulting in valuable collections of skeletal remains
and archeological implements. Physical measurements were made
on several hundred living natives, some of them the last represent-
atives of their tribes, and facial casts and hundreds of photographs
were taken.

Dr. Paul Bartsch, through the Walter Rathbone Bacon Travelling
Scholarship of the Smithsonian Institution, continued this season
the exploration of West Indian Islands for the study of their terres-
trial molluscan fauna, a work begun last year. He left Norfolk, Va.,
in June, 1929, for Porto Rico, where at San Juan a schooner, the
Guillermito, was chartered. Doctor Bartsch was accompanied by
Dr. William W. Hoffman and his assistant, J. Oliver, who were en-
gaged in other biological studies, The work began in Porto Rico
and then continued to Culebra and St. Thomas. On July 14 the
party visited the island of St. John and on the 15th St. Croix. Stops
were next made at Tortola, San Martin, Anguilla, San Bartholo-
mew, St. Eustatius, St. Cristopher, Nevis, Montserrat, and Grande
Terre. On July 31 they had reached Guadeloupe, and August 1 and
2 were on the Saints. They next visited Maria Galante and Domin-
ica, and August 7 and 8 were at Martinique. This was followed by
exploration of Santa Lucia, St. Vincent, and on August 17 of the
Grenadine islets. The expedition arrived at Grenada on August 25
and remained there until the 28th. September 1 to 4 were spent on
Trinidad. Margarita Island, off the Venezuelan coast was visited
September 7 and 8, followed by stops at Orchilla, E1 Roque, Bonaire,
Curacao, and Aruba. On September 24 the party arrived once more
at San Juan, Porto Rico. In addition to a rich harvest of mollisks,
this expedition as a by-product secured numerous specimens of ani-
mals of many groups as detailed elsewhere in this report.

Rev. David C. Graham, long a cooperator in the field work of
the Smithsonian, in the summer of 1929 made a collecting expedi-
tion to the Mupin district in Szechwan, the type locality of many of
the species discovered by the Abbé Armand David. Doctor Graham
started from his headquarters at Suifu on June 15 and reached
Mupin 11 days later. He made collections at several localities in
the district with good results, obtaining numerous specimens of
mammals, among them three flat skins of the “ giant panda,” birds,
reptiles, amphibians, fishes, and insects. He returned in August to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

Suifu, characterizing the trip as a successful reconnoissance, A
number of forms in the different groups enumerated are new to the
Museum, and the entire collection is of great importance.

Through the cooperation of Mr. Lee Parish, of ‘Tulsa, Okla., there
was organized in the late winter the Parish-Smithsonian expedition
to Haiti, on which Mr. Parish, and Mr. and Mrs. 8. W. Parish were
accompanied by Mr. W. M. Perrygo of the taxidermy staff. The
party sailed from Miami, Fla., on February 15, on the yacht L’sper-
anza, passing along the north coast of Cuba, where stops for col-
lecting were made at Gebara, Moa Key, the mainland opposite Moa,
and Port Tanamo. In Haiti visits were made to Gonave and Petit
Gonave Islands, both north and south sides of the southern penin-
sula, Lle-’-Vache off the south coast, and Navassa Island. Mr. Per-
rygo returned by steamer from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on May 28,
arriving in New York June 2. The specimens brought back include
35 mammals, about 600 birds, 206 reptiles, 281 fish, marine inverte-
brates, and echinoderms, as well as some live animals for the National
Zoological Park. The material is of importance and will give much
information of value concerning the area covered.

The Museum has also had the valued cooperation of the Hon.
Gifford Pinchot in the Pinchot South Sea Expedition which sailed
from Brooklyn, N. Y., on March 30, 1929, in the auxiliary yacht.
Mary Pinchot. The party consisted of the Hon. Gifford Pinchot,
Mrs. Pinchot, Dr. H. A. Pilsbry of the Philadelphia Academy of
Natural Sciences, and Dr. A. K. Fisher of the Biological Survey, De-
partment of Agriculture, who through cooperation of the survey
was detailed to make collections for the National Museum. No stops
were made until Key West was reached on April 7, when four days
were spent at this interesting place. A short stop was made at
Habana, whence the expedition proceeded to Grand Cayman Island,
On April 16 and 17 a collection of birds and other zoological speci-
mens was made there, and the party then continued to Swan, Old
Providence, and St. Andrews Islands. A hummingbird new to
science was taken on the island of St. Andrews. Cristobal, in the
Canal Zone, was reached on April 29 and on account of engine
trouble the expedition was detained for the following month in the
Canal Zone. On June 1 the Mary Pinchot left Balboa for Cocos
Island, where several days were spent collecting specimens. They
continued to the Galapagos Islands on June 11. The first stop was
made at Tower Island, followed by visits to Indefatigable, Seymour,
Charles, Hood, Chatham, Barrington, Albemarle, Narborough, and
a number of smaller islands. Considerable collections of birds and
other zoological material were obtained by August 26, when the
party continued westward. At Tagus Cove, Albemarle Island, the
flightless cormorant and penguin were found. From the Galapagos
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Islands the expedition proceeded 3,100 miles to the Marquesas Is-
lands, where they visited Hiva-oa, Fatu-Hiva, Uahuka, Nukahiva,
and later Eiao, one of the islands of the northern group. From
this point the voyage continued to the Tuamotu Islands. Fruit
pigeons, robber crabs and other crustaceans, corals, and shells were
collected. The cruise was ended at Papeete, Tahiti; because of the
lateness of the season the party returned by steamer to San Francisco,
arriving there on October 25, 1929. The Mary Pinchot was taken
back to Savannah, Ga., by the officers and crew.

Through the untiring energy of Mr. Pinchot and of Doctor Fisher,
who represented the Museum on the expedition, large and valuable
collections including porpoises, bats, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects,
and other animals have come to the Museum as noted elsewhere in
this report, numerous forms being new to our collections.

The explorations of Dr. Hugh M. Smith in Siam were continued
throughout the year. Among other journeys he made a trip to the
mountains of northern and northeastern Siam, where little zoological
collecting has been done before. As in previous years a number
of species new to science have been obtained.

In May, 1930, Doctor Wetmore made a short collecting trip princi-
pally for birds in the mountains of northern Spain, where he ob-
tained a number of forms new to the Museum collections. His work
was carried out principally from Puente de los Fierros, Busdongo,
and Riafo.

Dr. Joseph F. Rock continued work, under the auspices of the
National Geographic Society, in the semi-independent kingdom of
Muli, in southwestern Szechwan, China, and also visited the Minya-
konka Mountains. He made important collections of birds and
plants, the specimens coming to the National Museum as a gift from
the National Geographic Society.

Mr. Ernest G. Holt, traveling under the auspices of the National
Geographic Society, accompanied a boundary survey party along the
Venezuelan-Brazilian frontier, returning to this country with a
valuable collection of birds, reptiles, plants, and other material
which was presented to the National Museum by the National Geo-
graphic Society.

Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, who through cooperation
of the Navy Department was attached as surgeon to the Solar Eclipse
Expedition to the island of Panay, P. I., returned with large zoologi-
eal collections, principally of reptiles, fishes, and marine inverte-
brates, which are of great scientific value.

Dr. J. M. Aldrich was in Europe at the beginning of the fiscal year
examining types of species of flies in the British Museum. In July
he proceeded to Bergen, Norway, and after a brief collecting excur-
sion there continued to Sweden, where he spent a successful season
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37

collecting at Are. During this work he ascended the Areskutan,
a mountain 5,000 feet high, where Zetterstedt, 100 years before, had
made important entomological collections.

Doctor Aldrich left Washington on May 15, 1930, for a collecting
trip to the high altitudes of Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and north-
ern California, a journey on which he was absent at the end of the
fiscal year.

Mr. H. H. Shamel, of the division of mammals, was detailed for
about three weeks in May, 1930, to collect natural history specimens
in southwestern Missouri and eastern Kansas. ‘Twenty days were
spent in Barry and McDonald Counties, Mo., and a few days in
Montgomery and Harvey Counties, Kans. The collection obtained
included 65 mammals, 399 fishes, 34 birds, and between 100 and 125
reptiles, invertebrates, and insects, as well as three living mammals
for the National Zoological Park. The black-tailed jack rabbit
obtained in Barry County, Mo., was of interest as it is said to have
been in this region for only about 20 years, though previously re-
corded for Missouri from Vernon County.

E. D. Reid, of the division of fishes, was detailed from March 20
to April 12, 1930, to make collections of fresh-water animals in the
highlands of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. He secured
a fine lot of amphibians.

E. P. Killip, associate curator of plants, accompanied by Mr.
Albert C. Smith and Mr. W. J. Dennis, made an extended journey
to eastern Peru and Amazonian Brazil, remaining in the field from
April 9, 1929, to November 15, 1929. The expedition, under the
Smithsonian Institution, made general botanical collections and in-
vestigated especially the various plants used as fish poisons. The
New York Botanical Garden cooperated in the project by allowing
Mr. Smith, a member of the Garden staff, leave of absence for the
work. Nearly 27,000 specimens were collected, and such studies as
have been made to date show that a large number of novelties were
obtained. Many species have never before been brought back to
American herbaria.

Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian of the grass herbarium, spent the
months from July to October, 1929, in South and East Africa, col-
lecting and studying grasses. He visited Cape Colony, Transvaal,
Portuguese East Africa, Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Kenya, and Uganda,
obtaining a large number of specimens. He was an officially invited
guest of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
meeting in South Africa.

Mrs. Agnes Chase, of the grass herbarium, made an expedition to
Brazil during the months October to May, visiting the States of Rio
de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, Minas Geraes, Goyaz, Sao Paulo, and

28095—31——4
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Mattogrosso. More than 2,500 collection numbers were obtained,
with an average of five specimens to each number.

For four months of the last fiscal year and extending into the
early part of this, Dr. W. F. Foshag was engaged in field work
in the borax regions of California, Nevada, and Oregon, collecting
under the Roebling fund of the Smithsonian Institution with the
collaboration of the Harvard Mineralogical Museum. The purposes
of the expedition were to study the mineralogy and geology of the
borax deposits, with particular regard to their origin, and to obtain
for the Museum a comprehensive collection of typical minerals and
ores. It was thought desirable to undertake the work at this time
since changes in the borax industry have rendered obsolete many of
the most interesting of the deposits. Some very fine exhibition speci-
mens, a comprehensive series illustrating the geology and mineralogy
of the deposits, and much duplicate material resulted.

In the latter part of April Doctor Foshag was detailed to examine
some mineral localities in North Carolina. Through the courtesy of
Messrs. Burnham S. Colburn and Will Colburn of Biltmore Forest,
he was enabled to visit Spruce Pine, Balsam Gap, Mason’s Mountain,
Webster, and Statesville, and to collect rare uranium and other
minerals.

In order to carry out an expressed wish of the late Dr. Frank
Springer, Dr. R. S. Bassler visited Europe for the purpose of making
casts of various type specimens of crinoids preserved in foreign
museums. His chief object was to obtain facsimiles of the specimens
described by Barrande, which, with many other mementoes of that
famous paleontologist, are preserved in the National Museum at
Prague, Bohemia, this having been the scene of his greatest work.
Under most pleasant conditions and with the hearty cooperation of
the authorities at the museum, this work was carried to a successful
conclusion. Doctor Bassler was also enabled to visit other European
museums and various collecting fields. At the museums the paleon-
tological collections were studied and personal contact established
with the authorities; the time at the collecting fields was devoted
mainly to a study of the stratigraphy, in order to secure data for
the furtherance of work on our collections.

Late in the year, Doctor Bassler, accompanied by Dr. Ferdinand
Canu, made brief field trips in New England and along the Atlantic
coast in furtherance of their studies on Bryozoa.

Dr. C. E. Resser continued researches on the Cambrian of the
Rocky Mountain region under the Smithsonian Institution. For
a portion of the time he was accompanied by Dr. L. J. Moraes of
the Brazilian Geological Survey, who was interested in similar
problems. Doctor Resser’s chosen field was in Montana, with a
stop in the Yellowstone National Park to examine certain peculiar
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

structures caused by algal deposits. Camp was next established on
the Bridger Range in Montana, where a restudy of the stratigraphy
proved it to be much more complicated than was previously supposed.
Thence a move westward and northwestward led into the, Blackfoot
country where the pre-Cambrian and Cambrian rocks were examined.
Following this various ranges in southwestern Montana were visited,
and the last part of the season was spent in the Teton Mountains in
extending the studies of the previous season. Small collections were
made, the expedition being devoted mainly to field observations.

The field expedition under the Smithsonian in charge of Mr. C. W.
Gilmore covered certain badland areas extending from Kimbetoh
northward to Farmington in the San Juan Basin, N. Mex. Although
the surface indications gave every promise of yielding rich returns,
it was found that the majority of the leads consisted of single bones.
Individual skeletons had evidently been widely scattered before in-
terment, and only occasionally were portions of skeletons found to-
gether, which fact, however, did not prevent the collecting of ma-
terial of much scientific interest, as several news species appear to be
represented and some known forms are new to the fauna. The col-
lection, as a whole, is a decided contribution to the meagerly known
faunas of the area.

The expedition under the Smithsonian by Dr. J. W. Gidley to the
Snake River Valley, Idaho, inaugurated toward the end of the last
fiscal year, was attended with unusual success—so much so, in fact,
that a second expedition to the same region is now in progress. Well
preserved remains of a rare extinct species of horse comprise the most
important part of the collection, while gravel deposits in the vicinity
yielded a large species of bison, a giant muskox, camel, horse, and
other extinct animals of the Pleistocene period.

Later in the year Doctor Gidley continued his researches dealing
with the problem of the association of early man with the extinct
mammalian fauna in Florida, the work being financed by contribu-
tions from Mr. Childs Frick and by the Smithsonian. Worth-while
data and material were obtained, though the expedition was greatly
hindered by excessive rains which rendered it impossible to work out
some of the most promising localities.

Under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Dr.
Remington Kellogg, assisted by Mr. Norman Boss, was occupied for
a month in exploration of the Eocene (Jackson) deposits in Alabama
and Mississippi for zeuglodont remains. The resulting small collec-
tion of these comparatively rare fossils was presented to the Museum.
Messrs. Kellogg and Boss also made one trip of three days to the
near-by Miocene localities along Chesapeake Bay to collect cetacean
remains,
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

In August members of the Maryland Geological Survey brought
to the Museum’s attention the discovery of a large whalebone whale
skull located in Miocene deposits in the vicinity of Governors Run,
Md. Dr. Remington Kellogg, with the assistance of Mr. A. J. Poole
and members of the Maryland Survey staff, were successful in collect-
ing it, the specimen being one of the first of this type discovered.

Late in the fiscal year Mr. C. W. Gilmore was detailed to head an
expedition into the Eocene of the Bridger Basin in southwestern
Wyoming, and Dr. J. W. Gidley returned to the scene of his 1929
collections in Idaho. As both expeditions will continue well into
next year, detailed accounts will go over until the next annual report.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

The usual routine repairs have kept the buildings of the National
Museum in proper condition. At.the beginning of the year the
work of safeguarding the dome of the Natural History Building
had just been finished. Before opening the rotunda to the public
the walls were steam-cleaned, the plastered surfaces repainted, and
the floor repolished. The rotunda was opened finally on October
23, 1929, after having been closed to visitors for nearly two years.
Walls and ceilings in the north entrance to the Natural History
Building, as well as various exhibition, office, and laboratory rooms,
were repainted. The roadways on the east and west sides of the
buildings were closed by gates to prevent their use as thoroughfares
by unauthorized vehicles; this step was taken because of several acci-
dents that had taken place there. With the assistance of the office
of Public Buildings and Public Parks, a steel gallery was erected
in the storage rooms of the division of vertebrate paleontology to
provide additional space for the storing of fossils.

In the Arts and Industries Building the fountain in the center
rotunda was removed because in recent months several visitors
intent on other matters had stumbled over the coping and fallen
into the water. Roofs and exterior woodwork were repainted, and
various rooms and offices were redecorated. Work in enlarging the
women’s rest room was begun, a special item of $3,500 toward this
project being included in the second deficiency act approved after
the close of the year.

The power plant was in operation from September 27, 1929, to
May 28, 1930. The consumption of coal was 38,502 tons, an amount
in excess of that burned during the previous fiscal year. The aver-
age cost was $5.65 per ton. The Steamboat Inspection Service
examined the boilers during the year and made certain suggestions
as to their condition. The elevators have been regularly inspected
by the District of Columbia inspector. The total electric current
produced amounted to 655,253 kilowatt-hours, manufactured at a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 4]

cost of 1.78 cents per kilowatt-hour, including interest on the plant,
depreciation, repairs, and material. The amount of electric current
produced represents an increase of approximately 6,500 kilowatt-
hours over that of last year, and the plant is now operating at its
maximum capacity. As demands for electric current increase stead-
ily it will be necessary during the coming fiscal year to purchase a
limited amount from the local company during the winter season, in
addition to the regular purchase made during the summer season
when the Museum plant is not in operation.

The ice plant manufactured 435.5 tons of ice at the average cost
of $1.71 per ton; this cost represents a definite reduction over that
for the previous year.

During the year 7 exhibition cases and bases, 308 pieces of storage,
laboratory, and other furniture, and 2,224 drawers of various kinds
were added, the greater part of these being manufactured in our
shops.

MEETINGS AND RECEPTIONS

The lecture rooms and auditorium of the National Museum were
used during the present year for 135 meetings covering the usual
wide range of activities. Government agencies that utilized these
facilities for hearings, meetings, lectures, and other special occa-
sions included the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils, the Forest Service,
the Graduate School, Food, Drug and Insecticide Administration,

The Food Standards Committee of the Food, Drug, and Insecti-
cide Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, held
a public hearing on April 30 in room 48. On January 15 the Mary-
land-Virginia Farmers’ Marketing Association held a business meet-
ing in the auditorium. The seventh National and fifth Interna-
tional Oratorical Contest for the Evening Star area was held in
the auditorium on May 8, with J. Loren Freund of Gonzaga Col-
lege, Miss Virginia Carr, of Oakton High School, Va., and Miss
Frances Gertrude McKim, St. Mary’s Seminary, St. Mary’s City,
Md., as speakers. On May 27 the sixth annual National Spelling
Bee was held in the auditorium. From June 18 to 20 the United
States Public Health Service held a conference with State and
Territorial health officers in room 43. Addresses were made by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, Surg. Gen. H. S.
Cumming, and others.

From June 18 to 24 the meeting rooms were used by the Extension
Service of the United States Department of Agriculture for confer-
ences in connection with the 4-H Club camp.

A memorial meeting was held August 16 to commemorate the
service to science of the late Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of
geology of the United States National Museum.

On the evening of December 10 the formal opening of the exhibi-
tion of paintings purchased under the Henry Ward Ranger bequest
was held in the National Gallery of Art from 9 to 11. The District
of Columbia section of the Woman’s Auxiliary to the American
Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers arranged a recep-
tion in the National Gallery rooms on December 26 for ladies in
attendance at the meetings of the Geological Society of America.

MISCELLANEOUS

The exhibition halls of the National Museum were open during
the year on week days from 9 a. m. to 4.30 p. m. and with the excep-
tion of the aircraft building were open Sunday afternoons from 1.30
to 4.30; all museum buildings remained closed on December 24 and
25, in accordance with presidential order, and were closed also on
New Year’s Day.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 43

The flags on the Smithsonian and Museum buildings were placed
at half mast on November 19, 1929, out of respect to the late James
Wilson Good, Secretary of War. They were flown at half mast
from March 9 to April 7, 1930, out of respect to ex-President William
Howard Taft, associated for many years with the Smithsonian
Institution as a member of the Institution, presiding officer ex
officio, Regent, and Chancellor. On November 13 the flag pole on
the Smithsonian building was found to be in a dangerous condition
and was removed so that no flag was flown on that building until
April 10, 1930, when a new pole was put in place on the north tower.

Visitors to the Museum during the year totaled 1,894,989, a de-
crease of approximately 35,000 from the record of the preceding
year. This decrease apparently reflected changed economic con-
ditions in the country. Attendance in the several buildings of the
National Museum was recorded as follows: Smithsonian Institution,
282,482; Arts and Industries, 863,479; Natural History, 625,326;
Aircraft, 123,700. The average daily attendance for week days was
5,125, and for Sundays 10,317. The increase in the Sunday average
of nearly 4,000 persons per day is a certain indication of the need
for opening the exhibits to the public on Sunday afternoons.

During the year the Museum published 16 separate volumes and
35 miscellaneous papers, while the distribution of literature
amounted to 87,323 copies of its various books and pamphlets. Ad-
ditions to the Museum library included 2,317 volumes and 668
pamphlets, obtained partly by exchange, partly by donation, and
partly by purchase. The library of the National Museum as separate
from that of the Smithsonian Institution proper now contains 76,879
volumes and 108,297 pamphlets. Much work was done in arranging
the catalogues of these collections. The Museum has 36 sectional
libraries in connection with its various divisions, each containing
the particular books relating to the work involved. These are in
addition to the main libraries that house the works of general
reference.

On October 1, 1929, Dr. R. S. Bassler was made head curator of
the department of geology. Dr. Charles E. Resser was designated
on December 1 curator of stratigraphic paleontology. Dr. W. F.
Foshag was made curator of the division of mineralogy and pet-
rology on September 1, and in addition was given charge of the work
of the division of physical and chemical geology. Mr. Edward P.
Henderson was appointed on November 16 assistant curator in the
division last mentioned.

Dr. Charles W. Richmond, long associate curator in the division
of birds, was given the title of curator on July 1. On September 16
at Dr. Richmond’s own request he again became associate curator
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

and Dr. Herbert Friedmann was appointed curator. The division
of ethnology was reorganized during the year, with resulting change
in status for H. W. Krieger, curator, and H. B. Collins, jr., assistant
curator. Julian S. Warmbath was appointed taxidermist on Octo-
ber 1. Wm. H. Egberts was given the title of chief preparator of
the department of anthropology, and Norman H. Boss that of chief
preparator in vertebrate paleontology. Miss Leila G. Forbes was
appointed assistant librarian to succeed Miss Isabel L. Towner, who
resigned on September 7. Miss Gertrude L. Woodin succeeded Miss
Ethel A. L. Lacy, chief of the accessions department, who severed
her connection with the Museum on September 15. On July 1 Mrs.
Florence L. Grock was appointed principal accounting and auditing
assistant. Michael Cahillane, Clarence R. Kyte, and William H.
Smith were appointed sergeants July 1. On August 16 Mr. Cahil-
lane was advanced to heutenant, and Wm. H. Vanneman was made
sergeant on September 1.

Three employees left the service through the operation of the
retirement act—Edgar W. Hanvey, cabinet-maker, after a service of
nearly 32 years; A. C. Dufresne, lieutenant of the watch, after 18
years on the guard force; and Carl A. Ohlson after nearly 18 years’
service as watchman. The Museum lost through death during the
year seven of its active workers and one member of its honorary
scientific staff. Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, died
August 15, 1929. Dr. Jesse Walter Fewkes, collaborator in ethnol-
ogy, died on May 31, 1930. Other losses by death included Miss Ava
L. Bennett, clerk stenographer, on November 11, 1929; Robert M.
Campbell, bricklayer and plasterer, July 14, 1929; Ira W. Johnson,
oiler, October 26, 1929; William L. Brawner, watchman, August
25, 1929; Walter J. Ferguson, watchman, October 8, 1929; and Mrs.
Alberta Buchanan, charwoman, May 138, 19380.

Respectfully submitted.

ALEXANDER WETMORE,
Assistant Secretary.
APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Str: I have the honor to submit herewith my report on the opera-
tions of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1930.

THE GALLERY COMMISSION

The ninth annual meeting of the gallery commission was held in
the Regents’ room of the Institution at 10.15 a. m., December 10,
1929, the members present being as follows: Mr. Gari Melchers,
chairman; and Messrs. Herbert Adams, Charles L. Borie, jr., James
KE. Fraser, J. H. Gest, Frank J. Mather, jr., Charles Moore, James
Parmelee, E. W. Redfield, E. C. Tarbell, and Dr. Charles G. Abbot,
ex-officio.

Due to the absence of Dr. W. H. Holmes, secretary of the com-
mission, Mr. James G. Taylor was requested to act as temporary
secretary.

The minutes of the previous annual meeting were read and ap-
proved, followed by the reading and approval of the secretary’s
report on the activities of the gallery for the year.

A number of the matters mentioned in this report were discussed
very fully and with reference to the Langhorne collection, the fol-
lowing resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Langhorne be invited to loan to the
National Gallery of Art their collection of paintings as a temporary exhibition,
preferably at a time convenient to them as well as to the commission.

Doctor Abbot explained the steps taken in regard to the offer of
Mr. John Gellatly and its acceptance, stating that through an act
of Congress funds would be provided for the maintenance of the
collection during the next four years. He added that special cards
of admission to the collection in New York had been prepared and
that he would be glad to supply the members of the commission with
them. After discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That a committee consisting of Doctor Abbot and Mr. Melchers

be appointed to prepare a formal acknowledgment of appreciation and thanks
to Mr. Gellatly for his generous gift.

45
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

The acknowledgment duly prepared and forwarded is as follows:

JANUARY 6, 1930.

DEAR Mr. GELLATLY: At the annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art
Commission, held at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C., on the
10th day of December, 1929, the following resolutions were unanimously
adopted :

Resolved, That the deep and appreciative thanks of this commission be, and
they hereby are, extended to Mr. John Gellatly, of New York City, for his
generous action in donating to the National Gallery of Art the fine and valu-
able art collection which, during a long term of years, he has assembled with
so much pains and care, and with such rare discrimination and artistic taste.

Resolved, That this collection constitutes an important addition to the Na-
tional Gallery of Art; that it will for all time to come be an outstanding
feature of this Institution; and that it represents a great national asset in the
development of the art of our country.

Resolved, That these resolutions be spread in full upon the minutes of this
meeting, as a lasting tribute to the generosity of the donor, and that a copy
thereof be transmitted to Mr. Gellatly with assurance of the warm regard and
sincere appreciation of the members of the National Gallery of Art Commis-
sion, and with their cordial good wishes for his future health and happiness.

Sincerely yours.

(Signed) CHARLES G. ABBOT,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
(Signed) GARI MrLcHERS,

Chairman, National Gallery of Art Comnvission,

Mr. JOHN GELLATLY,

New York City.

The Ranger exhibit was very fully discussed. It was the sense
of the meeting that members of the commission should make
their inspection of the exhibit entirely as individuals and that
each member should give his personal expression of opinion in
regard to the selections proper to be added to the National Gal-
lery. It was also decided that these votes should be regarded as
strictly confidential. The following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the commission extend to the Council of the National Acad-
emy of Design an invitation as a body to view the Ranger exhibit.

Mr. Moore brought up the matter, which had been referred to pre-
viously, of providing a fund for the encouragement and support of
young artists until they had “ arrived.” He had not been successful
in getting one of the large philanthropical organizations to arrange
for this as yet, but he was glad to say that such provision had been
incorporated in the will of a public-spirited citizen to become oper-
ative upon his death.

EVENTS OF THE YEAR
Among the more noteworthy events of the year was the assemblage

in Washington and exhibition in the gallery of the group of paintings
purchased by the Council of the National Academy of Design in
——————

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47

accordance with provisions of the Henry Ward Ranger bequest.
This bequest provides for the purchase from year to year of paint-
ings by American artists which shall be assigned to art institutions
throughout the country, the National Gallery being given the privi-
lege of selecting from these purchases such examples as may be re-
garded as desirable additions to the national collections. There is
thus established in perpetuity a procedure which should prove of
prime importance in preserving a representative series of American
paintings continuing from year to year and period to period, an
historical measure not heretofore undertaken by any nation.

Purchases under the Ranger bequest began in 1920, and in 1930,
78 examples had been secured and distributed. The assemblage of
these in Washington, December 10, 1929, was arranged to enable
the gallery commission to inspect the works and make tentative
selections for the national collection. Final steps on acceptance can
not be taken, however, until within the 5-year period beginning 10
years after the artist’s death in each case.

It has been suggested that acceptance of paintings by living
painters be regarded as tentative acceptances only so that any work
chosen may be returned to the recipient institution whence it came
when a superior work by the same artist becomes available.

The addition of a single Ranger bequest work per year to the
gallery would certainly not seem excessive, and at this rate in 100
years the gallery would be enriched by the ownership of 100 of the
most masterly American works of the century.

Two distinct points of view may be held regarding acceptances
of paintings by the gallery. First, that there should be included
only recognized Old World masterpieces with possibly occasional and
rare outstanding examples of American work of corresponding art
value, and second that the National Gallery should first of all take
this opportunity to build up an unbroken series of American works
of the first order.

In the opinion of the director the authorities of the American
National Gallery looking to the far future should not be content
with accumulations of the art of the past, representing closed
chapters of the history of art. As a great people we should have an
assured art future, a future worthy of systematic record and repre-
sentation.

A million Old World masterpieces installed in great American
buildings will not make an American National Gallery, and in his
view a commission or other official body concerned in the estab-
lishment of a national art collection should recognize the distinction
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

between the history of the world art of the past and the story of
art in America to be revealed as the centuries and millenniums pass.

The essential concept of an American National Gallery is the
assemblage of an adequate number of the best available products of
the American brush (or chisel) from period to period and this is
exactly what the Ranger bequest aims to do.

SPECIAL EXHIBITIONS HELD IN THE GALLERY

The special exhibitions held in the gallery during the fiscal year
formed no small part of its activities and are as follows:

THH HENRY WARD RANGER EXHIBITION

The exhibition of paintings purchased to date by the Council of the
National Academy of Design from the Henry Ward Ranger fund,
was opened on the evening of December 10, 1929, with a reception
by the Secretary and Regents of the Institution, the director of
the gallery, and the members of the National Gallery of Art Com-
mission. ‘The National Academy of Design was represented by Mr.
Charles P. Curran, corresponding secretary; Mr. Albert P. Lucas,
assistant corresponding secretary; Mr. Henry Prellwitz, treasurer;
and Messrs. Charles S. Chapman, Ernest L. Ipsen, and Carl Run-
gius, of the council of the academy. The exhibit closed on January
31, 1980.

All of the paintings, 78 in number, are by outstanding contempo-
rary American artists and, as stated above, under the terms of Mr.
Ranger’s will the National Gallery has the privilege of claiming any
of them which it deems desirable for the national collections within
the 5-year period beginning 10 years after the artist’s death, and
ending 15 years after his death. In the meantime the pictures are
assigned by the Council of the National Academy of Design to
institutions which maintain a free art gallery. These institutions
lent the pictures for the present exhibition, in which for the first time
the Ranger fund pictures have been assembled in one place. Pay-
ment of expenses of transportation and insurance was made pos-
sible through a grant of $1,000 voted by the Carnegie Corporation
of New York. This grant was procured through the endeavors of
Mr. Gari Melchers, chairman of the National Gallery of Art Com-
mission.

Members of the National Gallery Commission submitted, confiden-
tially, their votes as to the paintings exhibited which were suitable
for permanent exhibition by the gallery. This vote is preserved for
the information of those who in future will be charged with selecting
pictures from the Ranger collections.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 57

Curatorial work within the collection has as usual included the
documentary study of inscriptions on the new purchases from the
Far East, as well as those upon objects already in the collection.
Many objects and reproductions of objects have been submitted by
other institutions and by private owners for expert opinion or for
translation of inscriptions in Chinese, Japanese, or Tibetan. The
total number of such reports made by the curator embraces 834
objects and 185 photographs of objects.

During the winter a large group of paintings in the Near Eastern
section, which was purchased en bloc in 1907 from its then owner,
Col. H. B. Hanna, and which comprised a miscellany of Mughal,
Rajput, and Persian paintings, has undergone complete revision and
reclassification. In this work the curator has had the expert assist-
ance of Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy, of the Museum of Fine Arts,
Boston. The entire collection of Near Eastern painting and manu-
script leaves is now in process of being remounted and stored in
boxes of an improved type made in the Freer Gallery shop for this
purpose. The collection of Chinese bronzes, also, has been given
a new and improved type of storage so arranged as to be most easily
accessible to the student.

The care and preservation of objects in the collection has this
year included work that can be itemized as follows:

(1) Remounted:
2 Chinese panel paintings.
1 Chinese scroll painting.
3 Japanese panel paintings.
2 Japanese screen paintings.
(2) Restored and rebacked.
2 Chinese velvet wall hangings.
(3) Repaired:
11 pages of Egyptian calligraphy on parchment.

BPrRFoMmMoarRranwiuc

On March 25, 1930, a special exhibition of “ New Accessions ”
was opened to the public, in Galleries I and II.

THE LIBRARY

During the year, there have been added to the main library 93
volumes, 87 unbound periodicals, and 229 pamphlets. Twenty-nine
volumes were sent to the bindery. A list of the new accessions to
the library accompanies this report as Appendix A (not printed).

The library is in process of being catalogued under the direction
of the librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, Mr. W. L. Corbin.
This work was begun in November, 1929, and is not yet completed.

REPRODUCTIONS AND PAMPHLETS

Four hundred and five new negatives of objects have been made.
Of these, 182 were made for registration photographs and 223 for
special orders. The total number of reproductions available either
as carbon photographs or as negatives from which prints can be
made upon request is now 38,094.

Kighty-two lantern slides have also been added to the collection,
making a total of 911 available for study and for sale.

The total number of sales of reproductions, at cost price, is as fol-
lows: Photographs, 1,600; post cards, 16,683; lantern slides, 79;
hegatives, 2. Eighty-three lantern slides have been loaned for
lecture purposes.

Of booklets issued by the gallery, the following number were sold
at cost price:

BUILDING

The work of repairing the building has included this year the
repainting of the corridors on the lower floor, and of Galleries LII
and IV. The shop has been constantly occupied with the building of
equipment of various sorts, including new cases for bronze storage,
other exhibition cases and easels, and, interesting for its novelty, a
motor-driven machine for the unrolling of Chinese scrolls before a
moving-picture camera. The report of the superintendent, which
gives a detailed account of shop work, accompanies this report as
Appendix C (not printed).

ATTENDANCE

The gallery has been open every day, from 9 until 4.30 o’clock,
with the exception of Mondays, Christmas Day, and New Year’s
Day.

The total attendance for the year was 120,651; the total attendance
for week days, 80,624; the total Sunday attendance, 40,027. The
average Sunday attendance is more than twice as great as that of
week days; 769 being the average Sunday attendance, and 310 the
average for week days. The two peaks of the year were reached in
August and April, with totals of 17,800 and 17,541, respectively;
the lowest attendance was that of January, with a total of 5,561.

The total number of visitors to the offices was 1,849. Of these,
156 came for general information; 172 to call upon upon members
of the staff; 308 to see objects in storage; 116 to submit objects for
examination; 16 to study the building and installation methods; 128
to study in the library; 95 to see the reproductions of the Washington
Manuscripts; 15 to make photographs and sketches, and 3 to make
tracings; while 212 came to purchase photographs.

Sixteen groups, ranging from 1 to 30 persons, were given docent
service in the exhibition galleries, and 10 classes in groups ranging
from 3 to 8 persons were given instruction in the study room.

Two lectures by eminent authorities in their respective fields were
given during the winter in the auditorium at the Freer Gallery.
These were as follows:

January 6, 1930: Sir Aurel Stein on “ The Caves of the Thousand
Buddhas ”; illustrated.

February 20, 1930: Dr. A. K. Coomaraswamy on “ Indian Sculp-
ture: Intention and Development ”; illustrated.

On May 7, at 5 o’clock, in compliment to the Library of Congress,
the auditorium was opened to the society of “The Friends of Music
in the Library of Congress,” for a concert of music written for
harpischord, piano, viola d’amore, and viola.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930
FIELD WORK

In spite of greatly disturbed conditions now and long since pre-
vailing in China, Mr. Bishop was able, last spring, to make investi-
gations of considerable interest at the site of the Liang dynasty
(A. D. 502-556) tombs, not far from Nanking. The detailed report
on these excavations has not yet been received; but, meanwhile,
copies of Mr. Bishop’s letters from the field are submitted herewith
as Appendix B (not printed).

In June, after a profitable winter at the Imperial University,
Kyoto, Mr. Wenley joined Mr. Bishop in China. He has been re-
called for work at the gallery where he is due to arrive next
December.

Mr. Acker has been making excellent progress in his Chinese
studies at the University of Leiden, and has also found opportunity
to see some of the important Chinese collections in Paris, Berlin,
and Stockholm. He will pass one more school year under Professor
Duyvendak at Leiden.

PERSONNEL

Miss Christabel E. Hill, stenographer to the field staff, resigned
from her position August 23, 1929.

Mr. Carl W. Bishop, associate curator, left for field work in China
on November 16. He was married to Miss Daisy Furscott in Berke-
ley, Calif., on November 30.

Miss Eleanor Thompson took up her position as office assistant
on November 15, 1929.

Dr. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy spent July 12, February 19 and

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
ean Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1930, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress approved February 20, 1929.
The act referred to contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation
of archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,
including necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and
illustrations, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses,
$68,800.

Mr. M. W. Stirling, chief, in the month of August, 1929, visited
Gallup, N. Mex., from whence he went to the Long H Ranch, Ariz.,
in order to view the archeological excavations being conducted there
by Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., of the bureau staff. From the Long
H Ranch he proceeded to Pecos, N. Mex., for the purpose of attend-
ing the Conference of Southwest Archeologists, which was held at
the site of the excavations being conducted by Dr. A. V. Kidder.

From Pecos Mr. Stirling went to Hanover, N. H., to deliver an
address before the annual meeting of the Social Science Research
Council.

On February 1 Mr. Stirling went to Key West, Fla., where,
through the courtesy of Mr. Lee Parish, he was enabled to conduct
an archeological reconnaissance of the Ten Thousand Islands in
Mr. Parish’s yacht, the Hsperanza. Upon the completion of this
reconnaissance a visit was made to Lacooche, Fla., where a small
mound was excavated. Mr. Stirling next proceeded to Tampa Bay,
where a large sand mound near Safety Harbor was excavated.

Work was continued on the preparation of manuscript descriptive
of the field work, and a number of short articles were prepared and
published in various periodicals. Frequent lectures on anthropo-
logical topics were given during the year before various scientific
and educational bodies.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, conducted field work during
July and August, 1929, in Mississippi and Oklahoma. He collected

further ethnological material from the Mississippi Choctaw, and
61
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

corrected notes that were obtained the year before. In Oklahoma
Doctor Swanton visited most of the existing Square Grounds of
the Creeks, witnessed parts of several ceremonies, and obtained de-
scriptions of their ceremonial arrangement. The Choctaw material
has been incorporated in his manuscript, “Source Book for the
Social and Ceremonial Customs of the Choctaw,” which is ready for
publication. The data Doctor Swanton collected on Creek Square
Grounds will form a short paper and is ready for publication.

Doctor Swanton corrected throughout the words of his Timucua
dictionary, completing work begun last year; and in addition he be-
gan the work of translating them, with the help of the original
Timucua-Spanish religious works in which the material is preserved.
Further work was done on the map of Indian tribes, the scope of
which has been extended so as to cover Mexico, Central America,
and the West Indies; the accompanying text has also been amplified.
On June 20 Doctor Swanton left Washington to resume field work
in the State of Louisiana.

On July 1, 1929, Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, went to
Shawnee, Okla., to continue his study of the Algonquin Tribes of
that State, where he obtained a fairly representative collection of
Kickapoo mythology. From these studies Doctor Michelson found
that his statement made 14 years ago that Kickapoo mythology, on
the whole, is closest to Fox mythology, still holds valid. It should
be mentioned that Kickapoo shares with certain northern Indian
tribes a number of tales which are either absent from the Fox or
their knowledge is confined to but few of them. Despite some sec-
ondary changes, Kickapoo is an archaic Algonquian language. It
may be added that their religious ideas and practices hold their own
with great vigor. Obviously, the type of social organization is quite
similar to those of the Sauk and Fox. Work among the Sauk and
Shawnee was chiefly linguistic. The new data clearly show that
Shawnee is further removed from Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo than
supposed; yet it is abundantly clear that it is closer to them than
to any other Algonquian languages. Only a short time was given to
Cheyenne, practically nothing but linguistics being considered. The
opinion given by Doctor Michelson in the twenty-eighth annual re-
port of the bureau that Cheyenne must be considered aberrant Al-
gonquian is fully sustained. Some social customs were noted, among
them male descent. Work among the Arapaho was mainly linguistic.

A large part of the time in the office was spent in preparing for
publication a large memoir on the Fox Wapanowiweni. This is now
in an advanced stage of preparation. He also corrected the proofs
of Bulletin 95 of the bureau which was issued during the year.

On June 3, 1930, Doctor Michelson left Washington to renew his
work among the Algonquin Tribes of Oklahoma. He spent at first a -
|

|

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

short time on the Cheyenne. It is now possible to formulate some
of the phonetic shifts that have transformed Cheyenne from normal
Algonquian. It is also clear that some of the commonest words in
normal Algonquian are lacking. He then took up work again among
the Kickapoo and obtained an even larger body of myths and tales.
Some new facts on their social organization were likewise obtained.

Mr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, worked during the year se-
curing the language and much of the ethnology of the San Juan
tribe of California through an aged and ill informant, Mrs. Ascen-
sién Solérsano, at Monterey, Calif. Having learned the language
which has scarcely been spoken since 1850, through the circumstance
that both her mother and father, who were fullblooded Indians,
talked it together all their lives, the mother dying at 84 years of age
and the father at 82, she retained a knowledge of an extinct language
and a dead culture, and lived long enough to enable Mr. Harrington
to record practically all that she knew, thus filling in a great blank in
California ethnology. So sick that she was scarcely able to sit up
even at the beginning of the work, Mr. Harrington continued this
work at her bedside until well into January, 1930, and no Indian
ever showed greater fortitude than this poor soul who served the
bureau up to almost her last day. The material recorded consisted
of every branch of linguistic and ethnological information and con-
tains many new and important features.

Mrs. Solorsano during all the latter part of her life was recog-
nized as a doctora. Her little home at Gilroy, Calif., was a free
hospital for down-and-outs of every nationality and creed, and here
the sick and ailing were treated with Indian and Spanish herb medi-
cines and were seen through to the last with motherly care and no
thought of recompense. Mr. Harrington obtained full accounts of
how she treated all the various diseases, and of the herbs and other
methods employed. Specimens of the herbs were obtained and
identified by the division of plants of the National Museum.

Songs were obtained on the phonograph, and accounts of cere-
monies, and description of all the foods of the Indians and how
they were cooked were obtained. Accounts of the witcheries of the
medicine men take us back to earliest times, and are mingled with the
early history of the tribe at the San Juan Mission. Many stories
and anecdotes about early Indians were recorded and throw much
light on the thought and the language of the times. Names of
plants and animals and places were studied and identified, Dr. C.
Hart Merriam generously helping in this and other sections of the
work. In spite of her age and infirmities Dona Ascensi6n’s mind
remained remarkably clear and her memory was exceptional. No
greater piece of good fortune has ever attended ethnological re-
search of a tribe that was culturally of the greatest importance,
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

forming an all but lost link between the cultures of northern and
southern California.

After the death of Dona Ascensién at the end of January, 1930,
Mr. Harrington spent some weeks in checking up on the information
in every way possible, copying from the archives at San Juan Mission,
working at the Bancroft Library at Berkeley, Calif., and interview-
ing many individuals, and returned to Washington in April, since
which time he has been engaged in preparing a report on the work
for publication.

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., archeologist, devoted the fiscal year to a
number of activities. July, August, and the first part of September,
1929, were spent conducting excavations at the Long H Ranch,
between St. John’s and Houck, in eastern Arizona. The work was
begun in May and continued through June of the preceding fiscal
year so that the investigations extending from July to the middle of
September were a continuation of work already under way. At the
completion of the summer’s work the remains of three different types
of houses had been uncovered. These included 18 pit houses, the
vestiges of three jacal, pole and mud structures, and a pueblo ruin
with 49 rooms, and 4 kivas or circular ceremonial rooms.

The pit houses were found to correspond in many respects with
those dug up by Doctor Roberts in the Chaco Canyon, in north-
western New Mexico, during the summer of 1927 and described in
Bulletin 92 of the Bureau of American Ethnology. The jacal houses
were found to have been quite comparable to a similar type found
in southern Colorado during the field season of 1928. The latter
were extensively described in Bulletin 96 of the bureau. The pueblo
revealed an unusually clear cut story of the growth and changes
in a communal dwelling. The building had not been erected ac-
cording to a preconceived plan but had grown by degrees through the
addition of new units. It was quite evident that such additions
had taken place at four different periods in the occupation of the
building.

Doctor Roberts returned to Washington in October. The autumn
months were devoted to reading and correcting galley and page
proofs for the report on the investigations of the 1928 field season.
This paper is called “ Early Pueblo Ruins in the Piedra District,
Southwestern Colorado,” and is Bulletin 96 of the bureau.

The winter months were devoted to working over the specimens
obtained from the summer’s excavations and preparing a report on
the investigations. This included the drawing of 31 text figures,
consisting of 70 drawings, 1 map showing the region in general
and the location of the sites, and the writing of a 600-page manu-
EEE —

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

script. The latter is called “The Ruins at Kiatuthlanna,” the Zuni
Indian name for the locality.

Doctor Roberts assisted Mr. Neil M. Judd of the United States
National Museum in cataloguing the collections made along the
Piedra River in southwestern Colorado in the summer of 1928.
Illustrated lectures on the archeology of the Southwest were deliv-
ered before a number of Washington organizations, and information
on the archeology of the New World was supplied in response to
many letters of inquiry.

On May 12, 1930, Doctor Roberts left Washington for Denver,
Colo., where one week was spent in studying new accessions in the
Colorado State Museum and the City Museum of Denver.

Leaving Denver, Doctor Roberts proceeded to Gallup, N. Mex.,
and from there to the Zuni Indian Reservation. One week was
devoted to an archeological reconnaissance of the Zuni area. As a
result of this a small pueblo ruin was chosen as the scene for inten-
sive investigations, and under a permit from the Department of
the Interior excavations were started. By July 1 a burial mound
containing 40 interments had been investigated and 16 rooms and
2 kivas or ceremonial chambers in the pueblo had been cleared of
their accumulated débris. In addition to much valuable information,
150 specimens, including pottery and other art facts, had been
secured.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was engaged in routine office
work from July 1, 1929, to May 7, 1930, and from the latter date
until the close of the fiscal year he was engaged in field service in
Canada and very briefly in New York State.

Mr. Hewitt devoted much careful research among various docu-
ments to ascertain, if possible, the symbolic significance of white
and purple wampum beads, respectively, and also when these are
mixed in definite proportions and arrangement on strings or belts;
but much reading of documents which might bear on the question
was comparatively barren of any satisfactory results. He was led
to this study because, in modern time at least, strings of wampum
function and have functioned quite prominently in the public trans-
actions of the Council of the League of the Iroquois. Wampum
strings are an essential accompaniment in the use of the ritual of
the Requickening Address of the Council of Condolence and Instal-
lation of the League.

Mr. Hewitt also transliterated an Ottawa mythic text from the
common missionary alphabet into that of the Powell phonetic system
designed for the use of collaborators of the bureau.

He also typed in native Mohawk text the chanted ritual, the

Eulogy of the Founders of the League, as intoned by the Father
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Tribal Sisterhood, incorporating therein such revisional additions,
textual and grammatic, as had been found necessary by extensive
field studies. Mr. Hewitt also typed in native Onondaga text this
ritual in the form in which it is intoned by the Mother Tribal Sister-
hood; these two versions of the eulogy differ chiefly in the introduc-
tory paragraphs and also in the terms or forms of address. Mr.
Hewitt continued to represent the Bureau of American Ethnology,
Smithsonian Institution, on the United States Geographic Board,
and as a member also of its executive committee.

On the afternoon of May 7, 1930, Mr. Hewitt left Washington
on field duty, returning to the bureau July 1. During this trip
he visited the Grand River Reservation of the Six Nations of In-
dians near Brantford, Canada, the Tuscarora Reservation near Ni-
agara Falls, N. Y., and the Onondaga Reservation near Syracuse,
N. Y. Largely through his own knowledge of the several Iroquois
languages, he was able to recover the hitherto lost meanings of sev-
eral passages in the texts relating to the league. These recoveries
now make the entire structure of the League of the Iroquois clear
and consistent.

During the fiscal year Dr. Francis LaF lesche, ethnologist, read
the proof of his paper “The Osage Tribe: Rite of the Wa-xo-be,”
which will be published in the forty-fifth annual report of the
bureau. At the time of Doctor LaF lesche’s retirement, December
26, 1929, he had nearly completed an Osage dictionary upon which
he had been working for several years.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

The music of 10 tribes of Indians has been studied during the
past year by Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the bureau,
in continuance of her research on this subject. These tribes are the
Acoma, Menominee, Winnebago, Yuma, Cocopa, Mohave, Yaqui,
Makah, Clayoquot, and Quileute. The first tribe given considera-
tion was the Acoma, the work consisting in a completion of the
study of records made in Washington by Philip Sanche. These |
records were made for the chief of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology. Thirteen were transcribed as representative of the series.
An outstanding peculiarity of these songs is a gradual raising or
lowering of the pitch during a performance. In some instances
the pitch was changed a semitone, in others a tone and a half, and
one example contained a rise of a whole tone during one minute of
singing. This was regarded as a mannerism and. the song was
transcribed on the pitch maintained for the longest time.

The work on Yuman and Yaqui music consisted in the retyping of
almost all the text on these tribes, made necessary by the combining
—S=-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

of individual manuscripts into a book. ‘The analysis of each song
was ‘scrutinized and several songs previously classed as “irregular
in tonality” were otherwise classified. The preparation for publi-
cation of a book on Menominee music has been practically com-
pleted. The manuscript contains 460 pages, with transcriptions of
140 songs, and a large number of illustrations. The material col-
lected at Neah Bay, Wash., and submitted in the form of 13 manu-
scripts during previous years, has been unified under chapter
headings and retyped for publication. Interesting features of these
songs are the prominence of the tetrachord and the large number of
songs with a compass of three or four tones.

In July and August, 1929, a field trip was made to the Menominee
and Winnebago in Wisconsin, the former tribe receiving the more
consideration. This was the third visit to the Menominee and work
was done at Keshena, Neopit, and Zoar. In June, 1930, another trip
was made to the Winnebago in Wisconsin, this being the fourth visit
to that tribe. Songs were recorded in the vicinity of Tomah and
also near Wisconsin Rapids. One of the singers at the former
locality was Paul Decora, whose home is in Nebraska. Fourteen
songs were recorded by this singer and found to contain the same
changes of pitch which marked the performance of the Acoma
singer. In some songs the pitch was steadily maintained, while in
others it was gradually raised or lowered a semitone during the first
rendition, the remainder of the performance being on the new pitch.

John Smoke is an industrious Winnebago farmer, who retains a
“water-spirit bundle” inherited from his ancestors and uses it in
a ceremonial manner. He allowed Miss Densmore to see this bundle,
explained its use and benefits, and recorded two of its songs which
are sung when its contents are exposed to view. A Winnebago flute
player known as Frisk Cloud recorded three melodies on a flute
made of metal pipe, and said “the love songs are words put to flute
melodies.” He is also a maker of flutes and described the measure-
ments of an instrument in terms of hand and finger widths and
hand spreads. Miss Densmore purchased the instrument on which
the melodies had been played.

Winnebago songs and another flute performance were recorded
by George Monegar, a blind man living near Wisconsin Rapids, who
is considered one of the best’ authorities on old customs. He also
related the legend of the origin of the flute.

Songs of 10 classes were recorded on this trip, with old and mod-
ern examples of one class. The recorded songs comprise those of
the water-spirit bundle, hand game, and moccasin game, love songs,
war songs, and a lullaby, and songs of the Green Corn, Friendship,
Fortynine, and Squaw dances.
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

At the suggestion of Senator Carl Hayden, Mr. Neil M. Judd,
curator of archeology in the United States National Museum, made
a brief reconnaissance in September, 1929, for the purpose of ascer-
taining the most practicable method of surveying, at this late date,
the prehistoric canal systems of the Gila and Salt River Valleys,
Ariz. Most of the ancient canals had been obliterated through agri-
cultural practices; others were threatened with early destruction
under the program of the Coolidge Dam project. Following his
preliminary investigation, he recommended an aerial survey as the
only feasible means whereby the former aboriginal canal systems
could be located and mapped for permanent record.

Since haste was a prime factor, in view of the extensive grading
operations within the Pima Indian Reservation, the War Depart-
ment generously came to the aid of the Smithsonian Institution by
providing an observation plane and personnel. Mr. Judd left Wash-
ington January 12, 1930, and proceeded to Phoenix, Ariz., by way
of Tucson and Sacaton. Unfavorable flying conditions served to
delay inauguration of the survey. Ground haze in the early morn-
ing and smoke in the afternoon obscured the ground except for a
2-hour period at mid-day. Lieut. Edwin Bobzien, pilot, and Sergt.
R. A. Stockwell, photographer, both from Crissy Field, the Presidio,
San Francisco, pursued their assigned tasks as rapidly as possible.
They made approximately 700 exposures, of which half were vertical
photographs taken from an altitude of 10,000 feet. These have
since been assembled into mosaic maps. As was anticipated, the
aerial survey disclosed numerous prehistoric canals not visible from
the ground. With the mosaic maps in hand these ancient canals
must now be examined individually and their locations identified
with reference to nearby section lines. This task properly should
be done during the late autumn or winter months and within the next
few years.

Without the personal interest of Senator Hayden and the cooper-
ation of the War Department, the Smithsonian Institution would
have found it impossible to undertake the aerial survey above
mentioned.

In late November, 1929, and again in early May, 1930, Mr. Judd
made brief visits to Charlottesville, Va., there to advise with Mr.
J). I. Bushnell, jr., in those investigations of nearby Indian village
sites he is pursuing in behalf of the bureau.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editing of the publications of the bureau was continued

LIBRARY

The reference library has continued under the care of Miss Ella
Leary, librarian, assisted by Mr. Thomas Blackwell.

The library consists of 29,071 volumes, about 16,527 pamphlets,
and several thousand unbound periodicals. During the year 559
books were accessioned, of which 109 were acquired by purchase
and 450 by gift and exchange; also 150 pamphlets, and 4,106 serials,
chiefly the publications of learned societies, were received and re-
corded, of which 110 were obtained by purchase, the remainder being
received through exchange. The catalogue was increased by the
addition of 3,420 cards. Volumes to the number of 210 were collated
and prepared for binding. Numerous loans were made to libraries in
Washington, and a considerable amount of reference work was done
in the usual course of the library’s service to investigators and stu-
dents, both those in the Smithsonian Institution and others. The
purchase of books and periodicals for the library has been restricted
to such as relate to the bureau’s researches,

Many volumes received by the library not pertaining to anthro-
pology were transferred to the library of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. During the year the cataloguing has been carried on as new
accessions were acquired and good progress was made in cataloguing
ethnologic and related articles in the earlier serials. The number
of books borrowed from the Library of Congress for the use of the
staff of the bureau in prosecuting their researches was about 150.

rapher, was engaged in completing the catalogue of phonograph
records of Indian music, copying manuscripts for Doctor Swanton
and in assisting Mr. Hewitt in his work as custodian of manuscripts
and phonograph records. Mrs. Frances 8. Nichols assisted the
editor.

During the course of the year information was furnished by mem-
bers of the staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the North
American Indian peoples, both past and present, and the Mexican
peoples of the prehistoric and early historic periods to the south.
Various specimens sent to the bureau were identified and data on
them furnished for their owners.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
operations of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1930:

For the support of the system of International Exchanges Con-
gress appropriated $51,297, an increase of $942 over the amount
granted for the preceding year. This extra amount was requested
to cover the added cost for freight due to the increase in the weight
of shipments sent abroad. The repayments from governmental and
other establishments aggregated $5,050.30, making the total resources
available for carrying on the Exchange Service during 1930,
$56,347.30.

The total number of packages received both from domestic and
foreign sources for distribution through the service was 694,665,
an increase over the previous year of 74,180, or about 12 per cent.
The weight of these packages was 708,094 pounds, a gain of 86,721
pounds, or nearly 14 per cent. ‘These increases are quite out of
the ordinary, especially when it is considered that the gain in
packages during the preceding year was one of the largest in the
history of the service.

The publications sent and received by the Exchange Service are
classified as parliamentary documents, departmental documents, and
miscellaneous scientific and literary publications. The term “ Par-
lhamentary documents,” as here used, refers to publications set aside
by law for exchange with foreign governments, and includes not
only documents printed by order of either House of Congress, but
those issued by any department, bureau, or commission of the
Government not of a confidential nature. The returns for these
publications are deposited in the Library of Congress. The term
“Departmental documents” embraces all of the publications de-
livered at the Institution from the various Government departments,
bureaus, or commissions, for distribution to correspondents abroad
from whom they desire to obtain similar publications in exchange.
The “ Miscellaneous scientific and literary publications” are re-
ceived chiefly from learned societies, universities, colleges, scientific
organizations, and museums. The number and weight of packages
coming under these different headings are as follows:

It will be seen from the foregoing table that 74 per cent of the
work of the office has been conducted in behalf of the United States
governmental establishments.

There were shipped abroad during the year 3,235 boxes, being an
increase of 412 (14.6 per cent) over the number for the preceding
12 months. This is the largest number of boxes forwarded abroad
through the service in one year. These boxes measured a total of
17,034 cubic feet. Seven hundred and eighty-five of the boxes con-
tained full sets of United States official documents for authorized
depositories and the remainder (2,450) were filled with departmental
and other publications for depositories of partial sets and for miscel-
laneous correspondents. ‘The number of boxes sent to each country

In addition to the packages forwarded abroad in boxes, 67,945—
an increase over last year of 7,089—-were sent to their destinations
direct by mail. About one-third of these packages contained copies
of the daily issue of the Congressional Record, which, under treaty
stipulations and by authority of Congress, are mailed directly to
the depositories immediately upon publication. The remainder of
the packages were partly for remote places which could not be
reached through existing agencies and partly for countries for which
the accumulations were so small at the scheduled forwarding dates
that it was more economical to send them by mail than by freight.

Almost since the establishment of the Smithsonian system of ex-
changes in 1850, consignments received from abroad have, at the
request of the Institution, been addressed in care of the collector of
customs at the port of New York, consignments so addressed being
admitted duty free and without examination. Up to July 1, 1923,
an official of the United States customhouse attended to the entry
and transmission to Washington of shipments arriving at the port
of New York for the Smithsonian Institution. On that date the
coordinator of the second area assumed charge of the handling of all
shipments for the Institution, both incoming and outgoing. How-
ever, as the foreign agencies had for so many years been accustomed
to addressing boxes to the Institution in care of the Collector of
Customs, no change in that regard was made until shortly before the
close of the current fiscal year, when the various foreign exchange
bureaus were requested to address all future shipments to the Insti-
tution as follows:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C.
Care Coordinator, Second Area,
Customhouse, New York City, U. S. A.

During the year nine boxes of exchanges from Germany were de-
stroyed when the steamship Mtinchen sunk while unloading at her
pier in New York, the sinking of the vessel having been caused by an
explosion which resulted in a fire. These boxes contained publica-
tions for distribution to various addresses in the United States and
German patent specifications for the United States Patent Office,
Boston Public Library, Chicago Public Library, and St. Louis Pub-
lic Library. An effort is being made to obtain duplicate copies of
the lost publications.

As an example of the use made of the facilities of the International
Exchange Service other than in transporting packages, reference is
made to a request from Adelbert College Library, Cleveland, Ohio,
for information concerning the Bulletin of Works published by the
Station of Aquiculture and Fisheries of Castiglione, a communica-
tion regarding the matter addressed to the station itself by the
~

library not having received attention. Full information was obtained
by this office through the French Exchange Bureau, and in the
library’s letter of acknowledgment to the Institution it is stated that
“the information, which had been impossible for us to obtain, is
just what we need.”

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

A convention for the international exchange of official documents
and scientific and literary publications was concluded at Brussels
March 15, 1886, between the United States and certain other coun-
tries. In accordance with the terms of that convention and under
authority of resolutions of Congress setting apart a certain number
of documents for exchange with foreign governments, there now
are sent regularly to depositories abroad 62 full sets of United States
official publications and 47 partial sets, an increase of four sets dur-
ing the year. China, Assam, Bihar and Orissa, Central Provinces,
and the Punjab were added to the list of those countries receiving
partial sets, and the set sent to Lourengo Marquez was discontinued.

The depository in Austria has been changed from the Bundesamt
fiir Statistik to the Bundeskanzleramt, Herrengasse 23, Vienna I;
the one in Bolivia from the Ministerio de Colonizacién y Agricultura
to the Biblioteca del H. Congreso Nacional, La Paz; the one in
Hesse, Germany, from the Landesbibliothek, Darmstadt, to the
Universitiits-Bibliothek, Giessen; and the one in Honduras from the

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL

In 1909 Congress, in order to more fully carry into effect the
provisions of the exchange convention concluded at Brussels in 1886,
passed a resolution setting aside a certain number of copies of the
daily issue of the Congressional Record for exchange, through the
Smithsonian Institution, with such foreign governments as may
agree to send to the United States current copies of their parliamen-
tary record or like publication, the returns to be deposited in the
Library of Congress. Since the passage of that resolution many
countries have entered into this exchange, 102 copies of the Record
now being sent abroad, one new depository—Colonial Secretary,
Belize, British Honduras—having been added during the year.

The depositories of the Record in San José, Costa Rica; Port-au-
Prince, Haiti; and Belgrade, Yugoslavia, have been discontinued
and the following have been added: “A Federagao,” Porto Alegre,
Brazil; Ufficio degli Studi Legislativi, Rome, Italy; Library of the
Persian Parliament, Teheran, Persia. [The depository in Madrid,
Spain has been changed to Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional.

A complete list of the States taking part in this immediate ex-
change, together with the names of the establishments to whom the
Record is mailed, is given below:

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper-
ations of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1930:

The regular appropriation made by Congress for the maintenance
of the park was $203,000, an increase of $7,450 over 1929. In addi-
tion an appropriation of $220,000 was provided for the construction
of a reptile house. The completion of this building has been made
possible by the addition of $28,000 to the regular 1931 appropria-
tion. The first deficiency act provided $2,000 for the construction of
a gate to close at night a new road leading into the south portion of
the park by Rock Creek.

On February 8, 1930, the Zoo suffered a severe loss in the death of
Mr. A. B. Baker, who for more than 39 years had been assistant di-
rector. To Mr. Baker’s great loyalty as well as his profound knowl-
edge of zoological park management is due to a large extent the de-
velopment of the National Zoological Park. His death takes away
not only a good friend but a most valued official. He was succeeded
by Mr. Ernest P. Walker, formerly senior biologist of the Biological
Survey, who had recently been engaged in the game and bird
reservation work conducted by that bureau.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts ——The collection this year has been greatly benefited by
gifts, some of them of rare and unusual specimens obtained on ex-
peditions.

Dr. Paul Bartsch brought home with him from South America
and the West Indies 6 iguanas, 10 South American tortoises, and
50 hermit crabs.

Mr. Fred Carnochan, of New York, returned from East Africa
with a rare white-thighed colobus, a Schwineforth chimpanzee, and
a Killimbira guenon. This last was obtained from M. de Frey-
gang of Urundi, and is the first of its kind to be exhibited in the
United States.

Mr. Stephen Haweis brought from Dominica four giant toads and
half a dozen large edible frogs of this island, locally called ‘“ moun-
tain chickens.”

84
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85

Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, who accompanied the
astronomical expedition to the Philippines, returned with a large
shipment of snakes, lizards, birds, and small mammals.

Mr. W. M. Perrygo of the United States National Museum, on an
expedition to Haiti, secured a large collection, of which six rhinoceros
iguanas and two Haitian boas were the most interesting to the Zoo,
though some of the small snakes that he collected may prove to be
new species.

Hon. Gifford Pinchot, who cruised the Pacific on a notable expedi-
tion, brought home with him for the National Zoological Park a
specimen of the almost extinct Duncan Island tortoise, a Hood
Island tortoise, four Albemarle tortoises, and three land iguanas, all
from the Galapagos. These are very important additions and make
the collection of giant tortoises one of the finest.

Through Theodore Roosevelt, jr., Harold S. Coolidge, jr., and
Ralph Wheeler, of the Kelly-Roosevelt expedition, were presented
a trio of white-faced gibbons, father, mother, and child, all magnifi-
cent specimens; a rare Bay Bamboo rat; a sun bear; a Himalayan
bear; as well as several smaller specimens.

Mr. Foster H. Benjamin of the United States Department of Agri-
culture, who has been engaged in field work in connection with
the extermination of the fruit fly in Florida, has kept a constant
lookout for reptiles, and through him there has been obtained a
notable collection of Florida species, including many desirable
specimens.

Mr. O. Hallson, Bethel, Alaska, through the Alaska Game Com-
mission and the United States Biological Survey, sent three pairs of
the rare Emperor goose, and Mr. E. R. Kalmbach of the United States
Biological Survey secured on a western trip a aw asus of 31 assorted
birds, including 5 Caspian terns.

The United Fruit Co., through Mr. Samuel Kress of Costa Rica,
has continued its interest and presented a fine pair of Costa Rican
deer, a collared peccary, and an Imperial boa.

Through the Walter P. Chrysler fund was purchased a specimen
of the very rare saddle-bill stork of West Africa, one of the most
striking of living birds. This bird was captured by the Viennese
explorer Weidholz, and was acclimatized in Vienna and afterwards
in Nice.

cured in Dominica through Mr. Stephan Haweis.

A pigmy hippopotamus was bought as a mate to the one already
in the collection, and a male Molucca deer was also bought for the
same purpose. The zoo purchased a pair of sea lions to replace
those that died last year; a pair of jaguars, which have been lacking
in our collection; and a black jaguar. The last is the third of its
kind to come to the United States, and is an exceedingly rare and
beautiful specimen.

Important animals received in exchange during the year were a
pair of Molucca deer, and two pairs of axis deer, three keas, and a
rare wallaroo.

REMOVALS

The most serious loss to the collection was that of old Mom, the
female hippopotamus, who had been at the Park for 19 years, and
during that time had given birth to seven young, five of which were
raised.

Causes of death—When it has been thought that determination of
the cause of death of certain animals might be useful, the specimens
have been submitted to the Pathological Division of the Bureau of
Animal Industry for examination. The following list shows the
results of the autopsies:

MAMMALS

Carnivora: Hemorrhagic septicemia, 1; chronic pneumonia, 1.

Pinnipedia: Gastritis, 1.

Primates: Intestinal parasites, 1.

Ungulata: Gastroenteritis, 3; pneumonia, 1; internal hemorrhage, 1; bilateral

Even casual observation of the cars parked in the zoo gives a fair
cross section of the visiting public, but many of the local cars visit-
ing the zoo from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia
carry visitors from distant States and from remote parts of the
world.

The National Zoological Park serves a higher and more important
function than that which is most commonly attributed to it. In ad-
dition to being a place for recreation and entertainment, it is an
important and unique educational institution. It is unique in that it
is a place of study for all ages and degrees of scholarship, from the
young child to the veteran naturalist and research man.

Its accumulated data on animals handled over a period of 40 years
are constantly referred to. Facts learned regarding animals in the
zoo often have a very practical application in other fields of activity.

The beginner in zoology gains at the zoo a grasp of the differences
and likenesses between animals, while he rubs shoulders with the
advanced medical man studying the primates to help him in solving
problems concerned with the health of mankind. The study of para-
sites and diseases of wild animals in the zoo assists students of para-
sites and diseases of man and domestic animals in their researches.
In short, the National Zoological Park as a laboratory is probably of
even greater value to the American people than it is as a recreational
area.

IMPROVEMENTS

A contract was let for the construction of the reptile house, and the
work was started in March, 1930. This building promises to be one
of the finest of its kind in the world. It will allow the zoo for the
first time in its history to maintain a collection of cold-blooded verte-
brates as well as certain invertebrates.

—L———
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 101

During the year many minor improvements have been made in
connection with usual maintenance operations. A new type of label
is being tried out, and the less legible of the older type are being
replaced as rapidly as possible by the new style.

The American waterfowl pond was cleaned by hydraulicking,
which restored it to a very satisfactory condition.

The destruction of the old bird house may be considered one of the
greatest improvements the park has made in years, but it greatly
reduced the housing facilities and no attempt at all has been made
to obtain quantities of specimens of the smaller birds and mammals
even to replace those lost during the year. There being no empty
cages to fill, the zoo has been able to pick and choose in making pur-
chases, so that at the present time the collection contains a great
number of interesting rarities, including a number of species unique
in American collections.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

Quarters for animals remain the most urgent need of the park.
The greatest need is for a house in which can be displayed repre-
sentatives of the large and very interesting group of small mammals.
The need for such a house has previously been emphasized.

The National Zoological Park is second to none in natural beauty,
and its building program is planned to conserve this by means of
constructing a few large, capacious exhibition buildings instead of
more numerous small ones, each of the new buildings to house several
groups of animals.

Hence, in the small-mammal house it is proposed to provide quar-
ters also for the great apes. ‘The park has an excellent collection
of these, but they are now housed in such small cages that they do
not appear to the best advantage and can be seen by comparatively
few people at one time.

The fire department of Washington has investigated the fire-pre-
vention facilities in the park and finds that the fire hazards are very
great on account of inadequate water mains and equipment. Expan-
sion of the water system is therefore very urgently needed as a
protection against fire and at the same time to augment the park’s
inadequate regular supply.

It is now 40 years since the park was established. Much of the
woodwork and ironwork in buildings and enclosures constructed in
the earlier days, and even comparatively recently, has deteriorated
from natural causes and from the unusual conditions present in the
zoo, so that we are now confronted with an early and necessary
program of replacement. One pair of boilers now 51 years old in
the central heating plant have been passed by the boiler inspectors

28095—31——8
102. =aANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

for only 60 pounds of steam for the present winter, and must be
replaced at a very early date. The entire floor in the hon house has
been given added support from beneath from time to time, but decay
has progressed to such an extent that it is now almost beyond repair
and must be replaced in the near future.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1930:

PLANT AND OBJECTS

This observatory operates regularly the central station at Wash-
ington and two field stations for observing solar radiation on Table
Mountain, Calif., and Mount Montezuma, Chile. The station at
Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa, which was established by
the National Geographic Society, is being continued for the present
in cooperation with the Astrophysical Observatory with funds donated
by a friend of the Institution. In addition, the observatory controls
a station on Mount Wilson, Calif., where occasional expeditions are
sent for special investigations.

The principal aim of the observatory is the exact measurement of
the intensity of the radiation of the sun as it is at mean solar distance
outside the earth’s atmosphere. This is ordinarily called the solar
constant of radiation, but the observations of past years by this ob-
servatory have proved it variable. As all life, as well as the weather,
depends on solar radiation, the observatory has undertaken the con-
tinued measurement of solar variation on all available days. These
measurements have now continued all the year round for 11 years.
As will appear in this report, recent studies indicate that the perma-
nent continuation of these daily solar-radiation measurements may
have great value for weather forecasting. In addition to this princi-
' pal object, the observatory undertakes spectroscopic researches on
radiation and absorption of atmospheric constituents, radiation of
special substances such as water vapor, ozone, carbonic-acid gas,
liquid water, and others, and the radiation of the other stars as well
as of the sun.

WORK AT WASHINGTON

Continuous series of solar observations having been made as
hitherto at several field stations on desert mountains in distant lands,
these observations have been critically studied and prepared for pub-
lication at Washington. Several new investigations based on these
observations have been made during the year.

103
104 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

(a) Reduction of observations—The observers in the field at
Montezuma, Chile, completely reduce their measurements according
to a definitive system adopted several years ago. Telegrams in code
arriving daily from Montezuma are decoded and furnished about 24
hours after observing to the United States Weather Bureau, which
publishes the solar constant values on the Washington daily weather
map. It is planned to include these results also in a broadcast of
miscellaneous geophysical data to begin in July, 1930, under the
auspices of Science Service.

The variations of solar radiation seldom range beyond 3 per cent,
yet, as will appear below, they seem to produce important weather
changes even when as small as 0.5 per cent. It is only at high-altitude
stations under very tranquil sky conditions that results of sufficient
accuracy to display these small solar variations are to be obtained.
Although visibly excellent, our station at Table Mountain, Calif.
(longitude 117° 41’ W., latitude 34° 22’ N., altitude 7,500 feet), as
yet fails to give results of equal consistency to those of the station
of Montezuma. A thorough rereduction of all the Table Mountain
observations, 1925 to 1930, has been completed, with great labor,
during the past fiscal year. But it is disappointing. Fluctuations
too evidently produced by the haziness or humidity of the atmosphere
still are found occasionally in magnitudes of the order of 2 per cent.
Accordingly, a new method of reduction designed to more effectively
allow for these atmospheric changes was being developed at the close
of the period covered by this report. Preliminary results by it seemed
more promising. Reduction of Mount Brukkaros observations 1s
being postponed until the success of this new method is tested for
Table Mountain.

(b) Atmospheric ozone—As stated in last year’s report, one
troublesome feature of the Table Mountain work has but lately
come to light through the studies of Fowle and of Dobson. It ap-
pears that a variation of large percentage occurs in the quantity of
atmospheric ozone prevailing at very high levels above Table Moun- -
tain. Fortunately only about one-fifth as much change of ozone
occurs above Montezuma. The change occurring above Table Moun-
tain is sufficient, if uncorrected for, to introduce nearly 1 per cent
change in the results on the solar constant of radiation, but the
corresponding effect at Montezuma is negligible.

We were not aware of this source of error when the Table Moun-
tain station was first occupied. It was not until several years after
the work began that we introduced there Dobson’s method of meas-
uring ozone. Hence, if ozone corrections to solar constant values
were to be made from 1925 on, daily, and not merely by averages,
as suggested in last year’s report, it became necessary to discover a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 105

method whereby the correction could be computed from our daily
colar constant observation themselves. This has been done.

Figure 1 shows a portion of the solar energy curve observed at
airmass 2.0. The ozone absorption occurs between places 20 and 26
of this curve, but is barely, if at all, visually discernible thereon,
even when ozone is most prevalent. However, its effects can be
made both discernible and measurable by the following simple pro-
cedure. If we take half a dozen of the best days observed in autumn,
when the ozone is near its minimum amount, and compute the mean
values of the heights of the energy curve in the blue, green, yellow,
and red we obtain thereby standard values proportional to the dis-

Ficuke 1.—Solar energy curve in the region of absorption by atmospheric ozone

tribution of energy in this region. These standard values, as thus
extended from the violet of the spectrum to the red, overlap at
each end the ozone region. Next consider the observations of the
heights of the energy curve at these selected places on any given day
of observation. We divide them by the standard values just referred
to and the result is a series of ratios, near unity, but tending some-
times to be lower in the violet than in the red, or vice versa. If
plotted against the spectrum place-numbers, these ratios may lie
nearly in straight lines. But if the ozone content of the atmosphere
on the day examined is different, being larger or smaller, than that
of the average of the standard days, then the ratio plot just described
presents a loop below or above that straight line which is fixed by
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

the unaffected spectrum regions in the violet and the red. These
facts are illustrated in Figure 2.

The deviation from the straight-line plots of these energy spectrum
ratios becomes, then, a measure of the ozone contents of the higher

FigurB 2.—Graph for measuring absorption by atmospheric ozone

atmosphere. The results have been so reduced by us as to give the
percentage corrections for ozone absorption to be appled to our
solar-constant values on all days of observation at Table Mountain.
These corrections apply only to the so-called “short method” of
observation. The long method takes cognizance of the ozone absorp-
tion in another way.

By the generosity of a friend of the Institution we are preparing
to send an expedition to Table Mountain in September, 1930, to

FiGuRE 3.—Variations of solar radiation since 1924

make solar observations there through definite known amounts of
ozone, so as independently to standardize this new ozone method.
The method is applicable on all days when solar radiation work has
ever been done.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 107

(c) Solar variation and temperature changes.—Obviously the
weather depends on the sun. If the sun’s emission of radiation
varies, then the weather must change in some measure on that ac-
count. Having six consecutive years of daily observations of solar
variation, made and reduced in the most exact way at Montezuma,
the variations have been compared with temperature changes in
Washington, Williston, and Yuma.

Figure 8 shows the solar radiation measurements at Montezuma
since 1924. Satisfactory, nearly satisfactory, and unsatisfactory ob-
servations are indicated thereon by circles, crosses, and points, re-
spectively. In passing, I draw attention to the facts that the results

Figure 4.—Solar changes and associated temperature changes at Washington

average higher in 1924 and 1925 than in 1929, but return to higher
values during the summer of 1930. Also the years 1924, 1926, and
1928, are more affected by long range variations than 1925, 1927, and
1929. This fact tends to verify the 2-year period of solar variation
to which I drew attention in last year’s report.

What I now particularly note are the numerous cases of sequences
of ascending and descending solar radiation values, occupying about
4 days per sequence. ‘These are indicated by curved full and dotted
lines respectively in Figure 3. There are 98 cases of ascending and
91 cases of descending sequences thus indicated. If it had been pos-
sible to observe on all days, there would probably have been nearly
twice as many such sequences. I have omitted cases where the
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

change was less than 0.4 per cent in the solar constant value, and also
have omitted cases depending on isolated or unsatisfactory values.

Corresponding to each of these 189 cases I have tabulated the mean
temperature of Washington, Williston, and Yuma, for a 9-day period,
of which the day of culmination of the solar change is the fifth or
central day. ‘Taking each month of the year by itself, I have com-
puted the average march of temperature over such 9-day intervals.
In illustration, I gave Tables 1 and 2, showing the Washington tem-
perature results of March, and Figure 4, which shows, at A, B, C,
and D, the mean values for March, May, July, and October. There
is given at E the average changes of solar radiation values corre-
sponding thereto.

There are several reversals of sign of the average temperature
effects during the year. In Figure 5, I give a study of these changes

l'icurE 5.—Inversions of tepyperature dependence on solar variations

of sign at Washington. All the cases have been arranged in con-
secutive order of days throughout the year, irrespective of what
year they occurred. The 98 cases corresponding to ascending se-
quences are given in Diagram F, and those corresponding to descend-
ing sequences in Diagram G. The quantity which is plotted is the
difference of temperature between that of the day of culmination of
solar change and that of four days previous. To guide the eye as
to the prevailing trend of the results, a zigzag line connects the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 109

separate points. The area it includes over the line of zero depar-
tures is crosshatched. Obviously the Diagram F has a preponder-
ance of crosshatched area below the zero line, and the Diagram G
above. Yet in April, and from June to mid-November, these aspects
tend to reverse themselves in each diagram. To bring out this char-
acteristic more plainly, I give in each diagram curves made by
taking 5-case consecutive means. ‘That is, the mean is taken of cases
1 to 5,2 to 7,3 to 8,andsoon. As it seemed clear that such a curve
in Diagram G is nearly the reverse of that in Diagram F, I have
inverted the 5-day mean curve of G as the dotted curve in F. The
correlation coefficient between the full and dotted curves in F is
50+5 per cent.

Results are found for Yuma and Williston similar to those pre-
sented for Washington. Though the types of effect do not occur in
identical months at the three stations, the magnitudes and tendencies
are much the same.

ED ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

From all this I conclude:

1. An apparent influence of short-period solar variation appears
in the temperature of the United States.

2. Corresponding to 0.8 per cent change in the sun, there appear
to be temperature changes of the order of 5° F. at Washington.

3. The sign of the correlation changes during the year.

4. A high negative correlation is found between the temperature
effects corresponding respectively to rising and to falling solar
sequences.

5. The temperature effects coincide in date with the solar changes
which appear to induce them.

6. If the connection between solar change and temperature change
is a genuine one, it must operate by some indirect atmospheric mech-
anism; because if it were a direct effect its sign would not change
during the year.

7. Although complicated, the relation seems to offer promise for
weather forecasting nearly a week in advance. Yet the occasional
inversions of effect found inspire caution in a pronouncement of this
character. These apparent inversions are, however, doubtless caused
frequently by one solar change treading too quickly on the heels of
another. Again they may sometimes be caused by delayed receipt
from distant centers of action of waves of temperature effect arising
from former solar changes.

The results thus far are tentative. It is proposed to study baro-
metric pressures as well as temperatures and to extend the investiga-
tion to other parts of the United States and of the world. Prelim-
inary studies have been made, too, of 10-day mean values of solar
radiation and temperature, and we hope that in this way, if reliable
weather-forecasting data are really secured, they may be extended to
months and seasons in advance.

FIELD STATIONS

Observations of the solar radiation have been continued whenever
weather conditions would permit at Table Mountain, Calif., at
Mount Montezuma, Chile, and at Mount Brukkaros, South West
Africa. All three stations continue to report measurements as made
on three-quarters of the days of the year or more. However, not all
of these observations prove satisfactory, so that 60 per cent is a bet-
ter estimate of available observation days for these selected high-
level desert stations.

A strange and serious accident occurred in December on Mount
Brukkaros. It will be recalled that for the sake of uniformity of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 113

temperature conditions our observatories are in the form either of
tunnels in solid rock or cemented chambers under ground. In a hard
thundershower on January 24, 1930, the interior of the tunnel in
the mountain face was struck by lightning, and the bolometer, the
resistance box, and other parts of the electric circuit were burned
out. Fortunately a second bolometer and some other spare parts
were in stock, so that the observer, Mr. Sordahl, by diligence and
clever adaptations, was able to restore the circuits so as to recom-
mence observing with the loss of only four days.

Mrs. Sordahl is keeping an interesting daily journal of events,
and, having zoological training, is also making a valuable collection
of the fauna and flora of the Mount Brukkaros region for the
United States National Museum.

PERSON NEL

At Washington, Dr. C. G. Abbot continues as director. Finding
himself unable to give sufficiently continuous attention to the work,
he appointed Mr. L. B. Aldrich to be assistant director, beginning
May 19, 1930; F. E. Fowle, research assistant; W. H. Hoover, asso-
ciate research assistant (detailed to the Division of Radiation and
Organisms) ; Mr. A. Kramer, instrument maker; Mrs, A. M. Bond,
statistical assistant, reinstated October 16, 1929, vice Miss M. Mars-
den, resigned October 10, 1929; Mrs. M. D. (Denoyer) Johnson, com-
puter; Mr. W. Oliver Grant, assistant computer.

In the field: Mr. A. F. Moore, field director, Table Mountain,
Calif.; Mr. F. A. Greeley, bolometric assistant, Table Mountain,
Calif.; Mr. H. H. Zodtner, field director, Montezuma, Chile; Mr.
C. P. Butler, bolometric assistant, Montezuma, Chile; Mr. L. O.
Sordahl, field director, Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa; Mr.
A. G. Froiland, bolometric assistant, Mount Brukkaros, South
West Africa.

SUMMARY

This year has been notable for both disappointment and achieve-
ment. Disappointment—because the high hopes of satisfactory ac-
curacy raised by preliminary results of reduction of observations at
Table Mountain proved to some extent illusory, and have given place
to tests of new methods designed to remove more effectually atmos-
pheric sources of error. Achievement—in the invention of a new
method of determining the amount of atmospheric ozone, applicable
on every day in which solar radiation observations have been made;
in the discovery of the apparently large and exceptionally important
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

influence exercised by small short-interval solar variations on ter-
restrial temperatures; and for the continuation under favorable
auspices of observing at the station on Mount Brukkaros, South
West Africa.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 8

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND
ORGANISMS

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of progress
made by the new Division of Radiation and Organisms during its
first year of existence.

The purpose of the division is to undertake those investigations
dealing with radiation bearing directly, or indirectly, upon biological
problems. The central idea in the development of the division is
to build up an especially strong spectrophotometric laboratory, with
a staff of experienced physicists and technicians to work cooper-
atively with men of biological training. Problems undertaken fall
into two classes:

1. Direct investigations upon living organisms.

2. Fundamental molecular structure and photochemical investigations re-
lated to the biological problems.

Briefly, the following developments have taken place. Basement
space in the Smithsonian Building, previously used for storage, has
been reconstructed into a modern physical, chemical, and biological
laboratory. Equipment has been purchased, and the laboratory
appointed. Offices have been furnished and developed in the north
tower. A small staff of investigators, of highly specialized training
in the various allied fields, has been assembled. Plans have been
made, and equipment partially developed for growth of plants
under controlled conditions. A preliminary experiment upon the
phototropic bending of plants has been carried to completion with
interesting results. Equipment has been assembled for a more ex-
tensive experiment in this field. In cooperation with the Fixed
Nitrogen Laboratory, the near infrared investigation of the halogen
derivatives of benzene has been completed.

Arrangements for cooperation with the Department of Agricul-
ture, in carrying out an experiment on the effect of light upon the
rooting of Citrus cuttings and the growth of palms, have been con-
summated. In cooperation with the Research Corporation, staff and
shop have been provided for instrumental development.

116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930
DEVELOPMENT OF LABORATORY

The initial drafting of plans for the development of the space
assigned to the division was begun May 1, 1929. By July 1, the
actual work of reconstruction, transforming the empty basement into
a laboratory, was under way. Room No. 18, the largest of the three
rooms originally assigned, some 60 feet long by 20 feet wide, was
planned to accommodate the main plant experiments and spectro-
scopic work in the visible region. Three small constant temperature
rooms were divided off for photometric and phototropic measure-
ments, and control instruments. Provision was made for experi-
ments dealing with the growth of plants under controlled conditions
in one end of the long laboratory space remaining. The other end
was arranged for the spectroscopic study of the sources of light
required in these experiments. Room No. 17, one of the two smaller
rooms, was subdivided into two parts, the larger portion, some 16 by
16 feet, was equipped with soapstone sinks, hood, furnace, still, etc.,
for a chemical laboratory. This is required for the preparation of
nutrient solutions which replace the soil in the growth of plants, for
dessicating and weighing the plants, for the incidental chemical
phases of other experiments, and later, for the photochemical experi-
ments which may be undertaken. The smaller part of room 17, about
9 by 16 feet, has been equipped for glass blowing and related technical
construction. Room 16, used prior to the completion of the space in
the tower as office and drafting room, was subsequently subdivided
into a large laboratory space and two small constant-temperature
rooms for infra-red work.

Throughout the laboratory, with the exception of the glass-blowing
room, the windows were provided with light-proof curtains, so that
the experiments could be carried out in the absence of daylight when
required. Plumbing and heavy electrical installations were made so
that service would be conveniently available for the experiments.
This service includes gas and air, 110 and 220 volts, both alternating
and direct current. Alternating current, not previously available in
the Smithsonian, was brought in by way of the Freer Building.
A special gas booster was installed to provide gas under sufficient
pressure for the glass blowing of large pyrex apparatus. A large
battery was installed, together with heavy leads for special constant-
light sources in the photometer room, and also in the infra-red
laboratory. All this general reconstruction, including carpentry,
masonry, electrical wiring, plumbing, and painting, as well as the
construction of special tables, was carried out either by, or under
the direction of, the Museum organization, to whom the division is
greatly indebted for the unusually fine laboratory resulting. The
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 117

extensive reconstruction of the laboratory space was finally completed
toward the end of February, 1930.

The detailed appointment and equipment of the laboratory proved
to be a tremendous undertaking, particularly so, because of the
border-line character of the proposed investigations. Although the
laboratory is not unusually large, provision had to be made for
physical, chemical, and biological fields of experimentation. By the
middle of July the volume of correspondence involved was such as
to require the whole time of a stenographer, thus leading to the
employment of Miss Stanley. Mr. Clark, who joined the staff
August 1, was of the greatest assistance in the selection of equipment,
because of his wide experience in technical fields. During the entire
year, a very large part of the director’s time was devoted to this
phase of the work.

INITIATION OF EXPERIMENTS

In spite of the construction work which was continuously in prog-
ress, steps were immediately taken toward beginning experimental
work.

PLANT GROWTH EXPERIMENTS

Arrangements were made with Maryland University for Doctor
Johnston, plant physiologist, to serve in consulting capacity, spending
three one-half days a week at the Smithsonian. In collaboration
with Doctor Johnston, plans were drawn up for a large pre-
conditioning chamber in which plants could be grown where the
individual plants would be under identical conditions, and, at the
same time, the humidity and temperature held at a definite point.
Plans were also drawn up for individual growth chambers to be
mounted in two groups of four. These small growth chambers were
to be water-cooled and gas-tight, so as to permit of the rigid control of
the atmospheric constituents, as well as temperature and humidity.
Windows were introduced for both lateral’ and overhead illumination.
The bases were equipped with adapters for gas-tight connection be-
tween the chamber and Mason jars for the nutrient solutions. As the
division had no shop facilities, beyond such work as could be carried
out as an accommodation through the courtesy of the National Mu-
seum and the Astrophysical Observatory, most of the construction
had to be arranged for with private concerns. With the growth cham-
bers themselves completed, the extensive development of apparatus
for supply and control had to be suspended in March, 1930, for lack
of funds. Near the end of the year, in anticipation of new funds on
July 1, orders were placed for manifold systems and other equipment
required in completing the first set of four chambers.

28095—31——-9
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

As artificial light, because of its possibility of rigid control, is used
to replace sunlight in most of these experiments, the problem of con-
struction of such special sources becomes a considerable part of the
undertaking. Because of his extensive experience in the commercial
construction of Neon lamps, as well as his unusual skill in glass blow-
ing, Mr. Clark was added to the staff. By October 1, his glass-
blowing laboratory was sufficiently complete to permit the commence-
ment of construction of high vacuum systems to be used in the evacu-
ation of special lamps and thermocouples. The constructive develop-
ment of these sources will, undoubtedly, be a matter of experimenta-
tion which will extend over several years.

PHOTOTROPIC EXPERIMENTS

As it was early realized that the construction of special growth
chambers would be an undertaking extending probably to two years,
and undoubtedly requiring more funds than were immediately avail-
able, another experiment dealing with the bending of plants in the
presence of light was undertaken. This experiment could be carried
out through the preliminary stages with equipment immediately at
hand. A long constant-temperature room, constructed out of a por-
tion of room No. 18, as has been mentioned, was ideally suited to this
purpose. Tor this phototropic experiment a special photometer box
was constructed. Two beams of light, originating at the extremities
of the box, played from opposite sides on a central plant. By the in-
troduction of water-cooled filters, these beams were restricted to a
narrow range of visible radiation, and provision was made for four
possible colors of light.

Even before the completion of the laboratory, actual observations
on the phototropic influence of different colors were being made.
It was found immediately that beams of equal intensity but different
color affected the bending of the plant in markedly different degree.
A thermocouple was provided so that by the galvanometer deflection
an accurate determination could be made of the relative intensities
of the two beams. By adjusting the beam whose color had the
lesser influence, its intensity could be increased until a balance was
secured against the weaker, but more potent radiation, so that the
plant would grow vertically without bending.

Early in the experiment it was realized that the most important
disturbing factor was the presence of small temperature fluctuations
in the air surrounding the oat sprout whose bending was being
observed. After many failures to remove this source of disturbance,
which vitiated many of the early observations, a scheme was devised
which overcame the difficulty. A double-walled cylindrical glass
shield was placed around the sprout, symmetrically, and maintained
in continual rotation. Thus, if one side were unevenly heated, its

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119

influence would be carried around so that it was felt equally from
all sides. Ultimately, this only proved completely effective when
the space between the double walls of glass was filled with water.

In order to determine the wave-length range transmitted by the
filters used in the phototropic experiment, spectrograms, secured
through the cooperation of the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory, were
taken. These showed the varying amounts of light transmitted by
the filter from an incandescent bulb of the type used in the experi-
ment. In order to interpret the spectrograms, a self-registering
microphotometer, previously secured by the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, was set up in one of the small constant-temperature rooms.
Curves were thus obtained, representing the relative transmission of
these filters for the various wave lengths, and so determining defi-
nitely the region of the spectrum, or colors, used.

Completion of this preliminary experiment in September of 1930,
yielded the following facts: First, that red, or infra-red light, pro-
duced no measurable effect; second, that yellow light of the type
used, produced a small, but measurable bending; third, that the green
light was one thousand times (+ or —2 per cent) more effective than
yellow; and finally, that blue light of the range used was thirty
times more effective than the green, or thirty thousand times more
effective than the yellow.

The outstanding points of interest resulting from the preliminary
experiments are two: First, the quantitative reproducibility of the
ratios obtained, that is, within 5 per cent of the magnitudes quoted;
second, the tremendous ratio observed between yellow and green,
together with rapid increase of the effect as one proceeds to shorter
wave lengths, tends to indicate a definite threshold wave length at
which the phototropic influence shows itself. This is typical of
photochemical reactions involving an electronic change of energy.
The conclusions drawn from this observation are of far-reaching
importance, as this constitutes crucial evidence against any theory
which seeks to explain phototropism as merely a thermal effect due
to unequal absorption of radiant energy.

The preliminary results of this experiment proved so interesting,
even at the early stages, that steps were immediately taken to prepare
for a more elaborate experiment. Mr. Hoover, returning from
extensive field experience with the Astrophysical Observatory, was
assigned to the work of the division in December, 1929. An ex-
perienced observer himself, much of the successful carrying out of
this phototropic experiment is due to his efforts.

The things which immediately suggest themselves as desirable
in a new experiment are, first: To use a narrower wave-length range,
or a purer color, in order to determine what wave lengths have a
particular effect, and second; to use a larger number of different
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

wave-length regions, or colors, to determine where in the spectrum
the phototropic influence begins as one proceeds to shorter wave
lengths that is, from red to blue. For this purpose suitable screens
are not available and one must, therefore, turn to a monochrometer.
Such a monochrometer would be used, on the one side, to furnish
all the different possible wave lengths or colors, while on the other, a
single standard comparison source would be used. The phototropic
influence of all the various wave lengths, would be expressed in terms
of a single standard. As has been seen in the preliminary experi-
ment, some thirty thousand times variation in phototropic effect is
to be observed. The comparison light, must, therefore, be varied in
intensity over a large range. For this purpose an optical bench has
been purchased. By means of this bench, the comparison hght may
be varied by varying the distance from the plant over a range of
three meters. Since the intensity of hight varies inversely as the
square of the distance from the source, this permits a tremendous
range of possible intensities. As funds were not available for the
purchase of a monochrometer, plans were made for the construction
of an instrument from optical parts available in the Smithsonian.
Lenses belonging to the National Museum, and originally used as
projectors, were loaned to the division for the construction of this
monochrometer. A prism and mirror were loaned by the Astro-
physical Observatory. A spectrometer bearing of a novel type, in-
volving an inverted cone with a ball thrust, was constructed by Mr.
Kramer in the Astrophysical Observatory shop. Because of the
pressure of other work in the shop, this monochrometer, begun in
Iebruary, was not completed until August of 1930. Preparations
for this more extensive experiment are now nearing completion.

COOPERATION

During the second half of the year, Doctor Weniger from Oregon
State College came to the laboratory and undertook the development
of more sensitive radiometers for the Astrophysical Observatory.
The facilities of the laboratory, and a considerable part of Mr.
Clark’s time were placed at his disposal. At the termination of the
6-month period, it was necessary for Doctor Weniger to return to his
position in charge of the Physics Department at Oregon State Col-
lege. ‘The completion of the development of these new radiometers
is, however, still in progress in his laboratory at Corvallis, Oreg.
The radiometers, when finally developed, will not only be of unusual
value of the Astrophysical Observatory in its study of stellar radi-
ation, but also to the Division of Radiation and Organisms in its
contemplated work in the infra-red spectrum upon the molecular
structure of polyatomic molecules.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 121

It will be noted, in this roughly chronological discussion of the
work of the year, that the only experiments mentioned came under
the first head of direct experimentation on living organisms. Some
progress, however, has been made under the second head in the sub-
division dealing with molecular structure. Due to the lack of funds
and shop facilities, it was impossible to undertake any of this work
at the Smithsonian. The only steps taken in that direction were,
first: The construction of two large tanks which will be used for
vacuum spectrograph bodies, and, second, the provision of special
room space in the reconstruction of the basement. Fortunately,
however, through the very generous cooperation of the Fixed Nitro-
gen Laboratory, work begun at the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory by
Doctor Brackett during the four months previous to his appoint-
ment by the Smithsonian, has been continued during the past year.
Mr. Liddel, appointed as a junior chemist on its staff, has actively
pushed the research work contemplated under the direction of and
in cooperation with the Smithsonian. The first work undertaken,
namely, the study of the near infra-red absorption spectra of the
halogen derivatives of benzene, has been carried through to comple-
tion so far as available materials and equipment permit. Predic-
tions made in the study of the paraflines in regard to the wave-length
position of the absorption due to vibration of hydrogen with respect
to carbon, have been borne out in the case of the phenyl derivatives.
The position of the second overtone of this vibration promises to
furnish an interesting basis for determinating the binding forces
upon the hydrogen atoms in different positions in the various organic
compounds. The work will be extended during the coming year,
largely to nitrogen compounds of a more immediate interest to the
Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory, and, at the same time, of great impor-
tance in biological connections.

Photochemical work bearing on biological problems can not be
undertaken until additional financial support can be obtained. In
the infra-red spectroscopic analysis, undertaken at the Fixed Nitro-
gen Laboratory because of its bearing upon the problems of molecular
structure, the range of spectrum which can be studied is limited by
the transmission of glass of which the prisms are constructed. It
has been the plan to build, at the Smithsonian, spectrographs in
which prisms of salt will be used. This will permit the extension
of the infra-red investigations from 244 to 15u. A more complete
understanding of the structure of polyatomic molecules will depend
upon securing the information from these regions of longer wave
lengths, as the most complete possible data upon vibration wave
lengths must be secured if progress is to be made. ‘The actual con-
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

struction of instruments for this purpose was more or less indefi-
nitely postponed for lack of funds and shop facilities as well as
laboratory staff. Arrangements for meeting this situation were
finally completed toward the end of the fiscal year.

In such an undertaking of border-line investigation, it is not sur-
prising that cooperation should have become a matter of unusual
importance. Not only is the division cooperating closely with the
University of Maryland in the plant physiological side, with. the
Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory in the molecular structure work, with
the Research Corporation in instrumental development, but also, in
a large degree with other bureaus of the Department of Agriculture.
Extensive plans have been developed, and something over $1,800
appropriated by the Department of Agriculture for investigation
of the effect of various radiation conditions upon the rooting of Citrus
fruits and the growth of date palms. This work is under the spon-
sorship and cooperative direction of Doctor Swingle. It is proposed
to complete the second group of four individual growth chambers
for that purpose.

PERSONNEL

During the fiscal year the personnel was as follows:

Research associate in charge, Dr. F. S. Brackett.

Consulting plant physiologist, Dr. Earl S. Johnston.

Research assistant, L. B. Clark.

Research assistant assigned by Astrophysical Observatory, W. H. Hoover.

SUMMARY

A well balanced and efficient laboratory has been developed. The
essential nucleus of a staff has been assembled. An experiment in
each of the main fields has been carried through to completion with
interesting results. Essential cooperations of a mutually profitable
character have been established. Foundations have been laid for
extensive investigations of importance in the fields of biophysics
and molecular structure. Preparations have been made for making
generally available specialized instruments developed by the division.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
operations of the United States Regional Bureau of the Interna-
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1930.

Since publication of the catalogue was suspended by the London
Central Bureau, owing to advanced costs in printing and the ina-
bility of the cooperating European countries to meet these advances
with their depreciated and unstable financial resources, it has been
the policy of this bureau to spend only so much of its annual con-
gressional appropriation as is necessary to keep the organization
alive pending the time when reorganization is possible and publica-
tion can be resumed. The gross expenditure for the past year was
$5,457.96 out of the appropriation of $7,885.

In the several preceding reports conditions affecting the catalogue
due to the late war were noted, and in the last report definite sug-
gestions were made regarding possible means of refinancing the
enterprise and estimates of the sum needed were submitted. Owing
to the still unsettled political and financial conditions abroad, no
definite scheme for reorganization has yet been submitted by the
director of the central bureau or the chairman of the executive com-
mittee, in whom authority for this purpose is vested.

The proposals looking toward reorganization made in the last
annual report were discussed in an article entitled “ The Interna-
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature Again,” by Dr. Ernest
Cushing Richardson, consultant in bibliography and _ research,
Library of Congress, published in “Science,” June 20, 1930 (Vol.
LXXI, No. 1851 pp. 635-637), and as Doctor Richardson is one of
the great international authorities on bibliography and on the needs
of librarians it is thought advisable to quote at length his remarks,
hoping thereby to aid the effort being made to refinance the catalogue.

THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AGAIN

The proposal suggested by the Smithsonian Institution to revive the publi-
cation of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature on a very modest
but well-considered budget is a challenge to all scientists and librarians, and
to all trust agencies which are spending good money for the promotion of
research,

123
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

It is suggested that a revolving fund of $75,000 and 1,000 library subscriptions
of $50 for 17 volumes will insure the enterprise. Whether or not this is
enough is a detail. If this catalogue or something like it is an indispensable
tool for research, as many first-class scientists seem to think, then any neces-
sary amount should and probably can be had. If the catalogue is not needed,
too much money is now being spent on it. Why waste more?

The Smithsonian raises this question plainly. Why ask the American Gov-
ernment to continue to appropriate six or seven thousand dollars a year in the
procrastinated hope of a resurrection, if the project is better dead? If it is
needed, why procrastinate?

By putting the question the Institution has deserved the thanks of all con-
cerned. It is to be hoped that it will not let the matter rest until it has
a square answer from all responsible parties. * * #*

* * * The question raised by the Smithsonian is not the question of pre-
senting a hew project to be justitied, financed and initiated, but whether per-
fectly good machinery worth at least $3,000,000 is to be scrapped, in an enter-
prise bound to be revived sometime, as Professor Armstrong, of the Royal
Society, prophesies and as many scientific bibliographers in many countries
are on record as believing.

It is at this point that the overture of the Smithsonian becomes a matter
of practical business concern both in the research trust endowments and to the
libraries. The research endowments are bombarded with bibliographical proj-
ects of varying method and degrees of merit. They aid or support a
good many projects. They are deeply concerned as trust organizations
to put their money where it will do the most good. Other things
being equal they prefer to put it where one dollar will do the work of four.
This seems to be a spot where one million, perhaps a quarter of a million,
will do the work of four millions. If its usefulness merely averages with
these other projects the endowments are likely to feel that its claims come
first. It is here they can give the most bibliographical service with the least
money. The proposition touches the libraries in a very similar way. If and
when the matter is revived it will depend for financing, if not on the endow-
ments, then on library subscriptions. If this machine is scrapped, when a new
one is started either a $3,000,000 endowment must be had from promoters of
research or a quadruple price charged to libraries.

This leads straight to the crucial question of whether the international cata-
logue is in fact a primary, essential or indispensable tool in such sense that
it is bound to be revived sometime. It no doubt seems a futile and mortifying
matter to those who have been deeply engaged in the problem for 30 years
that they should have to rejustify and refight a matter which was fought to
the finish 30 years ago. But it is fair enough. It is not the only real biblio-
graphical need of science. There are at least two other equally well-defined
needs—abstracts and handbooks. Without disparaging the usefulness of these
two other tools, it must be confessed that a good case is made by those who
claim that something like the international catalogue is the essential and only
indispensable tool among the three types.

A. dispassionate general bibliographer must recognize that this is a conclu-
sion towards which the whole history of bibliographical experience tends. The
complete survey, in full title form, of the whole literature of any subject or
group of subjects is the only solution of the main need of the student in re-
search and in the higher learning, that is, completeness, and the best solution
as to his need for a perspective. * * *
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 125

In short, bibliographical experience confirms the judgment that something
“very like” this catalogue as to completeness is the essential, and full title
method best, without prejudice as to variety in other details. * * *

Scientific bibliography has the very high honor in bibliographical history of hav-
ing been the first to conceive and to carry out on a large scale in the interna-
tional catalogue the seeing-as-a-whole aspect of things which the modern school
of psychologists is now exploiting. It would be an even greater honor if it
should lead the promotors of research generally to apply the comprehensive
method to other large fields.

Notwithstanding the practical deadlock still existing in interna-
tional relationships, where cooperation is essential to success, it is
hoped and expected that some method will be found to reorganize
and finance this great enterprise, as its history and past success en-
titles it to first place when worth-while projects are being consid-
ered by private individuals or by existing foundations whose aim
and purpose is to aid the advance of knowledge and the welfare of
mankind.

Respectfully submitted.

Leonarp C, GUNNELL,
Assistant in Charge.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 10
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1930:

THE LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library, or library system, is composed of the
10 major and 386 minor libraries of the Institution. It numbers
somewhat more than 800,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts, of
which many are on art, literature, history, music, and philosophy,
but most on science and technology. ‘The system is especially strong
in serial publications and in the reports, proceedings, and transac-
tions of the learned societies and institutions of the world. The
major units are the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress,
the Smithsonian office library, the Langley aeronautical library, and
the libraries of the United States National Museum, the Bureau of
American Ethnology, the Astrophysical Observatory, the National
Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Division of Radiation
and Organisms, and the National Zoological Park. The minor units
are the sectional libraries of the National Museum. The system,
with its highly specialized collections, the gathering of which has
been proceeding since 1846, the date when the Smithsonian began
its work, has brought to the Institution and through it to the Gov-
ernment and to American scholars generally the results of the re-
search of the world during its most important scientific era, and thus
has contributed not a little to the fulfilment of the purpose for which
the Institution was founded, namely, that of increasing and diffusing
knowledge among men.

CHANGES IN STAFF

A number of changes occurred in the staff. Miss Isabel L. Towner,
assistant librarian in the National Museum, after several years of
noteworthy service, resigned to accept an editorial position in New
York. She was succeeded by Miss Leila G. Forbes, a graduate of
St. Lawrence University and of the Pratt Library School, who had
been for many years librarian of Randolph-Macon Woman’s College.

Miss Ethel A. L. Lacy, assistant librarian in the National Museum,
also resigned to take a position in another Washington library. Her

126
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 127

place was filled by the appointment of Miss Gertrude L. Woodin, a
graduate of Wellesley College and of the Albany Library School,
who had been for some time a junior librarian on the roll of the
International Exchanges. Mrs. Hope Hanna Simmons, junior
library assistant in the National Museum, was promoted to the va-
eant junior librarianship. Mrs. Mary Arnold Baer, under library
assistant in the Museum, was advanced to Mrs. Simmons’ former
position. Miss Margaret Moreland, a graduate of the library science
department of George Washington University, who was already
serving temporarily on the roll of the International Exchanges, was
selected to succeed Mrs. Baer.

Miss Anna M. Link, a former teacher, and at present a student
of library science at George Washington University, was appointed
to the position of minor library assistant in the Astrophysical Ob-
servatory. Mr. William O. Grant, assistant messenger in the Na-
tional Museum, was given a better position elsewhere in the Insti-
tution, and Mr. Stephen Stuntz took his place. The temporary
employees were Mr. Alan Blanchard, Mrs. Daisy Cadle, Miss
Rosalie Dimmette, Miss Katherine Everhart, Miss Angela Moore,
Miss Margaret Moreland, Mrs. M. Landon Reed, Miss Jennette
Seiler, Miss Eleanor Spielman, and Mrs. M. Frances Watkins.

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

In the early days of the Institution the accessions to the library
usually came by purchase, gift, or copyright—for in those days the
copyright law provided that one copy of each new book published
in the United States should be deposited in the Library of Congress
and one in the Smithsonian library. Increasingly, however, since
that time the accessions have come by exchange of publications with
editors of journals and with learned institutions and societies, until
now, while some are still obtained by purchase and gift, by far the
greater number are received in exchange. Many of the latter come
through the United States International Exchange Service, which is
administered by the Institution.

During the fiscal year just closed the Smithsonian library received
24,063 packages by mail and 2,077 through the Exchange, each con-
taining one or more publications. These were stamped and entered—
with the exception of the documents from foreign governments—and
assigned to the units of the library system in which they would be of
most use in furthering the work of the Institution and its branches,
but chiefly, of course, to the Smithsonian deposit and the library of
the National Museum. There were a number of unusually large
sendings, the largest being one of 208 pieces from the Academy of
Sciences at Heidelberg. This went far toward completing the set
of the Academy’s publications in the deposit.
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Among the items received were several thousand dissertations from
the universities of Basle, Berlin, Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Budapest,
Erlangen, Freiberg, Giessen, Greifswald, Halle, Heidelberg, Helsing-
fors, Jena, Johns Hopkins, Kiel, Konigsberg, Leipzig, Lund, Mar-
burg, Neuchatel, Pennsylvania, Rostock, Strasbourg, Tiibingen,
Utrecht, Wiirzburg, and Ziirich; and from technical schools at Berlin,
Bonn, Braunschweig, Delft, Dresden, Freiberg, and Karlsruhe.

Most. of the 1,711 letters written by the library staff during the
yvear—which, by the way, represented an increase of about 400 over
the previous year—had to do with the acquisition of this material.
Many of these involved careful checking of sets and reviewing of
earlier correspondence. Some proposed or accepted exchange for
new publications. This gratifying increase in the number of letters
written by the library was effected largely by the recent reorganiza-
tion of the accessions department. As the immediate result of this
increase the exchange correspondence of the library was brought
practically up to date. Most of the letters were prepared in re-
sponse to special requests for publications needed by the Smithsonian
deposit and the libraries of the National Museum and the Astro-
physical Observatory. The number of items thus obtained was 2,928.

GIFTS

As usual, there were many gifts. The largest one came from Mr.
James Townsend Russell, jr., honorary collaborator in old world
archeology in the National Museum, who presented to the Institu-
tion 1,400 volumes on different subjects, together with a collection of
music. These will be assigned mainly to the Smithsonian deposit,
the office library, and the libraries of the National Museum and the
National Gallery of Art. About 150 volumes and 1,000 periodicals,
chiefly on aeronautics, came from the National Aeronautic Associa-
tion; and 2,000 or more miscellaneous scientific publications from the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American
Association of Museums, the Anthropological Society of Washington,
the Geophysical Laboratory, the Hygienic Laboratory, the Interna-
tional Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Philosophical Society
of Washington, and the Library of Congress. Another important
gift was that of 58 volumes on Japanese history and literature, from
the Historiographical Institute, Tokyo.

Among other gifts were 60 volumes, largely in the field of mining
engineering, from Mr. A. F. G. Lucas, and copies of the following:
Mythology of All Races, volumes 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 11, by various

also gave the library a number of publications.

130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930
SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT

The Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress is the main
unit in the library system of the Institution. It dates from 1866,
when for various reasons Congress granted authority to the Smith-
sonian to deposit its library of 40,000 volumes in the Library of
Congress. Since that time the collection has been steadily increased
by sendings from the Institution until it now numbers more than
a half million volumes, pamphlets, and charts, together with thou-
sands of volumes still uncompleted. The deposit comprises works
relating to many branches of knowledge, but chiefly to the natural
and physical sciences, and includes a collection of scientific serials
and of the publications of learned institutions and societies that is
unique for completeness among groups of its kind. Most of the
items have come to the Institution during its 80 years and more of
existence in exchange for its publications and those of the Govern-
ment bureaus under its direction. In 1900 the Library of Con-
gress established a special division, known as the Smithsonian divi-
sion, to take charge of the scientific publications in the deposit, as
well as of similar works belonging to the library itself. The rest
of the publications are shelved in the other divisions of the library
according to subject. It follows that the Smithsonian deposit is
not, as many have supposed, synonymous and coextensive with the
Smithsonian division.

In the course of the year just closed the library of the Institution
forwarded to the deposit 19,144 publications, consisting of 2,720
volumes, 11,802 parts of volumes, 4,352 pamphlets, and 270 charts.
Among these were 2,205 publications that the Smithsonian library
had obtained in exchange for the deposit, in response to want cards
sent from the order division, periodical division, and Smithsonian
division, or more than two and one-half times the number obtained
in the fiscal year 1929 and nearly five times the number in 1928.
Among them, too, were 4,484 dissertations. The library also for-
warded 13,729 documents of foreign governments, without stamping
or entering them, to the division of documents. The total number
of publications, therefore, added to the Library of Congress during
the year by the Smithsonian library was 82,873—an increase of
nearly 10,000 over the year before. This noteworthy increase, which
was due primarily to the reorganization of the accessions department
already referred to, was due also, in no small measure, to the hearty
cooperation the library staff received from those in immediate
charge of the various divisions of the Library of Congress chiefly
concerned, notably the Smithsonian division.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 131
NATIONAL MUSEUM LIBRARY

The library of the United States National Museum, which con-
sists of two major collections—namely, on natural history and tech-
nology—shelved respectively in the Natural History Building and
the Arts and Industries Building, and of 36 minor collections scat-
tered among the various sections of the Museum, is, next to the
Smithsonian deposit, the largest and most important unit in the
Smithsonian library system. It numbers 76,879 volumes and 108,297
pamphlets. During the last fiscal year it was increased by 2,317
volumes and 668 pamphlets. Most of these came in exchange, but
many were purchased and some were received as gifts.

The staff had a very busy year. They entered 8,805 periodicals,
catalogued 1,146 volumes and 856 pamphlets, and added 4,493 cards
to the catalogue of the natural history library and 295 to that of the
technology library. They assigned to the sectional libraries 5,622
publications, and lent to the Museum staff and other Smithsonian
employees 7,745, of which 2,820 were charged at the recently estab-
lished loan desk in the Arts and Industries Building. Of the loans,
1,889 were borrowed from the Library of Congress and 246 else-
where. The number of publications returned to the Library of
Congress was 2,250, and to other libraries 241. The loans to Goy-
ernment libraries and to libraries outside of Washington were 181.
Among the latter were those of the American Museum of Natural
History, the New York Botanical Garden, and the Department of
Agriculture, Ottawa, Canada, and of the following colleges and uni-
versities: Buffalo, California, Goucher, Harvard, Johns Hopkins,
MacMaster (Toronto), Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Minnesota, North Carolina State, Princeton, and Tennessee. The
number of volumes prepared for binding was 2,071, of which 1,271
were bound. The others will be sent to the bindery when additional
funds become available early in the next fiscal year. This work en-
tailed considerable checking of sets, collating, and correspondence.
In this connection it is of interest to note that the library was able
to obtain, without expense, 668 volumes and parts lacking in its sets
by writing special letters to the journals and learned societies
concerned.

The reference use of the library, not only by those connected with
the Smithsonian Institution and the different branches of the Gov-
ernment, but also by students and the public in general, increased
somewhat over that of the year before and necessitated a correspond-
ing increase of work on the part of the staff. Hundreds of inquiries
for information of various kinds were received and answered. To
the technology library alone, with its 700 visitors for the year, out-
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

side of the Smithsonian employees, carne about 225 such inquiries,
while to the natural history library came many more.

The sectional libraries, which number 36, are the immediate work-
ing tools of the curators and their assistants. Many of them are
rich in highly specialized material, much of which has not been
catalogued. ‘These libraries present other problems, too, that are
pressing for solution, and one of their most urgent needs is of two
assistants who can be detailed from the main library to spend their
full time looking after the interests of these smaller but very impor-
tant library units. During the past year it was possible for the
library staff to find time for only a few pieces of work in these
libraries, such as preparing 2,680 cards for the pamphlet collection
in the division of mammals, aiding the department of geology in
increasing quite materially its set of the publications of the various
State geological surveys, and cooperating with the scientific staff of
the division of plants in reorganizing the library of that division,
especially by arranging 10,000 cards for its reference file and get-
ting the John Donnell Smith botanical collection ready for transfer
to its shelves. ‘This included the making of a catalogue of the
collection.

These libraries are as follows:

Administration. Marine invertebrates.
Administrative assistant’s office. Mechanical technology.
American archeology. Medicine.

Anthropology. Minerals.

Biology. Mineral technology.
Birds. Mollusks.

Botany. Old World archeology.
HWehinoderms. Organic chemistry.
HWditor’s office. Paleobotany.

Hthnology. Photography.

Fishes. Physical anthropology.
Foods Property clerk’s office.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphie arts. Superintendent’s office.
History. Taxidermy.

Insects. Textiles.

Invertebrate paleontology. Vertebrate paleontology.
Mammals. Wood technology.

OFFICE LIBRARY

The office library serves Smithsonian employees in two ways. It
keeps constantly on hand in the administrative offices, reading rooms,
and other convenient places many works of general reference, includ-
ing dictionaries, encyclopedias, atlases, and sets of Smithsonian and
cther learned publications; it also provides material, to a limited
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 133

extent, of a less technical character, designed mainly for a cultural
and, in some instances, even a recreational purpose. Most of the pub-
lications in the latter group have been received as gifts from em-
ployees of the Institution or from friends outside. During the last
year several hundred such publications were given to the Institution,
especially by Mr. J. Townsend Russell, jr., of the scientific staff of
the National Museum. ‘These will soon be catalogued and placed on
the shelves of the office library. The happy arrangement previously
made with the Library of Congress to lend to the library from time
to time for a brief period some of the latest popular and semipopular
books was continued, much to the satisfaction of the Smithsonian
employees. ‘To the office library were added 1,988 volumes and 316
pamphlets. Its periodical entries were 835.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The library of the Bureau of American Ethnology, which is housed
in the Smithsonian Building, is one of the more important units in
the library system of the Institution. It is made up, in the main,
of works on anthropology, not a few of which are quite rare. It
is particularly rich in publications on the archeology, history, myths,
religion, arts, sociology, language, and general culture of the Ameri-
can Indians. The collection has some valuable manuscripts, many
photographs, and several Indian vocabularies. The library numbers
29,071 volumes and 16,527 pamphlets. During the last year it was
increased by 559 volumes and 150 pamphlets. ‘The number of periodi-
cals entered was 4,106, and the number of volumes bound 210. The
additions to the card catalogue were 3,420. The loans were 840. As
usual, hundreds of publications were consulted in the library,
especially by members of the bureau staff, and considerable reference
work was done by those in charge of the collection.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

The library of the Astrophysical Observatory, while one of the
smaller units in the library system, consists of publications of
especial value in the astrophysical and meteorological work of the
Institution. The main part of the collection is shelved in the Smith-
sonian Building, the rest in the observatory itself, where it is im-
mediately available for the use of the investigators. Its file of
current periodicals is also kept in the observatory, as is the card
catalogue of the library. The collection numbers 4,008 volumes and
8,100 pamphlets. To it were added during the last year 140 volumes
and 151 pamphlets. The number of volumes bound was 50.

28095 —31—10
134 | ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930
RADIATION AND ORGANISMS LIBRARY

The library of radiation and organisms, which was established in
1929 as a major unit of the Smithsonian library system to meet
the needs of a branch of research recently organized under a separate
division of the Institution, made satisfactory progress during the
year. An excellent working nucleus of reference books was obtained
for it, and arrangements were made to receive regularly the out-
standing magazines in the field of the division’s special interest. A
dictionary card catalogue was begun for the collection. At the end of
the year the library numbered 74 volumes, 8 pamphlets, and 6 charts,
besides about a hundred unbound periodicals.

LANGLEY AERONAUTICAL LIBRARY

During the year the Institution’s famous collection of aeronautical
publications, known as the Langley aeronautical library, was re-
moved from the main hall of the Smithsonian Building, where it
had been kept for many years, to the Library of Congress. ‘There,
with other and larger collections of its kind, it will be more cen-
trally available to the technician and historian as well as the general
student.

The collection will be under the immediate supervision of the
chief of the newly organized division of aeronautics, in the develop-
ment of which the Guggenheim fund has recently taken a generous
interest. But it will remain a unit of the Smithsonian library sys-
tem—a second deposit in the Library of Congress, distinct from the
main unit of that system known as the Smithsonian deposit, but
subject to the same conditions that Congress specified in providing
for the establishment of the older and larger deposit. Its identity
will be shown by a special stamp and book plate, and the collection
will continue to bear the name of the Langley aeronautical library
and will be increased from time to time by sendings from the
Smithsonian—it being the desire of the Institution to preserve the
collection as an independent and growing memorial to its third
secretary, whose work marked the beginning of the scientific study
of aeronautics in the United States.

Many of the library’s rarest items once belonged to Secretary
Langley; others to such well-known investigators and experimenters
as Alexander Graham Bell, Octave Chanute, and James Means.
The library numbers 1,734 volumes and 923 pamphlets and includes
files of most of the early aeronautical magazines, together with a _
large number of photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings. It
was increased the past year by 37 volumes, 362 parts of volumes,
and 85 pamphlets.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 135
NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

When in 1920 the National Gallery of Art was set apart as a sep-
arate Government bureau under the administrative charge of the
Smithsonian Institution, its library ceased to be a sectional library
of the National Museum and became a major unit of the Smithsonian
library system. Since that time the collection, already an important
nucleus of works on fine art, both American and foreign, has grown
yearly by carefully selected additions, until it now contains 1,098
volumes and 1,166 pamphlets. Small as the collection still is, it
almost fills the space available for books in the present limited gallery
quarters in the Natural History Building and will soon need more
room there unless in the early future a special building is provided
for the gallery. When that is at hand, the collection can be ade-
quately shelved, and be permitted to grow more rapidly, to meet the
expanding needs of the gallery. The library was increased during
the year just closed by 97 volumes and 60 pamphlets. Most of these
were purchased or received in exchange, but not a few were gifts,
especially from Dr. William H. Holmes, director of the gallery. The
number of periodicals entered was 271.

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art is one of the most unique
in the Smithsonian library system. Centering, as it does, primarily
in the interest of the Freer Gallery in the arts and cultures of the
Far East, India, Persia, and the nearer east, it richly supplements
for the purpose of research—especially with its publications in the
Chinese and Japanese languages, some of which are very rare—the
corresponding collections in the Library of Congress. It also has to
do somewhat with the life and works of various American painters,
notably James McNeill Whistler, many of whose pictures are the
possession of the gallery, and with the famous biblical manuscripts
of the fourth and fifth centuries, known as the Washington Manu-
scripts, which the gallery is so fortunate as to own.

The main collection numbers 4,362 volumes and 2,998 pamphlets;
the special collection designed for the use of the field staff of the
gallery, 814 volumes and 500 pamphlets. The former was increased
during the last fiscal year by 93 volumes and 229 pamphlets. The
number of volumes bound was 29. During the year, thanks to the
generous cooperation of the gallery, the work of reclassifying and
recataloguing the library was undertaken. In this connection 1,134
cards were prepared and filed in the new dictionary catalogue. This
work will be continued the coming year.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

The library of the National Zoological Park is made up of publi-
cations that have to do chiefly with the habits and care of animals,
and is designed for the use of the director and those associated with
lim. It numbers 1,213 volumes and 403 pamphlets. Its accessions
for the year were 4 volumes and 3 pamphlets.

This total does not, of course, include the large number of volumes
in the system still uncatalogued or awaiting completion.

UNION CATALOGUE

Further progress was made on the union dictionary catalogue begun
a short time ago. This will require many years to complete, but
when it is finished it will be an invaluable instrument in the reference
activities of the Institution, for it will constitute a central author-
title-subject finding list, for the most part on Library of Congress
cards, of all the items in all the 46 Smithsonian libraries. Unfor-
tunately, with the present force, the progress of this work must con-
tinue to fall short each year of what we should like.

Notwithstanding this fact, however, the staff, besides keeping up
with the current work, was able to finish cataloguing the important
John Donnell Smith botanical collection, with the exception of one set
of pamphlets and reprints, and to make considerable headway in cata-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 137

loguing the library of the Freer Gallery of Art. This work involved
classifying the publications and mounting many of them in pamphlet
binders. The staff spent some time in checking the Langley aero-
nautical collection and making the necessary changes in the catalogue
cards incident to the transfer of that library to the Library of Con-
gress. It worked out a plan by which the Library of Congress can
obtain copies of certain cards prepared by the staff for filing in its
union catalogue. It also provided that Library with manuscript
copies of a goodly number of titles, to be printed and distributed with
the cards regularly issued by the Library. In addition, it added more
than 15,000 cards to the shelf list of the Museum library, thus ad-
vancing it to a point from which it can be completed at an early date,
and began the preparation of a union shelf list to be kept, with the
union catalogue, in the Smithsonian Building. For this shelf list
27,417 cards were made, besides those prepared for the current publi-
cations catalogued. The cataloguing work of the year may be
shown in detail by the following statistics:

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

Some of the special activities of the year have already been re-
corded under the appropriate sections of thisreport. Those that have
not been may be set down here. One detailed piece of work was
the checking of several long sets of publications, with a view to
completing them, especially those of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, the Zoological Society of London, and the United
States Geological Survey. In connection with this work hundreds
of paper-covered publications of the United States Geological Survey
were listed for return to the survey, to be replaced by cloth-bound
volumes, in accordance with a recent agreement between the Museum
and the survey for the exchange of bound copies of their respective
publications. The reports and other publications of the State
geological surveys, which had been brought together the previous
year from various Smithsonian libraries, were also checked and most
of them used to fill gaps in either the main library of the Museum
or the library in the department of geology. The 434 volumes not
needed for this purpose were given to the United States Geological

Survey. About 1,050 scientific reprints were distributed to the
curators.
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

The Wistar Institute cards were filed to date, and more than
10,000 Concilium Bibliographicum cards of the author set were filed
in the main library, while the assignment, begun the year before, of
appropriate parts of the systematic set to the sectional libraries was
continued. It is hoped that the rest of this set can soon be deposited
in the sections interested, and that in the future the new increments
as they are received can immediately be sorted and sent to the cu-
rators for their files. In preparation for the forthcoming Supplement
to the Union List of Serials, the staff checked the periodical records
of all the Smithsonian libraries, except the deposit in the Library of
Congress, for new entries and for sets completed since 1925—a task
which required a great deal of time. The work of organizing, the
scientific duplicates in the west stacks of the main building, which
had been in progress for several years, was completed to the point
where most of the material became available for use. The result was
that before the end of the year hundreds of publications—many of
which could not otherwise have been obtained except by purchase,
and then often at fancy prices—were taken from the collection and
assigned to the sets in which they were lacking. The rest will soon
be used in the same way, or will be sent in exchange to other
hbraries.

In this connection it may be reported that 93 volumes and parts
of the Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington were
sent to the society for use in completing its three sets. About 9,600
other duplicates not needed by the libraries of the Institution were
distributed to Harvard University, Yale University, Chicago Uni-
versity, and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, for
similar use, under an arrangement by which the Smithsonian is to
receive an equivalent exchange, not merely of old material, but in
the case of at least two of the universities, of new material issued by
their presses. This happy arrangement will result in placing pub-
lications not required by the Institution in strategic positions else-
where for the furthering of research and in conserving Smithsonian
funds for the purchase of publications that can not be obtained by
exchange.

The popular and semipopular material that had previously been
brought together in a special building behind the Astrophysical
Observatory and roughly grouped was more carefully arranged,
pending final disposal. The set of star charts that the Smithsonian
has been receiving for some years from various important observa-
tories was transferred as a semipermanent loan to the United States
Naval Observatory, and the Institution’s set of Russian meteorologi-
cal bulletins was likewise transferred to the United States Weather
Bureau, the purpose in each case being to place the material where
it would be of most aid to investigators.

F

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 139

It might be added that the librarian gave 14 lectures during the
year, chiefly before local groups, including the Shakespeare Society.
Several of these were on the Smithsonian Institution and its library
system. He also contributed a chapter on the libraries of the Insti-
tution to the history of Washington, entitled “ Washington—Past
and Present,” which has recently appeared.

PHYSICAL CONDITION AND EQUIPMENT

About 400 feet of new steel shelving were installed in the main
stack room of the Museum library. ‘This additional space will relieve
for the time being the congested condition of the library and will
provide room for the rearranging of the collections that is soon to
be undertaken. The improvement in physical equipment and ap-
pearance of several of the sectional libraries, notably those of botany
and geology, should also be mentioned.

CONCLUSION

On the whole, the system of libraries under the Smithsonian made
considerable progress during the year toward becoming a complete
and available reference instrument worthy of the Institution. This
progress was retarded only by the lack of sufficient funds for bind-
ing, for the purchase of many of the books and periodicals requested
by the curators—publications which could not be obtained by ex-
change—and for the employment of enough trained workers to
enable the libraries not merely to meet the daily demands upon
them, but to carry forward the work of reorganization that was
begun a few years ago. It is gratifying to report, however, that this
condition was somewhat relieved by the generous action of the Freer
Gallery of Art, already mentioned, in allotting funds for use in con-
nection with the cataloguing of its library; and that it will soon be
further relieved, for on July 1, 1930, thanks to an increase in the
Government appropriation to the Smithsonian for library purposes,
$1,000 more than last year will be available for books and periodicals,
and two new positions will be provided—namely, for a clerk in the
exchange office of the library and a senior stenographer in the
librarian’s office.

But to make it possible for the system fully to meet the needs
of the Institution, the annual sum for binding and for the purchase
of publications should be further increased, and the staff should be
further augmented by at least two cataloguers to revise the cata-
logue of the museum library and those of other units in the Smith-
sonian system, to expedite the making of the union catalogue, and
to render available at the earliest possible moment the thousands
of important publications still uncatalogued on the shelves; two
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

library assistants for service of a general nature in the sectional
libraries; a library aid to relieve the more experienced assistants
of minor library tasks that they are now obliged to perform in addi-
tion to their regular duties; and a stack attendant to keep the various
collections in order, that publications may be found immediately
when called for by the scientists. When this increased sum is at
hand and these positions are provided and filled, the library system
will be able to enter more worthily into the opportunity for service
afforded by its close relation to the work of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and its branches.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE
BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTI-
TUTION FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1930

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Your executive committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Smithsonian Institution together with
a statement of the appropriations by Congress for the Government
bureaus in the administrative charge of the Institution.

SMITHSONIAN ENDOWMENT FUND

The original bequest of James Smithson was £104,960 8 shillings

6 pence—$508,318.46. Refunds of money expended in prose-

cution of the claim, freights, insurance, ete., together with

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave
to the Institution his collection of Chinese and other oriental objects
of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whis-
tler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for
the construction of a building to house the collection, and finally in
oe SE yy. See

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 151

his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities
to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endowment fund for
the operation of the gallery. In view of the importance and special
nature of the gift and the requirements of the testator in respect to it,
all Freer funds are kept separate from the other funds of the Institu-
tion, and the accounting in respect to them is stated separately.

All payments are made by check, signed by the secretary of the
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account. Jn many instances
deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collection and later
are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits has
proven satisfactory. During the year the interest derived from this
source has resulted in a total of $8,103.31.

The foregoing report relates only to the private funds of the Smith-
sonian Institution. The following is a statement of the congressional
appropriations for the past 10 years, for the support of the several
governmental branches under the administrative control of the Insti-
tution, and of appropriations for other special purposes durjng that
period.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR
ENDED JUNE 30, 1930

ANNUAL MEETING, DECEMBER 12, 1929

Present: Chief Justice W. H. Taft, chancellor, in the chair, Senator
Joseph T. Robinson, Senator Claude A. Swanson, Representative R.
Walton Moore, Representative Robert Luce, Mr. Frederic A. Delano,
Mr. Dwight W. Morrow, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, Dr. John C. Mer-
riam, and the secretary, Dr. C. G. Abbot. Dr. Alexander Wetmore,
assistant secretary, was also present.

The secretary announced that Representative Walter H. Newton
had resigned his seat as a Member of the House on June 30, last, thus
automatically terminating his appointment as a regent, and that the
Speaker had appointed Representative Robert Luce as a regent to
succeed him.

Mr. Delano, chairman of the executive committee, submitted the
following customary resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1931, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the
secretary, with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on the
part of the secretary as to items.

The secretary stated that his report for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1929, had been supplied to the regents, and called attention to the
many interesting and encouraging events of the year.

At the request of the secretary, Doctor Wetmore explained the
proposed building program for the Institution. After full discussion,
the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the permanent committee be authorized to formulate a program
to be presented to the Bureau of the Budget, and subsequently transmitted to
Congress, comprehending the proposed additional buildings needed by the
Smithsonian Institution.

The secretary stated that the Smithsonian Scientific Series was
meeting with gratifying success and that the Institution had already
received from this source royalties amounting to about $28,000,
which would increase as time passed. He reminded the board that
Ambassador Charles G. Dawes had made a grant for the purpose of
conducting historical studies in European archives and that Dr.
Charles Upson Clark, an expert, was now engaged in the work and

had already met with success in his researches.

160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

The annual report of the National Gallery of Art Commission was
presented. The report was accepted, and the board adopted the
following resolution:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
approves the recommendation of the National Gallery of Art Commission that
W. K. Bixby, W. H. Holmes, Herbert L. Pratt, and Charles Borie, be reelected as
members of the commission for the ensuing term of four years, their present terms
having expired.

The annual report of the executive committee was presented and
accepted.

The annual report of the permanent committee was submitted.
This included a suggestion for the establishment of a department for
the arousing of public interest in the Institution and for increasing its
endowment, which was referred to the permanent committee with
power to act.

The matter of the awarding of the Langley medal was next brought
up, and the following two resolutions were adopted:

Resolved, That in view of the service rendered to aviation by his pioneer con-
tributions to the development of the airplane engine, the Board of Regents of the

Smithsonian Institution hereby posthumously awards the Langley gold medal
for acrodromics to the late Charles Matthews Manly.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution award the
Langley gold medal for aerodromics to Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd,
United States Navy, for his pioneer flights over the North and South Poles of
the earth, his nonstop flight over the Atlantic Ocean; and the scientific discoveries
associated with these flights.

MEETING OF FEBRUARY 13, 1930

Present: Vice President Charles Curtis, Senator Reed Smoot,
Senator Claude A. Swanson, Representative R. Walton Moore,
Representative Robert Luce, Mr. Frederic A. Delano, and the secre-
tary, Dr. C. G. Abbot. Dr. Alexander Wetmore, assistant secretary,
was also present.

The secretary announced the resignation of the Hon. William
Howard Taft as Chief Justice of the United States, stating that this
action automatically terminated his service as a regent and con-
sequently as chancellor of the Institution. The following resolutions
were then adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution has
learned with deep regret of the illness and consequent resignation of its chan-
cellor, the Hon. William Howard Taft, from the office of Chief Justice of the
United States, thereby automatically severing his connection with this Board;

Resolved, That the board hereby expresses its deep sense of the great service
rendered by Mr. Taft to the Smithsonian Institution, and of the loss in counsel
and in association which his departure entails;

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be communicated to Mr. Taft.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 161

The secretary further stated that on December 19, 1929, the
Speaker of the House had reappointed as regents Representatives
Albert Johnson, R. Walton Moore, and Robert Luce.

The secretary recalled to the regents that at the last annual meeting
their attention had been drawn to the building program of the
Institution, the most urgent item of which was the addition of wings
to the present Natural History Building at an estimated cost of
$6,500,000, and Doctor Wetmore exhibited blue prints of the proposed
additions.

The secretary described the work of the new division of radiation
and organisms, and spoke of the interest shown in the Institution
by the Research Corporation of New York, of which he is a director.
He stated that for the past three years the corporation had in each
year made a grant to the Institution of $15,000 to promote the work
of the division of radiation and organisms. He also called attention
to the large sums that had been given by Mr. John A. Roebling to
the Institution for its work in solar radiation and for other purposes,
and stated that Mr. Roebling had very recently added a fund for the
purchase of books of reference on the subjects relating to radiation
investigations.

SPECIAL MEETING OF MAY 29, 1930

Present: Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Senator Joseph
T. Robinson, Senator Claude A. Swanson, Representative Albert
Johnson, Representative R. Walton Moore, Representative Robert
Luce, Mr. Robert S. Brookings, Mr. Frederic A. Delano, Dr. John C.
Merriam, and the secretary, Dr. C. G. Abbot. Mr. Delano was
invited to act as temporary chairman.

The secretary said that the appointment of Mr. Charles Evans
Hughes as Chief Justice of the United States takes him from the list
of “‘citizen”’ regents who are appointed for six years, and constitutes
him under the law an ex officio regent with a life tenure. He said
further that a vacancy existed in the office of chancellor, and the
following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
elects the Hon. Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, as
chancellor of the Institution.

The chancellor then took the chair, expressing his appreciation of
the honor done him.

The secretary said that in view of the resignation of Chief Justice
Taft, the Board of Regents, at their meeting of February 13, 1930,
had adopted resolutions which had been transmitted to the Chief
Justice, and which had been acknowledged.
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

The secretary spoke of the development of his researches on the
radiation of the sun, and then called attention to the provisions of
the new civil service retirement act, which makes possible the con-
tinuance in the service of the Institution of certain members of the
staff who would otherwise have to retire on August 20, 1930.

The secretary stated that beginning in 1911, letters had been re-
ceived from a Mr. James Arthur, of New York City, asking certain
information, including problems in mathematics, which had been
carefully answered. Recently, word had been received that Mr.
Arthur had bequeathed to the Institution the sum of $75,000, the
income of which was to be used for (a) the investigation and study of
the sun; (6) to provide annually a lecture to be known as the James
Arthur Annual Lecture on the Sun. Mr. Lloyd N. Scott, a director
and the counsel of the Research Corporation of New York, had been
designated as the legal representative of the Institution in connec-
tion with matters pertaining to this bequest.

The secretary said that the Senate had passed a bill authorizing
the preparation of plans for the construction of wings on either side
of the museum building at a cost of $6,500,000. The bill as passed
was an authorization only, but had not yet been brought before the
House. On motion, the secretary was requested to prepare a resolu-
tion embodying the sense of the board as to the urgency of the matter,
and requesting that the chancellor present the same to the President.

The secretary added that efforts had been made to fix a date for the
presentation of the Langley gold medals to Admiral Byrd and (post-
humously) to Charles M. Manly, but that this had not yet been
accomplished.
GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1930

163
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genrran Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
the Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific
discovery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous cor-
respondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool-
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though, not
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report for
1930.

BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM?
By H. D. Barcock

[With 2 plates]

One result of the widespread use of radio is a general familiarity
with two terms which have long been household words among
astronomers and physicists—wave length and frequency. Although
some vagueness often adheres to the meaning of these words, they
are exceedingly useful to everyone who uses a radio receiving set.
What matter if the machinery inside the box is permanently mys-
terious, provided a scale on the outside allows one to select the sta-
tion he wishes. We all soon learn the proper scale readings to find
our favorite stations, and we are accustomed to hear the announcer
make his routine statement: “This station operates at a frequency
of so many kilocycles by authority of the Tederal Radio Com-
mission.”

In such an ordinary experience as the use of the radio, a point of
contact is found with the subject of our discussion—Beyond the
Red in the Spectrum. We shall view this topic in its perspective
relation to the whole known range of wave lengths, trace a bit of
the history of its discovery and development, examine some of the
modern methods of studying it. If some idea is conveyed of the
reasons why these studies are worth while, our purpose will have
been in part accomplished. If, in addition, something of the fas-
cination which attends this kind of work is revealed, so that further
acquaintance with it appears desirable to you, the results will be
still more satisfactory.

Now as to radio waves, most of us are chiefly interested in the
ordinary broadcasting which may be received with our familiar
receiving sets. Such wave lengths, as everyone knows, range from
500 meters down to 200 meters—a difference corresponding to a little
over one octave in terms of the musical analogy. Only, instead of
having just 13 notes in the octave, our radio octave is now divided
into some 55 specified wave lengths. Outside the reach of the

ordinary receiver, however, other radio waves exist, and all that is
necessary to intercept them is a receiving set suitably designed.
Thus we have radio wave lengths ranging from a few meters to
many kilometers, all having the same physical nature and traveling
through space with the same velocity.

In order to make more definite the idea of the relative magnitude
of different wave lengths reference may be made to Figure 1.
Here is represented the region of the ordinary radio waves, and,
following along the scale, we find a succession of other types of
waves, all of which, however, are physically alike, just as all sound
waves are alike, though differing in pitch. Here you see the place
occupied by the visible waves, here the ultra-violet and the famous
cosmic radiation, of which so much is lately heard. This diagram,
doubtless familiar to many of you, is shown especially to point out
the location of the particular field selected for discussion—beyond
the red, but not indefinitely beyond. It also illustrates the fact that
in a broad sense we are all exceedingly color blind.

Figur 1.—The octaves of light from The World of Atoms, by Arthur Haas,
English translation by H. S. Uhler. By permission of the D. Van
Nostrand Co.

Having seen the setting of our subject, let us consider a little of
its history. All astronomers honor the name of Sir William Herschel,
who with his son, Sir John, contributed so much to our knowledge
of the universe. His enthusiasm, skill, and insight brought rich
returns. He explored the depths of space with an unprejudiced
mind, the gift of his Creator, and an excellent telescope, which he
made for himself. He sought a way to use his powerful instru-
ment for visual examination of the sun; how to avoid the disastrous
effects of too much heat and light in the eyepiece without sacrificing
the power of his instrument. This led Sir William to make the
first investigation of what lies beyond the red in the spectrum of
sunlight. With a glass prism, three ordinary thermometers, a
watch, some boards and paper screens, he carried out a remarkable
series of observations, an account of which he published in the year
1800 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of
London under the title “Investigation of the Powers of the Pris-
matic Colours to Heat and Illuminate Objects.”

In this paper Herschel gives a most interesting description of his
experimental work. He relates in detail how one thermometer was
exposed to the infra-red part of the solar spectrum, while the others
BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM—BABCOOK 167

were near-by but shaded from the spectrum. By reading all three
at regular intervals of time he found that the exposed thermometer
rose at a faster rate than the others. Pushing the thermometers
along the spectrum, he explored a considerable extent of the new
region which he had discovered, and was able to learn something
of the distribution of energy in it.

Later, by an improvement of this method of study, Sir John
Herschel, son of Sir William, continued the examination of the
invisible spectrum. He concluded that one-half of the sun’s heat
is found in the infra-red part of the spectrum—a result surprisingly
close to the modern figure of 45 per cent. The important result
of the Herschels’ work was the demonstration that visible radiation
is only a part of the spectrum, and that nonluminous hot bodies
have spectra just as those which we can see by their own light.

Leaving the work of the Herschels, on which it would be easy to
spend all the time available here, we shall next consider the contribu-
tions of Professor Tyndall, the famous English physicist who lived
in the middle of the last century. With apparatus far more delicate
than that of his predecessors (though it would appear crude to us
to-day) he devoted years to a thorough study of the phenomena of
heat, covering both the visible and the infra-red parts of the
spectrum. To give an adequate idea of the scope and the importance
of Tyndall’s brilliant experimental work would take far too long.
It furnished a sure foundation of established facts on which later
the great theoretical treatment of radiation was to be laid, and it
still constitutes a rich fund of information. | Tyndall studied, among
many other things, the absorbing power of gases for radiation. I
think he was the first to recognize the remarkable difference in the
absorbing power exhibited by a mixture of certain molecules and by a
chemical combination of the same molecules.

For example, if a certain number of molecules of oxygen are
mixed with twice as many of hydrogen, the power of the mixture to
absorb infra-red radiation is very small. But if these same molecules
are combined chemically to form water vapor, the absorptive power
is much greater. This fact finds a unique explanation in the modern
theory of molecular structure.

Another problem which Tyndall undertook to investigate was to
find the proportion in which the total energy radiated by a hot body
is divided between visible and obscure portions of its spectrum.
This proportion is known as the luminous efficiency. For example,
we have already seen that in the case of the sun the luminous efli-
ciency is roughly 50 per cent. Tyndall thus greatly extended the
study of the distribution of energy in the spectrum of a hot body,
which had been begun by Sir William Herschel. One of Tyndall’s
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

demonstrations, somewhat modified, is illustrated schematically in
Vigure 2. The infra-red radiation emitted by a hot wire is isolated
by a solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, which absorbs the visible
but permits the infra-red to pass through. When concentrated at
the focus of a mirror the invisible radiation ignites a match in a
few seconds.

By such means and others, Tyndall was able to find in what pro-
portion the total energy radiated by a hot body is divided between
visible and obscure portions. The relation of this proportion to the
temperature of the body, accurately formulated by the theoretical
physicists Wien and Planck, is a most valuable tool for both the
astronomer and the physicist. ‘Two applications of this idea may be
noted here. The first is the method of determining stellar or plan-
etary temperatures by finding the distribution of energy in their
spectra. For example, the image of a star is formed at the focus of
a telescope on a tiny receiver which has been blackened in order that
it may absorb all the radiation which falls on it. Delicate electrical

Ficurm 2.—Diagram of one of Tyndall’s demonstrations. A match
placed as indicated is quickly ignited by invisible infra-red radiation
from an electric lamp, although match and lamp are several yards
apart. LZ, an electric street lamp; Mi, Ms, concave mirrors; fF,
liquid filter which absorbs visible but transmits infra-red radiation

devices indicate the slightest change occurring in the temperature
of the receiver. Filters of various kinds, corresponding to the iodine
solution indicated in Figure 2, permit the separate measurement of
visible and invisible radiation and thus the ratio of these quantities
is obtained, leading to a knowledge of the temperature.

A second illustration is connected with recent events of world-
wide interest. When Mr. Edison’s golden anniversary was cele-
brated he once more constructed an electric lamp like his first of 50
years ago. The contrast between such early lamps and those in com-
mon use now is indeed striking. The improvements have resulted
from a knowledge of the distribution of energy between the visible
and the obscure parts of the spectrum. This has led to the opera-
tion of modern lamps at far higher temperatures than were formerly
used, with resultant increase of luminous efficiency. These two
lamps which I now turn on are consuming nearly the same power.
One is a type in wide use 20 years ago, the other a modern form.
It is evident that the brightness of the modern lamp is much greater
than that of the old one.
BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM—BABCOCK 169

We pass on to the more detailed study of the infra-red part of the
spectrum, where we shall deal no longer with the continuous spectra
of incandescent bodies, but with spectra of different type which are
produced by atoms and molecules acting as individuals. Now atoms
are in one respect like opera singers—in their most striking and
individual réles each requires plenty of elbowroom. Though the
analogy is imperfect, the continuous spectrum of a glowing solid
may be compared to the chorus, while the line spectrum of a luminous
gas is more like the song of the prima donna, who passes from one
degree of excitation to another, emitting a rapid succession of musical
notes like the brilliantly colored lines which individual atoms pro-
duce, when far enough apart from each other, and suitably stimulated.

When closely bound together as in a solid substance, the atoms tell
us the temperature of the solid, but only little of themselves. When
the solid is turned to gas by heating it sufficiently, the atoms get far
apart and then have an opportunity to do many things otherwise
impossible for them. Thus each kind of atom, whether it be hydrogen
or iron, sends out a characteristic spectrum consisting of numerous
kinds, or colors, of light, each very sharply defined. Some of these
“ colors ” are invisible but readily perceptible by instruments suitably
designed. Each separate color is referred to as a spectral line. The
supply of names for these colors soon proved inadequate and numbers
are now used instead.

Let us consider the case of hydrogen, with only some 50 or 60
lines in its spectrum, and think of each atom of the gas, mingled
with countless others all alike, as a magician having a repertoire of
tricks. At a given moment each atom can perform just one of its
various tricks, and the performance, practically instantaneous, is to
produce light of a certain color. A neighboring atom may be per-
forming a different trick, but it is one of the same repertoire. The
combined activities of all the atoms display the whole repertoire. At
a later time each atom may be doing a different trick from the one
it formerly showed, but the combined effect is the same as before.
Each trick corresponds to a line in the spectrum of hydrogen, and
the intensity of the line is a measure of the preference which the
atoms have for certain of their tricks. Every other kind of atom
such as oxygen, or zinc, has a characteristic repertoire. Each kind
may be recognized by its spectrum even under diverse conditions.

Near the beginning of this century a great physicist, Professor
Planck, to whom we have already referred, formulated a theory of
radiation which is known as the quantum theory. This important
work grew out of Planck’s study of the total radiation of a solid black
body. In 1913 Professor Bohr developed an application and exten-
sion of Planck’s theory to the problem of line spectra emitted by iso-
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

lated atoms, and he succeeded in accounting for the known spectrum
of hydrogen with astonishing accuracy and completeness. By cal-
culations based on this theory he showed that the known lines of the
hydrogen spectrum should be precisely where we find them. Further-
more, he predicted the exact position of other lines which the hydro-
gen atom should emit, and these were afterward observed precisely
where he said they should be. This brilliant success was followed by
a rapid expansion of our understanding of all line spectra and of
the atoms which give rise to them.

A basic idea in Bohr’s theory of spectra is this: Whenever an atom
produces one of its characteristic pure colors the energy thus sent
out in the form of radiation is exactly equal to the energy lost by the
atom as a result of the rearrangement of its parts. The atom is
thought of as having a heavy inner part or nucleus, with one or more
much lighter electrons bound to it by electrical forces. The analogy
with the structure of the solar system is obvious and to some extent
helpful, but it must not be carried too far. For example, the planes
of the planetary orbits lie within a few degrees of each other in the
solar system, while in the atoms this is not necessarily true. When
one of the outer electrons in an atom assumes a new position nearer
to the nucleus the atom accomplishes a definite amount of work,
and the energy radiated away is the exact equivalent of this work.
If a weight is allowed to fall from table to floor a certain amount
of work is done. Its equivalent is found in the heat developed,
the sound waves set up, and sometimes also in other ways.

Each line in a spectrum thus signifies the existence of two states
of the atom in which the internal energy of the atom is different.
A line whose color is red arises from a transition between two states
not very different; a line in the ultra-violet, from a transition be-
tween states having a much greater difference of energy. If your
baby falls off a footstool he may express his annoyance by a moder-
ately pitched exclamation; if he falls downstairs he will emit vocal
sound waves at least an octave higher. The color of a spectral line,
accurately expressed on a frequency scale, tells exactly the energy
lost by the atom when it performed one of its tricks.

The physicist measures the positions; i. e., the “colors,” to speak
loosely, of the spectral lines with an accuracy almost unbelievable;
he notes the relative intensities of the lines, their individual peculi-
arities such as sharpness or diffuseness, their varying behavior under
change of conditions surrounding the source of light, such as pres-
ence or absence of a magnetic field; and gradually he learns, for each
kind of atom, the system of energy-states which it possesses. These
energy-states, or spectral terms as they are called, are less numerous
than the lines in the spectrum, and are far more significant of the
BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM—BABCOCK 171

nature of the atom. Thus in the spectrum of neon some 900 lines
represent transitions between only 26 spectral terms.

These terms or energy-states themselves correspond to different
arrangements of the electrons which make up the outer part of
the atom. Thus a knowledge of the terms, which is derived from
the observed spectral lines, brings us some definite idea of the
mechanics of the atom.

The periodic table was long ago recognized by chemists as express-
ing some fundamental relations between the elements. By compari-
son of the spectra of elements adjacent in this table, the physicist is
now able to trace, in part at least, the gradual increase in mechanical
complexity of the atoms with their increase of weight. The most
fundamental physical and chemical relationships are thus clarified,
and man’s mastery of his environment is definitely increased.

This digression from the infra-red part of the spectrum has been
necessary in order to show in some fashion what the spectroscopist
is trying to do, regardless of the spectral region in which he works.
As we have seen, the object is to obtain, by a study of its spectral
lines, as complete a picture as possible of the system of terms
associated with each kind of atom and from these to derive the
structure of the atom. ‘To do this a large range of wave-lengths
must be examined; it is not sufficient to measure just the blue part
of the iron spectrum and attempt to find all the terms from the lines
shown there, for terms may exist whose combinations give no blue
lines at all. Even the entire visible spectrum is inadequate, and it
becomes necessary to study the ultra-violet and the infra-red in order
to fill in all the details.

These are some of the reasons which justify the activities of the
spectroscopist and warrant his efforts to extend the photographic
study of atomic spectra into the infra-red. Two other promising
fields of study also invite the more detailed exploration of the region
of longer wave lengths, namely the spectra which are characteristic
of molecules as distinguished from atoms, and the solar spectrum,
The complexity of molecules as compared to atoms is obvious, since a
molecule is a cluster of two or more atoms which have approached
each other close enough to form a partnership. Indeed the struc-
tural complexity is reflected in the spectra which molecules give.
Such spectra present many individual lines corresponding to a single
electronic transition in the molecule, because the atoms which make
up the molecule are free to rotate and to vibrate with respect to the
center of mass, and each of these possibilities is utilized every time
the electrons are rearranged. Thus the spectra of molecules have
furnished information of the utmost importance to the chemist as
well as to the physicist. For example, accurate determinations of
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

the distance between the two nuclei in a diatomic molecule, of the
moment of inertia of the molecule, of its heat of dissociation, as well
as the discovery of isotopic forms of the atoms and the calculation
of their masses are all possible in favorable cases where the band
spectra are suitable for precise measurement. To interpret the value
of each of these results, which have actually been obtained for oxy-
gen molecules, would lead us far into fields remote from our topic.
To apply improved methods of observing the infra-red region of
molecular spectra is bound to aid in developing this rapidly expand-
ing department of spectroscopy.

We are thus brought to the third field of large-scale spectroscopy,
namely, the study of the solar spectrum. Here we pause to pay
respect to the genius of Professor Rowland of Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, who carried out a remarkable investigation of the visible and
ultra-violet parts of the solar spectrum, which has been a storehouse
of information for 30 years. Some 20,000 spectral lines were meas-
ured and described with an accuracy only recently surpassed. There
is no doubt that Rowland would have extended his researches into
the infra-red part of the spectrum if he had possessed photographic
plates which would respond to such radiation.

Yor years it has been comparatively easy to photograph much of
the ultra-violet and all of the visible region of the spectrum, and the
method of photographic spectroscopy has proved superior to all other
ways of determining the exact positions and characters of spectral
lines. As we go beyond the visible red, however, the photographic
process becomes increasingly difficult and finally has to be replaced
by the thermometric method.

The thermometric method, as its name implies, depends on meas-
urement of the heating power of radiation. For this purpose three
types of instrument are in use, two of which utilize electrical effects
and the other, a mechanical effect of the radiation. Instruments of
the first two kinds are called bolometers and thermocouples, while
the third is known as a radiometer—and has been seen by every one
in the windows of opticians and jewelers.

It would be interesting to describe the working of these marvelous
devices and to show the results which they produce. It must suffice
to consider briefly the application of the bolometer to the study of the
solar spectrum. ‘This instrument was invented by Professor Langley
at the Allegheny Observatory in 1881. Subsequently as Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution he used it with the assistance of Dr. C.
G. Abbot, the present. secretary, to explore in detail the infra-red
solar spectrum. In the 30 years following the publication of this
great work, Doctor Abbot has continued to improve the instrument
and to apply it in a series of brilliant researches. During the past
year, with the assistance of Mr. Freeman, Doctor Abbot has published
BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM—BABCOCK 173

the latest measurements of this part of the solar spectrum from
observations made by them at Mount Wilson in 1928.

The bolometer depends on the change of electrical resistance shown
by a metal whose temperature is varied. A delicate electrical record-
ing device draws a continuous curve whose ordinates indicate the
temperature of a hairlike filament of blackened platinum, across
which the solar spectrum is made to pass. Figure 3 shows such a
curve obtained by Doctor Abbot. The electrical connections are so
made that when the curve dips down it means that the filament
became cooler. Thus these notches mean dark lines or bands inter-
rupting the continuity of the spectrum, exactly similar to the well-
known Fraunhofer lines in the visible spectrum of the sun. The wave
lengths here recorded are from 47,600 at one end to about A20,000
at the other. The thermometric method is capable, as you see, of
working over an enormous range of wave lengths, greater in fact
than the photographic method. It has another advantage in that

Ficurk 3.—Bolometrie record of solar energy in the infra-red, made by
Dr. C. G. Abbot. Beginning at the left with very deep red visible
radiation, the curve extends to the right far beyond the limits of
visibility and also beyond the present limit of photography

it gives, more directly than the photographic method, the intensity
of the radiation at each point in the spectrum. On the other hand
photography permits the observation of finer details than the ther-
mometric method, and leads to higher accuracy. A real advantage
is found, therefore, in observing, in so far as possible, the same part
of the solar spectrum by both the thermometric and the photo-
graphic methods. The greater accuracy of photography serves to
calibrate the wave-length scale of the bolometer, while the bolometric
record shows that the spectral lines recorded by the photographs are
real and not spurious effects introduced by the apparatus.

Nearly 50 years ago Sir William Abney photographed the invisible
solar spectrum as far as the point indicated on the curve—d9,867.
Attempts to extend his work have failed, although a few years ago
Dr. F. S. Brackett, then at the Mount Wilson Observatory, succeeded
in reaching a point just short of Abney’s limit. We shall now con-
sider some recent advances in the photographic method which have
made it possible to use it as far as A11,634.
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Abney obtained his results with a special form of silver bromide
which had the power of absorbing red and infra-red radiation; he
used no dyes. He prepared his own photographic plates shortly be-
fore use by an elaborate process which he described in detail. But
his process is troublesome and uncertain. It has never been seriously
applied to modern spectroscopy, although the resources of the present
chemical laboratory would perhaps warrant a revival of it. Since
Abney’s day, photographic chemistry has been more concerned with
ordinary silver bromide, which of itself absorbs only blue, violet,
and ultra-violet light. To make this bromide useful for longer wave
lengths, dyes are added to the emulsion which, by their absorption
of the yellow, red, or infra-red, are designed to confer sensitivity
to those kinds of radiation. This is the method used in preparing
panchromatic emulsions with which many of you are no doubt famil-
iar. Commercial needs have so stimulated the perfection of such
emulsions that those now obtainable are of excellent quality. For
the infra-red, however, the commercial requirements have not been
so great and progress has been much slower. For many years only
one useful dye was known for this region. It is called dicyanine
and it was with this that Doctor Brackett obtained his excellent
results some years ago. Lately, however, the motion-picture indus-
try developed a need for emulsions which would permit the taking
of night scenes in daytime, since great expense could thus be saved.
Now it turns out that a picture made with infra-red light under
ordinary daylight conditions looks very much as though it has been
made at night. In such a picture the sky, for example, is dark in-
stead of light. (See pl. 1.) Perhaps then, the spectroscopist owes
something to the movies for the fact that not long ago two new dyes
were produced by the Eastman Kodak Laboratory under Doctor
Mees’s direction. One of these is particularly important for our
purpose, and it is the outcome of using it that we shall now hear.
This new dye is called neocyanine. It is produced in the form of
beautiful red crystals which are soluble in alcohol. An ordinary
photographic plate soaked in this solution acquires infra-red sensi-
tivity far beyond that obtainable with other dyes. It has thus be-
come feasible to use instrumental power which is comparable with
that employed in the visible part of the spectrum and sufficient to
bring out a wealth of detail beyond the power of the thermometric
methods.

For this purpose the solar spectrum is formed by an optical
instrument called a concave grating, especially constructed to give
exceptional brightness to the spectrum. A small image of the sun
is formed on the slit of the spectrograph which is covered by a
filter. This stops the visible light and transmits only the invisible
BEYOND THE RED IN THE SPECTRUM—BABCOCK 175

infra-red rays. The plate is exposed to these about 7 hours and
then developed in total darkness. Perhaps you can imagine the
impatience with which the observer waits while the plate fixes sufli-
ciently to permit a glimpse in weak light to see whether he got
anything on it or not.

It turns out that just twice as much of the solar spectrum can
now be studied by photography as in the day of Professor Rowland,
with the result that hundreds of spectral lines produced by atoms
in the sun’s atmosphere are being accurately measured for the first
time. From what has been said about the significance of a line
in the spectrum it will be evident that such new data are valuable
to the physicist as well as to the astronomer. The physicist sees
in the sun’s atmosphere a laboratory in which about two-thirds of
the elements known on earth are trying to tell him the story of their
structure. The astronomer sees new opportunities to examine the
constitution of our nearest star and so to understand what all stars
are like,

Carbon is an element abundant in the earth. We should expect
it to be abundant in the sun also, since the best tests we can make
indicate that the earth is a fair chemical sample of the material
universe. Hitherto the only evidence for the presence of atomic
carbon in the sun has been found in nine faint lines in the visible
part of the spectrum. Although doubtless conclusive, this evidence
is not very impressive when compared to that for other equally
abundant elements. The fact is that throughout the visible and near
ultra-violet region, carbon atoms have no strong lines and only a
few weak ones. When studied in the electric arc, however, the
carbon atom is known to produce a group of very strong lines in the
infra-red. The new solar spectrograms show these same lines; but
since the accuracy here is greater than in the case of the electric
arc, the solar data more completely correspond with the predictions
of the atomic theory than do those of the laboratory.

Perhaps we have talked of too many things in the course of the
hour, and some of them were not interesting to you. But, although
tiresome details may soon be forgotten, some general impressions
may remain. One which I should like to leave with you in closing
is that of the continuity of scientific progress. Some writers who
interpret scientific news in popular magazines and in newspaper
articles emphasize what they call the revolutionary discoveries and
theories of recent years. This no doubt attracts the eye of the
general reader, and at any rate reminds him that science is alive.
But a much truer perspective is had by omitting just one letter in
such headlines and thus bringing out the fact that most important
scientific advances are evolutionary in character, not revolutionary.
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

Illustrations abound on every hand, but the subject of our discussion
here is apropos. The Herschels, father and son, Tyndall, Bunsen,
Kirchoff, Wien, Planck, Bohr, and, preceding these, Newton, form
a succession no one of whom overthrew the work of his predecessors.
Instead, before each one saw a little deeper into the pure spring of
truth, he first established himself on the foundation already laid
for his use. Einstein does not overthrow Newton; he adds to
Newton’s truth.
Listen to Alfred Noyes, writing of Newton:

“Tf I saw farther, ’twas because I stood

On Giant shoulders,” wrote the king of thought,
Too proud of his great line to slight the toils

Of his forebears. He turned to their dim past,
Their fading victories and their fond defeats,
And knelt as at an altar, drawing all

Their strengths into his own; and so went forth
With all their glory shining in his face,

To win new victories for the age to come.

So, where Copernicus had destroyed the dream
We called our world; where Galileo watched
Those ancient firmaments melt, a thin blue smoke
Into a vaster night; where Kepler heard

Only stray fragments, isolated chords

Of that tremendous musie which should bind

All things anew in one, Newton arose

And carried on their fire.

* * * he caught
The sunbeam striking through that bullet-hole
In his closed shutter—a round white spot of light
Upon a small dark screen. He interposed
A prism of glass. He saw the sunbeam break
And spread upon the screen its rainbow band
Of disentangled colours, all in scale
Like notes in music; first the violet ray,
Then indigo, trembling softly into blue,
Then green and yellow, quivering side by side;
Then orange, mellowing richly into red.

Here Newton stopped; and here Herschel began the long-
continued, still progressing, sightless but not unseeing search,
Beyond the Red in the Spectrum.

GROWTH IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN?
By CHARLES BI. St. JoHN

[With 7 plates]

The differences between the two representations of the sun (pl. 1)
show graphically the wide contrast between the appearance of the
sun as observed and imagined in 1635, and as photographed nearly
300 years later as a composite of spectroheliograms of disk and
chromosphere.

The gulf between the past and the present knowledge of the sun
has been bridged in comparatively recent years, almost within the
lifetime of men now living.

Though absorption lines in the solar spectrum were first observed
by Wollaston in 1802 and catalogued to the number of 576 by Fraun-
hofer in 1814, the real beginning of astrophysics dates from Kirch-
off’s great discovery, in 1859, of the true interpretation of the Fraun-
hofer lines. The application of spectroscopic analysis to astronomi-
cal problems opened broad vistas to active and progressive spirits.
Huggins says, “The news of Kirchoff’s discovery was to me like
coming upon a spring of water in a dry and thirsty land.” The first
triumphs of the spectroscope were won by its application to the sun.
It is interesting to note, however, that in the hands of Huggins and
Draper the novel method of research was extended to stars, nebulae,
and comets with great success before further uses were found for it
in solar work. ;

Lockyer and Janssen in 1868 made a great advance through their
independent observations that the blood-red chromosphere and
prominences, hitherto seen only during a total eclipse of the sun, are
gaseous and owe their redness to the emission of the red line of
hydrogen; and by the discovery of helium in the sun a quarter of a.
century before it was traced to an earthly source. A romantic touch
was thus given to the study of the sun.

COMPOSITION OF SUN’S ATMOSPHERE

The identification of solar lines with those of the known terrestrial
elements, begun by Kirchoff, was taken up by Rowland, whose ex-
tensive findings were incorporated in his Preliminary Table of Solar
Spectrum Wave Lengths, published in 1896. For a third of a cen-
tury this has been the world’s standard, and the vade-mecum of
astronomers, chemists, and physicists. In the Revision? recently
completed at Mount Wilson Observatory, the original identifications
have been checked and corrected by the use of all available data con-
jointly with modern astrophysical theory and the results of spectrum
analysis. Nearly all, viz. 35, of the elements recognized or suggested
by Rowland as present in the sun, have survived the critical examina-
tion and retain their place as components of the sun’s atmosphere.
To these, 26 have been added, so that 61 of the 90 known elements
are represented with varying degrees of probability. Of particular
interest and importance among the results of the Revision are the
identification of the nonmetallic elements—carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
and sulphur in the atomic state; the large proportion of the metals
occurring in both the neutral and ionized states; the complete ioniza-
tion of the rare-earth metals; and the importance of the role of
excitation potential.

The identification rests upon reasonable correspondence between
the positions of solar and laboratory lines, so-called coincidence. For
iron this is shown in Plate 2, Figure 1, at A, where it is seen that the
bright arc lines of iron are well represented in the sun’s spectrum.
This is a reproduction of a spectrogram made by simultaneous ex-
posures to the center of the sun and to the luminous vapor between
the two poles of an iron are.

Identifications are furnished also by flash spectra. When the sun’s
disk is covered by the moon at a total eclipse only the glowing gases
of the sun’s atmosphere are exposed to view beyond the moon’s edge.
These then give bright lines which, except in the case of helium, are
the reversals of the dark Fraunhofer lines. This may be seen in
Plate 3, for the strong iron triplet \A4,045, 4,063, 4,071. Normally
helium gives bright lines which appear only in flash and prominence
spectra. The helium line A4,026 is conspicuous in the reproduction.

The symbols of the 90 known chemical elements are given in
Table I.

Those in parentheses are as yet unidentified in the sun’s atmos-
phere. This does not necessarily mean that these unidentified ele-
ments are absent. For some elements the lines of lowest excitation
potential, the resonance lines, are far in the ultra-violet beyond the
accessible regions in both stellar and solar spectra. A layer of
ozone situated some 50 miles above the earth’s surface absorbs the
radiations to the violet of \2,975 A. The strong resonance lines of
the neon and fluorine groups are in this region. The question marks
mean that the evidence is not strong and that exact laboratory wave
lengths are wanting as in the case of osmium and iridium. Even-
tually such elements will be found to be definitely present or absent.

Ninety of the ninety-two possible elements have been found on the
earth. The heavy elements in the bottom line are all radioactive.
180 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

The end results of the radioactive changes are helium and lead which
are being formed continually from their ultimate sources, thorium
and uranium, through the more highly radioactive elements in the
series of transformations. That these do not appear in the sun may
be due in part to their radioactive degeneration, and the ending of
the series of elements with uranium, at No. 92, the heaviest element,
may be due to the disappearance of possibly heavier elements through
their radioactivity, so that we have left the more stable ones which
have proved the fittest to survive.

ASTROPHYSICS

The methods introduced by Huggins and Lockyer of interpreting
astronomical spectra through observations in the physical laboratory
led to the development of astrophysics, as a branch of physical
science. Confirmation of the soundness and fruitfulness of these
methods could be drawn from many sides. An outstanding illustra-
tion is the work of Hale and his co-workers, who have brought us to
the present view of the constitution of sun spots as great vortices
whose centers are magnetic fields which may in the larger spots reach
intensities of 4,000 gausses over areas of many millions of square
miles.

MAGNETIC FIELDS IN SUN SPOTS

Many lines in the spectra of sun spots taken with sufficiently high
dispersion are doubled or tripled, depending upon the strength of
the magnetic field and the angle between the lines of force and the
path of the light. The components of the doublets were found by
Hale to be circularly polarized in opposite directions. In the lab-
oratory similar doubling with circular polarization of the compo-
nents is observed when the light source is placed between the poles
of a powerful magnet and the light emitted by a spectrum line is
viewed in a direction parallel to the lines of the magnetic field.
Viewed in any other direction, the line is a triplet, the middle com-
ponent plane, and the two side components elliptically polarized;
except when normal to the field, when the two side components are
plane polarized at right angles to the plane of the central compo-
nent. The illustration (pl. 4, fig. 1) shows the Fe line, 6,173, photo-
graphed as an absorption line in a sun spot and as an emission
line in the laboratory (the insert). The horizontal bands are due
to quarter-wave mica strips with their optical axes at right angles
to each other in the alternate bands. These change the circular or
elliptical vibration of the side components into plane vibrations at
right angles to each other in the alternate bands. A Nicol prism in
the optical train cuts out the blue and transmits the red (side) com-
rh

ponent in one strip and cuts out the red and transmits the blue
component in the following strip and so on alternately, producing
the staggered effect. In the case shown, the light from the spot was
not viewed exactly parallel to the lines of the magnetic field, hence
there is a weak middle component, while in the laboratory observa-
tion there is no central component, the line of sight in this case being
parallel to the lines of the magnetic field. As the separation of the
components observed in the laboratory for a given line is propor-
tional to the strength of the magnetic field, the intensity of the field
in a spot is deducible from the separation of the components of the
same line in its spectrum. The magnetic fields in sun spots are
attributed to the rapid rotation of electrically charged particles in
deep-seated vortices in which the gases are in cyclonic rotation.
The low temperature, some 2,000° C. below that of the general sur-
face, was first shown by interpreting the differences between the
spectra of the photosphere and the spot umbra in terms of laboratory
observations, and was later deduced from the theory of ionization.

The polarity of the leading spot in a bipolar group in the North-
ern Hemisphere is opposite to that of the leading spot in the South-
ern Hemisphere, during a given 1l-year cycle. The polarities re-
verse at the beginning of each new spot-cycle, the complete magnetic
period being double that between spot minima. The general mag-
netic field of the sun is relatively weak but was detected by methods
similar to those applied to spots, although still more refined measures
were necessary. It has an intensity at low levels in the reversing
layer of 50 gausses. The magnetic axis is 4° from the sun’s axis of
rotation and revolves around it in 31.5 days.

DOPPLER EFFECTS

Lockyer’s use of the Doppler principle to explain the distortions
of bright chromospheric lines was the first introduction of it into
solar investigation, where it has played a preeminent role.

It has been applied to determining the rotation of the sun by
photographing in juxtaposition the spectra of the east and west
edges of the sun. (PI. 2, fig. 2.) The center strip is from the east
limb and the two outer from the west limb. A careful examination
will show that the Fraunhofer lines from the east and west limbs
are mutually displaced. The displacement at the east limb to shorter
wave length indicates that the eastern equatorial edge of the sun is
approaching the observer with a velocity of 2 km/sec. and that
therefore the sun rotates on its axis once in about 25 days.

A solar spectrum shows dark lines due to absorption by oxygen
and water vapor in the earth’s atmosphere. These atmospheric lines

28095—31——_13
182 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

are not displaced and thus may be distinguished from true solar
lines. A spectrum of the impressive B group of atmospheric oxy-
gen is reproduced in Plate 5, Figure 1. These lines coincide in the
spectra of the east and west limbs while the solar lines are mutually
displaced.

In the case of sun spots, it has made it possible to build up a pic-
ture of the motions of the surrounding vapors and to fathom the

sun’s atmosphere. When the spectra of the centerward and the
limbward edges of the penumbra of a sun spot suitably situated
between the center and limb of the sun are photographed in juxta-
position, it was found by Evershed that for lines of moderate
strength the two spectra are displaced, the one from the center edge
toward the violet and the one from the limb edge toward the red
(pl. 5, fig. 2). Interpreted as a Doppler effect, the displacement
KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN—ST. JOHN 183

means an outflow of the gases from the spot tangential to the sun’s
surface. An extensive series of observations at the Mount Wilson
Observatory gave the data for a more complete analysis of the
motions.

The results are graphically given in the accompanying diagram
(fig. 1), which shows a vertical section of the surroundings of a
spot, the axis of the vortex lying in the plane of the paper. Im-
mediately above the shaded umbra, the gases in which the low-level
lines of iron and those of the heavy elements originate are flowing
outward with velocities proportional to the lengths of the heavy
lines. At higher levels the velocity of outflow decreases and be-
comes zero for the strongest and highest-level lines of iron, the
level of velocity-inversion lying at about 1,200 km. Above this
level the motion is inward, the velocity increasing with height. The
field-forming vortex is below the level of the umbra and in it the
gases are rising as in a terrestrial tornado and spreading outward
above the photosphere. The high-level chromosphere layers tend
to settle, owing to the decreased pressure of radiation over the spot
caused by the cooling of the expanding gases, and form a secondary
vortex, in which the flow, as shown by Doppler displacement, is
inward. The magnetic lines of force are indicated in the usual way
as if diverging from the pole of a magnet. As seen from the earth
in the red light of hydrogen the high-lying cyclone appears as in
Plate 4, Figure 2, which pictures a horizontal cross section of it.

ORIGIN OF FRAUNHOFER LINES

Spectrum lines are due to transitions between two energy states of
an atom, the frequency of the emitted or absorbed radiation being
exactly proportional to the difference in energy between the two
states. Every absorption line is associated with the transition from
one energy state to another of higher energy content and can only be
produced when the atom is already excited to the lower energy state
of the transition to which the line is due, measured by the excita-
tion potential expressed in volts. The absorbed energy, hv, corre-
sponding to the line is diffusely scattered or reradiated without change
of wave length. This alone would give completely black lines, but
the effect of collisions of the “second kind” is to supply radiation
to the middle of the line so that none are completely black; this
residual intensity is what makes the spectroheliogram possible.

LEVELS

Lines in the solar spectrum give information of the conditions ob-
taining in the region of their origin.. Like information concerning
the conditions is given by lines originating in the same layer, but
184 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

the behavor of lines from different layers reveals characteristic differ-
ences. This is shown particularly well in studies of solar rotation
and by the currents observed in the gases in the immediate
neighborhood of spots.

When the linear equatorial velocity of rotation given by iron
lines of medium intensity is taken for reference, the velocity given
by Ca+t is 0.2 km/sec. greater, with lower velocities for Ha, Ca 4227,
and high-level iron, corresponding to their separate and lower levels,
the lowest velocity being given by lines originating immediately
above the photosphere. The same arrangement of the levels is given
by the flow near spots, high velocity inward, 1.80 km/sec. for Ca+,
decreasing to zero for high-level Fe, and rising to maximum velocity

CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN

The present view conceives it as a completely gaseous sphere.. For
the sun, built on the Eddington model, in which the radiation pres-
sure is a constant fraction of the total pressure, the temperature at
the center would be of the order of 29,000,000° K. The atoms in
the interior are highly ionized, but are not destroyed or transformed
into other elements, the only changes being the removal, more or
less complete, of the orbital electrons. The mean molecular weight
of the mixture of free electrons and nuclei is taken as 2.11. The
pressure in the deepest interior, 36,000,000,000 atmospheres, is so
KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN—ST. JOHN 185

great that even at the high temperature the density is estimated to
be approximately twenty-eight times that of water, though the mean
density is only 1.4. The radiation pressure bears a very appreciable
ratio to the weight of the superincumbent material.

The photosphere is a relatively thin gaseous shell, through which
radiation from the interior does not pass directly, its optical opacity
being due to its highly ionized state (Stewart). The temperature of
its surface is approximately 6,000° K, and the pressure there a
thousandth of an atmosphere. The total mass of the overlying gases
according to Russell is approximately 10° tons. The mass of the
earth’s atmosphere is three times as great, but on the sun the pressure
(mass X solar gravity) is distributed over an area twelve thousand
times greater. As the sun’s atmosphere is approximately 10? times
as deep, its volume is 12 10° as large, hence its average density is
extremely small, about 210-7".

The reversing layer is a few hundred kilometers in thickness and
contains all the elements found in the sun’s atmosphere. In it the
vast majority of the Fraunhofer lines originate. It is supported be-
low mainly by gas pressure but above increasingly by the pressure of
radiation. The reversing layer merges gradually into the chromo-
sphere, which reaches 12,000—14,000 kilometers in height, and is sup-
ported by radiation pressure. The eclipse spectra of the chromo-
sphere (pl. 3) show conspicuously the emission lines of the lighter
gases, hydrogen and helium, and of ionized elements such as Ca+
and Ti+. The pressure at the top of the Ca+ atmosphere is of the
order of 10* atmosphere (Milne) and at the photosphere 10° atmo-
sphere (St. John and Babcock).

Prominences are luminous vapors, mainly hydrogen and ionized
calcium, that often rise above the chromosphere to great heights,
reaching at times to more than half the solar radius. (PI. 6, fig. 1.)
Formerly these were observed only at times of total eclipse of the
sun, but now are photographed daily with the spectroheliograph.
Their composition is known but there remains much to be explained
as to the forces that originate and support them and control their
movements. Dark masses of hydrogen are often photographed on the
disk of the sun. (PI. 6, fig. 2.) They were long suspected to be
prominences seen in projection on the disk. This relation to promi-
nences became clear through such fortunate observations as shown
in Plate 7, Figure 1, where a dark hydrogen cloud was caught being
carried off the disk by the sun’s rotation and later in Plate 7, Figure
2, when completely off the disk and bright. The motions of both
dark and bright hydrogen flocculi are now visually studied by means
of the spectrohelioscope recently developed by Hale.

The corona gives a continuous spectrum in which absorption lines
show faintly and upon which a bright line spectrum is superposed.
The former is ascribed to reflected or scattered sunlight, the latter to
an unidentified gaseous element considered formerly to be a
hypothetical element, coronium, but now thought to be due to some
known element peculiarly excited. The periodic table of the elements
based upon atomic theory has no place for such a hypothetical gas.
The recent identification by Bowen of the hypothetical nebulium lines
with the “ forbidden ” lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, whose
production is favored by the extremely low density in nebulae, points
to a similar explanation for coronium.

RADIATION AND AGE OF THE SUN

The solar radiation at the mean distance of the earth from the
sun is 1.94 calories per minute per square centimeter. It is subject
to variation over the 11-year spot-cycle, being about 2 per cent above
the mean when spots are most plentiful. Variations with periods
of a few days may reach 8 per cent (Abbot). The total radiation
from the sun is 88 X10* ergs per second. Since pre-Cambrian times
the sun has been radiating at approximately this rate. This implies
a subatomic source of energy within the sun, the transformation of
hydrogen into helium, the annihilation of matter (Jeans), or radio-
active elements of higher atomic weight than uranium. In modern
theory the output of solar energy is equivalent to a loss in mass of
4,200,000 tons per second. Even at this enormous rate it would re-
quire fifteen thousand billion years for the transformation into en-
ergy of a mass equal to that of the sun. The widely accepted value
for the age of the earth derived from the radioactive content of the
oldest rocks is of the order of sixteen hundred million years. On the
assumption that the planets are the offspring of the sun’s early years,
a minimum age of two thousand million years is found for the sun
(Nernst).

Recently Milne has rediscussed the internal structure of stars and
finds that a star tends to generate a kind of “ white dwarf” at its
center surrounded by a gaseous distribution of more familiar type;
the star being like the yolk in an egg. He concludes that in the in-
tensely hot, intensely dense, nucleus, the temperatures and densities
are high enough for the transformation of matter to take place with
ease and that in this nucleus we must look for the origin of stellar
energy.

origin of Fraunhofer lines, an idea originally suggested by Lockyer
and later introduced independently at Mount Wilson. The first
column shows certain typical chemical components at various levels.
188 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1930

In sounding the sun’s atmosphere from the outside, one would, on
passing through the corona, encounter an atmosphere of ionized
calcium; to this would be added at successively lower levels, hydro-
gen, ionized titanium, sodium, normal calcium, and then other ele-
ments in rapid succession until at the photospheric level all constitu-
ents would be present. Helium, probably because of its high exci-
tation potential, does not appear as an absorption line in the solar
spectrum, except over the more actively disturbed areas. It is promi-
nent in eclipse spectra and extends to a height of 8,000 km.

In the second column, the cyclonic whirls in the upper chro-
mosphere are indicated by circles. These secondary high-level
vortices are probably called into existence through the low tem-
perature of the underlying spot umbra, either as a result of the
cooling of the lower chromosphere causing a down rush, or more
directly as the result of a decrease in the radiation pressure by
which the chromosphere is supported. As a rule, the direction of
these high-level whirls corresponds in all sun-spot cycles to the
terrestrial law, counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and
clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. For the underlying vortices
constituting the sun spots, the whirls are below the photosphere and
their directions are unknown. Since the magnetic polarity is
opposite in Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and reverses at
each spot minimum, we may infer that change of polarity corre-
sponds to change in the direction of the whirl in the field-forming
vortex (Hale). The directions of the whirls in the upper and lower
vortices are independent of each other. In the same column the
leneth of the arrows is proportional to velocity of flow, and their
directions correspond to the inward and outward motions at high
and low levels, respectively.

In the third column (disk) displacements of high-level lines to
the red and of low-level lines to the violet relative to lines of medium
level, are similar to displacements that occur in stellar spectra and
appear to be a general characteristic of stellar atmospheres, their
magnitude increasing with the temperature of the star. The dis-
placements for the sun are consistent with its position in the evolu-
tionary sequence. As to the displacements of high-level lines to the
red expressed in their equivalent (Doppler velocity in the third
column of Figure 2), the following considerations offer a probable
interpretation. The increase in width of H and K above 8,000 km
indicates high ionic agitation. After emission, it is probable that
some of these atoms will possess large outward velocities, and hence
the next absorption will be from the violet side of the absorption
line, where the radiation is much stronger than at the center. Con-
secutive emissions and absorptions will therefore endow these atoms
with an increasing outward acceleration, and it is possible that some
KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUN—ST. JOHN 189

will eventually escape from the sun with enormous velocities. The
velocities of descent are hardly likely to exceed the velocities of
thermal agitation. When the Fraunhofer spectrum is observed,
there are therefore more atoms absorbing from the red wing than
from the violet. Hence the absorption line will appear displaced to
‘the red, and this feature should become more prominent with in-
creasing height (Milne, Merfield). The displacements to the violet
at low levels seem explicable by the upward streaming of gases near
the photosphere.

The last three columns show respectively the very low pressure
in the sun’s atmosphere by which the sun again shows its similarity
to the stars, the rotation at different levels, and the heights to which
the different gases rise as derived from the eclipse observations.

RELATIVITY

The question of the gravitational displacement of the Fraunhofer
lines predicted by the general theory of relativity has been a subject
of extended investigation, with the result that when other known
characteristic displacements in stellar atmospheres are taken into
consideration the remaining displacements to the red universally
observed are most satisfactorily interpreted in accordance with that
theory (Evershed, St. John). The interpretation is reinforced by
the observed effect in the “ white dwarf” companion of Sirius by
Adams and Moore.

This brief outline of the progress in our understanding of the
sun illustrates the wide-reaching results in astrophysical investiga-
tions from the union between spectroscopic observations on the sun,
work in the physical laboratory, and deductions from atomic theory,
and perhaps justifies the claim of astrophysics that it deals with
the most interesting questions of physical research.
